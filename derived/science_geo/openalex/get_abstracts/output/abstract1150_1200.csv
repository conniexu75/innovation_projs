https://openalex.org/W1989934357,"Full-length, double-stranded globin DNA was synthesized in vitro starting from rabbit globin mRNA. Several restriction endonuclease cleavage sites with known recognition sequences were mapped on this DNA as a means of assessing the accuracy of in vitro synthesis. By comparing this map with the nucleotide sequences known or predicted from the amino acid sequences of alpha-and beta-chain rabbit hemoglobin, it was possible to show that the synthetic globin DNA is a faithful copy of beta-globin mRNA. Amplification of the synthetic globin DNA was achieved by inserting the molecule into the plasmid PMB9 using the poly(dA)-(dT) joining procedure, and transforming E. coli with the hybrid DNA. Transformants carrying beta-globin DNA were identified by colony hybridization using purified 125I-beta-mRNA probe. Comparison of the restriction maps of the synthetic and inserted globin DNAs showed that the entire synthetic globin DNA molecule was amplified without sequence rearrangements. Both the synthetic and the cloned DNA include the entire coding sequence of the beta-globin gene plus a substantial portion of the untranslated regions flanking the structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W2068775012,"Plasminogen activator production by cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages can be modulated in vitro by low concentrations of various pharmacologically active molecules. Glucocorticoid hormones and their synthetic derivatives, as well as cholera toxin, colchicine, and vinblastine markedly inhibit production of this enzyme without affecting other important macrophage functions. The effect of glucocorticoids is of particular interest, both because their relative in vivo anti-inflammatory potencies correlate exactly with their effect on plasminogen activator production in culture and because this effect occurs at near physiological concentrations. In view of the correlations established in other systems between plasminogen activator production and cell migration, we have also examined the age of the macrophages in thioglycollate-induced exudates. Confirming the results of Van Furth and Cohn, 1968 Van Furth R. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 127: 415-433 Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar , we have found that the majority of these cells are young, having recently replicated and arrived in the peritoneal cavity. Using a fibrinagar overlay technique which allowed us to determine the production of plasminogen activator by individual cells, we have also found that the majority of these cells produce the enzyme. The potential roles of plasminogen activator in monocyte migration and the relationship of this enzyme to the anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids are correlated and emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2066748034,"We have produced a series of somatic cell hybrids by fusing pluripotent PCC4aza1 embryonal carcinoma (""teretocarcinoma"") cells with thymocytes from young adult mice. When these hybrids form tumors in nu/nu or syngeneic mice, all the tumors contain a range of differentiated tissues, as well as embryonal carcinoma-like tissues. Some of the tumors produce alpha-fetoprotein. These results show that pluripotency in embryonal carcinoma cells need not to be abolished by the introduction of a complete diploid genome from a differentiated cell."
https://openalex.org/W1480767322,"The activation of Factor XII occurs via fragmentation of this zymogen into a diverse spectrum of enzymatically potent molecular species. To study the interaction of antithrombin-heparin cofactor and heparin with activated Factor XII, we have employed two forms of this enzyme with widely differing physical characteristics and biologic potencies. Antithrombin-heparin cofactor was found to be a progressive, time-dependent inhibitor of both forms. The addition of heparin dramatically accelerated the rates of these interactions. Furthermore, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of reduced proteins has indicated that antithrombin-heparin cofactor functions by forming an undissociable complex with either species of the enzyme. This complex represents a 1:1 stoichiometric combination of activated Factor XII and inhibitor. In the presence of heparin, both species undergo virtually instantaneous complex formation with antithrombin-heparin cofactor without exhibiting alterations in dissociability or stoichiometry."

https://openalex.org/W1560440045,"When isolated rat epididymal fat cells were incubated with [125I]iodoinsulin for 5 min at 37 degrees, radioactivity accumulated in the plasma membrane fraction (Peak 1) and an unidentified particulate fraction (Peak 2) as reported previously (Kono, T., Robinson, F.W., and Sarver, J.A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7826-7835). This accumulation of radioactivity in Peak 2 (but not that in Peak 1) was greatly impaired when cells were incubated with iodoinsulin in the presence of a variety of metabolic inhibitors that reduce the cellular content of ATP. The reduction in the ATP level coincided with a disappearance of the stimulatory effects of insulin on sugar transport and the hormone-sensitive phosphodiesterase. In contrast, ATP depletion had no significant effects, at least during a 5-to 15-min incubation, on the intracellular water space and on the basal sugar transport and phosphodiesterase activities. When cells once depleted on ATP by treatment with 2,4-dinitrophenol (1 mM; 10 min) were washed and suspended in fresh buffer, the ATP level was recovered almost fully in 10 min. This recovery coincided with the restoration of responsiveness to insulin. When cells were incubated with [125I]iodoinsulin or insulin for 5 min at 15 degrees instead of 37 degrees, a negligible quantity of radioactivity accumulated in Peak 2 and insulin failed to activate sugar transport. In contrast, under the same conditions, radioactivity accumulated in Peak 1 and insulin stimulated phosphodiesterase considerably. These results suggest that ATP, or some other compound metabolically related to ATP, may be necessary for the actions of insulin on sugar transport and phosphodiesterase. ATP, or some other related compound, may also be necessary in the formation of the radioactive Peak 2, although the physiological function and cellular location of this peak are yet to be ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W1566763721,"Induction of hepatic 4-methylumbelliferone UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) by polycyclic aromatic compounds, such as 3-methylcholanthrene or beta-naphthoflavone, occurs in C57BL/6N, A/J, PL/J, C3HeB/FeJ, and BALB/cJ but not in DBA/2N, AU/SsJ, AKR/J, or RF/J inbred strains of mice. This pattern of five responsive and five nonresponsive mouse strains parallels that of the Ah locus, which controls the induction of aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[alpha]pyrene) hydroxylase (EC 1.14.14.2). Induction of the transferase is maximal in C57BL/6N mice with 200 mg of 3-methylcholanthrene/kg body weight; no induction occurs in nonresponsive DBA/2N mice even at a dose of 400 mg/kg. The rise of inducible transferase activity lags 1 or more days behind the rise of inducible hydroxylase activity and peaks 5 days after a single dose of 3-methylcholanthrene. In offspring from the appropriate backcrosses and intercross between C57BL/6N and DBA/2N parent strains, the genetic expression of 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible transferase activity is inherited as an additive (co-dominant) trait. This expression differs distinctly from that of the inducible hydroxylase activity, which is inherited almost exclusively as a single autosomal dominant trait in these same animals. The more potent inducer 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induces the transferase more than 3-fold in C57BL/6N mice and less than 2-fold in DBA/2N mice, whereas the hydroxylase is induced equally (about 8-fold) in both strains. A dose of 3-methylcholanthrene given 3 days after 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, at a time when hydroxylase induction in both strains is very high, does not enhance the rise in inducible transferase activity seen in C57BL/6N or DBA/2N mice which have received 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin alone. These data indicate that (a) the inducibility of two metabolically coordinated membrane-bound enzyme activities may be regulated by a single genetic locus, and (b) although the hydroxylase can be fully induced in the nonresponsive DBA/2N strain by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin prior to 3-methylcholanthrene treatment, metabolites of the 3-methylcholanthrene treatment, metabolites of the 3-methylcholanthrene treatment, metabolites of the 3-methylcholanthrene, presumably present in the liver, are incapable of inducing further the transferase activity. The difference in sensitivity between 3-methylcholanthrene and the more potent inducer 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin for both the hydroxylase and the transferase activities suggests the possibility of a common receptor in regulating both enzyme induction processes."

Monospecific rabbit antiserums to PAPP-A, PAPP-C and hCS all stained the trophoblast cytoplasm equivalently in a continuous layer, usggesting that the same trophoblast cells synthesize all three pregnancy proteins. In contrast, PZP was localized in blood vessel walls, parenchymal structures within the villous, as well as in the trophoblast cytoplasm. Its distribution in the latter was relatively inhomogeneous, tending to be more intense on the basement membrane side."

https://openalex.org/W1544710560,"Abstract Selectively permeable membrane vesicles isolated from Simian virus 40-transformed mouse fibroblasts catalyzed Na+ gradient-coupled active transport of several neutral amino acids dissociated from intracellular metabolism. Na+-stimulated alanine transport activity accompanied plasma membrane material during centrifugation in discontinuous dextran 110 gradients. Carrier-mediated transport into the vesicle was demonstrated. When Na+ was equilibrated across the membrane, countertransport stimulation of L-[3H]alanine uptake occurred in the presence of accumulated unlabeled L-alanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, or L-methionine. Competitive interactions among neutral amino acids, pH profiles, and apparent Km values for Na+ gradient-stimulated transport into vesicles were similar to those previously described for amino acid uptake in Ehrlich ascites cells, which suggests that the transport activity assayed in vesicles is a component of the corresponding cellular uptake process. Both the initial rate and quasi-steady state of uptake were stimulated as a function of a Na+ gradient (external Na+ greater than internal Na+) applied artificially across the membrane and were independent of endogenous (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity. Stimulation by Na+ was decreased when the Na+ gradient was dissipated by monensin, gramicidin D or Na+ preincubation. Na+ decreased the apparent Km for alanine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, and glutamine transport. Na+ gradient-stimulated amino acid transport was electrogenic, stimulated by conditions expected to generate an interior-negative membrane potential, such as the presence of the permeant anions NO3- and SCN-. Na+-stimulated L-alanine transport was also stimulated by an electrogenic potassium diffusion potential (K+ internal greater than K+ external) catalyzed by valinomycin; this stimulation was blocked by nigericin. These observations provide support for a mechanism of active neutral amino acid transport via the A system of the plasma membrane in which both a Na+ gradient and membrane potential contribute to the total driving force."
https://openalex.org/W1505751930,"The interaction between tetanus toxin and ganglioside containing 2 N-acetylneuraminic acid residues linked in sequence to one another has been investigated using a new method involving radioactively labeled ganglioside and tetanus toxin adsorbed to Sephadex matrix. Binding between the two components was demonstrated, and it was calculated that in the nanomolar concentration range, tetanus toxin becomes half-saturated at about 5 X 10(-8) M concentration of ganglioside. Removal of the ceramide portion from the ganglioside resulted in the complete loss of binding activity, whereas removal of the terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid residue from the intact ganglioside had no effect. Among the fragments derived from tetanus toxin (Helting, T. B., and Zwisler, O. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 187-193), only the heavy chain polypeptide exhibited a binding activity of the same order of magnitude as that observed for the native toxin. The light chain polypeptide showed no interaction with ganglioside and among the fragments derived from the toxin by digestion with papain, only Fragment C, at a high protein concentration, displayed marginal binding activity. Using monovalent antibodies directed against specific regions of the tetanus toxin molecule, it was demonstrated that antibodies directed against Fragment C uniquely interfere with the binding process. Anti-light chain serum was ineffective, as well as antitetanus toxoid serum previously absorbed with Fragment C. It is concluded that the binding site for ganglioside is located on the heavy chain portion of tetanus toxin, possibly in or near the region comprised by Fragment C."
https://openalex.org/W1801959869,"1. Photoinduced generation of electric current by bacteriorhodopsin, incorporated into the planar phospholipid membrane, has been directly measured with conventional electrometer techniques. 2. Two methods for bacteriorhodopsin incorporation have been developed: (a) formation of planar membrane from a mixture of decane solution of phospholipids and of the fraction of violet fragments of the Halobacterium halobium membrane (bacteriorhodopsin sheets), and (b) adhesion of bacteriorhodopsin-containing reconstituted spherical membranes (proteoliposomes) to the planar membrane in the presence of Ca2+ or some other cations. In both cases, illumination was found to induce electric current generation directed across the planar membrane, an effect which was measured by macroelectrodes immersed into electrolyte solutions on both sides of the membrane. 3. The maximal values of the transmembrane electric potential were of about 150 mV at a current of about 10(-11) A. The electromotive force measured by means of counterbalancing the photoeffect by an external battery, was found to reach the value of 300 mV. 4. The action spectrum of the photoeffect coincides with the bacteriorhodopsin absorption spectrum (maximum about 570 nm). 5. Both components of the electrochemical potential of H+ ions (electric potential and delta pH) across the planar membrane affect the bacteriorhodopsin photoelectric response in a fashion which could be expected if bacteriorhodopsin were a light-dependent electrogenic proton pump. 6. La3+ ions were shown to inhibit operation of those bacteriorhodopsin which pump out H+ ions from the La3+-containing compartment. 7. The photoeffect, mediated by proteoliposomes associated with thick planar membrane, is decreased by gramicidin A at concentrations which do not influence the planar membrane resistance in the light. On the contrary, a protonophorous uncoupler, trichlorocarbonylcyanidephenylhydrazone, decreases the photoeffect only if it is added at a concentration lowering the light resistance. The dark resistance is shown to be higher than the light one, and decreases to the light level by gramicidin. 8. A simple equivalent electric scheme consistent with the above results has been proposed."

Morphologically, the virus resembles Mason-Pfizer monkey virus but is antigenically distinct from this virus. The virus grows in cells of human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, canine, and mink origin, but not cells of squirrel monkey origin. On the basis of its properties, the newly isolated virus can be classified as a retravirus."

Soil samples were recovered 12 years after treatment at 1 part per million (ppm), and ant bait was recovered 5 years after an aircraft crash. As much as 50 percent of the original mirex was recovered at levels of about 0.5 and 640 ppm, respectively. Kepone was present at levels of 0.02 ppm in soil and 10 ppm in the bait or up to 10 percent of the recovered mirex, as determined by combined techniques of chromatography and mass spectrometry. This constitutes the first observation of the degradation of mirex in nature, and demonstrates a pathway for its eventual disappearance from the environment."

We have isolated such a major cell surface glycoprotein from chick embryo fibroblasts; this protein, CSP, is decreased after transformation. Treatment of a mouse tumor cell line (SV1), L929 cells, and transformed chick fibroblasts with CSP results in a decrease in the number of microvilli and marginal ruffles, accompanied by restoration of a more normal morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2017900911,"Extracts of homogenates of rat, mouse, rabbit, and human submaxillary salivary glands contain a significant quantity of a material with glucagon-like immunoreactivity. Fractionation of this material on columns of Sephadex G-100 reveals a single peak immediately following a gamma globulin marker but in advance of a rat growth hormone marker, crystalline amylase, and isotopically labeled porcine insulin and glucagon. This material, which is urea stable, shows identical immunoassay dilution curves when measured with the highly specific K-30 glucagon antiserum. Study of paired glands in vitro shows that low concentrations of glucose stimulate and high concentrations of glucose suppress release of this material. Arginine promotes brisk release in vitro. Somatostatin does not influence arginine-stimulated secretion and insignificantly suppresses basal release in vitro. These findings lend support to previous speculations that the salivary glands may possess endocrine as well as exocrine functions. Salivary gland glucagon may also be the source of circulating glucagon recently reported in pancreatectomized and eviscerated rats."
https://openalex.org/W1582222346,"Three forms of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase were isolated from highly purified avian sarcoma virus B77 grown in duck embryo fibroblasts, using sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and poly(U)-cellulose. One form, which sedimented with about 5.2 S, contained only one species of polypeptide, with a molecular weight of 63,000; a second sedimented with about 7.8 S and contained only one species of polypeptide with a molecular weight of 81,000; and a third form, which sedimented with about 7.3 S, contained two species of polypeptides with molecular weights of 63,000 and 81,000. The molecular constitution of the three enzyme forms were therefore alpha, beta2, and alphabeta. All three possessed almost the same specific activity with poly(rA)-oligo(dT) as the primer-template. Forms alpha and alphabeta of avian sarcoma virus DNA polymerase have already been described in the literature; form beta2 is a new form. All three forms possessed ribonuclease H activity, the relative specific activities of the alpha, beta2, and alphabeta forms being about 1:4:5. All three enzyme forms were inhibited by antiserum to the alphabeta form, but whereas the alpha and alphabeta forms could be inhibited about 95%, the maximum degree of inhibition of the beta2 form was about 80%. The three enzyme forms also differed with respect to heat stability at 46 degrees, the monomeric alpha form of the enzyme being only about one-half as stable as the two dimeric forms."
https://openalex.org/W1561580790,"The present study was undertaken to study the binding of several thyroid hormones and structurally related compounds to human serum thyroxine-binding alpha-globulin (TBG). The source of TBG was normal human serum diluted 1:100 in 0.035 M barbital buffer, pH 7.4. In the binding assays, 125I-thyroxine, unlabeled thyroxine, and diluted serum were incubated for 20 h at 37 degrees in Plexiglas equilibrium dialysis units. Two orders of binding sites were discerned: a high affinity, low capacity binding site with an affinity constant of approximately 2.5 X 10(9) M-1, and a low affinity, very high capacity binding site with an affinity constant of less than 10(6) M-1. Studies with purified TBG, serum deficient in TBG, and purified human serum albumin indicated that the high affinity site represented binding to TBG and the low affinity site represented binging to albumin. The ability of several groups of thyroid hormone analogues to bind to TBG was then investigated. As a result of these studies, the following structural features of thyroid hormones were found to be important for optimal binding activity: (a) the L-alanine side chain conformation, (b) the presence of a 4'-hydroxyl group, (c) the presence of two substituents in the inner and outer rings (positions 3, 5, 3', and 5'), and (d) the presence of either bromines or iodines in the inner ring and iodines in the outer ring. Of lesser importance was the presence of an oxygen atom in the ether position."
https://openalex.org/W1964133052,"A polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 75,000 daltons, p(75), was identified on the surface of AKR spontaneous leukemia cells by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radio-iodination. This protein was shown by immunoprecipitation to have antigenic determinants of MuLV p30, p15, and p10, but not gp70, suggesting that p(75) represents a polyprotein composed of virion core components. As evidenced by studies on incorporation of radioactive glucosamide, p(75) is probably glycosylated. No p(75) was found on 2 month old AKR thymocytes, and only a small amount of p(75) was detectable of thymocytes from 4 month old animals. However, substantial quantities of p(75) could be found on thymocytes from 6 month old, yet still preleukemic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1591560282,"Rauscher leukemia virus RNA-directed DNA polymerase has been purified to near homogeneity (greater than 90% pure) using affinity chromatography on polycytidylate-agarose with over 85% recovery of input enzymatic activity. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 70,000 and appears to consist of a single polypeptide chain. The enzyme is free of DNase, but has RNase H activity. Analysis of the requirements for optimal rates of DNA synthesis by this enzyme using synthetic and natural template-primers has revealed template-specific variations in such requirements. During these studies it was observed that DNA synthesis catalyzed by Rauscher leukemia virus DNA polymerase is inhibited by the addition of inorganic phosphate. An analysis of the mechanism of phosphate inhibition was carried out using the synthetic template-primer poly(A)-(dT)10. It appears that by some mechanism, possibly involving the substrate binding site of the enzyme, phosphate ions inhibit DNA synthesis with a more acute effect on the rate of chain growth than on that of initiation. The extension of these studies to DNA synthesis catalyzed by a variety of mammalian type C viral reverse transcriptases revealed that low levels ( less than or equal to 2 mM) of inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited DNA synthesis. The susceptibility to phosphate inhibition appears unique to mammalian type C viral enzymes since the type B viral enzyme, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, avian myeloblastosis virus and Mason Pfizer monkey tumor virus reverse transcriptase and cellular DNA polymerases alpha and gamma are not inhibited by inorganic phosphate. This phenomenon of phosphate inhibition of various DNA polymerases, therefore, provides a new basis for the differentiation of the sources and nature of these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2161948605,"The method of centrifugation of chloroplast thylakoids through silicone fluid, previously used to estimate the uptake of solutes by thylakoids, is shown to be an excellent method for measuring binding of nucleotides to thylakoids. This binding, which is probably an exchange (Harris, D. A. and Slater, E. C. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 387, 335-348), is enhanced by light and is sensitive to uncoupling. Half-maximal binding of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) at 10 mjM was reached within less than 0.1 s. With illumination times sufficient to elicit maximal binding, saturation of the site(s) is approached at 20 muM nucleotide and dissociation constants of 5 muM and 7 muM were calculated for ADP and ATP, respectively. At saturation, the binding corresponds to 1 mol/mol of coupling factor 1 or less. Although the light-dependent binding of ADP does not require Mg2+, that of ATP is markedly enhanced by Mg2+. A 10-fold molar excess of guanosine di- or triphosphate or adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate had little effect on the binding. Adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, a competitive inhibitor of phosphorylation with respect to ADP, decreases the binding. Thylakoids, previously illuminated in the absence of added nucleotides, retain the capacity to bind ADP or ATP in the dark long after the H+ electrochemical gradient has decayed. The conformation of coupling factor 1 in darkened thylakoids following illumination in the absence of added nucleotides may thus differ from that in thylakoids either illuminated in the presence of nucleotides or kept in the dark. Approximately 20% of the ADP bound to coupling factor 1 in thylakoids is converted to ATP by a 2-s illumination. Bound inorganic phosphate, derived either from ATP or from inorganic phosphate itself, serves as the phosphoryl donor. Bound ADP may, therefore, be of catalytic significance in the mechanism of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1485901535,"Using purified single-stranded ovalbumin complementary DNA (cDNAov) as a template for avian myeloblastosis (AM) virus reverse transcriptase, we have enzymatically synthesized a complete double-stranded cDNAov sequence. Our data suggests that many single-stranded cDNAov molecules contain short double-stranded sequences (hairpins) at their 3' termini capable of acting as primers for synthesis of complete double-stranded cDNAs. Optimum conditions for synthesis of the double-stranded cDNAov were found to be a high temperature (46 degrees) and a low salt concentration. Nevertheless, in all cases 40% of the initial single-stranded cDNAov molecules fail to prime for synthesis of a complementary double strand. Following synthesis, the second DNA strand is covalently linked to the first cDNAov strand as shown by analysis on alkaline sucrose gradients. The two strands have a high Tm on hydroxylapatite (89 degrees). These intact double-stranded cDNAov structures have a bouyant density in CsCl gradients of 1.700 g/cm3 and rapidly renature after heat denaturation with a C0t1/2 value of less than 2 X 10(-6) mol s liter(-1). All size classes of cDNAs, i.e. partial as well as complete transcripts of the mRNA, are capable of forming double-stranded structures. The closed loop of the double-stranded cDNAov could be opened with S1 nuclease. The denatured complementary strands of the cDNAov then renatured with the appropriate second order kinetics at a C0t1/2 value of 1.89 X 10(-3) mol s liter(-1). Using the enzyme terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase to label to free 3'-terminal end of double-stranded [32P]cDNAov with 3H, we demonstrate a convenient procedure to study the site for restriction endonuclease cleavage within the ovalbumin gene."

https://openalex.org/W1983277072,"Characteristic reverse fluorescent banding patterns (R bands) on human, bovine, and mouse metaphase chromosomes are produced by treating chromosome preparations directly with olivomycin. With the DNA in solution, the repeating polymer poly[d(G-C)] - poly[d((G-C)] (where G is guanine and C is cytosine) enhanced the fluorescence of olivomycin, while the antibotic fluorescence was not affected by the alternating polynucleotide poly]d(A-T)] - poly[d(A-T)] (where A is adenine and T is thymine). Calf thymus DNA, with an intermediate G-C content of about 40 percent, showed a smaller fluorescence enhancement in the presence of olivomycin as was observed for the synthetic polynucleotide poly[d(G-C)] - poly [d(G-C)]. The closely related antibiotic chromomycin A3 showed the same results as were obtained with olivomycin either in the solution interaction with specific DNA's or with the netaphase chromosome preparations. The production of R bands by these G-C-specific DNA binding antibiotics lends credence to the suggestion that the arrangement of the nucleotide sequences along the chromosome is a primary determinant for the appearance of fluorescent bands."
https://openalex.org/W2063729075,"The mode of action of interferon in de novo Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) infection of mouse bone marrow/thymus (TB) cells was studied. Our results indicate that in interferon-treated cells, there is approximately a 2000 fold decrease in the production of infectious MuLV, but only a 10-20 fold decrease in the level of viral specific extracellular reverse transcriptase activity, and only about a 2 fold difference in the number of virus particles observed on the cell membrane as determined by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies showed that the proportion of early budding virions, which have shallow crescent-shaped ribonucleoprotein cores (Figure 3A), to virions in later stages of assembly (Figures 3B-3D) is relatively higher in interferon-treated cells than in the untreated controls. From a temperature shift-down experiment on a temperature-sensitive mutant of MuLV, ts 3, which produces viral particles that fail to dissociate from the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature, we demonstrated that ts 3 virions partially assembled on the cell membrane prior to the addition of interferon are able to complete assembly and to dissociate from the cell membrane on temperature shift-down in the presence of interferon action. Our data suggest that interferon neither inhibits the late stages of virion assembly at which ts 3 virions are arrested at the nonpermissive temperature nor prevents release of the virions. Our findings also indicate that in interferon-treated cells, most of the extracellular virions are noninfectious."
https://openalex.org/W2008808720,"It was previously demonstrated that the 60,000 dalton (p60) precursor-like polyprotein containing murine p30 was a constituent of the feline leukemia virus pseudotype of Moloney sarcoma virus [m1MSV(FeLV)]. It is now shown that p60 is detected in cells of five mammalian species transformed by m1MSV, indicating that p60 is specified by this genome. Moreover, little or no murine p30 is detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, suggesting that the murine group p30 antigenic reactivity of S + L- cells is ude to p60. Pulse-chase studies in cells producing m1MSV(FeLV) show that p60 is the largest polypeptide detectable during the pulse, and that intracellular p60 is not cleaved into smaller (for example, p30) polypeptides during chase periods of up to 10 hr. The lack of cleavage of p60 is in contrast to the properties of p30 precursors detected in cells containing replicating avian or mammalian RNA tumor viruses. The inefficient cleavage of intracellular p60 and the kinetics of appearance of murine p30 in extracellular m1MSV(FeLV) suggest that p60 cleavage to p30 occurs in cells shortly before virus release. While only p60 was detected in the m1MSV-transformed cells, p60 and p70 were detected in m3MSV-transformed cells, and no immunoprecipitable polypeptides were detected in HT-1 MSV-transformed cells. The observed differences in the intracellular polypeptide expression by each of the strains of MSV suggests differences in genetic content."
https://openalex.org/W1507503605,"Two different lines of solid tumors were produced in outbred hamsters by subcutaneous injection of polyoma transformed BHK cells. Growth of the tumors correlated with the appearance in serum of an electrophoretically distinct peak of galactosyltransferase: NeuAc-, Gal-free fetuin acceptor activity on polyacrylamide gels. This slow moving peak of enzyme activity (GT-HH) was detected before solid tumors could be grossly observed and the amount of activity in this peak was also found to be linearly related with growth of the tumor. GT-IIH was not detectable in control animals and separated from a faster migrating major area of serum galactosyltransferase activity (GT-IH) found in sera of both control and tumor-bearing hamsters. These two activities were shown to maintain their respective mobilities on re-electrophoresis. Solubilized enzyme derived from excised tumors demonstrated an electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels identical to that for GT-IIH present in serum from tumor-bearing animals. In contrast, enzyme activity solubilized from livers of both control or tumor-bearing hamsters showed a mobility similar to that of the faster moving serum galactosyltransferase enzyme activity, i.e. GT-IH. In addition, medium derived from nonconfluent BHKpy cells in tissue culture contained galactosyltransferase activity which co-electrophoresed with the slower migrating characteristics of galactosyltransferase activities derived from serum (control and tumor-bearing), solid tumors, liver and BHKpy cells in tissue culture were compared. All kinetic properties were similar with the exception that the Km UDP-galactose of GT-IIH (1.0 X 10(-5) M) was half that of GT-IH (2.0 X 10(-5) M)."

https://openalex.org/W197584215,"Chicken globin mRNA has been purified and partially characterized. Globin-specific sequences are found primarily as 9 S RNA, but also are found with ribosomal RNA, preferentially the 28 S moiety. The chicken globin mRNA preparation has been translated in the wheat germ and Krebs ascites cell-free systems. The products have been identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis as the alpha- and beta-globin polypeptides. The globin mRNA is resolved into two asymmetric peaks by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 98% formamide. The minor rapidly migrating peak consists primarily of alpha message while the major slowly migrating peak contains a mixture of alpha and beta messages. The synthesis of cDNA has been optimized and the products analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 98% formamide. The products consist primarily of full copy transcripts that can be resolved into three discrete species."

https://openalex.org/W2061507256,"Revertants of nonproducer human osteosarcoma (NP/KHOS) cells induced by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus were isolated after incubating at high temperature (40.5 degrees C) overnight and subcloning at 36 degrees C. The morphologic variants, from which murine sarcoma virus could no longer be rescued, had growth properties similar to those of the nontransformed, parent human osteosarcoma cells and did not release RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. These revertants were nontumorigenic in nude mice. The revertants supported leukemia virus growth and showed an enhanced sensitivity to murine sarcoma virus superinfection. Thus, the revertants were from human cells transformed by an oncogenic RNA virus."
https://openalex.org/W1482673411,"The molecular weights of alpha2-macroglobulin and its non-covalent subunits have been determined by equilibrium centrifugation. The secondary structure of the native and the thermally denatured molecules has been analyzed by circular dichroic measurements. In contrast to most proteins the thermally denatured form contains a slightly more highly organized polypeptide chain than the native form. The relaxation time of the native protein, as determined by fluorescence polarization measurements, indicates that alpha2-macroglobulin is composed of domains smaller than that of the two subunits. The transitions in acid, alkali, and at high temperatures have been explored in order to establish the pH and thermal range of stability of alpha-macroglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1545794108,"IT has been demonstrated by means of histoautoradiography that tetanus toxin, after injection into a muscle, reaches motoneurones in the spinal cord by retrograde axonal transport1–3. It was until now not known whether the labelled motor axons and motoneurones belong to the α, the γ, or to both α and γ populations. We now present evidence that tetanus toxin is selectively transported in α motor neurones."
https://openalex.org/W1547274575,"An immunopeptide bearing a3 allotypic determinant(s) was isolated from the gamma chain of an a3 homozygous rabbit (G222-2) immunized with type III pneumococcal vaccine. Immunocogical properties of peptides were studied using a radioimmunoassay that involved inhibition by these peptides of a reaction between 125I-labeled anti-a3 antibody and Sepharose-bound a3 immunoglobulin G (IgG). The gamma chain was isolated from IgG of restricted heterogeneity and then citraconylated and digested with trypsin. The tryptic digest (TD1) was passed through an anti-a3 immunoabsorbent column either directly or after an intermediate step of Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The bound peptides (T1) were eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid and further digested with trypsin. The digest (TD2) was again run on the anti-a3 immunoabsorbent column to purify the bound immunopeptide T2. In the radioimmunossay this immunopeptide was found to have major a3 determinant(s). Its molecular weight was found to be approximately 6,000, which decreased to about 3,000 after reduction and alkylation. These data, together with NH2- and COOH-terminal analyses and cysteine peptide mapping, demonstrated that T2 is composed of two polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, one from the cysteine 22 region having lysine at the COOH terminus and the other from the cysteine 92 region arginine at the COOH terminus. The lysine peptide was separated from the arginine peptide and its NH2-terminal sequence was found to be Gly-Asx-Glx-Ser-Thr-Cys. Since the cysteine is at position 22, the lysine peptide starts at position 17. It has approximately 22 residues. The framework sequence from 17 to 20 is different from those reported so far. In addition, the heavy chain used in these studies has some other unusual features including a histidine, probably in the first hypervariable region. The presence of histidine in the first hypervariable region of rabbit heavy chain has not been reported previously. The other peptide which is about 30 amino acids in length and ends with arginine 94, probably includes positions 67, 70, 71, 84, and 85 that are believed to have substitutions correlating with a allotypes. In a hypothetical three-deminsional model of the Fv portion of rabbit anti-SIII antibody BS-5, residues 17 to 33 of the lysine peptide and 67 to 79 and 84 to 85 which may be present in the arginine peptide are fully exposed on the surface and are far removed from the antibody combining site."

https://openalex.org/W2007648707,"Type C RNA viruses have been isolated from several Old World vertebrates, and an even larger number of Old World species have been shown to contain endogenous viral genetic sequences. The present report describes the first isolation of type C virus endogenous to a species originating in the New World. This virus, isolated from cells of the Columbian black-tailed deer, Odocoileus hemionus, is shown to possess genetic sequences in common with DNA of its species of origin. While it shares biochemical and immunologic characteristics with other mammalian type C viruses, its immunologic properties readily distinguish it from known endogenous viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1607100812,"Two peptic fragments (residues 37-88 and 43-88) of guinea pig myelin basic protein which are capable of inducing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats were cleaved to shorter fragments with alpha-protease (Crotalus atrox proteinase, EC 3.4.24.1) and thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4). The fragments were isolated, purified, and identified by amino acid composition and NH2- and COOH-terminal residues. The time courses of the reactions, monitored by thin layer electrophoresis of the digests, showed that alpha-protease cleaves peptide (43-88) initially at the Pro(71)-Gln(72) bond, and that the product peptides are subsequently attacked at the Arg(63) -Thr(64), Ser(74)-Gln(75), Arg(78)-Ser(79), and Ser(76)-Gln(80) bonds. No significant cleavages occurred at the -Leu, -Val, and -Ala bonds. These results are in striking contrast to those obtained previously by others workers with other peptide substrates, where selective cleavage at hydrophobic residues occurred. Thermolysin was found to attack peptide (37-88) at the Phe(42)-Phe(43) bond very rapidly; the product peptides were subsequently attacked at the His(60)-Ala(61), Ser(38)-Ile(39)-Tyr(67)-Gly(68), and Pro(84)-Val(85) bonds. These cleavages are compatible with the known specificity of this enzyme. Several of the fragments prepared with these two enzymes, peptides (43-71), (61-88), (75-88), and (72-84) have been used in other studies to locate the encephalitogenic site in the parent peptic peptide."
