We show here, however, that it is the special hierarchical structure of the legs, which are covered by large numbers of oriented tiny hairs (microsetae) with fine nanogrooves, that is more important in inducing this water resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2107558798,"A significant fraction of the energy density of the interstellar medium is in the form of high-energy charged particles (cosmic rays)1. The origin of these particles remains uncertain. Although it is generally accepted that the only sources capable of supplying the energy required to accelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic rays are supernova explosions, and even though the mechanism of particle acceleration in expanding supernova remnant (SNR) shocks is thought to be well understood theoretically2,3, unequivocal evidence for the production of high-energy particles in supernova shells has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we report on observations of the SNR RX J1713.7 - 3946 (G347.3 - 0.5), which was discovered by ROSAT4 in the X-ray spectrum and later claimed as a source of high-energy γ-rays5,6 of TeV energies (1 TeV = 1012 eV). We present a TeV γ-ray image of the SNR: the spatially resolved remnant has a shell morphology similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates that very-high-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy spectrum indicates efficient acceleration of charged particles to energies beyond 100 TeV, consistent with current ideas of particle acceleration in young SNR shocks."

https://openalex.org/W2137704498,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), commonly the deletion of residue Phe-508 (ΔF508) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1), which results in a severe reduction in the population of functional channels at the epithelial cell surface. Previous studies employing incomplete NBD1 domains have attributed this to aberrant folding of ΔF508 NBD1. We report structural and biophysical studies on complete human NBD1 domains, which fail to demonstrate significant changes of in vitro stability or folding kinetics in the presence or absence of the ΔF508 mutation. Crystal structures show minimal changes in protein conformation but substantial changes in local surface topography at the site of the mutation, which is located in the region of NBD1 believed to interact with the first membrane spanning domain of CFTR. These results raise the possibility that the primary effect of ΔF508 is a disruption of proper interdomain interactions at this site in CFTR rather than interference with the folding of NBD1. Interestingly, increases in the stability of NBD1 constructs are observed upon introduction of second-site mutations that suppress the trafficking defect caused by the ΔF508 mutation, suggesting that these suppressors might function indirectly by improving the folding efficiency of NBD1 in the context of the full-length protein. The human NBD1 structures also solidify the understanding of CFTR regulation by showing that its two protein segments that can be phosphorylated both adopt multiple conformations that modulate access to the ATPase active site and functional interdomain interfaces.

Cystic fibrosis causes lung, liver, pancreas, and reproductive tract disorders, typically leading to death prior to middle age from deterioration in pulmonary function (1Ratjen F. Doring G.

Although it functions as an ATP-gated anion channel, CFTR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (2Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome.

Understanding the exact molecular pathology caused by the ΔF508 mutation in CFTR is of great importance in the development of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis because of the prevalence of this mutation in the human population. ΔF508 CFTR fails to mature appropriately in the endoplasmic reticulum and is poorly populated in the epithelial membrane (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A.

It has been proposed that the primary effect of the ΔF508 mutation is to cause misfolding of NBD1, which leads to aberrant transport and ultimately targeted proteolytic degradation of CFTR (7Thomas P.J.

Canonical ABC domain structures are composed of three subdomains, a central F1-type ATP-binding core subdomain, an antiparallel β-sheet (ABCβ) subdomain, and an α-helical (ABCα) subdomain. One surface of the latter subdomain contains the stringently conserved LSGGQ signature sequence, whereas the opposite surface is of high sequence variability and is known to mediate contact of the ABC domain to the transmembrane α-helices in the structures of two different prokaryotic ABC transporter membrane proteins (11Chang G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Bass R.B. Locher K.P. Borths E. Poon Y. Strop P. Lee A. Rees D.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Residue Phe-508 in the NBD1 of CFTR occurs near the C terminus of the first helix in the ABCα subdomain in this putative MSD1-interacting region. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of NBD1 from mouse CFTR (mNBD1) (13Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The structure is similar to those previously reported for other ABC transporter NBDs (Fig. 1A and Ref. 14Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) with the primary exception of two segments that undergo regulatory phosphorylation. One of these segments, which we label the regulatory insertion (RI), is an ∼30-residue insert between the first two β-strands in the ABCβ subdomain. The other segment, which we label the regulatory extension (RE), occurs at the C terminus of mNBD1 where it extends ∼20 residues longer than canonical ABC domains. The RI and RE protein segments both have elevated B-factors in crystal structures of mNBD1, suggesting that they might be conformationally dynamic as would be required to allow formation of the heteromeric NBD1/NBD2 ATP-sandwich complex believed to important in CFTR channel gating (13Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E.

We hypothesized that phosphorylation might control channel activation by altering their conformational preferences and thereby modulating steric interference with formation of the NBD1/NBD2 ATP-sandwich complex. Here, we report the production of soluble and monomeric domains of human NBD1 (hNBD1) both without and with the ΔF508 mutation for crystal structure determination and biophysical folding studies. We observe no significant differences in the folding properties of the two versions of hNBD1 but do observe changes in the surface at the putative site of interaction with MSD1. Therefore, our results provide new insights into the molecular pathology of the predominant disease-causing cystic fibrosis mutation, which is of particular relevance to drug discovery efforts. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—hCFTR NBD1 (residues 389-673 and 389-678, both with and without the ΔF508 mutation; see Fig. 1A and Table I) was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal, His6-Smt3 fusion protein (see Ref. 13Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E.

Cells were grown overnight at 20 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed by sonication on ice. Recombinant protein was initially purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography followed by removal of the tag using Ulp1 protease (15Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The sample was then passed through an S200 gel filtration column followed by a second nickel ion affinity column to remove residual His6-Smt3 tag. The protein was concentrated to 5-20 mg/ml in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 10% ethylene glycol, 100 mm arginine, 2-5 mm ATP, 3-7.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm TCEP, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. As reported for mNBD1, the ATPase activity of hNBD1 was indistinguishable from background in the coupled pyruvate kinase/lactase dehydrogenase assay (data not shown).Table IHuman NBD1 proteins Thermodynamic values are listed for those proteins analyzed in equilibrium denaturation experiments. **, proteins for which crystal structures were determined and reported herein.a Mutations in blue indicate human to mouse sequence changes, in green human to fish, and in red the three suppressor mutants.b High yields are >2 mg of purified, Smt3-cleaved protein p/g of fermentation pellet, medium is 0.7–2.0 mg/g, low is 0.1–0.6 mg/g, and none is <0.1 mg/g.c NC means expression construct not cloned. a Mutations in blue indicate human to mouse sequence changes, in green human to fish, and in red the three suppressor mutants. b High yields are >2 mg of purified, Smt3-cleaved protein p/g of fermentation pellet, medium is 0.7–2.0 mg/g, low is 0.1–0.6 mg/g, and none is <0.1 mg/g. c NC means expression construct not cloned. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization leads at 4 °C from hNBD1-2b-F508A at 6-17 mg/ml 4 °C were optimized using microseeding. Well diffracting crystals in space group C2221 (5 molecules/asymmetric unit) were obtained via hanging drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 20% polyethylene glycol 400, 5% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, 200 mm LiCl2, and 50 mm citrate, pH 4.5. hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 was crystallized in an analogous manner in space group P43212 (1 molecule/asymmetric unit) with a precipitant of 35% polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. In both cases, many crystals were screened to find those of robust diffraction properties. Crystals were frozen by brief transfer to a cryoprotectant prior to immersion in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were measured at the SGX-CAT beamline 31-ID at the Advanced Photon Source in cryogenic conditions and processed with Mosflm (16P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The refined model of hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 includes residues 391-402 and 438-675, 1 ATP, and 135 water molecules. (see Table II for refinement statistics.) Equilibrium Denaturations—Experiments were performed as described by Pace et al. (20Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thompson J.A. Creighton T.E. Measuring the Conformational Stability of a Protein. IRL Press, New York1989: 311-330Google Scholar) using 20 mm sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm TCEP as the protein buffer. Proteins were denatured in 7 m urea that contained phosphate buffer. Samples were mixed by inversion and equilibrated at room temperature for 2 h prior to spectroscopic measurements. Circular dichroism measurements at 222 nm for equilibrium denaturation experiments were obtained using an AVIV 215 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C and a 0.1-cm quartz cuvette. Equilibrium denaturation data were analyzed with a mathematical model assuming a 2-state unfolding/refolding mechanism using all of the experimentally determined unfolding data. Nonlinear least-squares fitting was done using Kaleidagraph v.3.52 (Synergy Software, Reading PA). Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence emission for kinetic refolding measurements was monitored using a Cary Eclipse scanning spectrofluorometer with a 1-cm small volume quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the emission wavelength was 324 nm with a 5-nm slit width. All measurements were made at ambient temperature. Refolding Kinetics—Unfolded stocks of protein (4 mg/ml) were made at 20-times the desired final protein concentration in the refolding measurement and allowed to unfold for 2 h at room temperature in 7 m urea. Refolding was initiated by diluting the unfolded stock 20-fold into buffer lacking urea. Refolding as a function of time was followed either by CD at 222 nm or by tryptophan fluorescence as described above. The resulting data were analyzed by a simple single exponential decay using Kaleidagraph v.3.52. Solubility-enhancing Mutations Yield Well Behaved Forms of hNBD1 and the ΔF508 Mutant—Our work on mNBD1 established the boundaries of the first ABC fold within the sequence of CFTR and provided soluble murine protein. However, equivalent domains in hCFTR could not be recovered in soluble form following expression in E. coli despite substantial expression levels. Isolated NBDs from ABC transporters have frequently exhibited low solubility when expressed in the absence of their cognate TM domains. These solubility limitations have been shown, in some cases, to be caused by a tendency of the protein to self-associate and precipitate in the native conformation rather than from instability in protein folding (21Yuan Y.R. Blecker S. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 22Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that engineered hNBD1 proteins with improved solubility could be produced by introducing mutations in surface residues to make them more hydrophilic. Many of the changes that yielded soluble protein were to residues that are naturally present in mNBD1. We also investigated the effect of three suppressor mutations (G550E, R553Q, R555K) that have been observed to improve in vivo trafficking efficiency of STE6-CFTR chimeras containing the ΔF508 mutation expressed in yeast (23Teem J.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35896-35905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic basis has not been characterized, these suppressor mutations could act in improving the folding efficiency, stability, or solubility of NBD1. Table I summarizes the yield of soluble hNBD1 protein obtained from expression constructs containing 1-7 potentially solubilizing mutations chosen based on natural variations in mouse or fish orthologs, either in the presence or absence of the ΔF508 mutation. Recombinant proteins harboring the F508A mutation gave higher yields than the equivalent proteins with phenylalanine at position 508, whereas constructs with the ΔF508 mutation consistently gave lower yields. Although the yield of purified protein from in vivo expression procedures can be influenced either by folding efficiency or solubility in its native conformational state, the data presented below indicate that the ΔF508 mutation produces minimal perturbation of the equilibrium folding properties of hNBD1 in vitro. We conclude, therefore, that the effect of the Phe-508 deletion on the yield of soluble protein is most likely attributable to reductions in protein solubility. This surface mutagenesis strategy, together with improvements in the purification procedure (see “Materials and Methods”), yielded large amounts of stable and soluble, monodisperse hNBD1 protein in buffers containing ATP. Static light-scattering measurements and elution profiles in gel filtration experiments show these proteins to be monomeric and monodisperse (data not shown). Importantly, their availability provides for the first time the opportunity to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of hNBD1 and the effect of the disease-causing ΔF508 mutation on the structure of this domain. Crystal Structure of hNBD1 Shows That Regulatory Protein Segments Adopt Multiple Conformations Altering Access to the Active Site—High-resolution diffraction data were obtained for hNBD1-2b-F508A, containing two solubilizing mutations (F429S and H667R) in addition to the F508A substitution (Table II). These mutations are either surface-exposed in the crystal structure or located in conformationally dynamic regions of the domain. One (F429S) participates in intermolecular packing interactions stabilizing the lattice (data not shown). With the exception of the RI and RE segments, the structure of hNBD1-2b-F508A closely matches that of mNBD1. Least squares superposition of the remainder of the F1-type core and ABCβ subdomains yields a 0.46-Å root mean square deviation (rmsd) for 127 C-α atoms, only slightly exceeding the 0.39-Å rmsd observed after superposition of the different molecules within the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of hNBD1-2b-F508A. The ABCα subdomains are also similar in structure, with an rmsd of 0.71 Å for superposition of 49 C-α atoms, although it exhibits a 10° rotation in hNBD1 relative to the orientation observed in mNBD1. Even so, residue Gln-493 in the Q-loop, which is considered important for hydrolysis of the ATP, maintains hydrogen-bonding contact with the γ-phosphate of ATP. In contrast, dramatic differences are observed when comparing the conformations of the RI and RE in the crystal structures of hNBD1 and mNBD1 (Fig. 1B). Both segments undergo ∼180° reorientations. We concluded that these differences reflect the dynamic flexibility in the regulatory regions and that their exact conformations are determined by the different intermolecular packing in the two crystal structures. Significantly, the conformational change in RI observed in the structure of hNBD1 exposes the conserved aromatic residue Trp-401, and a canonical base-stacking interaction now occurs between its side chain and the adenine base of ATP as observed in almost all other NBD structures but not in that of mNBD1 (26Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Interactions with the phosphate group of the nucleotide are the same in both the hNBD1 and mNBD1 structures. Although the conformation of the regulatory segments observed in the crystal structure of hNBD1-2b-F508A would preclude formation of a canonical ATP-sandwich complex with NBD2 because of a steric overlap at the interface, their dramatic change in conformation compared with the crystal structure of mNBD1 confirms our prediction that these segments of NBD1 are conformationally dynamic. Presumably, additional conformational adjustments can occur to allow formation of an NBD1-NBD2 ATP-sandwich complex with canonical geometry, perhaps in a manner modulated by regulatory phosphorylation at the known protein kinase A sites in these segments. Crystal Structure of ΔF508 hNBD1 Shows Minimal Conformational Changes but Substantive Changes in Surface Topography at the Putative Site of MSD1 Interaction—Crystals diffracting to a resolution of 2.3 Å were obtained for hNBD1-7a-ΔF508, which contains seven mutations (F409L, F429S, F433L, G550E, R553Q, R555K, H667R) in addition to the deletion of Phe-508 (see Table II). It shows only minor differences compared with hNBD1-2b-F508A except in the immediate vicinity of the deletion of Phe-508 (Fig. 2) and at the regulatory segments. Superposition of the F1-type core and ABCβ subdomains with those in hNBD1-2b-F508A gives an rmsd of 0.51 Å for 127 C-α atoms, similar to the deviations observed between the different protomers in that structure. The ABCα subdomain is rotated by 6° relative to its position in hNBD1-2b-F508A but is largely conserved in structure, exhibiting an rmsd of 0.87Å for the superposition of 49 C-α atoms. Furthermore, all of the contacts to bound ATP molecules are the same in the two hNBD1 crystal structures, independent of the presence of the ΔF508 mutation and the other solubilizing mutations. However, the position of α-helix 9b in the RE is very similar in the structures of hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 and mNBD1 (and different from the position observed in the structure of hNBD1-2b-F508A), suggesting that this may represent a preferred conformation of the dynamically flexible RE. The structure of hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 shows that deletion of Phe-508 is accommodated through a simple shortening of the loop connecting α-helices 3 and 4 in the ABCα subdomain (Fig.2, A-C). The superposition of the three available NBD1 crystal structures (mNBD1, hNBD1-2b-F508A, and hNBD1-7a-ΔF508) based on least squares alignment of α-helices 3 and 4 demonstrates that the conformation is extremely similar even in the immediate vicinity of the deletion, consistent with the quantitatively similar folding parameters observed either in the absence or presence of the ΔF508 mutation. However, the surface topography of NBD1 is dramatically altered at the site of the mutation (Fig. 2, compare D with E), which represents the presumed region of binding to the MSD1 of CFTR based on the interdomain interactions previously observed in the crystal structures of two ABC transporter integral membrane proteins (11Chang G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Bass R.B. Locher K.P. Borths E. Poon Y. Strop P. Lee A. Rees D.C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The deletion causes Gly-509 to move into the position occupied by Phe-508, resulting in a >90° rotation of the side chain of Val-510 as it moves into the center of the interhelical loop as well as reorganization of the backbone of residues 509-510 (including reorientation of their carbonyl groups). These changes result in a significant change in both the topography and chemical properties of the surface at this critical interdomain interaction site (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the structure of hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 suggests that interdomain interactions are likely to be substantially altered by the ΔF508 mutation. Of the seven solubilizing mutations present in the ΔF508 form of hNBD1, three (F409L, F429S, F433L) occur in disordered regions and therefore likely interact with solvent, whereas residue H667R is only minimally solvent-exposed on the surface of α-helix 9b in the RE. The three suppressor mutations (G550E, R553Q, R555K) occur either in or immediately following the LSGGQ signature sequence at the N terminus of α-helix 5. There are no backbone conformational differences between the three different NBD1 crystal structures in this immediate region (Fig. 1B), indicating that suppressor mutations do not change the tertiary structure of the domain. Furthermore, the side chains of these residues adopt similar conformations to those adopted by the wild-type residues in the other NBD1 structures (data not shown). Future study will be required to determine how these mutations improve the stability of NBD1 and the yield of native recombinant protein in vivo and whether these phenomena are related. However, the remote location of the suppressor mutations from the ΔF508 site (Fig. 1B) suggest that they do not influence the hNBD1 structure in the vicinity of the ΔF508 mutation. This inference is reinforced by the fact that from our in vitro measurements the ΔF508 mutation is not observed to significantly alter folding properties of the domain either in the absence or presence of the suppressor mutation (Table I). Minimal Perturbation of the Folding Properties of ΔF508 hNBD1—Equilibrium denaturation studies were conducted on several proteins available in sufficient yield. All unfold in urea with midpoints of 4-5 m (Table I). Equivalent folding isotherms were observed using either CD at 222 nm (Fig. 3) or intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission intensity (data not shown). Moreover, equivalent data were obtained from either denaturation or renaturation experiments (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the folding reaction is fully reversible. hNBD1-4-F508 serves as a reference protein in these studies. Fitting of its denaturation profile gives a standard free energy of folding (ΔG0) of about -9 kcal/mol in the absence of denaturant. Although hNBD1-4 variants contain four substitutions relative to the wild-type human sequence, all are naturally occurring variations found in wild-type mNBD1. hNBD1-2f-F508, which contains two different solubilizing mutations, displayed equivalent in vitro folding characteristics including a similar standard free energy of folding. In contrast, hNBD1-7a-F508, with three suppressor mutations added to the four solubilizing mutations of hNBD1-4, shows markedly greater free energy of folding (ΔG0) of about -11 kcal/mol (Table I). Urea denaturation experiments on hNBD1-2f and hNBD1-7a proteins, either in the presence of absence of ΔF508, show that this predominant cystic fibrosis-causing mutation does not cause any apparent change in the in vitro stability of hNBD1 either in the presence or absence of the suppressor mutations (Table I). A small 0.25 m decrease in the midpoint of the urea denaturation isotherms is observed for hNBD1-7a-ΔF508 as compared with hNBD1-7a-F508 but does not reflect a difference in the stability of the domain in the absence of denaturant as revealed in the ΔG0 calculations. A change of this kind is frequently observed when hydrophobic residues are removed from proteins because of a reduction in the compactness of the denatured state (27Shortle D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It is notable that the same enhancement in stability that accompanies introduction of the three suppressor mutations into a Phe-508 protein occurs as well for a ΔF508 protein. Therefore, although the predominant disease-causing ΔF508 mutation does not appear to substantially alter the in vitro stability of NBD1, other mutations affecting the efficiency of CFTR biogenesis appear to do so. Preliminary kinetic data suggest that the refolding kinetics of hNBD1 are also unaffected by the introduction of the ΔF508 mutation. Either in the absence or presence of the mutation, refolding experiments monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity show a fast phase (probably <100 ms) followed by a relatively slow single exponential phase with a half-time on the order of 1.5-2.5 min (Fig. 4, A and B). Preliminary measurements of refolding kinetics using CD spectroscopy show similar results, with 80% of the total CD change in either protein occurring in the dead time of manual mixing experiments and the bulk of the remaining change occurring with a half-time similar to that observed for the slow change in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 4, C and D). Analysis of the products of the fast refolding reaction using analytical gel filtration chromatography shows that with both protein variants ∼30% of the refolded protein is recovered on the column with half migrating at the monomer position and the other half migrating as an aggregate in the void volume (data not shown). Preliminary investigations indicate changes in some folding parameters in the presence of Mg-ATP or upon alteration of buffer constituents, but all protein constructs have shown equivalent behavior either in the presence or absence of the ΔF508 mutation in all assays. Further experimentation will be required to explore the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of potential parallel aggregation pathways and the effects of various ligands on the folding of hNBD1. We report the engineering of biochemically well behaved proteins containing the entirety of NBD1 from human CFTR. Their availability provides the opportunity to conduct structural and biochemical/biophysical studies on the domain containing the predominant disease-causing ΔF508 mutation. The altered topography of the ΔF508 mutant at the putative site of interaction with MSD1 suggests that interdomain interactions are likely to be substantially different in CFTR molecules harboring this ultimately lethal molecular defect. Disrupted interdomain interactions could play a role in altered gating properties that have previously been reported for ΔF508 CFTR channels (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W.

Additionally, they might be involved in the impaired intracellular trafficking observed for ΔF508 CFTR either because of enhanced sensitivity to digestion by endogenous proteases during biogenesis in the ER (9Zhang F. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or because of impaired export from the ER attributable to destabilized quaternary interactions (28Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). This suggests that an ideal small molecule “corrector” of the ΔF508 mutation might serve to reinforce interdomain interactions in CFTR, particularly at the site of the ΔF508 mutation. Our biophysical studies of intact hNBD1 domains are consistent with the structural observations showing, at most, minor differences between proteins containing wild-type Phe-508 and those with the ΔF508 mutation. Although more thorough kinetic studies and a more rigorous characterization of folding yield need to be performed in the future, the structural and thermodynamic observations reported in this paper suggest that the ΔF508 mutation causes no substantive defect in the folding of NBD1. Our characterization, however, of the biophysical properties of the suppressor mutations in NBD1 indicates that they may indeed facilitate in vitro folding of NBD1 to a significant extent. Future work will be required to determine whether this folding effect is responsible for their activity in improving maturation and the transport efficiency of CFTR in vivo. However, cosmotropic small molecule agents that promote more efficient protein folding have been shown to enhance the yield of functional CFTR in the plasma membrane for both wild-type and ΔF508 chloride channels (29Sato S.

On this basis, factors promoting a more efficient folding of CFTR domains in general or NBD1 in particular might have a beneficial effect on the yield of functional ΔF508 CFTR in the plasma membrane even if the mutation does not impair the folding of NBD1.

Pim-1 has been implicated in both cytokine-induced signal transduction and the development of lymphoid malignancies. We have determined the crystal structures of apo Pim-1 kinase and its AMP-PNP (5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate) complex to 2.1-Å resolutions. The structures reveal the following. 1) The kinase adopts a constitutively active conformation, and extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions between the activation loop and the catalytic loop might be the structural basis for maintaining such a conformation. 2) The hinge region has a novel architecture and hydrogen-bonding pattern, which not only expand the ATP pocket but also serve to establish unambiguously the alignment of the Pim-1 hinge region with that of other kinases. 3) The binding mode of AMP-PNP to Pim-1 kinase is unique and does not involve a critical hinge region hydrogen bond interaction.

Overexpression of Pim-1 in mice makes these mice more susceptible to lymphomagenesis, likely due to Pim-1 cooperation with c-Myc (4van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aberrant Pim-1 expression is detected in human cancer patients. Pim-1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression being found in both hematopoietic tissues and testes (5Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Berns A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The expression of Pim-1 is induced by a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and mitogens. Pim-1 is believed to be involved in cell growth control and survival (6Wang Z. Bhattacharya N. Mixter P.F. Wei W. Sedivy J. Magnuson N.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1593: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Pim-1 may enhance cellular survival by protecting cells from apoptosis. Cells deficient for all Pims were defective in response to proliferation signals (7Mikkers H. Nawijn M. Allen J. Brouwers C. Verhoeven E. Jonkers J. Berns A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6104-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). How Pim-1 exerts its influence on cell proliferation remains obscure. Several proteins are reported to be Pim-1 substrates in vitro, e.g. Cdc25A (8Mochizuki T. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Muramatsu T. Asai A. Kuchino Y. J. Biol.

Limited mutagenesis and biochemical data exist that may identify particular Pim-1 residues critical for substrate selection, ATP binding, and kinase activity, except that the K67M mutation results in the loss of Pim-1 kinase activity (11Friedmann M. Nissen M.S. Hoover D.S. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is well established that some kinases can switch on and off through conformational changes in the activation loop (A-loop). 1The abbreviations used are: A-loop, activation loop; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CHK-1, checkpoint kinase 1; C-loop, catalytic loop; G-loop, glycine-rich loop; PhK, phosphorylase kinase.1The abbreviations used are: A-loop, activation loop; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CHK-1, checkpoint kinase 1; C-loop, catalytic loop; G-loop, glycine-rich loop; PhK, phosphorylase kinase. The structural nature of these conformational changes is also well understood for these kinases (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of 1–3 residues in the A-loop leads to salt bridges being formed to basic residues in both the catalytic loop (C-loop) and the N-lobe, thereby resulting in an active kinase (13Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Other kinases are constitutively active, as phosphorylation is not necessary for their kinase activities. These kinases, including CK2 (14Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), phosphorylase kinase (PhK) (15Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and check point kinase-1 (CHK-1) (16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), adopt a unique conformation in which acidic residues in the activation loop form a salt bridge with a conserved arginine residue in the C-loop; both loops are well ordered and do not block the ATP binding pocket, whereas the glycine-rich loop (G-loop) conformation varies. In this paper, such conformation is loosely termed as a constitutively active conformation. ATP traditionally makes two hydrogen bonds to the kinase hinge region using its adenine moiety; its phosphate moiety interacts both with two lysine residues and two bound magnesium ions, which, in turn, coordinate to Asx or Glx side-chain oxygen atoms. The specific binding interactions and the associated residues are highly conserved among kinases, and the presence of two bound magnesium ions also remains invariant (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The two ribose hydroxyl groups also form hydrogen bond interactions in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) (17Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar), but this not always observed in other kinases. To catalyze the transfer of ATP γ-phosphate to substrate, kinases adopt an active conformation in which the ATP pocket is open and the highly conserved residues, both binding to ATP and transferring the ATP γ-phosphate during catalysis, are correctly positioned relative to one another. Whether the Pim-1 kinase must be phosphorylated for activity is not currently known. Ser190 in Xenopus laevis Pim-1 (equivalent to Ser189 in human Pim-1) is reported to be phosphorylated. However, mutating Ser190 has not established unequivocally that this residue is critical for kinase activity (18Palaty C.K. Kalmar G. Tai G. Oh S. Amankawa L. Affolter M. Aebersold R. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10514-10521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The three Pim family members share >80% sequence identity within their own kinase domains but are <30% identical to other known protein kinase (see below). The Pim family kinases also share a unique consensus hinge region sequence of ERPXPX, which, mainly because of the two proline residues, has presented a significant challenge to building reliable homology models for predicting either ATP or inhibitor binding modes with these kinases, especially as most traditional binding modes depend heavily on multiple interactions with the kinase hinge region (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 17Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Therefore, the crystal structure of Pim-1 may still provide significant structural and biological insights, and determining the precise hinge region conformation of at least one Pim kinase, e.g. Pim-1, should greatly benefit a structure-based drug design effort targeting any of the Pim kinases. Herein, the crystal structures of apo Pim-1 and its co-complex with AMP-PNP are reported that reveal the following: 1) a constitutively active kinase conformation and the structural basis for maintaining such a conformation; 2) a novel hinge region architecture and hydrogen bond pattern, which also serves to establish unambiguously the alignment of the Pim-1 hinge region with that of other kinases; and 3) a unique binding mode for AMP-PNP to Pim-1 kinase, especially in regard to the hinge region. Furthermore, the Pim-2 and Pim-3 kinase domains, based on the previously described overall and hinge region sequence identities, should present either the same or at least highly similar molecular, structural, and functional features as those described herein for Pim-1. Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—Details of cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization have been published (36Qian K.C. Studts J.M. Wang L. Barringer K. Kronkaitis A. Peng C. Baptiste A. LaFrance R. Mische S. Farmer B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallization Commun. 2005; 61 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The full-length Pim-1 protein was cloned and fused with a glutathione S-transferase tag. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in a fermenter. The cell lysate was applied to a glutathione S-transferase resin column. The resin was subsequently washed and digested with thrombin “on-resin.” The raw Pim-1 sample eluted after thrombin digestion was loaded directly to a Mono-Q column and eluted with 0–1 m NaCl gradient followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75) with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The Pim-1 protein at this stage was determined to be highly pure by SDS-PAGE and to be monodispersed by the dynamic light-scattering technique. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method with the Pim-1 protein at a concentration of 4.4 mg/ml (A280 = 6.6). The final crystallization buffer contained 30% polyethylene glycol 1500, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl. Data Collection—The statistics of data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I. The AMP-PNP co-complex crystal was prepared by adding ∼1% volume of a 100 mg/ml aqueous AMP-PNP stock solution to the crystallization drop and then soaking overnight. Both the apo Pim-1- and AMP-PNP-soaked crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred into a cryo-nitrogen gas stream for data collection using an RAXIS IV++ detector mounted on an RU-300 x-ray generator (Rigaku/MSC). The diffraction data were processed and scaled using HKL software (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar), revealing a hexagonal P61 or P65 space group. The 2.5-Å data set was collected on a crystal of size 40 × 40 × 400 μm. The 2.1-Å data sets for both apo and the AMP-PNP co-complex were collected on crystals of size ∼100 × 100 × 1000 μm.

The final structure of apo Pim-1 contains residues 35–308 and 42 water molecules. This structure was later used to solve and then refine the Pim-1·AMP-PNP co-complex structure and another apo Pim-1 structure to 2.1-Å resolution. The apo structure from the 2.1Å resolution data set is essentially the same as that from the 2.5-Å data set, except that the higher resolution data do permit clear resolution of the Glu124 and Val126 peptide bond orientation in the hinge region. The apo structure at a 2.1-Å resolution was deposited in Protein Data Bank as entry 1XQZ, and the complex was deposited as 1XR1. Structural Overview—Both the apo Pim-1 and the Pim-1·AMP-PNP co-complex structures have been determined to 2.1-Å resolution, with the AMP-PNP co-complex being obtained by soaking apo crystals. The Pim-1 kinase structure adopts a typical two-lobe kinase fold with a deep, intervening cleft (Fig. 1a), as described for cAPK (17Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). The N-terminal lobe comprises primarily anti-parallel β-sheets, and the C-terminal lobe is composed of α-helices. The two domains are connected through the hinge region (residues 121–126). There is no ionic interaction between the two lobes in the Pim-1 structure, even though an ionic pair, comprising a lysine residue in the N-lobe and an acidic or phosphorylated residue in the C-lobe, is commonly observed for many different kinases and is believed to be critical in maintaining structural stability for kinase activity (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Although Pim-1 adopts a typical kinase fold, its kinase domain structure does contain an extra pair of anti-parallel β-sheets (βH1 and βH2) that connects the β3-strand and the αC helix. This may represent a unique structural feature among kinases. In other kinases, this region usually adopts a helical structure, as observed in cAPK, or is disordered as in other kinases. A twist within the β1-strand in Pim-1 is probably caused by the presence of P42. A pair of small, anti-parallel β-sheets (β7 and β10) resides in the C-terminal lobe between the A-loop and the C-loop. This structural feature is similar to that reported for CHK-1 (16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) but not for other kinases. AMP-PNP binding into the cleft induces conformational changes that are dramatic in the G-loop but insignificant in the phosphate binding and hinge regions. Most residues in the Pim-1 structures are well resolved, except for the N-terminal residues 14–31 and the C-terminal residues 309–313. The G-loop is poorly resolved in the apo structure but somewhat resolved in the AMP-PNP co-complex, consistent with the flexibility in this loop as inferred from other kinase structures. Note that the first 13 residues in Pim-1 are removed by thrombin digestion at an endogenous cleavage site and are therefore not present in the crystallized Pim-1 protein. Pim-1 kinase Adopts a Constitutively Active Conformation— The Pim-1 kinase has been expressed in E. coli purified and found to not be phosphorylated based on results from parent ion mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid-sequencing analysis. However, the same protein sample has been shown to be active in our kinase activity assay. Because all A-loop residues are clearly seen in both Pim-1 crystal structures reported herein, one can state categorically that no A-loop residue in this crystallized Pim-1 is phosphorylated. A detailed analysis of the crystal structures reveals a solid structural basis that Pim-1 remains active even in the absence of A-loop phosphorylation. Sequence alignment suggests that the conserved Pim-1 residues Lys67, Glu89, Lys169, Asn172, and Asp186 would bind ATP or its analogs and that Asp167 would catalyze phosphate transfer. These residues are located within the shaded area in Fig. 1a, which is both the ATP binding pocket and the major portion of the cleft as found in the apo enzyme structure. The ATP pocket in Pim-1 is either open in the apo enzyme structure or bound with AMP-PNP in the co-complex structure. That the two active sites are structurally similar suggests that the Pim-1 kinase active site may be maintained in an active conformation. To further strengthen this hypothesis, residues Lys67, Glu89, Asp167, Lys169, Asn172, and Asp186 in both Pim-1 structures have been superimposed upon the structurally equivalent residues in PhK, which is known to be a constitutively active kinase (15Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 1b shows that the Pim-1 residues critical for both ATP binding and catalysis overlay well with those of PhK, with a backbone atom root mean square deviation of 0.57 Å. In Pim-1, residue Lys67 in the β3-strand forms a salt bridge with Glu89 in the helix αC, equivalent to the Lys48-Glu73 salt bridge in PhK. A salt bridge in this location is known to be critical for kinase activity (13Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The phosphate binding residues Lys67, Asp186, Asn172, and Lys169 all adopt the same relative conformation as that found in PhK. The Pim-1 catalytic residue Asp167 is found to be almost identical in conformation to that of Asp149 in PhK. These comparative results further support the hypothesis that Pim-1 is a constitutively active kinase. Structural Basis for Constitutively Active Conformation— How kinases maintain a constitutively active conformation is not clear from a structural standpoint, even though the structures for at least six constitutively active RD kinases (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) have been determined. A detailed examination of the Pim-1 kinase structure reveals an extensive network of interactions between the A-loop and C-loop that may be critical for maintaining its active conformation. A similar network of interactions is also seen in two other constitutively active kinases, PhK (15Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Papageorgiou A.C. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 467-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and CHK-1 (16Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The active conformation of a monomeric kinase, in the absence of a bound regulatory subunit or domain, depends critically on the conformations of the A- and C-loops (12Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These loop conformations are usually stabilized by a salt bridge between a conserved arginine residue immediately N-terminal to the catalytic aspartate and a phosphorylated residue (S/T/Y) in the A-loop. Formation of this A-loop to C-loop salt bridge both opens up the ATP pocket and helps to stabilize the induced changes in both loop conformations, thereby activating the canonical kinase. The clear electron density shown in Fig. 2a establishes that no A-loop residue in Pim-1 is phosphorylated, and, therefore, the constitutively active Pim-1 conformation is not stabilized through phosphorylation. The conserved Arg166 residue in the Pim-1 C-loop does form a salt bridge with Asp200 in the A-loop. The Pim-1 crystal structures (Fig. 2, a and b) show that the same guanidino amino group of this residue makes a bifurcated interaction with Asp200, forming both a salt bridge with the Asp200 side-chain carboxyl group at a distance of 2.5Å and a hydrogen bond with the Asp200 main-chain carbonyl oxygen. This non-phosphate salt bridge and hydrogen bond in Pim-1 might be functionally equivalent to the one involving a phosphorylated residue. Two additional hydrogen bonds within the A-loop involving residue pairs Leu192-Tyr198 and Lys194-Val197 should help further in stabilizing its active conformation (Fig. 2a). Additional hydrophobic interactions that should stabilize both loops are shown in Fig. 2b. Residues Leu193, Tyr198, and Phe201 in the A-loop are seen to pack into a hydrophobic cluster with residue Leu164 from the C-loop and residues Trp212 (αEF) and Tyr218 (αF). This hydrophobic cluster serves to anchor both loops to the kinase core. Corresponding residues in PhK are also hydrophobic, i.e. Leu174, Leu180, and Leu183 in the A-loop, Leu146 in the C-loop, and Ile194 and Tyr206 in the kinase core. A similar hydrophobic cluster also exists in CHK-1. That this hydrophobic cluster is conserved in at least three constitutively active kinases suggests that it may play a significant role in maintaining this general subgroup of kinases in an active conformation. Determination of Hinge Region Alignment—The ATP adenine usually forms two hydrogen bonds with the kinase hinge region. Maintaining this hydrogen bond motif is an important consideration in aligning a novel kinase hinge region. Although hinge regions can usually be aligned in a straightforward manner, the Pim kinases are somewhat more complicated because of their ERPXPX consensus sequence in the hinge region. Two Pro residues present at least two distinct challenges in building a homology model for Pim-1. First, Pro residues may adopt either a cis- or a trans-peptide bond. The propensity for a cis-peptide bond may be increased when at least two Pro residues are together in sequence and lie in a region of a not well defined secondary structure. The second challenge can be illustrated as follows. A BLAST search indicates that Aurora B (1MUO), PhK, CHK-1 (1IA8), and cAPK (1BKX) are most homologous to Pim-1, with sequence identities in the range of 25–29%. Aligning Pim-1 to these reference proteins (Fig. 3a) has initially identified Leu120 as the gatekeeper residue and Pro123 as the hydrogen bond donor residue to the adenine of ATP. Because a Pro residue cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor, a different alignment has been sought for the Pim-1 hinge region. In this second alignment, Pro123 in Pim-1 is aligned to Pro108 in Aurora-B, making Glu124 the hydrogen bond donor residue to the ATP adenine moiety. However, the gatekeeper residue resulting from this alignment scenario, Glu121, does not match the non-polar profile of other gatekeeper residues. Therefore, both possible sequence alignments for the Pim-1 hinge region produce partially acceptable results with no strong indication as to which, if either, is the correct one. The conformation of the hinge region is well determined (Fig. 3b) in both the apo Pim-1 and the AMP-PNP co-complex structure, and so is that of AMP-PNP (Fig. 4b). The locations of its two chelating magnesium ions are also well determined in the co-complex structure. The co-complex structure clearly shows that the adenine amino group of AMP-PNP makes a hydrogen bond to the Glu121 backbone carbonyl oxygen. This structural registration of AMP-PNP to the Pim-1 hinge region places Leu120 at the gatekeeper position and Pro123 at the position where a hydrogen bond donor residue is generally expected. This positioning of Pro123 is rather surprising, because this position is almost always occupied by a residue, other than proline, that is capable of donating a hydrogen atom to the adenine of ATP. Novel Hinge Region Architecture—The unique hinge region sequence in Pim-1 also gives rise to an equally unique three-dimensional architecture. As discussed above, Pro123 is positioned but yet unable to donate a hydrogen bond to the AMP-PNP adenine moiety, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. The backbone amide groups of both Glu124 and Val126, which point away from the ATP pocket, are >4 Å away from any adenine atom. As a result, there is no suitable residue at all in the Pim-1 hinge region to form this normally critical hydrogen bond. Furthermore, a structural comparison to cAPK and PhK reveals three additional unique aspects to the Pim-1 hinge region architecture. Pro125 exists in a cis-peptide conformation (Fig. 3b), creating a sharp kink within the hinge region (Fig. 3c). The Pim-1 hinge region is also expanded horizontally by ∼4 Å to the left (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the conformation of the Pim-1 hinge region produces an ATP pocket that is both larger than and of"

These two domains have distinct functional properties and display unique lipid and protein compositions. Tight junctions (TJs) act as a fence preventing the lateral diffusion of proteins and lipids between the two domains and as a gate regulating solute flux through the paracellular space (1Tsukita S.

Proteins constituting TJs include the transmembrane proteins mediating cell-cell adhesion and the cytosolic plaque proteins linking TJs to the cytoskeleton and participating in intracellular signaling (2Gonzalez-Mariscal L.

The maintenance of epithelial polarity depends on the continuous sorting of membrane proteins and lipids into distinct cell surface domains. This sorting occurs both in the trans-Golgi network during biosynthetic vesicular transport and, after endocytosis, in endosomes (9Mostov K. Su T. Ter Beest M. Nat.

These polarized vesicular transport pathways must be strictly regulated to ensure the controlled loss and recovery of epithelial polarity during dynamic morphogenetic events. The Rab family small G proteins consist of more than 60 family members in mammalian cells and play a crucial role in determining the specificity of vesicular transport pathways. Each Rab family member that is localized to a distinct compartment in the exocytic or endocytic pathway functions as a molecular switch, cycling between the GTP- and GDP-bound conformations, at the compartment where they reside (11Pfeffer S.R.

Two Rab family members, Rab3B and Rab13, localize to TJs, and it has been proposed that they function as putative regulators of polarized vesicular transport to and/or from TJs in polarized epithelial cells. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that Rab13 regulates the assembly of functional TJs and that the role of Rab13 in polarized vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface is distinct from that of Rab3B (14Weber E.

Adherens junctions (AJs) and TJs are points of adhesion between epithelial cells that ensure the maintenance of appropriate epithelial cell polarity. Cadherins are essential adhesion molecules within AJs supporting not only stable cell-cell contacts but also dynamic morphogenetic events such as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and mesenchymal-epithelial transitions (MET) (18Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). During EMT, E-cadherin, the prototypical epithelial cadherin, is down-regulated by transcriptional silencing and/or protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (19Thiery J.P. Nat.

The endocytosis and recycling of E-cadherin have recently emerged as alternative mechanisms allowing cells to undergo rapid changes in morphology in response to extracellular stimuli (20Kamei T.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4973-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among the transmembrane proteins in TJs, occludin and claudins, a family composed of more than 20 different members, are thought to be responsible for the formation of TJs and epithelial polarization (4Furuse M.

To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic change in epithelial polarity during EMT and/or MET, we examined the intracellular transport of occludin and claudins to and from the cell surface in both fibroblastic BHK and epithelial MTD-1A cells. When occludin was expressed in BHK cells, it was continuously endocytosed and recycled back to the cell surface. Endogenous occludin was also subjected to continuous endocytic recycling in MTD-1A cells. Our results indicate that Rab13, one of the cytosolic plaque proteins in TJs, directs the continuous endocytic recycling of occludin in both fibroblastic and epithelial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—MTD-1A cells were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). BHK, HeLa, MDCK, and Caco2 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). MTD-1A and BHK cells were cultured at 37 °C (5% CO2 and 95% air) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. MTD-1A cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies—Rat anti-occludin (MOC37) and rabbit anti-polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. S. Tsukita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) and Dr. A. L. Hubbard (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Rabbit anti-claudin-1, rabbit anti-occludin, rabbit anti-Rab11, and mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco). Rabbit anti-GFP and mouse anti-GFP were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse anti-HA (12CA5) and rat anti-HA (3F10) were from Roche Applied Science. Mouse anti-Rab4 was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and mouse anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Bovine Rab3B cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Y. Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Rab4, Rab11, Rab13, TfR, claudin-1, and occludin cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from MDCK cells, rat brain, Caco2 cells, HeLa cells, mouse kidney, and mouse liver, respectively. Dominant active and negative mutants of Rab3B (Rab3B Q81L and Rab3B T36N) and Rab13 (Rab13 Q67L and Rab13 T22N) were constructed using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All cDNAs used in this study were cloned into the N-terminal HA-tagged (pCI-neo-HA), the N-terminal EGFP-tagged (pCR259-EGFP), the C-terminal FLAG-tagged (pBS-FLAG), or pCR3.1 expression plasmid and sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer 377 (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant T7 Vaccinia Virus System—Recombinant vaccinia virus-expressing T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3) was described previously (26Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). BHK cells were infected with vTF7-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 30 min and then transfected with either pCR3.1-TfR, pBS-claudin-1-FLAG, or pBS-occludin-FLAG alone or in combination with pCI-neo-HA (mock), pCI-neo-HA-Rab3B T36N, pCI-neo-HA-Rab3B Q81L, pCI-neo-HA-Rab13 T22N, or pCI-neo-HA-Rab13 Q67L. After a 6-h transfection, cells were subjected either to endocytosis or recycling assay. Recombinant Adenovirus Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing EGFP and EGFP-Rab13 Q67L (Ad-EGFP and Ad-EGFP-Rab13 Q67L) were constructed using the Transpose-Ad Adenoviral Vector System (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EGFP and EGFP-Rab13 Q67L cDNAs were cloned into a pCR259 transfer vector. Recombinant adenoviral plasmid was generated by Tn7-mediated transposition in Escherichia coli. The resulting plasmid was linearized by PacI digestion and transfected into QBI-HEK293 cells using an MBS Mammalian Transfection kit (Stratagene). After a 24-h transfection, cells were split into a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 10–14 days. Screening of recombinant adenovirus was done by PCR and immunoblot analysis. Recombinant adenovirus was amplified in QBI-HEK293 cells, and its titer was determined by multiplicity of infection test. MTD-1A cells were infected with Ad-EGFP (mock) or Ad-EGFP-Rab13 Q67L at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After a 36-h culture, cells were subjected either to endocytosis or recycling assay. Endocytosis Assay—Endocytosis assay was performed as described previously (21Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surface proteins were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.33 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM) at 4 °C for 30 min, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 15 min, and incubated at 37 °C or 18 °C for the indicated periods of time to allow endocytosis. The remaining biotin on the cell surface was stripped with 50 mm MESNA in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.6) containing 100 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min and quenched with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 15 min. After lysis with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1.25% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and 10 μg/ml APMSF, an aliquot was taken to determine the total amount of cargo proteins expressed in the cells. Biotinylated cargo proteins were then isolated with UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Plus beads (Pierce). The samples were prepared for immunoblot analysis. The values for biotinylated cargo proteins protected from MESNA treatment were normalized to total cargo proteins expressed in the cells. Immunoblot—Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membrane blocking and antibody dilutions were done in Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan). Blots were developed by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and an ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was performed after scanning of the autoradiograph film of nonsaturating signals by using a NIH Image 1.62 program. Potassium (K+) Depletion—Potassium depletion was performed as described previously (27Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK cells were rinsed sequentially three times with K+-free buffer containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml d-glucose, hypotonically shocked with hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 70 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mg/ml d-glucose, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with K+-free buffer to deplete K+. The endocytosis assay was performed using K+-free buffer instead of PBS/CM. Recycling Assay—Recycling assay was performed as described previously (21Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surface proteins were biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 30 min, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 15 min, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time to allow endocytosis. The remaining biotin on the cell surface was stripped with 50 mm MESNA in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.6) containing 100 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min, and quenched with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells were again incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time to allow recycling of endocytosed cargo proteins back to the cell surface. Then newly appeared cell surface biotin was again stripped with 50 mm MESNA in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.6) containing 100 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min, and quenched with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS/CM at 4 °C for 15 min. After lysis with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1.25% Triton X-100, 0.25% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml APMSF, an aliquot was taken to determine the total amount of cargo proteins expressed in the cells. Biotinylated cargo proteins were then isolated with UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Plus beads (Pierce). The samples were prepared for immunoblot analysis. The values for biotinylated cargo proteins protected from MESNA treatment were normalized to total cargo proteins expressed in the cells. Bafilomycin A1 (BAF) Treatment—BHK cells were preincubated in 1 μm BAF at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated in 1 μm BAF at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time to allow recycling of endocytosed cargo proteins back to the cell surface. The recycling assay was performed as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—MTD-1A cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with either 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (for immunostaining of occludin, occludin-HA, HA-GFP, HA-TfR, occludin-GFP, occludin-Rab4, occludin-Rab11, and occludin-TfR), -20 °C methanol for 5 min on ice (for immunostaining of claudin-1), or 10% trichloroacetic acid in PBS for 15 min on ice (for immunostaining of HA-claudin-1). After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and blocking with 5% goat serum in PBS for 60 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min and with Alexa 488 or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 60 min at room temperature. Fluorescent images of the cells were acquired using a Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Microinjection—MTD-1A cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and grown for 24 h. Either pCI-neo-HA-Rab3B T36N, pCI-neo-HA-Rab3B Q81L, pCI-neo-HA-Rab13 T22N, or pCI-neo-HA-Rab13 Q67L expression plasmid (0.05 mg/ml) was microinjected into the nuclei of the cells. Microinjections were performed using the Inject Man NI2 Micromanipulator and FemtoJet Microinjector Systems (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) mounted on an inverted microscope TE-2000-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Nuclear injections were operated using a Z (depth) limit option, a 0.1-s injection time, and an injection pressure of 70 hectopascals. Cells were grown for an additional 18 h to allow the expression of proteins before fixation. Occludin Is Endocytosed Continuously in Fibroblastic BHK Cells—To begin to understand the molecular basis for the dynamic rearrangement of TJs, we first examined the transport of TJ membrane proteins to and from the cell surface in fibroblastic BHK cells (17Yamamoto Y. Nishimura N. Morimoto S. Kitamura H. Manabe S. Kanayama H. Kagawa S. Sasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the transport of claudin-1, the original member of claudins, to the cell surface was measured easily, the detection of the cell surface transport of occludin was more difficult. If occludin was endocytosed more rapidly than transported, detection of occludin would be difficult. To test this possibility, we examined the endocytic transport of occludin using a well established biochemical assay based on cell surface biotinylation (21Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 26Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As a control, a well characterized endocytosed and recycled protein, TfR, was examined. TfR expressed in BHK cells was not recovered on avidin beads without biotinylation (Fig. 1A). Endocytosed TfR increased in a time-dependent manner up to 15 min and stayed at a constant level until 120 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). When the endocytosis assay was performed at 18 °C, a temperature that causes the accumulation of endocytosed proteins in early/sorting endosomes (28Czekay R.P. Orlando R.A. Woodward L. Lundstrom M. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), endocytosed TfR accumulated progressively and did not reach the maximum level within 120 min (Fig. 1A). When occludin was expressed in BHK cells and subjected to cell surface biotinylation, occludin was efficiently biotinylated and isolated on avidin beads. Importantly, no occludin was detected when biotin was omitted (Fig. 1B). If the endocytosis assay was performed at 37 °C, endocytosed occludin increased linearly up to 15 min and showed a steady level until 120 min (Fig. 1B). In contrast, endocytosed occludin at 18 °C accumulated progressively up to 120 min (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that occludin as well as TfR was indeed endocytosed in BHK cells. Because claudin-1 was not endocytosed significantly when expressed in BHK cells, occludin seemed to be selected for endocytosis (17Yamamoto Y. Nishimura N. Morimoto S. Kitamura H. Manabe S. Kanayama H. Kagawa S. Sasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To characterize further the endocytosis of occludin in BHK cells, we performed the endocytosis assay in K+-free media, a technique that has been shown to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis of low density lipoprotein receptor and other receptors (21Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 27Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 29Moya M. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Louvard D. Boquet P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). K+ depletion blocked the endocytosis of occludin to an extent comparable to that of TfR in BHK cells (Fig. 2, A and D), suggesting a clathrin-dependent endocytosis of occludin. Because the TJ-associated Rab family members, Rab3B and Rab13, are good candidates for regulators of occludin transport, we next assessed their function in the endocytosis of occludin. For this purpose, we generated dominant active mutants (Rab3B Q81L and Rab13 Q67L) that are defective in GTP hydrolysis as well as dominant negative mutants (Rab3B T36N and Rab13 T22N) that have a lower affinity for GTP than GDP. When these mutants were cotransfected with occludin into BHK cells, they were expressed at comparable levels and did not affect the expression level of occludin (Fig. 2B). Occludin was endocytosed in Rab3B T36N-, Rab3B Q81L-, Rab13 T22N-, or Rab13 Q67L-transfected cells as efficiently as in empty vector (mock)-transfected cells (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations indicate that occludin is endocytosed from the cell surface in a Rab3B/Rab13-independent manner in BHK cells. Endocytosed Occludin Is Recycled Continuously Back to the Cell Surface in BHK Cells—The saturable and progressive accumulation of endocytosed occludin at 37 and 18 °C, respectively, indicates recycling of endocytosed occludin back to the cell surface in BHK cells. To examine the recycling of endocytosed occludin, we performed a biochemical recycling assay, in which a decrease of biotinylated cargo molecules represents their recycling back to the cell surface. When endocytosed TfR was allowed to be recycled back to the cell surface, the amount of biotinylated TfR decreased in a time-dependent manner as expected (Fig. 3). Like TfR, endocytosed and biotinylated occludin was diminished up to 5 min (Fig. 3). This clearly demonstrates that endocytosed occludin is indeed recycled back to the cell surface in BHK cells. Rab13 Q67L Mutant Inhibits Recycling of Endocytosed Occludin, but Not TfR, Back to the Cell Surface in BHK Cells—To investigate further the recycling of occludin in BHK cells, the recycling assay was performed in the presence of BAF, a compound that inhibits the recycling of endocytosed proteins back to the cell surface by interfering with endosomal acidification (31Presley J.F. Mayor S. McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13929-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous report, the recycling of TfR in the presence of BAF was inhibited compared with that in control media (21Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). BAF restrained the recycling of occludin to an extent comparable to that of TfR (Fig. 4, A and C), revealing that endocytosed occludin is indeed recycled back to the cell surface in BHK cells. Next, we examined the effect of Rab3B and Rab13 mutants on the recycling of occludin. For this purpose, the recycling of occludin was analyzed in BHK cells cotransfected with occludin and mock, Rab3B T36N, Rab3B Q81L, Rab13 T22N, or Rab13 Q67L. Occludin was recycled in Rab3B T36N- and Rab3B Q81L-transfected cells as efficiently as in mock-transfected cells, indicating that occludin is recycled in a Rab3B-independent manner (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, the recycling of occludin was impaired in Rab13 Q67L-transfected cells but not in Rab13 T22N-transfected cells, compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4, B and C). These results demonstrate that occludin is recycled back to the cell surface via a Rab13-dependent pathway in BHK cells. The question naturally arises as to whether the Rab13-dependent recycling pathway is specific for occludin. To address this question, we examined the endocytosis and recycling of TfR in BHK cells cotransfected with TfR and Rab13 Q67L. TfR was endocytosed in Rab13 Q67L-transfected cells as efficiently as in mock-transfected cells. In contrast to occludin, the recycling of TfR was not affected by the presence of the Rab13 Q67L mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). These results demonstrate that Rab13 directs a specific endocytic recycling pathway for occludin, but not for TfR, in BHK cells.Fig. 4Rab13-dependent recycling of occludin in BHK cells. A, BHK cells expressing TfR or occludin were subjected to BAF treatment and recycling assay as in Fig. 3. After the endocytosis reaction, BAF treatment was performed by preincubating on ice for 30 min and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence of 1 μm BAF to allow the recycling reaction. B, BHK cells coexpressing occludin and mock, Rab3B T36N, Rab3B Q81L, Rab13 T22N, or Rab13 Q67L were subjected to recycling assay as in A. C, the effects of BAF treatment, Rab3B mutants, and Rab13 mutants on recycling of occludin were quantitated. Recycled proteins were expressed as the percentage of endocytosed proteins. The data shown in C are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2K+-dependent endocytosis of occludin in BHK cells.

https://openalex.org/W2143864980,"A relationship between solar activity and aurorae on Earth was postulated long before space probes directly detected plasma propagating outwards from the Sun. Violent solar eruption events trigger interplanetary shocks that compress Earth's magnetosphere, leading to increased energetic particle precipitation into the ionosphere and subsequent auroral storms. Monitoring shocks is now part of the 'Space Weather' forecast programme aimed at predicting solar-activity-related environmental hazards. The outer planets also experience aurorae, and here we report the discovery of a strong transient polar emission on Saturn, tentatively attributed to the passage of an interplanetary shock--and ultimately to a series of solar coronal mass ejection (CME) events. We could trace the shock-triggered events from Earth, where auroral storms were recorded, to Jupiter, where the auroral activity was strongly enhanced, and to Saturn, where it activated the unusual polar source. This establishes that shocks retain their properties and their ability to trigger planetary auroral activity throughout the Solar System. Our results also reveal differences in the planetary auroral responses on the passing shock, especially in their latitudinal and local time dependences."
https://openalex.org/W2040759573,"Processing of the laminin-5 (Ln-5) γ2 chain by membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinases (MT1-MMP) promotes migration and invasion of epithelial and tumor cells. We previously demonstrated that MT1-MMP cleaves the rat γ2 chain at two sites, producing two major C-terminal fragments of 100 (γ2′) and 80 (γ2x) kDa and releasing a 30-kDa fragment containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motifs (domain III (DIII) fragment). The DIII fragment bound the EGF receptor (EGF-R) and stimulated cell scattering and migration. However, it is not yet clear whether human Ln-5 is processed in a similar fashion to rat Ln-5 because one of the two MT1-MMP cleavage sites present in rat γ2 is not found in human γ2. To identify the exact cleavage site for MT1-MMP in human Ln-5, we purified both the whole molecule as well as a monomeric form of human γ2 that is frequently expressed by malignant tumor cells. Like rat Ln-5, both the monomer of γ2, as well as the γ2 derived from intact Ln-5, were cleaved by MT1-MMP in vitro, generating C-terminal γ2′ (100 kDa) and γ2x (85 kDa) fragments and releasing DIII fragments (25 and 27k Da). In addition to the conserved first cleavage site used to generate γ2′, two adjacent cleavage sites (Gly559–Asp560 and Gly579–Ser580) were found that could generate the γ2x and DIII fragments. Two of the three EGF-like motifs present in the rat DIII fragment are present in the 27-kDa human fragment, and like the rat DIII, this fragment can promote breast carcinoma cell migration by engaging the EGF-R. These results suggest that MT1-MMP processing of Ln-5 in human tumors may stimulate the EGF-R, resulting in increased tumor cell scattering and migration that could possibly increase their metastatic potential.

Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Migration and scattering of epithelial and tumor cells are induced by proteolytic processing of the γ2 chain of Ln-5. The γ2 chain is a 140-kDa polypeptide and forms a triple helix with the other subunits at its C-terminal (see Fig. 1A) (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Processing of the γ2 chain occurs at the N terminus generating two major C-terminal fragments of 100 (γ2′) and 80 (γ2x) kDa (see Fig. 1A), and this processing has been observed in different species including humans and rodents (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Because of the limited availability of purified Ln-5, most biochemical studies in this area have been carried out using the rat protein. MT1-MMP and MMP-2 were identified as the proteases responsible for the second cleavage of the N terminus generating the γ2x fragment (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In contrast, only MT1-MMP cleaved the first site to generate the γ2′ fragment (5Koshikawa N. Schenk S. Moeckel G. Sharabi A. Miyazaki K. Gardner H. Zent R. Quaranta V. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 364-366PubMed Google Scholar). The two cleavage sites on the rat γ2 chain were identified as Gly434–Asp435 for γ2′ and Ala586–Leu587 for γ2x (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Processing of the rat γ2 chain at these two sites releases an internal fragment containing three of the four EGF-like motifs in domain III (DIII) (7Schenk S. Quaranta V. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although Ln-5 does not stimulate the EGF receptor (EGF-R), the DIII fragment released has the ability to bind EGF-R and induce its phosphorylation (8Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the processing using MMP inhibitors or inhibition of EGF-R activity using specific kinase inhibitors abolished cell migration on Ln-5 (8Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, the DIII fragment generated by this processing appears to play a major role in the observed biological effect of Ln-5 and MT1-MMP. This system seems to function in vivo as well because MT1-MMP-deficient mice showed significantly reduced processing of the γ2 chain in the kidney, resulting in abnormalities terminal differentiation of the tubular epithelium (5Koshikawa N. Schenk S. Moeckel G. Sharabi A. Miyazaki K. Gardner H. Zent R. Quaranta V. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 364-366PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of the γ2 chain by MT1-MMP appears to play a critical roles in tumor growth and progression because the γ2 chain is frequently expressed as a monomer in malignant tumors that express MT1-MMP (9Koshikawa N.

In addition, aggressive melanoma cells are known to form vascular-like networks (vascular mimicry) requiring expression of MT1-MMP and the γ2 chain (11Seftor R. Seftor E. Koshikawa N. Meltzer P. Gardner L. Bilban M. Stetler-Stevenson W. Quaranta V. Hendrix M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6322-6327PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of these cells with a neutralizing antibody against MT1-MMP or antisense oligonucleotide against the γ2 gene abrogated the mimicry (11Seftor R. Seftor E. Koshikawa N. Meltzer P. Gardner L.

It has also been reported that the γ2′ and γ2x fragments in humans are similar in size to those in the rat (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), suggesting that the processing of the human γ2 chain by MT1-MMP is similar to that of the rat. However, a comparison of rat and human γ2 sequences reveals that although the first site (Gly434–Asp435) is conserved in humans, the second cleavage site of rat γ2 (Ala586–Leu587) is not. Thus, it is not known whether MT1-MMP directly cleaves the second site in addition to the first and generates γ2x and the DIII fragment. Further confusion has been raised by two contradictory reports on this issue. Veitch et al. (12Veitch D.P. Nokelainen P. McGowan K.A. Nguyen T.T. Nguyen N.E. Stephenson R. Pappano W.N. Keene D.R.

Instead of MT1-MMP, they reported that the astacin family of proteases, such as bone morphogenic protein-1 (BMP-1) and mammalian Tolloid-like metalloproteinases, cleave the γ2 chain (12Veitch D.P.

Coraux C. Tournier J.M. Meneguzzi G. Munaut C. Volders L. Rousselle P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that recombinant MT1-MMP induces processing of Ln-5 deposited in the extracellular matrix, although the cleavage sites were not identified, and it was not clear whether a DIII-like fragment was generated as a result of the processing. In this manuscript, we have attempted to settle this controversy by identifying the cleavage sites on the human γ2 chain cut for MT1-MMP. To this end, we purified the γ2 chain either as a monomer or as a heterotrimer (Ln-5) from human cancer cell lines. Incubation of the purified γ2 chain and Ln-5 with a recombinant catalytic fragment of MT1-MMP generated the two C-terminal fragments (γ2′ and γ2x) and released DIII-like fragments functionally. By purifying the γ2x fragment, two adjacent cleavage sites were determined. In addition, the γ2 monomeric chain that is expressed in human malignant tumors show greater sensitivity to MT1-MMP than the heterotrimer form of Ln-5. Cells and Cell Culture—MKN45, a human gastric carcinoma cell line, was provided by the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan). Mum2B, a human melanoma cell line, was a gift from Professor Mary Hendrix, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. STKM-1, a human gastric carcinoma cell line, was obtained from Dr. Shunsuke Yanoma, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Research Institute, Yokohama, Japan. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mg/ml of NaHCO3, and 2 mm glutamate was used as basal medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—The method for SDS-PAGE was described in our previous report (4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The Western blotting was performed as reported (4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned medium was collected from confluent cultures of cancer cells incubated for 2 days in serum-free medium. The serum-free conditioned medium was concentrated about 30-fold with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation as described in our previous report (4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was prepared with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.005% Brij-35. The protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad dye binding kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purification of Human Laminin-5 and Laminin γ2 Monomer—Human Ln-5 and the laminin γ2 monomer (Ln γ2) were purified using anti-human Ln γ2 monoclonal antibody (D4B5)-conjugated immunoaffinity chromatography from serum-free conditioned medium of the STKM-1 and Mum2B cell lines, respectively. The purification procedure and other experimental conditions were reported previously (4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). N-terminal Sequencing—Automated N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 419A protein sequencer (15Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Nagashima Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Ln-5 γ2 and Monomeric Ln γ2 by MT1-MMP in Vitro— Purified Ln-5 (1.5 μg) or Ln γ2 (0.5 μg) was digested with recombinant MT1-MMP at a given concentration for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.005% Brij-35, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm CaCl2, electrophoresed with a 4–20% gradient on SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, and analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody against domain III of Ln γ2 (2778). The methods and conditions are described in previous reports (4Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Transfection of MT1-MMP Expression Vector into Cancer Cells— Transfection with the pSG-MT1-MMP vector (1 μg/5 × 105 cells seeded in each well of 6-well plates) was done with the FuGene™ 6 reagent as recommended. After 2 days of transfection, the conditioned medium and cellular lysate were collected and analyzed by Western blotting for Ln γ2 and its proteolytic fragments. The transfection procedure and experimental conditions were reported elsewhere (16Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Human Recombinant DIII (rDIII) Fragment—Total RNA from STKM-1 (human gastric carcinoma cell line) was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR, and a gene encoding human Ln γ2 chain was obtained. A gene fragment (435 bp) corresponding to the coding region for Asp435–Gly579 was then amplified by PCR, fused with a FLAG coding sequence at the 3′ end, and subcloned into the pCDNA 3.1 (+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the recombinant rDIII protein was expressed as a secreted form. rDIII protein that accumulated in the serum-free conditioned medium was purified by two series of column chromatography, an affinity column conjugated with anti-FLAG mAb (M2) and an anion-exchange HPLC on a QAE-825 column. The purified rDIII fragment was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Transwell Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed using Transwell chambers as described in our previous report (5Koshikawa N. Schenk S. Moeckel G. Sharabi A. Miyazaki K. Gardner H. Zent R. Quaranta V. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 364-366PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the filter undersides were coated with human Ln-5 (500 ng/ml) overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 5% milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, and used for cell migration assays. MDA-MB-231 cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of human rDIII protein (1.3 μm) and were seeded into the upper chamber at 20,000 cells/Transwell chamber. After an 8-h incubation with/without an anti-human EGF-R neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml) (LA-1) (Upstate Group, Inc, Charlottesville, VA), cells on the upper filter were scrapped and washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and then migrating cells on the lower filter were fixed with 100% MeOH and stained with 0.25% crystal violet, 20% MeOH for 15 and 30 min, respectively. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. for cell migration in three wells. Reagents—Monoclonal antibody to human β-actin and polyclonal antibody to human BMP-1 were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecura, CA). Immobilon membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The transmigration chamber was from Corning-Corster (Corning, NY). Transmembrane domain-deleted recombinant MT1-MMP, polyclonal antibody against rat Ln γ2 (2778), and monoclonal antibody to MT1-MMP were produced by our laboratories (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Purification of Human Laminin-5 and Laminin γ2 Monomer—The human cancer cell lines Mum2B and STKM-1 express the γ2 chain as both a monomer and a heterotrimer, Ln-5, respectively. Serum-free conditioned medium of the cells was used to purify both forms of the γ2 chain using an immunoaffinity column conjugated with a monoclonal antibody (D4B5) against the DIII domain of rat γ2. The purified preparation from Mum2B cells contained one major (140 kDa) and two minor (280 and 100 kDa) polypeptides as detected by silver staining in Fig. 1B. Based on previous studies, the 140-kDa protein corresponded to the intact γ2 chain, and the 280-kDa protein is presumably a dimer. The smaller band (100 kDa) corresponded to γ2′ cleaved at the first site, and the very weak band (85 kDa) corresponded to γ2x cleaved at the second site (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, the preparation from STKM-1 cells contained α3 (160-kDa) and β3 (135-kDa) chains in addition to γ2 (140 and 100 kDa). However, most of the γ2 chain was detected as γ2′, and the amount of intact γ2 chain was negligible (Fig. 1B). A very faint band corresponding to γ2x was also detected. Processing of Human Ln γ2 Chain by MT1-MMP—The Ln γ2 chain and γ2′ fragment were also detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against the rat DIII domain (Fig. 2, A and B). A fully processed γ2x fragment was weakly detectable by the antibody, although the amount of DIII fragment was negligible in these preparations (Fig. 2, see MT1-MMP 0 nm). The results presumably indicate that the mAb D4B5 used for the preparation recognizes the C-terminal part of the DIII domain, and this portion is not included in the clipped DIII fragment as illustrated in Fig. 2C. To examine whether MT1-MMP cleaves γ2 and γ2′, purified protein samples were incubated with increasing amounts of a catalytic fragment of human MT1-MMP. The amount of γ2 monomer decreased and that of γ2x and the DIII fragment increased dependent on the concentration of MT1-MMP (Fig. 2A, from 4 to 20 nm). Thus, the human Ln γ2 chain can be cleaved by MT1-MMP like its rat counterpart. The amount of γ2′ did not change significantly presumably because of the balance between production and further processing. The γ2 chain in Ln-5 was also processed into γ2x by MT1-MMP, and the DIII fragment was generated (Fig. 2B). However, it is of note that the processing of the γ2 chain in Ln-5 requires 10 times more MT1-MMP than the processing of the single chain form. Thus, the two forms of the γ2 chain differ in their susceptibility to MT1-MMP. Since the first cleavage site identified for the rat γ2 chain is conserved, along with its flanking sequences, in humans (Fig. 2C), it is most likely that cleavage to generate the γ2′ fragment occurs at this site. Thus, we tried to identify the second cleavage site that generates γ2x. The γ2x fragment was extracted from the polyacrylamide gel and sequenced. Two N-terminal sequences were identified in the γ2x preparation, Asp-Pro-Leu-Ala and Ser-Glu-Pro-Val. Thus, the two cleavage sites were identified as Gly559–Asp560 and Gly579–Ser580 (Fig. 2C). Although the Gly559–Asp560 sequence is not conserved in rats, Gly579–Ser580 is present in its flanking sequences (Fig. 2C), which, although unreported, may be a cleavage site for the rat γ2 chain. The human DIII fragments are calculated to be 152 and 145 amino acids long, respectively, and presumably correspond to the 27- and 25-kDa bands in Fig. 2, A and B. Thus, human γ2 fragments are generated by MT1-MMP as in rodents. Human DIII Fragment Stimulates Carcinoma Cell Migration—We previously described that the rat DIII fragment contained three EGF-like motifs and promoted cell migration by engaging the EGF-R (8Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As the human DIII fragment only contained two of the three motifs (Figs. 1A and 2C), we attempted to confirm whether the human DIII fragment (Asp435–Gly579) retained its activity to stimulate EGF-R. To do this, we expressed a secreted form of the recombinant rDIII protein with a FLAG tag at the C terminus in COS-7 cells. The rDIII fragment was purified from the serum-free conditioned medium using anti-FLAG antibody and subsequently by an anion-exchange HPLC. The final preparation contained a 27-kDa single protein band as detected by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A, left), and the band reacted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 3A, right). The effect of the rDIII on migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was analyzed using a Transwell chamber. Addition of human rDIII (1.3 μm) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in migration on Ln-5 (Fig, 3B) and this effect was completely abolished by a neutralizing antibody against EGF-R, LA-1. Thus, the two EGF-like motifs retained in the human DIII fragment appear to be sufficient to induce EGF-R-dependent cell migration. Cell-mediated Processing of the Human Ln γ2 Chain by MT1-MMP—To examine whether MT1-MMP is responsible for cell-mediated processing of the human γ2 chain, MT1-MMP was transiently expressed into Mum2B cells, and conditioned media was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Untransfected Mum2B cells express MT1-MMP at a low level and constitutively release C-terminal fragments of γ2 as well. Forced expression of MT1-MMP increased the amount of γ2′ and γ2x fragments. To confirm that the γ2 chain of in Ln-5 is processed from the intact Ln-5 molecule by MT1-MMP in a cell-mediated manner, we used human gastric carcinoma MKN45 cells. MKN45 cells produce Ln-5 containing only an intact form of the γ2 chain (Fig. 4B), and they do not express endogenous MT1-MMP at detectable levels as expected from the low levels of γ2 processing. Expression of MT1-MMP in the cells resulted in a significant amount of the γ2′ fragment, although little γ2x was detected at least under these conditions (Fig. 4A). The processing was inhibited by 10 μm MMP inhibitor BB94 (data not shown). Thus, the cell-associated form of MT1-MMP promotes the processing of both forms of the human γ2 chain. To determine whether there was a correlation between the expression levels of processing enzymes and Ln-5 processing, we assessed whether there was a correlation between endogenous MT1-MMP and the amount of cleavage observed. Ln-5 produced by STKM-1 cells and Ln-5 produced by Mum2B cells were both found in the cleaved form, and the Ln-5 in the STKM-1 cells contained only a small amount of intact γ2 chain, whereas most of the γ2 chains were detected as processed forms (Fig. 1B). All three cell lines were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP was detected in Mum2B cells but not in STKM-1 or MKN45 cells (Fig. 4C). As BMP-1 has also been reported as a potential processing enzyme for Ln-5 (13Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we determined whether it was found in the cells. STKM-1 (Fig. 4C) cells were the only line to express this enzyme. Thus, BMP-1 appears to be responsible for the processing by the cells, and MT1-MMP appears to be responsible for that by Mum2B cells. This study was performed due to the debate over the ability of MT1-MMP to cleave the human Ln γ2 chain. We demonstrated that when monomeric or Ln-5 forms of the human γ2 chain were purified and incubated with MT1-MMP, two major C-terminal fragments, γ2′ and γ2x, were formed as reported for rat Ln-5. The first cleavage, which generates γ2′, presumably occurs at the same site as rat γ2 because the cutting site, including flanking sequences, is well conserved between the two species. At the location of the second cleavage sites, which generates the γ2x fragment, we identified two adjacent sites (Gly559–Asp560 and Gly579–Ser580). Since the sites are close together, the two γ2x bands could not be separated clearly by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A and B). This cleavage at the two different sites resulted in the formation of two DIII fragments (25 and 27 kDa) by MT1-MMP. The Ln γ2 chain is frequently expressed in malignant human tumors. Using the human cell line Mum2B, we purified a monomeric form of γ2 and compared the processing of the monomer by MT1-MMP with that of Ln-5. Interestingly, the monomer was 10 times more sensitive to MT1-MMP than the Ln-5 form. Since the γ2 monomer is frequently expressed together with MT1-MMP in malignant tumors, a similar processing of the γ2 chain may be occurring in tumors. This result supports the previous observations that both γ2 and MT1-MMP were required for melanoma cells to show vascular mimicry (11Seftor R. Seftor E. Koshikawa N. Meltzer P. Gardner L. Bilban M. Stetler-Stevenson W. Quaranta V. Hendrix M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6322-6327PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that rat Ln-5 showed greater sensitivity to MT1-MMP than human Ln-5 (data not shown). The relatively resistant nature of human Ln-5 may be why Veitch et al. (12Veitch D.P. Nokelainen P. McGowan K.A. Nguyen T.T. Nguyen N.E. Stephenson R. Pappano W.N. Keene D.R. Spong S.M. Greenspan D.S. Findell P.R. Marinkovich M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15661-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) could not detect its processing by MT1-MMP. It is not clear whether the difference in sensitivity affects the biological outcome mediated by Ln-5 and MT1-MMP in humans significantly. The second cleavage site, which generates the rat γ2x fragment, is not conserved in humans (3Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 6Vailly J. Verrando P. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D. Wagman D.W. Baudoin C. Burgeson R. Bauer E. Ortonne J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and two new cleavage sites were identified for human γ2x. Although one site (Gly559–Asp560) is not conserved in the rat sequence, the other site (Gly579–Ser580) is. Thus, in addition to the rat γ2x site (Ala586–Leu587) reported previously, the conserved second site (Gly558–Ser559) in rat Ln γ2 may also be cleaved by MT1-MMP. Cleavage at the first and second sites in human Ln γ2 generates shorter DIII fragments than in the rat (7 and 27 amino acids, respectively). Although the 27-kDa human DIII fragment retains only two of the three EGF-like motifs present in the in rat DIII fragment (7Schenk S. Quaranta V. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Schenk S. Hintermann E. Bilban M. Koshikawa N. Hojilla C. Khokha R. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), it induced EGF-R-dependent carcinoma cell migration (Fig. 3B). Thus, the human DIII fragment appears to function as an EGF-R ligand. We also examined the expression of MT1-MMP and BMP-1 in three human tumor cell lines that produce γ2 as either an intact or a processed form. Mum2B cells expressed MT1-MMP and produced processed forms of γ2. STKM-1 cells produced Ln-5 containing processed forms of the γ2 fragments and expressed BMP-1, another candidate for a protease that processes human Ln-5 (5Koshikawa N. Schenk S. Moeckel G. Sharabi A. Miyazaki K. Gardner H. Zent R. Quaranta V. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 364-366PubMed Google Scholar, 12Veitch D.P. Nokelainen P. McGowan K.A. Nguyen T.T. Nguyen N.E. Stephenson R. Pappano W.N.

Enforced expression of MT1-MMP in MKN45 cells induced cell-mediated processing of the γ2 chain in Ln-5. Thus, multiple proteases including MT1-MMP and BMP-1 appear to mediate processing of the γ2 chain, and the proteases responsible for the processing may differ depending on cell type and tissue. For example, although the processing of Ln γ2 in kidney and lung is significantly reduced in MT1-MMP-deficient mice (5Koshikawa N. Schenk S. Moeckel G. Sharabi A. Miyazaki K. Gardner H. Zent R. Quaranta V. FASEB J. 2003; 18: 364-366PubMed Google Scholar), such a reduction was not evident in other organs. On the other hand, mice lacking both BMP-1 and mammalian Tolloid-like metalloproteinases show reduced processing of Ln γ2, particularly in skin (12Veitch D.P. Nokelainen P. McGowan K.A. Nguyen T.T. Nguyen N.E. Stephenson R. Pappano W.N. Keene D.R. Spong S.M. Greenspan D.S. Findell P.R. Marinkovich M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15661-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether this occurs in other tissues as well. In conclusion, human Ln γ2 is processed by MT1-MMP and generates DIII fragments containing at least two EGF-like motifs. Moreover, recombinant DIII fragment significantly increases cancer cell migration activity by engaging EGF-R. The monomeric form is 10 times more sensitive to MT1-MMP than the γ2 chain in Ln-5. Thus, MT1-MMP can act as a processing enzyme for both human and rat γ2 and presumably promotes cell migration and invasion through the action of the released DIII fragment (8Schenk S. Hintermann E.

https://openalex.org/W2056542389,"Plant growth and development are sensitive to light. Light-responsive DNA-binding transcription factors have been functionally identified. However, how transcription initiation complex integrates light signals from enhancer-bound transcription factors remains unknown. In this work, we characterized mutations within the Arabidopsis HAF2 gene encoding TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAF1 (or TAFII250). The mutation of HAF2 induced decreases on chlorophyll accumulation, light-induced mRNA levels, and promoter activity. Genetic analysis indicated that HAF2 is involved in the pathways of both red/far-red and blue light signals. Double mutants between haf2-1 and hy5-1, a mutation of a light signaling positive DNA-binding transcription factor gene, had a synergistic effect on photomorphogenic traits and light-activated gene expression under different light wavelengths, suggesting that HAF2 is required for interaction with additional light-responsive DNA-binding transcription factors to fully respond to light induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the mutation of HAF2 reduced acetylation of histone H3 in light-responsive promoters. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that the mutation altered the expression of about 9% of genes in young leaves. These data indicate that TAF1 encoded by the Arabidopsis HAF2 gene functions as a coactivator capable of integrating light signals and acetylating histones to activate light-induced gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2129987262,"Previously, we have shown that the V-ATPase holoenzyme as well as the V1 complex isolated from the midgut of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) exhibits the ability of binding to actin filaments via the V1 subunits B and C (Vitavska, O., Wieczorek, H., and Merzendorfer,H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 18499-18505). Since the recombinant subunit C not only enhances actin binding of the V1 complex but also can bind separately to F-actin, we analyzed the interaction of recombinant subunit C with actin. We demonstrate that it binds not only to F-actin but also to monomeric G-actin. With dissociation constants of approximately 50 nm, the interaction exhibits a high affinity, and no difference could be observed between binding to ATP-G-actin or ADP-G-actin, respectively. Unlike other proteins such as members of the ADF/cofilin family, which also bind to G- as well as to F-actin, subunit C does not destabilize actin filaments. On the contrary, under conditions where the disassembly of F-actin into G-actin usually occurred, subunit C stabilized F-actin. In addition, it increased the initial rate of actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner and was shown to cross-link actin filaments to bundles of varying thickness. Apparently bundling is enabled by the existence of at least two actin-binding sites present in the N- and in the C-terminal halves of subunits C, respectively. Since subunit C has the possibility to dimerize or even to oligomerize, spacing between actin filaments could be variable in size."

At-P4H-2 differed distinctly from At-P4H-1 in its substrate specificity. Recombinant At-P4H-2 hydroxylated poly(l-proline) and extensin and arabinogalactan-like peptides effectively but with much higher Km values than At-P4H-1, suggesting different roles for the two At-P4Hs in the plant cell. Unlike At-P4H-1, At-P4H-2 hydroxylated collagen-like peptides only very inefficiently and did not hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible transcription factor α-like peptides at all. All the peptides efficiently hydroxylated by At-P4H-2 had at least 3 consecutive prolines, suggesting that these may represent a minimum requirement for efficient hydroxylation by this isoenzyme. N-terminal sequencing of an extensin-like peptide SPPPVYKSPPPPVKHYSPPPV indicated that At-P4H-2 preferentially hydroxylated the 3rd proline in the C-terminal PPP triplet. The Km values of At-P4H-2 for the reaction cosubstrates Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate were similar to those of At-P4H-1 with the exception that the Km for iron was about 3-fold lower. Pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate and pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate, well known competitive inhibitors of the vertebrate P4Hs with respect to 2-oxoglutarate, were also competitive inhibitors of At-P4H-2 but with Ki values 5–100-fold higher than those of human type I collagen P4H. It thus seems that there are some distinct differences in the structure of the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site between At-P4H-2 and the animal collagen P4Hs. 4-Hydroxyproline is found in collagens, collagen-like proteins, elastin, and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor in animals and in many hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins in plants. We report here on the cloning and characterization of a second plant P4H (prolyl 4-hydroxylase), At-P4H-2, from Arabidopsis thaliana. It consists of 299 amino acids and shows 33% sequence identity to the first characterized isoenzyme, At-P4H-1.

It thus seems that there are some distinct differences in the structure of the 2-oxoglutarate-binding site between At-P4H-2 and the animal collagen P4Hs. 4-Hydroxyproline is found in animal proteins almost exclusively in collagens, elastin, and more than 20 additional proteins with collagen-like sequences (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kivirikko K.I.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). 4-Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are found ubiquitously in the extracellular matrix of plants and green algae, accounting for as much as 10–20% of the dry weight of their cell walls (for reviews, see Refs. 12Kieliszewski M.J.

HRGPs are implicated in all aspects of plant growth and development, however, from fertilization to apoptosis and responses to stress (12Kieliszewski M.J. Shpak E. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1386-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The HRGP superfamily contains three major groups of proteins: proline-rich glycoproteins, which are highly periodic and lightly arabinosylated repetitive proteins, extensins, which are also periodic, and arabinogalactan proteins, which are the most highly glycosylated and the least periodic (12Kieliszewski M.J.

Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar), but only one plant P4H has been cloned and characterized in detail, an Arabidopsis thaliana P4H termed At-P4H-1 (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme is a 29-kDa monomer that efficiently hydroxylates poly(l-proline) and many synthetic peptides corresponding to proline-rich repeats in plant glycoproteins and other proteins (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it also effectively hydroxylated collagen-like and HIFα-like peptides (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A monomeric P4H has also been cloned from the Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) and has likewise been found to hydroxylate poly(l-proline), other proline-rich peptides, and collagen-like peptides (16Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All P4Hs require Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate, and their reaction involves stoichiometric decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate (1Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The Fe2+ atom is bound to the catalytic site by 2 histidines and 1 aspartate, whereas the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate is bound to a lysine located in position +10 with respect to the 2nd iron-binding histidine (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The C-P4Hs have a peptide substrate-binding domain that is distinct from the C-terminal catalytic domain (18Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpelainen I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34966-34974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but it is currently unknown whether the other P4Hs also have a separate peptide substrate-binding domain or whether their substrates become bound directly to the catalytic domain. We report here on the cloning and characterization of a second A. thaliana P4H isoenzyme, At-P4H-2. This is a 33-kDa monomer that differs distinctly from At-P4H-1 in its substrate specificity. It was found to hydroxylate poly(l-proline) and extensin and arabinogalactan-like peptides but with much higher Km values than At-P4H-1, suggesting a different role in the plant cell. Unlike At-P4H-1, it hydroxylated collagen-like peptides only very inefficiently and did not hydroxylate HIFα-like peptides at all. We also determined the Km values of At-P4H-2 for the reaction cosubstrates and Ki values for two 2-oxoglutarate analogue inhibitors. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant A. thaliana P4H-2 in Insect Cells—PCR primers 5′-GCGGCGGCCGCCGATTGCTATAATGTCGATGTCTCGGCTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCTAGAGAGGAGTTTAAAGTCTTTAACAAGCTTTACAGC-3′ were synthesized based on the sequence of the gene encoding the polypeptide NP566279.1 (GenBank™, named here At-P4H-2) and used to obtain a 947-bp PCR product coding for full-length At-P4H-2 cDNA from an A. thaliana Uni-ZAP XR cDNA Library (Stratagene). The PCR product obtained had added NotI and XbaI restriction sites at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (underlined in the primer sequences), and it was cloned into a NotI-XbaI-digested baculovirus vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen). The sequence was verified on an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The recombinant vector was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection, and the recombinant virus was amplified (20Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Instruction Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of Sf9 cells in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or High Five cells in SF-900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) were infected with a recombinant virus coding for At-P4H-2 or human ERp57 (21Silvennoinen L. Myllyharju J. Ruoppolo M. Orrú S. Caterino M. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol.

The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The insoluble pellet was further solubilized in two consecutive steps, first in the same buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and then in a 50% glycerol, 0.6 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8. The remaining pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and aliquots of all fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The presence of At-P4H-2 in the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction was verified by N-terminal sequencing. Triton X-100 and SDS-soluble samples were transferred from SDS-PAGE to a ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems) by electroblotting and stained with Coomassie Blue. The At-P4H-2 polypeptide visible in the SDS-soluble sample and a slice of the corresponding position of the Triton X-100-soluble sample were excised from the blot and analyzed in a ProciseTM 492 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). P4H Activity Assay—P4H activity was analyzed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (22Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a final volume of 0.5 ml, which contained 10–50 μl of the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fractions of the insect cells expressing recombinant At-P4H-2 or ERp57, which was used as a negative control, as sources of the enzyme, differing amounts of various peptide substrates (Sigma, Innovagen), 0.025 μmol of FeSO4, 0.15 μmol of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (150 000 dpm), 1 μmol of ascorbate, 30 μg of catalase (Sigma), 0.05 μmol of dithiothreitol, 1 mg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 25 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7.8 at 25 °C. The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The amounts of total cellular protein in the Triton X-100 extracts were assayed by Roti-Quant (Roth) and adjusted to be equal in the activity assay reactions. The Km and Ki values of At-P4H-2 were determined as described previously (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) with poly(l-proline) as a substrate. The amount of 4-hydroxyproline formed in a poly(l-proline) substrate was determined by a colorimetric method in samples hydrolyzed with 6 m HCl at 120 °C overnight (23Kivirikko K.I. Laitinen O. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Other Assays—The hydroxylation site specificity of At-P4H-2 in the peptide SPPPVYKSPPPPVKHYSPPPV was studied by performing the enzyme incubation in the presence of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) for 7 h and purifying the partially 4-hydroxylated peptide from the reaction mixture by reverse phase HPLC. The molecular mass of the hydroxylated peptide was analyzed by a Voyager DE-STR matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (Applied Biosystems), and its N-terminal sequencing was performed. Cloning of At-P4H-2 and Comparison of Its Amino Acid Sequence with Those of Other P4Hs—A sequence homology search of the A. thaliana genome indicated that it encodes at least six polypeptides of 280–332 residues that show 21–27% identity to the catalytically important C-terminal regions of the α subunits of the human type I and type II C-P4Hs (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One of these, a 283-residue polypeptide with a GenBank™ accession number AAC64297, was cloned and characterized recently and named At-P4H-1 (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), being the first plant P4H to be cloned from any source. We have now cloned a second 299-amino-acid A. thaliana P4H based on the GenBank™ sequence NP566279.1 and have named it At-P4H-2, its gene being located in chromosome 3. This polypeptide corresponds to AAF08583 as identified in the first sequence homology search (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the first 178 amino acids encoded by NP566279.1 being identical to those of AAF08583, whereas the subsequent AAF08583 sequence has a deletion corresponding to 21 amino acids. A third GenBank sequence, AAM67123.1, is identical to NP566279.1 except that it lacks the first two amino acids of the encoded polypeptide. We used PCR to amplify a 947-nucleotide product from an A. thaliana cDNA library encoding 11 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated sequence, the entire coding region, and 16 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated sequence. This cDNA encodes a 299-amino-acid polypeptide identical to NP566279.1. The calculated molecular mass of At-P4H-2 is 33,019 Da, its isoelectric point is 5.93, and the polypeptide contains three potential N-glycosylation sites. The 3 amino acids, 2 histidines, and 1 aspartate that bind the iron atom and the lysine that binds the C-5 carboxyl group of the 2-oxoglutarate (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) are conserved in its sequence (Fig. 1). At-P4H-2 shows a 33% amino acid sequence identity to At-P4H-1 (Fig. 1), the identity of the C-terminal catalytic regions being distinctly higher. The identity of the 126-amino-acid stretches starting at residue 118 of At-P4H-2 and at residue 159 of At-P4H-1 is 51%, for example (Fig. 1). A characteristic feature of the At-P4H-2 polypeptide is a 49-amino-acid C-terminal extension with 6 cysteines that is not found in At-P4H-1 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a closer homologue of At-P4H-2 is a 310-amino-acid polypeptide found in rice (AAO72377.1), which is 53% identical to At-P4H-2. These two polypeptides also share the C-terminal cysteine-rich extension (Fig. 1). The P. bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) P4H (16Eriksson M. Myllyharju J. Tu H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) shows a 25% overall sequence identity to At-P4H-2, the C-terminal catalytic regions being more alike, the identity of a 126-amino-acid stretch starting at residue 118 of At-P4H-2 to that starting at residue 131 of the PBCV-1 P4H being 34% (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a 24-aminoacid stretch in the N-terminal region of At-P4H-2, starting at residue 52, is 67 and 54% identical to the corresponding regions in the rice and PBCV-1 P4Hs, whereas its identity to the corresponding region in At-P4H-1 is only 42% (Fig. 1). The sequence identity between At-P4H-2 and the 517-residue α subunit of the human type I C-P4H is 23% (data not shown), being thus very similar to the identity of 25% between At-P4H-1 and this α subunit (15Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression of Recombinant At-P4H-2 in Insect Cells—A baculovirus expressing At-P4H-2 was generated and used to infect Sf9 and H5 insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The pellet obtained was further solubilized consecutively in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and in a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 0.6 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% SDS. Analysis of the glycerol and SDS extracts by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions indicated that both insect cell types expressed the recombinant At-P4H-2 as a polypeptide of about 35 kDa, as shown for Sf9 cells in Fig. 2 (lanes 3 and 4), whereas its solubility in the two Triton X-100-containing buffers was poor (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The 0.1% Triton X-100 and SDS-soluble samples were electroblotted, and the membrane was stained by Coomassie Blue. N-terminal sequencing of the band representing the SDS-soluble At-P4H-2 polypeptide gave the sequence MSMSRLGLLLF, corresponding to the N terminus of At-P4H-2. When a slice of the blot cut from the corresponding migration position of the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction was analyzed, the same sequence was identified, thus verifying the presence of At-P4H-2 in this fraction. High levels of At-P4H-2 activity were seen in the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction, the activity generated in Sf9 cells being twice that obtained in H5 cells (data not shown), and therefore the former cell line was chosen for further investigation. The At-P4H-2 activity in the 50% glycerol-soluble fraction was only 16% of that in the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction when expressed per 100 μg of protein in the fraction (data not shown), suggesting that a considerable percentage of the glycerol-soluble polypeptide was incorrectly folded. The 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction was therefore used as the At-P4H-2 source in all subsequent experiments. The Recombinant At-P4H-2 Effectively Hydroxylates Poly(l-proline)—P4H activity generated in the 0.1% Triton X-100-soluble fraction of Sf9 cells expressing either At-P4H-2 or human ERp57, an endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein-specific thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase (24High S.

A high amount of P4H activity was found in the soluble fraction of cells expressing At-P4H-2 when 200 μm poly(l-proline) was used as the peptide substrate, the amount of activity increasing with the molecular weight of the poly(l-proline) (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W1974607158,"Angiostatin binds to endothelial cell (EC) surface F1-F0 ATP synthase, leading to inhibition of EC migration and proliferation during tumor angiogenesis. This has led to a search for angiostatin mimetics specific for this enzyme. A naturally occurring protein that binds to the F1 subunit of ATP synthase and blocks ATP hydrolysis in mitochondria is inhibitor of F1 (IF1). The present study explores the effect of IF1 on cell surface ATP synthase. IF1 protein bound to purified F1 ATP synthase and inhibited F1-dependent ATP hydrolysis consistent with its reported activity in studies of mitochondria. Although exogenous IF1 did not inhibit ATP production on the surface of EC, it did conserve ATP on the cell surface, particularly at low extracellular pH. IF1 inhibited ATP hydrolysis but not ATP synthesis, in contrast to angiostatin, which inhibited both. In cell-based assays used to model angiogenesis in vitro, IF1 did not inhibit EC differentiation to form tubes and only slightly inhibited cell proliferation compared with angiostatin. From these data, we conclude that inhibition of ATP synthesis is necessary for an anti-angiogenic outcome in cell-based assays. We propose that IF1 is not an angiostatin mimetic, but it can serve a protective role for EC in the tumor microenvironment. This protection may be overridden in a concentration-dependent manner by angiostatin. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that angiostatin blocks IF1 binding to ATP synthase and abolishes its ability to conserve ATP. These data suggest that there is a relationship between the binding sites of IF1 and angiostatin on ATP synthase and that IF1 could be employed to modulate angiogenesis.

These data suggest that there is a relationship between the binding sites of IF1 and angiostatin on ATP synthase and that IF1 could be employed to modulate angiogenesis. The term angiogenesis refers to the development of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels. This process is essential for maintaining and promoting tumor growth. One of the first anti-angiogenic agents discovered with the aim of treating cancers was angiostatin (1O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R.

Our laboratory identified F1-F0 ATP synthase as a receptor for angiostatin on the surface of human EC 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cells; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; IF1, inhibitor of the F1 subunit of ATP synthase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

A. 1999; 96: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This non-mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis and is inhibited by angiostatin at low, tumor-like extracellular pH. The pH dependence explains the selectivity of angiostatin for the tumor microenvironment, where it inhibits EC migration and proliferation (3Wahl M.L. Page A.R. Tootell M. Zahaczewsky M. Owen C.S. Grant D.S. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2001; 59Google Scholar, 4Wahl M.L. Owen C.S. Grant D.S. Endothelium. 2002; 9: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Wahl M.L. Grant D.S. Gen. Pharmacol. 2002; 35: 277-285Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Angiostatin inhibited both ATP production and ATP hydrolysis in previous studies (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that polyclonal antibodies against the catalytic β-subunit or the regulatory α-subunit of ATP synthase inhibit the enzyme bidirectionally and therefore act as angiostatin mimetics. However, it was unknown whether a specific inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis could also serve as an angiostatin mimetic. To address this question, we have studied the effects of IF1, a natural inhibitor protein of F1-F0 ATP synthase, on EC surface ATP synthase. The IF1 protein is a 9.6-kDa basic protein that comprises of 84 amino acids (7Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is known to inhibit the hydrolytic activity of mitochondrial ATP synthase (7Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol.

IF1 binds to ATP synthase at the F1 domain in the COOH-terminal region of the β-subunit (9Klein G. Satre M. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V.

Negawa Y. Tagawa K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in an area that is in contact with the central γ-subunit (12Cabezon E. Runswick M.J. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6990-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that IF1 disrupts the contact between the β- and γ-subunits, inhibiting F1 ATPase function (12Cabezon E. Runswick M.J. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6990-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of IF1 protein to ATP synthase depends on pH (13Panchenko M.V. Vinogradov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with a pH of 6.5 or below favoring a stable complex with the enzyme (14Cabezon E. Butler P.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The ability of IF1 to inhibit ATP hydrolysis is well documented, but its role in the synthesis of ATP has been unclear (15von Harris D.A. Tscharner V. Radda G.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 548: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Lippe G. Sorgato M.C. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, its ability to inhibit ATP synthesis on the surface of EC had not been explored. We demonstrate here that exogenous IF1 does not inhibit ATP production on the surface of EC; however, the addition of IF1 produced a relative increase in extracellular ATP as a result of inhibition of ATP hydrolysis. We therefore conclude that IF1 serves as a model of unidirectional inhibition of cell surface ATP synthase, which has an ATP-conserving effect. In addition, we demonstrate that IF1 does not have the anti-angiogenic effect of angiostatin, but it may attenuate the anti-angiogenic response to angiostatin. Expression and Purification of IF1—Recombinant human IF1 DNA was obtained as described previously (18Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33906-33912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, IF1 DNA (pET15b) containing a His6 tag was transformed into BL21(DE3) gold competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). IF1 protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and batch-purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under non-reducing conditions before dialyzing into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. A monoclonal antibody against IF1 (anti-IF1 IgG1) was employed to verify the presence of purified protein product by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or by Western immunoblot as described previously (18Aggeler R.

Bovine F1 ATP Synthase—Fresh bovine heart mitochondria were obtained as described previously (19Johnson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and sonicated to yield submitochondrial particles (20Li S.G. Gui L.L. Lin Z.H. Wan Z.L. Chang W.R. Liang D.C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 479-486PubMed Google Scholar). The F1 portion was separated from membrane-bound F0 by chloroform extraction. The aqueous layer was centrifuged at 105,000 × g to remove particulate matter before purifying over an S300 gel-filtration column. Human and bovine ATP synthase are highly homologous, differing only by eight amino acid residues in the mature α chains (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P25705 and P19483, respectively) and six residues in the mature β chains (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P06576 and P00829, respectively). Angiostatin (K1–3)—Human angiostatin consisting of plasminogen kringles 1–3 was purified as described previously (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 21Thorsen S. Clemmensen I. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The concentration of angiostatin was determined spectrophotometrically at a λ = 280 nm by using an A1%/1 cm value of 0.8 and a molecular mass of 38 kDa (21Thorsen S. Clemmensen I. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 668: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). ELISA Binding Studies—Binding studies were performed with purified bovine F1 ATP synthase (10 μg/ml) passively adsorbed onto microtiter 96-well, flat-bottomed plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Briefly, plates were coated with protein in 50 μl of 0.1 m Na2C03, pH 9.6, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating with PBS, pH 7.0, containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Increasing concentrations of purified recombinant IF1 were added in a 50-μl final volume of PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, and incubated with an anti-IF1 IgG at 1 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, plates were incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Plates were washed, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma) was added to the wells. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 m H2S04, and color absorbance at λ = 450 nm was measured on a SpectraMax® microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Microplate F1 Activity Assay—The forward reaction of ATP synthase results in production of ATP. The complete F1-F0 holoenzyme is required to catalyze the reaction. If only the F1 subunit is present, only the reverse reaction, ATP hydrolysis, can occur. Therefore, to measure IF1 activity, the assay employs only the F1 subunit. In this assay, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The oxidation of NADH to NAD+ may be read as a decrease in relative fluorescence units (excitation λ = 355 nm, emission λ = 460 nm). A decrease in fluorescence is a measure of increased F1 activity. Briefly, purified bovine F1 ATP synthase (10 μg/ml) was added to 96-well Microfluor® 2 black flat-bottomed plates (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA) at 25-μl volume in PBS, pH 6.5 or 7.5. Inhibitors (IF1 or angiostatin) or controls (PBS, 2% sodium azide) were added to wells at increasing concentrations, diluted in PBS, pH 6.5 or 7.5, for 1 h. 2× assay buffer (4 mm phospho-enolpyruvate, 0.4 mm NADH, 4 mm ATP, 2% pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, 50 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm MgCl2 in dH20) was added to each well for 1 h before monitoring NADH fluorescence emission (λ = 460 nm) on an fmax® fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices). Cell Proliferation Assay—Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were plated at a density of 5,000 cells/well in essential growth medium (Clonetics, East Rutherford, NJ) depleted of fetal calf serum overnight to allow the cells to become quiescent. Fresh medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 3 ng/ml vascular endothelial cell growth factor was added to the wells along with IF1 protein (1 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml), PBS (pH 6.5), or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Cell density was measured at 24 and 48 h using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation cell proliferation ELISA® (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Endothelial Cell Tube Differentiation—For the experiment in Fig. 4, HUVEC were grown at 37 °C in essential growth-MV cell medium (–vascular endothelial cell growth factor/fibroblast growth factor) at pH 6.5 or pH 7.5 for 24 h. HUVEC were harvested from flasks using 4 mm EDTA. The cells were then diluted in essential growth-MV cell medium (+vascular endothelial cell growth factor/fibroblast growth factor) for a final concentration of 60,000 cells/well. IF1 (1 μm, 2.5 μm), PBS (pH 6.5, 7.5), or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added to cells before incubating on 24-well plates coated previously with Matrigel® at 37 °C. Tube formation was monitored over a 24-h period, and images were taken using a CoolSNAP digital color camera (Image Processing Solutions, North Reading, MA) with Olympus IX70 microscope (Olympus, Orangeburg, NY). For the experiment in Fig. 7, HUVEC were grown as above, except that during the experimental assay, the pH was 6.1. For each error bar, 6–9 fields of tubes from 3 wells in a 96-well plate were quantified using the NIH Image program, and a mean and standard deviation were calculated. Each experiment shown is representative of the two that were performed.Fig. 7The effects of IF1 and angiostatin on EC tube differentiation. Competition experiments with sequential addition of angiostatin and IF1 are shown. The first bar (white) represents the control where cells were plated in the absence of either angiostatin or IF1. The second bar (light gray) represents the effect of 0.50 μm angiostatin. The third bar (diagonal hatched) shows the effect of sequential addition of IF1 (1 μm) followed by angiostatin (0.50 μm). The fourth bar (black) represents sequential addition of angiostatin (0.50 μm) and IF1 (5 μm). The fifth bar (horizontal hatched) represents angiostatin (0.50 μm) followed by IF1 (1 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Flow Cytometry—HUVEC (300,000 cells/ml) were resuspended in ice-cold staining buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution/1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% sodium azide) at pH 6.5 or 7.5 and incubated on ice for 30 min with anti-IF1 IgG, anti-CD31, or 4 μg of exogenous IF1. Cells were washed with ice-cold staining buffer and pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. This wash was repeated twice, and the cells were resuspended in ice-cold staining buffer before incubating for 30 min in the dark with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to allophycocyanin. After the final wash, the cells were pelleted and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde at a density of 106 cells/ml. Nonviable cells were identified using DEAD Red stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) prior to the final wash. The mean relative fluorescence after excitation at a λ = 488 nm was determined for each sample on a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). ATP Generation by CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescence Assay—HUVEC, which were ∼80% confluent in 96-well plates, were washed and equilibrated into custom endothelial basal medium from Clonetics containing 0.45 mm NaH2PO4 and 0.50 mm Na2HPO4. Cells were treated with IF1 (0.5–2.5 μm), angiostatin (5 μm), or piceatannol for 30 min at 37 °C. For competition experiments, angiostatin was allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 °C before addition of IF1 (or vice versa). All cells were then incubated with 0.05 mm ADP for 20 s. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged before assaying for ATP production by CellTiter-Glo™ luminescence assay. Aliquots (50 μl) of cellular supernatants from cell surface ATP assays were analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo™ luminescence assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). In this firefly luciferin-luciferase reaction, only ATP is readily detected because the enzymatic reaction of firefly luciferase to oxidize luciferin is specific for ATP relative to all other nucleotides. Samples were injected with the ATP assay mixture and incubated for 10 min to stabilize the luminescence signal. Recordings were then made in a Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) over a 20-s period. The response in a given sample or standard was quantified as area under the peak of the response and averaged for duplicate determinations. Data are expressed as moles of ATP per cell based on standards determined under the same conditions with each experiment. IF1 Binds to Purified Bovine F1 ATP Synthase—Bovine F1 was passively adsorbed onto microtiter wells before the addition of increasing amounts of recombinant human IF1 protein. ELISA studies demonstrated that purified IF1 bound to F1 ATP synthase in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner and bound at lower concentrations at a pH of 6.5 rather than 7.3 (Fig. 1). Near saturation level was obtained at a pH of 6.5 at 1–2 μm, whereas at a pH of 7.3, saturation was achieved at 4 μm. IF1 Inhibited F1-dependent ATP Hydrolysis—We employed a microplate F1 activity assay to confirm the ability of our purified IF1 protein to inhibit ATP hydrolysis. The F1 subunit was sufficient for the reverse ATP hydrolysis reaction but not the forward reaction of ATP synthesis, which required the F1-F0 holoenzyme. IF1 inhibited the activity of F1 ATP synthase in a concentration- and pH-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The inhibitory capacity of IF1 decreased when the pH was raised to 7.5. In contrast, IF1 did not inhibit Escherichia coli F1 activity (data not shown). Sodium azide completely abolished F1 activity comparable with IF1 at pH 6.5 and was thus used as a positive control in this and subsequent experiments. IF1 Increases the Presence of Extracellular ATP on the Surface of HUVEC—ATP synthase on the surface of EC is active in producing ATP and is inhibited by angiostatin, as well as by antibodies to the α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), when measured using a CellTiter-Glo™ luminescence assay. We employed this same assay to determine whether IF1 inhibited ATP synthesis on the surface of EC. EC were incubated at pH 6.1 or 7.7 before ATP synthase activity was measured on the cell surface. IF1 increased extracellular ATP on the surface of HUVEC compared with medium alone (Table I). This trend is concentration- and pH-dependent, with the largest increase seen at pH 6.1, where IF1 (0.5 μm) increases the level of extracellular ATP by ∼37%. At the same concentration, but at pH 7.7, IF1 increases ATP generation by 13%. Because there is a fixed amount of ADP per well, and ADP alone in medium sets the base line for ATP production, it is unlikely that there is an active increase in ATP production in the presence of IF1. Rather, the addition of IF1 results in a relative increase in extracellular ATP by inhibiting its hydrolysis. This is in contrast to angiostatin, which inhibited ATP production by greater than 70% in similar studies (see Table II). Piceatannol, a known inhibitor of mitochondrial F1-F0 ATP synthase (22Zheng J. Ramirez V.D. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 23Zheng J. Ramirez V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), inhibited ATP production by 75% at pH 6.1 and 92% at pH 7.7 (see Table I), which demonstrated that ATP synthase is the major source of ATP in this assay.Table IATP generation on the surface of HUVEC as measured by CellTiterGlo™ luminescence assay in the presence of IF1ATP concentration ± S.E.pH 6.1pH 7.7mol-15/cellMedium alone20.7 ± 2.935.8 ± 3.6IF1 (0.50 μm)26.5 ± 1.536.6 ± 2.0IF1 (2.5 μm)28.3 ± 0.440.8 ± 1.4Piceatannol (500 μm)5.0 ± 0.032.8 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab Table IIATP generation on the surface of HUVEC as measured by CellTiterGlo™ luminescence assay in the presence of IF1 and angiostatinpH 6.1ATP concentration ± S.E.mol-15/cellMedium alone34.5 ± 2.2Angiostatin (5 μm)9.2 ± 1.2Angiostatin (5 μm) then IF1 (2.5 μm)4.7 ± 0.3IF1 (2.5 μm) then angiostatin (5 μm)6.9 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of HUVEC Proliferation in the Presence of IF1— IF1 protein was added to quiescent EC at low pH (<7.0) to analyze cell proliferation at 24 and 48 h. IF1 (10 μg/ml) inhibited proliferation 20% at 48 h, compared with medium alone and PBS vehicle controls (Fig. 3). A known inhibitor, cycloheximide, inhibited cell proliferation 65%. In addition, our laboratory demonstrated previously the ability of angiostatin to inhibit proliferation by 57% in this same assay (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IF1 on EC proliferation is markedly less than that of angiostatin, supporting the argument that bidirectional inhibition of ATP synthase is necessary for a strong anti-angiogenic response. HUVEC Tube Differentiation in the Presence of IF1—We next studied IF1 in another cell-based assay of neo-angiogenesis, differentiation to form EC tubes, at pH 6.5 and 7.5. IF1 demonstrated no inhibition of tube formation at either pH value (Fig. 4). At pH 6.5, PBS (vehicle)-positive controls demonstrated strong tube formation (Fig. 4A) and were comparable with IF1-treated wells (Fig. 4B). At pH 7.5, PBS controls (Fig. 4C) were also identical to IF1 (Fig. 4D). Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, completely inhibited tube formation at both normal and low pH values (Fig. 4E). Consistent with our prior studies, angiostatin also inhibited tube differentiation in similar studies only at low pH (data not shown). These results and the cell proliferation studies indicate that IF1 is a poor angiostatin mimetic in cell-based assays. IF1 Is Endogenously Present on the Surface of HUVEC— Previously published reports have demonstrated that the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of ATP synthase are present on the cell surface (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that IF1 is also endogenously present on the surface of HUVEC by flow cytometry. IF1 protein was present whether the HUVEC were incubated at pH 7.4 (Fig. 5A) or pH 6.5 (data not shown). The presence of IF1 was compared with CD31, a known marker on the surface of EC. In addition, we also demonstrated that adding exogenous IF1 protein to EC increased the cell surface signal (median intensity) by 41% (Fig. 5B). This confirms that exogenous IF1 is able to bind the endothelial cell surface and likely helps saturate IF1 binding to ATP synthase. IF1 Binding to ATP Synthase Is Inhibited by Angiostatin— IF1 and angiostatin both bind ATP synthase in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner. We then performed experiments to determine whether angiostatin inhibited IF1 binding to purified F1ATP synthase. ATP synthase was preincubated with angiostatin before the addition of increasing amounts of IF1. Preincubation with 10 μg/ml angiostatin inhibited IF1 binding to ATP synthase by 70% when compared with IF1 binding alone (Fig. 6). The calculated apparent Kd was 5 nm. Similarly, in a cell surface ATP luminescence assay, preincubation with angiostatin abolished the ability of IF1 to conserve ATP at low pH (Table II). The same effect was seen at pH 7.7 (data not shown). Furthermore, the effect of preincubation with IF1 was completely overridden by the addition of angiostatin (see Table II). Together, these data demonstrated that angiostatin was able to block and compete with IF1 binding to ATP synthase and inhibited its activity. Whether this effect results from direct competition between angiostatin and IF1 cannot be determined from these studies. It is also conceivable that a conformational change in F1 ATP synthase is induced by angiostatin and/or IF1. Angiostatin Overrides the Effects of IF1 on Tube Differentiation—In a series of experiments using the EC tube differentiation assay, we examined the question of whether angiostatin could override the protective effect of IF1 (Fig. 7). To optimize the assay, a serum dose response was evaluated at pH 6.1 prior to dose responses to IF1 and angiostatin. Tube formation was dependent on serum concentration over the range of 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 20% (v/v). Experiments shown in Fig. 7 were performed at the optimal conditions, a pH of 6.1 and 1 mm bicarbonate media containing 0.1% serum. A dose-response study revealed decreased tube formation at 0.25 and 0.50 μm angiostatin. The data at a concentration of 0.5 μm angiostatin are shown in Fig. 7. Decreased tube formation could be observed if angiostatin was added at the time of cell plating or 1 or 2 h subsequent to cell plating. In the experiments with both IF1 and angiostatin, each was added followed by the other 2 h later. A dose response to IF1 revealed a slight protective effect at 1 and 2.5 μm with no further effect at higher doses. These experiments indicated that angiostatin overrides the slight protective effect of IF1 whether the latter is added before or after angiostatin. The role of IF1 inhibitory protein was explored to elucidate its potential for activity on EC surface ATP synthase, its interaction with angiostatin, and its effect on angiogenesis. To determine whether IF1 can be an angiostatin mimetic, we tested its ability to 1) bind purified F1 ATP synthase and inhibit its hydrolytic activity and 2) inhibit endothelial cell tube differentiation and cell proliferation. First, we confirmed the ability of IF1 to inhibit F1-dependent ATP hydrolysis using a microplate F1 activity assay. However, IF1 did not inhibit ATP production on the surface of EC. From these data, we concluded that IF1 is a unidirectional inhibitor of cell surface ATP synthase. This is in contrast to angiostatin, which inhibits the reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase in both directions (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that IF1 activity is concentration- and pH-dependent. Increased inhibitory capacity was observed when the pH was lowered to 6.5, as has been shown with angiostatin (3Wahl M.L. Page A.R. Tootell M. Zahaczewsky M. Owen C.S. Grant D.S. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2001; 59Google Scholar, 4Wahl M.L. Owen C.S. Grant D.S. Endothelium. 2002; 9: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Wahl M.L. Pizzo S.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, in cell-based assays, IF1 did not inhibit EC tube differentiation and only slightly inhibited cell proliferation in contrast with angiostatin (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B.

To understand the interactions of IF1 and angiostatin, competition and binding studies were performed with the two proteins and purified F1 ATP synthase. We demonstrated that exogenous IF1 was not able to overcome angiostatin-induced inhibition of ATP synthesis on the endothelial cell surface. Furthermore, IF1 binding to purified F1 ATP synthase was inhibited by preincubation with angiostatin. These findings demonstrated that angiostatin was able to inhibit the binding of IF1 to ATP synthase and inhibited its activity on the surface of EC. From a mechanistic standpoint, we propose that the binding of angiostatin induces a conformational change that diminishes the affinity of IF1 toward its binding site. Finally, we hypothesized that IF1 might be endogenously present on the surface of EC. It is known that the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of ATP synthase are present and co-localize extensively on the cell surface (6Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Arakaki N. Nagao T. Niki R. Toyofuku A. Tanaka H. Kuramoto Y. Emoto Y. Shibata H. Magota K. Higuti T. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 931-939PubMed Google Scholar), but the presence of IF1 had not been determined. We have now demonstrated by flow cytometry that endogenous IF1 is present on the surface of EC. Furthermore, exogenously added IF1 is able to increase the signal detected by flow, confirming that EC bind IF1 on the external surface of the plasma membrane. These data indicate that IF1 is a specific inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis on endothelial cell surface ATP synthase. This inhibition is not sufficient for a sustained anti-angiogenic effect in cell-based assays, suggesting that IF1 is not an angiostatin mimetic. Rather, we hypothesize that IF1 serves a protective function on EC in the tumor microenvironment by allowing these cells to conserve ATP during periods of low pH. In addition, it now seems likely that angiostatin disrupts this preservation of ATP, tipping the balance toward an anti-angiogenic effect. We therefore also conclude that blockage of ATP hydrolysis is not sufficient to cause inhibition of angiogenesis. Rather, inhibition of ATP synthesis is necessary for an anti-angiogenic outcome. It is likely that the role of IF1 on cell surface ATP synthase is similar to its role in mitochondria, where IF1 binds ATP synthase to conserve ATP. In mitochondria, this binding is favored under anaerobic conditions, when the electrochemical gradient collapses and the pH decreases (28Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9657-9661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3472-3476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rouslin W. Broge C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15224-15229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although low pH conditions are not present in normal tissues, the tumor microenvironment has an average pH of 6.7 (31Wike-Hooley J.L. Haveman J. Reinhold H.S. Radiother. Oncol. 1984; 2: 343-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 32Yamagata M. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 1328-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This low pH environment favors the binding of IF1 to tumor EC and suggests that IF1 may modulate tumor angiogenesis. The dependence of tumor growth on angiogenesis is already well documented, and it is known that tumor expansion beyond a prevascular size (1–3 mm3) requires the generation of new blood vessels (33Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). IF1 would give these blood vessels an increased source of ATP at low pH, when mitochondrial ATP synthesis might be shut down. In support of this hypothesis is a study demonstrating that EC maintains ATP levels under hypoxic conditions (34Graven K.K. Farber H.W. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 426-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the role of ATP in this environment is still being elucidated, it has been hypothesized that ATP may activate signaling cascades (24Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Wahl M.L. Pizzo S.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) via binding to P2X/P2Y receptors on the cell surface, leading to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (35Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of DNA synthesis and cell replication. Thus, the ability of IF1 to help conserve ATP on the surface of EC may not only promote angiogenesis but also tumor cell population growth. When mitochondria are in low oxygen conditions, matrix pH decreases, and the proton gradient favorable for ATP synthesis declines. The orientation of the F1-F0 ATP synthase in the EC membrane is such that ATP production occurs on the cell surface (2Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hojrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S.

The three principal transporters that affect or regulate intracellular pH are the Na+/H+ exchanger (37Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

All of these take advantage of ion gradients rather than ATP to drive their activity; thus it may be more feasible for the cell in a hypoxic, acidic environment to produce ATP on its surface. This would have the additional benefit of providing ATP on the surface for signaling via the P2X/P2Y receptors (45Staerman F. Shalev M. Legrand A. Lobel B. Saiag B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 486: 189-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that IF1 is endogenously present on the surface of EC supports the hypothesis that these cells use surface ATP synthase and interactive proteins in a mechanism developed to conserve extracellular ATP. However, it is clear that the protective response afforded by IF1 is not sufficient to overcome the anti-angiogenic effects of angiostatin. In support of this statement, we have shown that the ability of IF1 to conserve ATP on the surface of EC was abolished by angiostatin. This is an example of the balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors that help determine whether angiogenesis or angiostasis will be favored (46Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar, 47Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar, 48Bouck N. Stellmach V. Hsu S.C. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 69: 135-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study angiostatin was capable of overriding the protective effect of IF1. It is now reasonable to propose that angiostatin exerts its anti-angiogenic effect, at least in part, by inhibiting IF1 binding to ATP synthase. This hypothesis would help explain why angiostatin has a stronger anti-angiogenic effect at low pH and little effect at physiologic pH. At physiologic pH, EC would have little use for IF1 as a source of ATP because alternative sources of ATP would be abundant, and therefore the activity of IF1 would be minimal. However, in the low pH, low oxygen, milieu of the tumor microenvironment, EC would have a strong need to conserve ATP through IF1 because oxidative phosphorylation would begin to shut down. In this scenario, the ability of angiostatin to abolish IF1 activity would be devastating to the growing tumor. We thank Aimee Paradis for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2085082236,"Fyn protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), a member of the Src-PTK family, is essential for myelin development in the central nervous system (CNS). The absence of Fyn activity results in defects in the morphogenesis of oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) and CNS hypomyelination. However, molecular mechanisms for Fyn to control CNS myelinogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that Fyn-PTK is significantly up-regulated in early OPC differentiation, concentrated in the compact myelin, and declines during myelin development. Despite the high levels of Fyn-PTK expression during early OPC differentiation, Fyn deficiency does not affect the expression of mRNAs that encode myelin structural proteins, including that for the myelin basic protein (MBP), until postnatal day 13 (P13). However, the accumulation rate of MBP mRNA is significantly attenuated during the most active period of myelinogenesis (P13 and P20). Interestingly, the absence of Fyn causes a preferential reduction of the exon-2 containing MBP mRNA isoforms derived from alternative splicing, providing the first evidence that Fyn is required for posttranscriptional regulation of MBP. Consistent with this idea, Fyn phosphorylates the selective RNA-binding protein QKI, which likely modulates the activity of QKI in binding and stabilizing the MBP mRNA. Furthermore, Fyn deficiency exerts an opposing influence on MBP isoform patterning in comparison to that by QKI deficiency. These observations collectively suggest that Fyn plays critical roles in promoting accelerated MBP expression during myelinogenesis in a MBP isoform-preferential manner, and QKI may act in the same pathway downstream of Fyn for MBP mRNA homeostasis.

Furthermore, reduced expression of genes encoding myelin structural proteins in the fyn knock-out (ko) brain has been reported in several studies (11Sperber B.R. Boyle-Walsh E.A. Engleka M.J.

Neurobiol. 2004; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms underlying hypomyelination in the fyn ko brain remain unknown. No comprehensive model has been proposed to describe the role of Fyn signaling in regulating myelin protein expression and myelin development.In this study, we observed a marked up-regulation of Fyn expression upon induced differentiation of the CG4 oligodendrocyte cell line, consistent with the hypothesis that Fyn signaling promotes early differentiation of OPCs. During normal brain development, Fyn was enriched in the compact myelin and gradually declined with age. In the fyn ko brain, myelin structural gene mRNAs, represented by the myelin basic protein (MBP) transcripts, were expressed at normal levels until postnatal day 13 (P13) but failed to accumulate rapidly thereafter, indicating a functional requirement of Fyn in accelerating myelin synthesis. Interestingly, an isoform-preferential reduction of MBP mRNA was observed in the fyn ko brain, suggesting the involvement of Fyn in posttranscriptional regulation of MBP during myelin development. Furthermore, Fyn can phosphorylate the selective RNA-binding protein QKI at the C-terminal tyrosines that controls the activity for QKI to bind MBP mRNA, suggesting the possibility for QKI to act down stream of Fyn in CNS myelination.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and RNA Preparation—Animals were treated according to National Institutes of Health regulations under the approval of the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The fyn ko colony (generously provided by Dr. P. Stein, University of Pennsylvania) and the quakingviable (qkv) colony (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) were maintained at the Emory animal facility. Brain regions were dissected at ages indicated in the corresponding figure for total RNA extraction using TRIzol™ according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The quantity of RNA from each sample was determined by A260 reading and further confirmed by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Phosphorylation—CG4 cells were maintained for proliferation and induced for differentiation by established procedures (19Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for preparation of whole cell lysate in 1× Laemmli buffer. HEK293T cells were maintained at standard conditions and plasmid transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 following manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma). For the detection of phosphotyrosine, immunoblot analysis was performed with phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (20Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-QKI-7 was used for the in vitro phosphorylation assay by purified Fyn-PTK (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP using our previously published conditions (20Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies—Compact myelin was isolated from the forebrains by homogenizing the tissue in 10% w/v sucrose followed by sucrose gradient fractionation as described previously (20Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Li Z. Zhang Y. Li D. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4944-4953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole tissue lysates were prepared by sonicating minced tissue in 1× laemmli buffer. The quantity of total protein in each sample was estimated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) before subjected to SDS-PAGE. Hybridization to the primary antibody was performed in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 10% milk. All antibodies used in immunoblot analysis are commercially available: anti-neuron-specific enolase (NSE), anti-MBP, and anti-2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) (Chemicon); anti-PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), anti-Src, anti-Src pY416 (Sigma), and anti-Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RNase Protection Analysis (RPA) and RPA Probes—Antisense ribo-probes were generated by in vitro transcription following manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene) in the presence of [32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) using linearized plasmids as DNA templates. The synthesis of the MBP probe and CNP probe were described previously (22Zhang Y. Feng Y. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA template for the PLP-DM20 probe was generated from reverse transcription-PCR and the primer sequence will be available upon request. The glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RPA probe and β-actin probe were generated using DNA templates purchased from Ambion. RPA was carried out according to previously published procedures (22Zhang Y. Feng Y. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—15–45% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients were employed to fractionate cytoplasmic extracts derived from the forebrain of fyn ko mice and that of the wild type (wt) age-matched controls using published procedures (23Feng Y. Absher D. Eberhart D.E. Brown V. Malter H.E. Warren S.T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Each gradient was fractionated by upward replacement and collected into 11 fractions. Total RNA was isolated from each fraction by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by RPA to detect mRNA as indicated in the corresponding figures.RESULTSExpression of Fyn in Differentiating OPCs and in the Developing Myelin—To understand the role of Fyn in oligodendroglia development, we first examined the expression profile of Fyn upon induced differentiation of the CG4 oligodendrocyte cell line. As shown in Fig. 1A, CG4 cells underwent vigorous morphogenesis accompanied by a marked up-regulation of myelin structural proteins represented by the CNP, recapitulating differentiation of primary cultured oligodendrocytes. Fyn expression level was significantly elevated when cells extended multiple branched processes (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Src levels gradually declined, indicating distinct regulation of Src-PTK members during the early stage of OPC differentiation.Fig. 1Up-regulation of Fyn expression upon induced OPC differentiation.A, morphological changes during the early differentiation of the CG4 oligodendrocyte cell line. The day for differentiation is marked in each panel. B, immunoblot demonstrating Fyn up-regulation. Whole cell lysate was prepared for the SDS-PAGE and subjected to sequential probing by the antibodies marked on the left. eIF5-a, translation initiation factor 5, was used as a housekeeping loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both Fyn and Src were enriched in the fraction containing compact myelin isolated from normal brain at the peak of myelination (∼P20) as well as in young adulthood (Fig. 2A). The purity of isolated myelin was indicated by the absence of neuronal and astrocytic proteins, represented by the NSE and the GFAP respectively. Interestingly, Fyn levels gradually declined in the compact myelin isolated from the wt brain during active myelinogenesis (P20, Fig. 2B). As expected, Fyn was undetectable in the fyn ko brain (Fig. 2B). Consequently, the absence of Fyn resulted in a significant reduction of the total activity of Src-PTKs in the isolated myelin (Fig. 2C), as measured by the levels of phosphotyrosine at position 416 (Tyr(P)-416) that is present in all the activated Src-PTK members.Fig. 2Src-PTKs in compact myelin isolated from the developing forebrain.A, immunoblot demonstrates that both Fyn and Src are enriched in purified compact myelin. Ten micrograms of total protein was loaded in each lane. The detected proteins by specific antibodies are labeled on the left. Actin was used as a loading control, NSE as a neuronal marker, and GFAP as an astracyte marker. B, Fyn abundance in the wt compact myelin declines during myelinogenesis. As expected, no Fyn signal is detected in the fyn ko myelin. (C) The absence of Fyn causes significant reduction of total Src-PTK activity in the compact myelin. Tyr(P)-418 is detected by a specific antibody that recognizes all the activated Src-PTK members.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fyn Deficiency Causes an Abnormally Slow Accumulation of MBP mRNA during Myelin Development— To identify the molecular defects that lead to hypomyelination in the fyn ko brain, we analyzed the expression levels of several myelin structural protein mRNAs during myelin development by quantitative RPA. Fig. 3 shows the expression profile of MBP mRNA isoforms in the forebrain of fyn ko mice and age-matched wt controls. Four major MBP mRNA isoforms derived from alternative splicing, which encode the 21.5, 18.5, 17.2, and 14 kDa MBP protein isoforms (M21.5, M18.5, M17.2, and M14, respectively), were detected at comparable levels in wt and fyn ko forebrain up to P13 (Fig. 3, A and B). A rapid accumulation of MBP mRNAs was detected in the wt forebrain between P13 and P20 (Fig. 3C). However, all the MBP mRNA isoforms were at lower levels in the fyn ko forebrain as compared with that in the wt controls after P13, resulting in a significantly reduced accumulation rate of MBP mRNAs during the most active period of myelination between P13 and P20 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, expression of MBP mRNAs in the fyn ko brain stem was normal throughout the entire profile of myelin development (data not shown). This result suggests that Fyn is required for accelerated MBP expression only in a subclass of oligodendrocytes in the CNS during the most active myelinogenesis.Fyn Deficiency Results in an Isoform-preferential Reduction of Alternatively Spliced Oligodendrocyte mRNAs—A more detailed analysis revealed that the M21.5 and M17.2 MBP mRNA isoforms (both contain exon 2) appeared to be more severely reduced than the M18.5 and M14 MBP mRNA isoforms (both lack exon 2) in the fyn ko brain (Fig. 3B). To reaffirm this phenomenon, we employed a semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay that amplified the exon 2(+) and exon 2(-) MBP transcripts in the same reaction. As shown in Fig. 4, the ratio of exon 2(+) MBP mRNAs to the exon 2(-) MBP mRNAs was reduced in the fyn ko brain, confirming the preferential reduction of the exon 2(+) MBP mRNA isoforms caused by Fyn deficiency. The isoform-preferential deficits caused by Fyn deficiency cannot be explained by transcriptional abnormality and thus provides the first evidence that Fyn is required for posttranscriptional regulation in oligodendrocytes.Fig. 4Preferential reduction of the exon 2(+) MBP mRNA isoform in the fyn ko forebrain. The top panel shows a representative gel for a reverse transcription-PCR reaction that detects exon (Ex) 2(+) and exon 2(-) MBP mRNAs simultaneously. The bottom panel illustrates the ratio of the exon 2(+) MBP mRNA to exon 2(-) MBP mRNA based on phosphorimager reading. ** indicates p < 0.01 by standard t test (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Besides the reduced MBP mRNA expression during active myelination in the fyn ko forebrain, the mRNAs encoding CNPs and DM20 were also significantly reduced whereas the PLP mRNA, an alternatively spliced mRNA derived from the same transcript encoding the DM20 mRNA, was at normal level (Fig. 5). Hence, Fyn deficiency causes a broad range of abnormalities in the expression of myelin structural genes, which is conceivable to result in deficient myelin synthesis and the hypomyelination phenotype.Fig. 5Expression of CNP and PLP gene transcripts in wt and fyn ko forebrain.A, representative RPA gel with the signals of each mRNA isoform marked on the side of the corresponding lanes. GAPDH was used as a loading control. B, phosphorimager reading of RPA signals normalized to GAPDH. ** indicates p < 0.01 by standard t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether Fyn deficiency may cause additional post-transcriptional abnormalities, we performed linear sucrose gradient fractionation experiments to evaluate MBP translation in the absence of Fyn. As shown in Fig. 6, forebrain cytoplasmic extracts derived from fyn ko mice and wt controls were fractionated on parallel linear sucrose gradients and the distribution of each MBP mRNA isoform was determined by RPA. A nearly identical polyribosome association profile of MBP mRNA was observed in fyn ko and wt brain, with the majority of the MBP mRNAs associated with polyribosomes engaged in active translation, demonstrating that MBP translation is not affected by Fyn deficiency.Fig. 6MBP mRNA isoforms are engaged in normal translation in the fyn ko forebrain. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from P19 fyn ko and wt forebrains for fractionation on 15–45% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient. The separation of ribosomal components was monitored at A254 and shown on top of each panel. The distribution of MBP mRNAs and that of the housekeeping GADPH mRNA in each gradient was analyzed by RPA and superimposed with the A254 absorption profile. The fraction numbers are indicated at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested whether the absence of Fyn may affect the efficiency for the transport of MBP mRNAs to the compact myelin, which is essential for localized MBP production and myelin ensheathment of neuronal axons (24Colman D.R. Kreibich G. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Soma polyribosomes and compact myelin were prepared by sucrose gradient fractionation using a well established procedure (21Li Z. Zhang Y. Li D. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4944-4953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Colman D.R. Kreibich G. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the total RNA isolated from each fraction was subjected to RPA. As shown in Fig. 7, the successful separation of myelin from other soma contaminant was demonstrated by the absence of the GAPDH mRNA that is restricted to the cell body. Despite the reduction of MBP mRNAs in the soma polyribosomes, similar MBP mRNA levels were detected in the compact myelin isolated from the fyn ko forebrain. This result suggests that the efficiency for transporting the MBP mRNAs to the compact myelin in fyn ko brain was at least comparable with that in the wt controls. Therefore, the above results collectively suggest that the deficient MBP expression in the fyn ko forebrain is mainly due to the reduced levels of MBP mRNAs at steady state. Besides the net reduction of MBP mRNA, Fyn deficiency also results in posttranscriptional misregulation, as indicated by the abnormal MBP mRNA isoform patterning in the fyn ko brain.Fig. 7Fyn deficiency does not affect the transport of MBP mRNAs to the compact myelin.A, soma polyribosome pellet (PR) and compact myelin were derived from wt and fyn ko forebrain based on the sucrose gradient myelin floatation assay and total RNA from each fraction was recovered for RPA analysis. RPA signals for MBP, GAPDH, and the 18 S ribosome RNA are indicated on the left. B, phosphorimager quantification of MBP mRNA isoforms was normalized to the signal of 18 S rRNA as loading control, and results derived from somatic polyribosome pellets and compact myelin derived from wt and fyn ko forebrain were plotted. The level of MBP mRNAs in wt control was set as 100% when compared with data derived from fyn ko brain. ** indicates p < 0.01 by standard t test. The numbers of experiments are indicated at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)QKI May Act Downstream of Fyn in MBP mRNA Homeostasis—During normal development, expression of MBP in myelinogenesis is under the control of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Previous studies demonstrated that the selective RNA-binding protein QKI is a critical factor required to maintain the stability of MBP mRNAs in an isoform-preferential manner (21Li Z. Zhang Y. Li D. Feng Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4944-4953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Src family kinases negatively modulates the RNA-binding activity of QKI (20Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next tested whether QKI can be phosphorylated by Fyn, which possibly influences the homeostasis of MBP mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 8A, incubation with Fyn-PTK resulted in phosphorylation of purified recombinant QKI in vitro. In addition, when coexpressed with Fyn in HEK293T cells, QKI was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the mutant QKI, in which the C-terminal tyrosine cluster was replaced by phenylalanines thus lost the phosphorylation-dependant regulation in binding MBP mRNA (20Zhang Y. Lu Z. Ku L. Chen Y. Wang H. Feng Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), failed to be phosphorylated by Fyn in parallel experiments. These data demonstrate that the tyrosine cluster that controls the RNA binding activity of QKI is a target for Fyn-PTK.Fig. 8Fyn-PTK phosphorylates QKI and exerts opposing influence on MBP isoform patterning as compared with that caused by QKI.A, phosphorylation of purified His-tagged QKI by Fyn in vitro. Recombinant His-QKI purified from bacterium was incubated with purified Src or Fyn in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as indicated on top before subjected to SDS-PAGE. The migration of phosphorylated His-QKI was marked on the left. B, Fyn phosphorylates the C-terminal tyrosine cluster in QKI when co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged wt QKI or mutant QKI in which the C-terminal five tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines (Y-F mt) was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Fyn into HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of wt and mutant QKI was performed using anti-FLAG antibody, and the presence of phosphotyrosine was determined on immunoblot (IB) by the anti-PY20 antibody. The expression levels of hemagglutinin-Fyn and FLAG-QKI were shown on immunoblot in the bottom panels. C, immunoblot detects opposing abnormal MBP isoform patterns in fyn ko and qkv brain. The MBP protein isoforms are indicated on the left. D, opposing effect of Fyn and QKI on the ratio of M21.5 to M14 MBP mRNA isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W1967632729,"Lipodystrophic syndrome is a major side effect of highly active antiviral therapy. Fat tissue redistribution is associated with changes in adipocyte gene expression and in circulating levels of adipocytokines involved in the development of insulin resistance. However, the evidence that HIV drugs accumulate into human adipocytes and have a direct effect on the expression of adipocyte-specific genes is still lacking. To address these questions, we used adipocytes derived from adult stem (hMADS) cells isolated from human adipose tissue. We showed by ELISA that two inhibitors of the HIV protease, lopinavir and ritonavir, accumulated at similar levels during the development of hMADS cells in adipocytes, whereas a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, the nevirapine, accumulated at lower levels. Two fluorescent protease inhibitors then have been generated to investigate their subcellular localization. The data showed that HIV drugs accumulated into adipocytes and displayed various effects on hMADS cell-derived adipocytes. Indinavir, amprenavir, and nevirapine did not alter differentiation of precursor cells. In contrast, lopinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir inhibited the development of preadipocytes into adipocytes. In adipocytes, amprenavir increased leptin expression and ritonavir was able to up-regulate tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, and leptin expression and down-regulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin. Intracellular accumulation and localization of HIV drugs into human adipocytes strongly suggest that adipose tissues store these drugs. Because ritonavir can alter the expression of insulin resistance-related cytokines in human adipocytes in a way parallel to the situation observed in vivo upon treatment of HIV-infected patients, we propose that protease inhibitors participate in insulin resistance through a direct effect on adipocytes.

These drugs have demonstrated their efficiency in improving the lifespan of HIV-infected patients. However, patients under HAART develop metabolic alterations including fat tissue redistribution with peripheral lipoatrophy and increased central adiposity. The lipodystrophic syndrome affects up to 60% treated HIV-infected patients and is emerging as a significant medical concern (1Carr A. Samaras K. Thorisdottir A. Kaufmann G.R. Chisholm D.J. Cooper D.A. Lancet. 1999; 353: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). The adipose tissue of lipodystrophic HIV-infected patients contains clusters of small adipocytes (2Bastard J.P. Caron M. Vidal H. Jan V. Auclair M. Vigouroux C. Luboinski J. Laville M. Maachi M.

PIs and NNRTIs were detected in adipose tissue of patients, but evidence that HIV drugs accumulate and have a direct effect on the development of human adipocytes are still lacking. It has been recently shown that PIs can enter and accumulate in cultured mouse adipocytes (3Vernochet C. Azoulay S. Duval D. Guedj R. Ailhaud G. Dani C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2177-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Janneh O. Hoggard P.G. Tjia J.F. Jones S.P. Khoo S.H. Maher B. Back D.J. Pirmohamed M. Antiviral Ther. 2003; 8: 417-426PubMed Google Scholar) and that PIs, but not all, inhibited differentiation of mouse adipocytes (3Vernochet C. Azoulay S. Duval D. Guedj R. Ailhaud G. Dani C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2177-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Zhang B. MacNaul K. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

AIDS. 2002; 16: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These reports indicate a direct effect of PIs on adipogenesis. However, the effects of PIs were different according to the mouse preadipocyte clonal lines (3Vernochet C. Azoulay S. Duval D. Guedj R. Ailhaud G. Dani C. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2177-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating that studies with human adipocytes should be more appropriate to gain better insights into the molecular events that occur in human adipose tissue.HIV-infected patients under HAART develop dyslipidemia and systemic insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is thought to play a critical role in insulin resistance, in particular, through the expression of adipocytokines such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL6), and adiponectin. Leptin is an important circulating satiety factor that regulates food intake via its action in the central nervous system (7Friedman J.M. Nutr. Rev. 2002; 84: 85-87Google Scholar), and insulin sensitivity correlates negatively with leptin in lipohyperthrophic HIV-infected patients (8Vigouroux C. Maachi M. Nguyen T.H. Coussieu C. Gharakhanian S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Rozenbaum W. Capeau J. Bastard J.P. AIDS. 2003; 17: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that HIV-infected lipodystrophic patients exhibit 40% reduced plasma adiponectin levels compared with non-lipodystrophy patients leading to the proposal that adiponectin replacement therapy could improve the treatment of HAART-associated syndrome (9Kinlaw W.B.

In human, the increase of TNFα in obese subjects suggests a role of this cytokine in the development of insulin resistance (10Hotamisligil G.S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: S23-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recently, TNFα has been related to lipodystrophy and insulin resistance in HIV-infected and PI-treated patients (8Vigouroux C. Maachi M. Nguyen T.H. Coussieu C. Gharakhanian S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Shimomura I. Rozenbaum W. Capeau J. Bastard J.P. AIDS. 2003; 17: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, a direct effect of HIV drugs on the development of human adipocytes and on the expression of insulin-resistant-related genes has not been demonstrated. Importantly, there is no evidence that HIV drugs accumulate into human adipocytes that would indicate putative intracellular targets. Indeed, the data on the effects of HIV drugs on the differentiation of human adipocytes are still pending because of the lack of appropriate cellular models. Our laboratory has recently isolated from human adipose tissue adult stem cells able to differentiate at a high rate into adipocytes (11Rodriguez A. Elabd C. Delteil F. Astier J. Vernochet C. Saint-Marc P. Guesnet J. Guezennec Ez.-Z.A.A. Dani C. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These cells are termed multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells. Therefore, we used hMADS cells to investigate the following: 1) the intracellular localization and accumulation of HIV drugs in undifferentiated and differentiated cells; 2) the effects of different PIs and nevirapine on adipocyte differentiation and on fully differentiated adipocytes; and 3) the ability of PIs to modify the expression of adipocytokines involved in the establishment of insulin resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Nelfinavir, indinavir (IDV), ritonavir (RTV), and saquinavir (SQV) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (National Institutes of Health). Amprenavir (APV) was kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development (Herfordshire, United Kingdom). Large amounts of RTV, LPV, IDV, SQV, and nevirapine (NVP) were obtained by extraction from commercially available tablets and capsules. The purity was assessed by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. PIs obtained from the National Institutes of Health were used as reference products for purification and to validate results obtained with drugs purified from tablets. Each PI was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted 1:1000 in culture medium.Cell Expansion and Differentiation—hMADS cells were expanded in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dutscher S. A., Brumath, France). A detailed description of adipocyte differentiation of hMADS cells has been published recently (11Rodriguez A. Elabd C. Delteil F. Astier J. Vernochet C. Saint-Marc P. Guesnet J. Guezennec Ez.-Z.A.A. Dani C. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were maintained in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium v/v) supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.2 nm triiodothyronine (T3), 5 μg/ml human insulin, and 0.5 μm rosiglitazone. Three days later, Dex and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were omitted and media were changed every other day. Neutral lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O staining as previously described (12Dani C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 185: 107-116PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity was determined as previously described (13Vassaux G. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Gaillard D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).RNA Analysis—Total RNA from hMADS cells was prepared using TriReagent (Euromedex) according to the recommendations of the supplier. 20 μg of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis as previously described (14Dani C. Smith A.G. Dessolin S. Leroy P. Staccini L. Villageois P. Darimont C. Ailhaud G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were successively hybridized with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and β-actin probe to standardize signals. Quantification of the hybridization signal was performed using a PhosphorImager (Fuji-Bas1000) coupled to the Mac-Bas, version 2.x bioimaging analyzer. The concentrations of the different adipocytokine mRNAs were measured by reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR using a Light-Cycler (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and the FastStart DNA Master SYBRGreen kit (Roche Diagnostics). Primers (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) were selected to amplify small fragments (80-200 bp) and to hybridize in different exons of the target sequences. The list of the primers and real-time PCR conditions for each mRNA assay is available upon request. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and the validation of the real-time PCR runs was assessed by evaluation of the melting temperature of the products and by the slope and error obtained with the standard curve. The analyses were performed using the Light-Cycler software.PIs Labeling and Time-lapse Fluorescence Microscopy—Pyridine (0.178 mmol), N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (0.0158 mmol), and dansyl chloride (0.297 mmol) were added to amprenavir (0.198 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane under nitrogen atmosphere for 8 h at reflux temperature. The solvent then was removed in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography on a silica gel (96/4, chloroform/methanol) to obtain the APV-dansyl. N,N-Dimethylaminopyridine (0.081 mmol) and N-methylisatoic anhydride (0.089 mmol) were added to indinavir (0.081 mmol) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide under nitrogen atmosphere for 5 h at room temperature. The solvent then was removed in vacuo, and the crude product was purified by TLC (96/4, chloroform/methanol) to obtain the indinavir-N-methyl-anthraniloyl (IDV-MANT). All of the products were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Details of the chemical procedure are available upon request. Cell images were recorded by using the ×40/0.65-1.35NA oil immersion objective lens. Image acquisition and analysis were performed using the Applied Precision Deltavision system (Applied Precison, Issaquah, WA) built on an Olympus IX-70 base. For APV-dansyl and IDV-MANT, excitation and emission filters were FITC-DAPI and DAPI-DAPI, respectively. The stability of the labeling has been investigated. For that purpose, intracellular APV-dansyl and IDV-MANT have been recovered from adipocytes 2 days after incubation and analyzed by HPLC-UV. No uncoupled PIs and no free fluorophore were detected, indicating that the labeling was stable and that the fluorescence reflected the PI localization.Competitive ELISA—RTV, NVP, and LPV were quantified by competitive ELISA as previously described (15Azoulay S. Nevers M.C. Creminon C. Heripret L. Durant J. Dellamonica P. Grassi J. Guedj R. Duval D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Akeb F. Ferrua B.

Results were expressed as nanomole of HIV drugs/106 cells.RESULTSHIV Drugs Enter and Accumulate into Human-cultured Adipocytes—We first investigated by ELISA the ability of two PIs (RTV and LPV) and one NNRTI (NVP) to enter and accumulate in human adipocytes. The amounts of HIV drugs we used are in the range of those detected in the sera of HIV-infected patients under HAART (17Balani S.K. Woolf E.J. Hoagland V.L. Sturgill M.G. Deutsch P.J. Yeh K.C.

Antiviral Ther. 2004; 9: 423-429PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, HIV drugs accumulated at different levels during adipocyte development. Whereas RTV and LPV accumulated at similar levels (4.1 ± 0.3 and 5.4 ± 0.8 nmol/106 cells, respectively), the intracellular level of NVP was much lower (0.7 ± 0.03 nmol/106 cells) despite a higher extracellular concentration. Two concentrations of RTV were used, and as shown in Fig. 1A, the intracellular accumulation was dose-dependent. The involvement of the multi-drug resistance (MDR) and MDR-associated protein transporters in preadipocyte accumulation of RTV has been investigated. The addition of 20 μm reserpin, a pharmacological inhibitor of the MDR1 and of MDR-associated protein transporter 1, for 3 h led to a higher accumulation of RTV (12 ± 0.8 nmol/106 cell compared with 4.1 ± 0.3 nmol/106 cell in the absence of reserpin, n = 3). This result strongly suggested that accumulation of the drugs into preadipose cells could be regulated via MDR transporters. We have previously shown that the antibodies used in the ELISAs are specific for the native form of the drugs and do not recognize metabolic forms (15Azoulay S. Nevers M.C. Creminon C. Heripret L. Durant J. Dellamonica P. Grassi J. Guedj R. Duval D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Akeb F. Ferrua B. Creminon C. Roptin C. Grassi J. Nevers M.C. Guedj R. Garraffo R. Duval D. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, HPLC-UV analysis indicated that the PIs stored into adipose cells displayed a chemical profile identical to the native form of the PIs (not shown). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that, even if we could not rule out the presence of minor oxidized or chemically modified forms of the drugs, preadipocytes and adipocytes stored the native form of the HIV drugs. The generation of fluorescent APV (APV-dansyl) and IDV (IDV-MANT) using a straightforward chemical synthesis then allowed us to investigate their apparent uptake and subcellular localization in live cells imaged by time-lapse digital fluorescence microscopy. APV-dansyl was detected in undifferentiated and in fully differentiated hMADS cells within 10 min following the addition to the culture medium and became distributed throughout the cytoplasm within 30 min (Fig. 1B). We treated images by deconvolution to analyze more precisely the intracellular localization of both labeled PIs after a 1-h incubation in living adipocytes (Fig. 1C). In differentiated hMADS cells, APV-dansyl accumulated at a high rate into lipid droplets. In contrast, IDV-MANT accumulated more outside the lipid droplets.Fig. 1Accumulation and subcellular localization of HIV drugs in human adipocytes. A, hMADs cells were induced to undergo differentiation into adipocytes in the presence of indicated drugs, and ELISAs were performed at the indicated time points. Data are means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. B, time-lapse digital fluorescence microscopy was performed on preadipocytes and adipocytes derived from hMADS cells.

We have analyzed the effects of chronic addition of pharmacological concentrations of HIV drugs on differentiating hMADS cells. With the exception of nelfinavir (4 μg/ml), no cytotoxicity of HIV drugs was observed at the used concentrations. The induction of adipocyte differentiation of hMADS cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml IDV, APV, or NVP did not modify the differentiation process as indicated by the neutral lipid accumulation (data not shown) and the G3PDH activities, a marker of mature adipocytes, determined 10 days after the addition of the drugs (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when induced to differentiate in the presence of SQV (4 μg/ml) or LPV (10 μg/ml), the inhibition of G3PDH activity was observed. RTV (10 μg/ml) elicited the highest inhibitory effect on G3PDH activity, and RTV-treated human adipocytes displayed a fibroblast-like morphology and accumulated less cytoplasmic triacylglycerol droplets (Fig. 2B). These data indicated that, when used in the range of concentrations determined in serum of HIV-infected patients under HAART, some HIV drugs but not all could inhibit adipocyte differentiation of precursor cells.Fig. 2Effects of HIV drugs on differentiating hMADS cells. A, undifferentiated cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of 10 μg/ml IDV, RTV, LPV, APV, and NVP or 4 μg/ml SQV. G3PDH activities were determined 10 days after treatment. Data are reported by taking as 100% the G3PDH activity of untreated cells Me2SO (DMSO). The means ± S.D. are representative data from three independent experiments. Significant differences (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test) between control (Me2SO) and treated cells are denoted by asterisk. B, photo-micrographic records of hMADS cells induced to undergo differentiation for 10 days in the presence of 0.1% Me2SO or 14 μm RTV.

The bar represents 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of PIs on Human Adipocytes Derived from hMADS Cells—We studied the effects of PIs on fully differentiated adipocytes at day 13 after induction of adipogenesis. hMADS cell-derived adipocytes were treated for 5 days with different PIs, and the expression of both PPARγ and various adipocytokines was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3A, exposure to RTV but not to SQV, LPV, IDV, or APV inhibited PPARγ expression in mature adipocytes. TNFα was undetectable in untreated hMADS adipocytes. However, the expression of TNFα was reproducibly induced after treatment with RTV (Fig. 3B) and, at a less extent, after treatment with LPV and APV. The expression profile of leptin, IL6, and adiponectin has been investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in the Table I, a 5-day exposure of adipocytes to RTV decreased adiponectin expression and induced both leptin and IL6 gene expression. APV and LPV did not display any significant effect on adiponectin and IL6 expression. In contrast, leptin expression was dramatically induced upon the addition of APV. These data point out that PIs have a direct effect in human adipocytes on the expression of cytokines that are tightly associated with the development of insulin resistance. Fig. 4 summarizes the effects of the various HIV drugs on adipocyte differentiation of precursor cells and on the alteration of gene expression in adipocytes.Table IPls alter expression of adipocytokines in human cultured adipocytes Adipocytes derived from hMADS cells were treated with 10 μg/ml indicated Pls or with 0.1% Me2SO as negative control for 5 days as indicated in Fig. 3.

ND, not determined. Lipid droplets are open circles, and the nucleus is in black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have shown that APV and IDV, which belong to the same class of drugs, displayed different intracellular localization. It is well documented that, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the intracellular accumulation of HIV drugs depends of several parameters such as their chemical structures, their half-lives, or their affinity to drug transporters. Intracellular sequestration due to protein binding or ion trapping has also been suggested (21Koo S.H. Hoggard P.G. Williams I. Meaden E.R. Newton P. Wilkins E.G. Smith A. Tjia J.F. Lloyd J. Jones K. Beeching N. Carey P. Peters B. Back D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3228-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). APV was stored preferentially into lipid droplets, whereas IDV accumulated outside the lipid droplets. The lipophilic properties of APV and IDV could be responsible for their differential distribution, but active mechanisms cannot be ruled out. This observation indicates that adipose tissues can store PIs in treated patients. The capacity of adipocytes to mobilize and to release PIs remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note that the two labeled PIs were not detected into the nucleus. Even if we cannot exclude a role of the fluorophore on the localization of the drugs, these results indicate that nuclear proteins are not direct targets of PIs. This hypothesis does not exclude the effects of PIs in the cytoplasm on maturation of nuclear proteins. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that HIV drugs could have intracellular targets and direct effects on the development of human adipose cells.Some HIV drugs, but not all, could inhibit differentiation of precursor cells isolated from human adipose tissue. Similar conclusions have been previously reported with precursor cells isolated from human bone marrow (22Jain R.G. Lenhard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19247-19250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In regard to the lipodystrophy associated with the use of PI, alternative therapies substituting NNRTIs (efavirenz or nevirapine) for protease inhibitors have been proposed (23Barreiro P. Soriano V. Blanco F. de la Casimiro C. Cruz J.J. Gonzalez-Lahoz J. AIDS. 2000; 14: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). NNRTIs represent a promising approach to combine antiviral efficiency and limited adverse effects. However, recent papers have reported that efavirenz could accumulate in adipose tissue (24Dupin N. Buffet M. Marcelin A.G. Lamotte C. Gorin I. Ait-Arkoub Z. Treluyer J.M. Bui P. Calvez V. Peytavin G. AIDS. 2002; 16: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and inhibit triacylglycerol accumulation in mouse preadipose clonal lines (25El Hadri K. Glorian M. Monsempes C. Dieudonne M.N.

We show in this paper that, despite a high extracellular concentration of nevirapine, the intracellular accumulation of this NNRTI was low compared with PIs. More interestingly, nevirapine did not interfere with lipid accumulation during adipocyte development of hMADS cells.hMADS cells accumulated less triacylglycerol droplets when exposed to RTV in agreement with its inhibitory effects previously reported on adipocyte differentiation of various mouse preadipocyte clonal lines (3Vernochet C.

https://openalex.org/W2057248168,"The eukaryotic translation factor 4A (eIF4A) is a member of DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase family, a diverse group of proteins that couples ATP hydrolysis to RNA binding and duplex separation. eIF4A participates in the initiation of translation by unwinding secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNAs and facilitating scanning by the 40 S ribosomal subunit for the initiation codon. eIF4A alone has only weak ATPase and helicase activities, but these are stimulated by eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4H. eIF4G has two eIF4A-binding sites, one in the central domain (cpC3) and one in the COOH-terminal domain (cpC2). In the current work, we demonstrate that these two eIF4G domains have different effects on the RNA-stimulated ATPase activity of eIF4A. cpC3 stimulates ATP-hydrolytic efficiency by about 40-fold through two mechanisms: lowering KmRNA by 10-fold and raising kcat by 4-fold. cpC3 also stimulates RNA cross-linking to eIF4A in an ATP-independent manner. Studies with eIF4G and eIF4A variants suggest a model by which cpC3 alters the conformation of the catalytic site to favor RNA binding. cpC2 does not stimulate ATPase activity and furthermore increases both KmATP (at saturating RNA concentrations) and KmRNA (at subsaturating ATP concentrations). Both cpC3 and cpC2 directly interact with the NH2-terminal domain of eIF4A, which possesses conserved ATP- and oligonucleotide-binding motifs, but not with the COOH-terminal domain.

Both cpC3 and cpC2 directly interact with the NH2-terminal domain of eIF4A, which possesses conserved ATP- and oligonucleotide-binding motifs, but not with the COOH-terminal domain. Initiation of translation is the most studied step for regulation of protein synthesis (1Gingras A-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

It involves the sequential assembly of initiation complex (43, 48, and 80 S), each step catalyzed by a different class of initiation factors (eIF1–eIF6) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; aa, amino acid residue; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.

The rate-limiting step under normal conditions (i.e. absence of viral infection, amino acid starvation, chemical poisoning, etc.) is the recruitment of mRNA to the 43 S complex to form the 48 S complex, which is catalyzed by the eIF4 class of factors. The mammalian eIF4 proteins consist of eIF4A, a 46-kDa ATP-dependent RNA helicase; eIF4B, an 80-kDa protein that stimulates the processivity of eIF4A; eIF4H, a 25-kDa protein that enhances the stimulatory activity of eIF4B; eIF4E, a 25-kDa cap-binding protein; and eIF4G, a 185-kDa protein that binds most factors involved in mRNA recruitment and anchors them to the 40 S subunit through binding to eIF3. These factors are required both to recognize mRNA and to unwind secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated region, which is necessary for 48 S initiation complex formation and scanning for the initiation codon. Helicases unwind duplex DNA or RNA at the expense of energy derived from NTP hydrolysis (4Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons have classified the helicases into three superfamilies, SFI, SFII, and SFIII (5Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). There are striking similarities in the tertiary structure of two core domains called 1A and 2A (6Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Subramanya H. Bird L. Brannigan J. Wigley D. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These domains have homology with each other and also with the central region of the RecA protein (8Story R. Weber I. Steitz T. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Domain 1A contains motifs I, Ia, Ic, II, and III, whereas domain 2A contains motifs IV, V, and VI. The most highly conserved motifs are Walker A and B, which possess sequences characteristic of ATPases (9Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gray N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). The ATP-binding site is situated in a cleft between domains 1A and 2A. The bound NTP acts as a cross-bridge pulling NH2- and COOH-terminal domains closer together. Conserved amino acid residues in both domains lining the active site cleft interact with the metal ion and the γ-phosphate group of the bound NTP, thus stabilizing the transition state. Binding and hydrolysis of ATP at this site affect the relative positions of domains 1A and 2A. eIF4A is a bidirectional ATP-dependent helicase (10Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E.

A complex containing eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G can be isolated by high salt treatment of mammalian ribosomes and is termed eIF4F (24Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol.

In particular, we wished to determine whether both of the eIF4A-binding sites on eIF4G could affect ATPase activity. Furthermore, we examined the effect of eIF4G on the various steps in the catalytic cycle of RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Finally, we sought to determine the functional domains of eIF4A that bind eIF4G. Materials—m7GTP-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, and a Mono Q HR 5/5 column were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Econo-Pac® 10 DG disposable chromatography columns and the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit were obtained from Bio-Rad. RNasin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).

Pestova (SUNY Downstate, Brooklyn, NY). pET-4A(1–109) was constructed by inserting a restriction fragment from BamHI/XhoI digestion of pET(His6-eIF4A) between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pET-28b (Novagen). pET-4A(110–294) was constructed by inserting a restriction fragment from XhoI digestion of pET(His6-eIF4A) between the XhoI sites of pET-28a. The eIF4A sequences in these plasmids were verified at the Iowa State University facility. RNA Synthesis and Purification—EMCV RNA was transcribed in vitro from PstI-linearized pTE1 using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP as described previously (43Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41369-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts (600,000 cpm/pmol) were purified using NucTrap Prob purification columns. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol prior to storage at –80 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The S-tagged eIF4G fragments S-eIF4G(653–1600), S-eIF4G(653–1118), S-eIF4G-(917–1118), and S-eIF4G(1118–1600), and the T7-tagged eIF4G fragment T7-eIF4G(737–989), were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described previously (34Korneeva N.L.

In the case of S-eIF4G(653–1600), S-eIF4G(653–1118), and T7-eIF4G(737–989), it was necessary to perform an additional purification step on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B. The eluate from Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was diluted with an equal volume of buffer A0 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5) to reduce the salt concentration and then applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with the same buffer except containing 100 mm KCl (buffer A100). (The convention of specifying the KCl concentration in mm with a subscript is used throughout for all buffers). The protein was eluted from the resin with buffer A400. Prior to performing binding or ATPase assays, purified eIF4G fragments were passed over desalting Econo-Pac® 10 DG columns to replace the buffer with buffer B100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5). After buffer exchange, the concentrations of recombinant proteins were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. eIF4A, eIF4A(R362Q), eIF4A(1–109), and eIF4A(110–294) were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography as described for eIF4G. eIF4A and eIF4A(R362Q) were further purified by Mono Q chromatography. Prior to ATPase assays, eIF4A samples were diluted with buffer B0 to adjust the final KCl concentration to 100 mm. RNA Cross-linking—eIF4G fragments with or without eIF4A were incubated in the presence of 32P-labeled EMCV RNA. Reactions (15 μl) containing various recombinant eIF4G fragments (1 μm), various forms of eIF4A (1 μm), 32P-labeled RNA (0.3 μm), RNasin (10 units), buffer B100, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm spermidine, and 1 mm ATP were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were irradiated on ice in a GS Gene Linker UV chamber (Bio-Rad) for 999 s. Then reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of RNase A (25 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (0.5 units/μl). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager detection (Storm; Amersham Biosciences). Limited Proteolysis—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 10 μm recombinant eIF4A and 500 nm trypsin in buffer B100 were incubated at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protease. Aliquots (5 μl) were removed at various times and made 1 μm in trypsin inhibitor where indicated, and the reaction was quenched in 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) with protein detection by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of eIF4A Fragments—Mass spectrometric analysis was performed in the LSUHSC-S Research Core Facility on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO Biospectrometry work station. Peptides were prepared for MALDI-TOF MS after proteolytic digestion by extraction from gel pieces twice with 50-μl portions of 50% acetonitrile and 5.0% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides in the extract were dried, dissolved in 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and purified on a ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). They were eluted with 2 μl of 0.01 mg/ml solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and spotted on a MALDI plate. Data were summed over 50–100 acquisitions in delayed extraction mode. Data analysis was performed using the Data Explorer software, version 3.5–4.0. Spectra were subjected to algorithms for baseline correction and noise removal at two S.D. values. Theoretical masses were determined using the Peptide Mass tool at the ExPASy Proteomics site on the World Wide Web (www.expasy.org/tools/). Peaks seen in both the sample of interest and also in a blank gel treated identically were eliminated from further consideration. We considered that peptides matched if their masses were within 1 Da for the range 800–10,000 Da. Immunologic Procedures—Mouse monoclonal anti-eIF4A antibody was a gift from Dr. Hans Trachsel (Bern, Switzerland). Anti-T7 antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Novagen. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred after SDS-PAGE to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the primary anti-eIF4A antibody in 5% milk proteins in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min with buffer C, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) at a dilution of 1:2000 in 5% milk proteins in buffer C. Blots were developed with the nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate color development reagents (Promega, Madison, WI). eIF4A(1–109) and eIF4A(110–294) were identified by incubating membrane with anti-T7 antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase at 1:3000 dilution. Blots were developed as described for eIF4A Western blots. Protein Binding Assays on S-Protein-Agarose—Binding of S-eIF4G fragments with eIF4A fragments was performed using S-Protein-agarose. After 40 min of preincubation of S-eIF4G fragments with eIF4A on ice, proteins were mixed with at least a 10-fold molar excess of S-Protein-agarose and incubated for 1 h in buffer B150 containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. The resin was washed four times with 200-μl aliquots of buffer B150. Proteins were eluted in SDS-electrophoresis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with detection by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blotting. ATPase Assays—ADP and ATP were titrated to pH 7.0 with KOH and were added to reactions in stoichiometric amounts with MgCl2. Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10–1000 μm ATP·Mg2+, 2–600 μm poly(A), and 0.5–2 μm eIF4A. The highest concentrations of ATP are comparable with the concentration of ATP in mammalian cells (45Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Poly(A) was used because this homopolymer was found to be the most stimulatory for ATPase activation in previous studies (22Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, reactions also contained eIF4F, eIF4G fragments, an eIF4A variant, or ADP, as noted in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and 2-μl aliquots were quenched with an equal volume of 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets using 0.8 m LiCl, 0.8 m acetic acid. Sheets were air-dried, cut, and analyzed by Cherenkov radiation in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. 32Pi was calculated as a fraction of total radioactivity (32Pi + [32P]ATP). The value of Pi in reactions without enzyme was subtracted as background (usually about 1%). Kinetic Measurements—Steady-state ATPase assays were performed using an excess of ATP and RNA (i.e. poly(A)) over enzyme. Reactions were followed only during the linear range of time (generally 10–15 min). Values for Pi release were used to determine kinetic constants only if <20% of the ATP was hydrolyzed at subsaturating ATP concentrations and <10% at saturating ATP concentrations. In the current study, the term subsaturating substrate concentrations is defined as being ≤0.2 × Km. The term saturating substrate concentrations is defined as being ≥4 × K ATPm, ≥10 × K RNAm for eIF4A + cpC3 and for eIF4A + cpC, and ≥3 × K RNAm for eIF4A + cpC2. Under these conditions, eIF4A is in either the unliganded form (at subsaturating substrate concentrations) or in the fully liganded form (at saturating substrate concentrations). When eIF4A is present in the unliganded form, the rate is given by the equation v=(k3[E0][RNA][ATP]/KmRNAKm′ATP)/(1+([RNA]/KmRNA)), where Km′ indicates the Km was measured at saturating concentrations of the other substrate. In this situation, a plot of v versus [RNA] can be fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation. A detailed derivation can be found in Ref. 46Wells T.N. Knill-Jones J.W. Gray T.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5151-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. In the case of saturating substrate concentrations, the dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the concentration of RNA (or ATP) follows classical pseudofirst order kinetics, allowing the data to be fit to a Michaelis-Menten equation. The K ATPm for reactions with free enzyme (E) or with the E·RNA complex were determined by measuring ATP hydrolysis with various concentrations of ATP at either subsaturating or saturating concentrations of RNA. Reciprocal experiments were performed to measure K RNAm at subsaturating or saturating concentrations of ATP. Inhibition constants (Ki) for ADP were measured at 10 μm ATP. Each ATPase assay was repeated at least three times. Kinetic analysis was performed using KaleidaGraph software (version 3.06; Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with iterative least squares minimizations. Effect of eIF4G Domains on ATPase Activity of eIF4A—eIF4F stimulates the RNA-activated ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activities of eIF4A (47Rogers G. Komar A. Merrick W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 307-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4F consists of three proteins, eIF4G, eIF4E, and eIF4A, that co-purify as a complex after high salt treatment of polyribosomes (24Grifo J.A.

However, there are two distinct eIF4A-binding sites in eIF4G (32Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Serine 10 is the major phosphorylation site of p27, and its phosphorylation has been shown to affect the stability and nuclear export of p27 at the G0-G1 transition in transfected cultured cells. To investigate the physiological relevance of p27 phosphorylation on Ser10, we generated p27 “knock-in” mice that harbor an S10A mutation in this protein. Mice homozygous for the mutation (p27S10A/S10A mice) were normal in body size, but the abundance of p27 was decreased in many organs, including brain, thymus, spleen, and testis. The stability of p27 in G0 phase was markedly reduced in lymphocytes of p27S10A/S10A mice compared with that in wild-type cells, whereas p27 stability in S phase was similar in cells of the two genotypes. The degradation of p27 in cells of the mutant mice at G0 phase was prevented by a proteasome inhibitor. These data indicate that the physiological role of p27 phosphorylation on Ser10 is to stabilize the protein in G0 phase. Unexpectedly, the nuclear export of p27 at the G0-G1 transition occurred normally in p27S10A/S10A mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser10 is dispensable for this process.

Progression of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells is regulated by a series of protein complexes composed of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, CDK inhibitor; ES, embryonic stem; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. the activity of which is in turn controlled by a group of CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (1Morgan D.O.

Among these CKIs, p27 plays a pivotal role in the control of cell proliferation (3Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

In normal cells, the amount of p27 is high during the G0 phase of the cell cycle, but it decreases rapidly upon the mitogen-induced reentry of cells into G1 phase (5Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M.

Moreover, we and others have shown that mice with a homozygous deletion of the p27 gene (p27) are larger than normal mice and exhibit both multiple organ hyperplasia and a predisposition to the development of spontaneous and radiation- or chemical-induced tumors (8Fero M.L.

These observations support the notion that p27 is a key determinant of both body size and organ size as a result of its role in the control of cell proliferation and that the loss of p27 function may lead to carcinogenesis. Indeed, many studies have shown that the expression of p27 is deregulated in various human cancers (12Tsihlias J. Kapusta L. Slingerland J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 401-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The abundance of p27 is thought to be controlled by multiple mechanisms that operate at the level of the synthesis (transcription and translation) (13Hengst L. Reed S.I.

Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The proteolysis of p27 is mediated predominantly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Sal DelG. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The protein is phosphorylated on Thr187 by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex (18Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 19Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of this residue is required for binding of p27 to Skp2, an F-box protein that is thought to function as the receptor component of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex; such binding then results in the ubiquitylation and degradation of p27 (20Carrano A.C.

Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We have shown that the degradation of p27 at the G0-G1 transition is independent of Skp2, however, and occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas the Skp2- and Thr187 phosphorylation-dependent degradation of p27 occurs at S and G2 phases in the nucleus (26Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48937-48943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the nuclear export of p27 may be critical for its down-regulation early during reentry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle. We previously identified Ser10 as the major phosphorylation site of p27, showing that it accounts for ∼70% of the total phosphorylation of this protein; the extent of phosphorylation at this site was 75 times that at Thr187 (27Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The extent of Ser10 phosphorylation is markedly increased in cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle compared with that apparent for cells in S or M phase. Mutational analysis suggested that phosphorylation of Ser10, like that of Thr187, contributes to regulation of p27 stability. The p27 protein is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at the G0-G1 transition of the cell cycle. We and others showed that substitution of Ser10 with Ala (S10A) markedly reduced the extent of p27 export from the nucleus at the G0-G1 transition. Furthermore, phosphorylation on Ser10 is required for the binding of p27 to CRM1, a carrier protein for nuclear export (28Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 29Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that phosphorylation on Ser10 is essential for nuclear export of p27. Residues 32–45 of p27 constitute a putative nuclear export sequence, the mutation of which reduces both the interaction of p27 with CRM1 as well as the nuclear export and degradation of p27 (30Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Human kinase-interacting stathmin has been identified as a nuclear serine-threonine kinase that binds to the COOH-terminal region of p27 and phosphorylates p27 on Ser10 both in vitro and in vivo, thereby promoting its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (31Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Most studies that have evaluated the effect of Ser10 phosphorylation on p27 function have been based on overexpression of exogenous mutant proteins in cultured cell lines. Under such conditions, however, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that physiologically irrelevant levels of p27 inhibit cell cycle progression, resulting in apparent inhibition of the nuclear export of p27. It is therefore important that the effects of mutant proteins expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter of p27 be examined. To this end, we have adopted a “knock-in” strategy to express the S10A mutant of p27 in mice. We now show that the stability of the mutant protein is markedly reduced in certain cell types of p27S10A/S10A mice at G0 phase. Unexpectedly, the export of p27 from the nucleus at the G0-G1 transition appeared to be unaffected by the S10A mutation. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser10 is important for p27 stability in G0 phase but is not required for nuclear export of this CKI at the G0-G1 transition. Generation of p27S10A/S10A Knock-in Mice—We isolated p27 from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library as described previously (10Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K-I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The codon for Ser10 in exon 1 was mutated to an alanine codon (GGG AGC → GGC GCC) to create the p27S10A allele. The targeting vector was constructed by insertion of a loxP-flanked PGK-neo-poly(A) cassette into the HindIII site of intron 1 of p27 and ligation of a PGK-TK-poly(A) cassette at the 5′ end of the insert (Fig. 1A). The maintenance, transfection, and selection of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were performed as described (10Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K-I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The loxP-flanked PGK-neo-poly(A) cassette was deleted in transfected ES cells by infection with an adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase. For detection of mutated ES clones, genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and subjected to Southern hybridization with a 0.9-kb NdeI-EcoRI probe (Fig. 1A). The mutant ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and the resulting male chimeras were mated with female C57BL/6 mice. Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant animals. All mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility. Immunoblot Analysis—Tissues from p27+/+ or p27S10A/S10A mice were homogenized in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, as well as antipain, pepstatin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, each at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The resulting homogenates as well as cultured primary lymphocytes or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented as for the homogenization buffer. Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C; after determination of its protein concentration with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the resulting supernatant (50 μg of protein) of each lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a Hybond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies (1 μg/ml) to p27 (Transduction Laboratories) or to glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (Transduction Laboratories). A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for p27 phosphorylated on Ser10 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) could not be used because it reacted with p27(S10A) (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Immune complexes were detected with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Band intensity was measured with an LAS-1000 chemiluminescence imager (FujiFilm). Cell Culture—Single-cell suspensions of lymphocytes were prepared from the lymph nodes of p27+/+ or p27S10A/S10A mice and cultured (1.0 × 107 cells in 5 ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; the cells were exposed to 10 nm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (Sigma), 300 nm ionomycin (Sigma), 10 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), as indicated. Primary MEFs were isolated on embryonic day 13.5 and cultured as described (10Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K-I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). For analysis of synchronized cells, MEFs were arrested at G0 phase by serum deprivation (incubation in medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum) for 96 h; they were then cultured for the indicated times in medium containing 20% serum. Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Lymphocytes cultured as described above were exposed to 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) for 30 min, harvested, fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at –20 °C, and denatured for 30 min at room temperature in 2 m HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After neutralization with borax buffer (pH 8.5), the cells were subjected to dual color staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to BrdUrd (Becton Dickinson) and propidium iodide (5 μg/ml). They were then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Two-dimensional PAGE—Lymphocytes, MEFs, and tissues were lysed in a solution containing 8 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 65 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Ampholine (pH 3.5–9.5) (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates containing 50–150 μg of protein were applied to an Immobiline DryStrip (13 cm, pH 4–7) (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to isoelectric focusing for 12 h at 0 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and 2 h at 8000 V. The DryStrip was then equilibrated with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 65 mm dithiothreitol before the separated proteins were resolved in the second dimension by standard PAGE on an 11% gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis. 32P and 35S Labeling of p27 in Vivo—Freshly isolated lymphocytes were incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 mCi/ml for 8 h at 37 °C in the same medium with or without 10 nm PDBu and 300 nm ionomycin. Alternatively, the cells were incubated for 8 h with or without PDBu and ionomycin and labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 80 mCi/ml for the final 1 h. After extensive washing with radioisotope-free medium, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to p27. The resulting precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography with a BAS-2000 image analyzer (FujiFilm). Immunofluorescence Analysis of p27 Expression—MEFs were grown on glass coverslips and subjected to immunofluorescence staining as described previously (32Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Endogenous p27 was stained with a monoclonal antibody to p27 (Transduction Laboratories), and immune complexes were detected with Alexa488-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 dye. Lymphocytes were plated on glass coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine (200 μg/ml) and were then subjected to immunofluorescence staining as described previously (32Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Endogenous p27 was stained with polyclonal antibodies to p27 (C-19 and N-20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; Ab-2 from Neomarkers), and immune complexes were detected with Alexa488-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes). Cell nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained with a Radiance2000 microscope (Bio-Rad). Introduction of an S10A Mutation into Mouse p27—We designed a targeting construct to replace the wild-type p27 allele with an allele in which the codon for Ser10 was changed to an alanine codon (Fig. 1A). The linearized targeting vector was introduced into mouse ES cells by electroporation, and transfectants selected on the basis of their ability to grow in the presence of both G418 and gancyclovir were screened for homologous recombination events by the polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). The loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette was then deleted by infection of selected ES cells with an adenovirus vector encoding Cre recombinase, after which the mutant p27 allele was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). The targeted ES cells were then injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and chimeric male mice that transmitted the mutant allele in the germ line were obtained. Heterozygotes (p27+/S10A) were bred to produce p27S10A/S10A mice, which were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1B). Phenotype of p27S10A/S10A Knock-in Mice—Heterozygote matings yielded wild-type (p27+/+), heterozygous (p27+/S10A), and homozygous mutant (p27S10A/S10A) offspring in a ratio similar to that expected for Mendelian inheritance, indicative of no substantial embryonic lethality of the mutant allele. We have previously shown that p27–/– mice are larger than normal mice and exhibit multiple organ hyperplasia (10Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K-I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). In contrast, the body size (Fig. 1C) and organ size (data not shown) of p27S10A/S10A mice appeared normal. The increase in body weight with age also did not differ markedly among p27+/+, p27+/S10A, and p27S10A/S10A mice (Fig. 1D). This difference in phenotype between p27–/– and p27S10A/S10A mice suggests that the S10A mutant of p27 is not functionally null. Consistent with this notion, we previously showed that mutation of Ser10 in p27 does not affect the CDK-inhibitory function of this protein (27Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We next examined the abundance of p27 in various organs by immunoblot analysis. The amount of p27(S10A) was reduced in the brain, thymus, spleen, and testis of p27S10A/S10A mice compared with that of the wild-type protein in p27+/+ animals, whereas the expression of p27 in liver, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle was not affected by the mutation (Fig. 2, A and B). For all organs examined, the abundance of p27 mRNA was similar in p27S10A/S10A and p27+/+ mice (data not shown). Two-dimensional PAGE revealed that the proportion of p27 molecules that were phosphorylated in various organs of wild-type mice varied from 30 to 70% (Fig. 2C) and was not correlated with the extent of p27 down-regulation apparent in the corresponding organs of p27S10A/S10A mice. No signal corresponding to phosphorylated p27 was detected in thymus or lung of p27S10A/S10A mice (Fig. 2C), indicating that the signal observed in wild-type animals was attributable to phosphorylation of p27 on Ser10. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser10 affects the abundance of p27 in some, but not all, organs. Cell Cycle-dependent Phosphorylation of p27 on Ser10 in Primary Lymphocytes—We have previously shown that p27 is phosphorylated on Ser10 at G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle in cultured HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells, whereas the extent of this phosphorylation is markedly reduced in cells in S and M phases (27Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We examined the phosphorylation status of Ser10 of p27 in primary lymphocytes isolated from wild-type mice. Almost all mature lymphocytes are in the G0 phase in the absence of mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of the cells with the combination of PDBu and ionomycin for 12 h (G1 phase) or 24 h (S phase) resulted in a substantial reduction in the abundance of p27 (Fig. 3B). We evaluated the relative amounts of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of p27 in lymphocytes and MEFs by two-dimensional PAGE (Fig. 3, C and D). Similar to our previous observations with HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells (27Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), about half of p27 molecules were phosphorylated in wild-type lymphocytes at G0 phase, whereas no such phosphorylation was detected in p27S10A/S10A lymphocytes (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that most phosphorylation of p27 at G0 phase is attributable to Ser10. Only ∼8% of p27 molecules were phosphorylated in wild-type lymphocytes at S phase, suggesting that the phosphorylated molecules present in G0 phase had been dephosphorylated or selectively degraded. We obtained similar results with MEFs (Fig. 3D). The detection of marked phosphorylation of p27 on Ser10 at G0 phase does not necessarily indicate that p27 undergoes phosphorylation during G0 phase. It might become phosphorylated before the entry of cells into G0 phase. To test this hypothesis, we labeled lymphocytes freshly isolated from wild-type or p27S10A/S10A mice with [32P]orthophosphate for 8 h in the absence or presence of mitogenic stimulation (Fig. 3E). In the absence of stimulation (G0 phase), neither wild-type nor p27S10A/S10A cells incorporated [32P]orthophosphate into p27. In contrast, p27 present in both types of cells was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in response to mitogenic stimulation, although the extent of labeling was greater for wild-type cells than for p27S10A/S10A cells. To exclude the possibility that the resting lymphocytes were metabolicallly inactive, the cells from wild-type mice were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. Lymphocytes in G0 or G1 phases incorporated the radiolabeled amino acids to similar extents. These data suggest that p27 undergoes phosphorylation on Ser10 not during G0 phase but during the cell cycle before entry of cells into G0 phase. Destabilization of p27 by the S10A Mutation Specifically at G0 Phase—The predominance of the Ser10-phosphorylated form of p27 in G0 phase suggested that phosphorylation of this residue might be responsible for the stabilization of p27 apparent in quiescent cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured, as described previously (33Malek N.P. Sundberg H. McGrew S. Nakayama K. Kyriakidis T.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the half-life of p27 in lymphocytes isolated from wild-type or p27S10A/S10A mice. In G0 phase, whereas wild-type p27 was stable, p27(S10A) was markedly unstable (Fig. 4A). In contrast, wild-type p27 and p27(S10A) were degraded at similar rates in S-phase cells (Fig. 4B). Treatment of p27S10A/S10A lymphocytes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely prevented the degradation of p27(S10A) at G0 phase (Fig. 4C), suggesting that this proteolysis is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These data indicate that phosphorylation of Ser10 contributes to the stabilization of p27 apparent during G0 phase. Degradation of p27 at G0-G1 Independent of Ser10Phosphorylation—p27 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway at the G0-G1 transition. This process is largely independent both of SCFSkp2 and of phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187 (26Hara T. Kamura T. Nakayama K. Oshikawa K. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K-I. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 413: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We examined whether the degradation of p27 at the G0-G1 transition is dependent on phosphorylation of Ser10. Both wild-type and p27S10A/S10A lymphocytes exhibited similar kinetics of p27 down-regulation at the G0-G1 transition, although the original abundance of p27(S10A) was lower than that of wild-type p27 at G0 phase (Fig. 5A). The timing of entry of cells into S phase after mitogenic stimulation also did not differ substantially between wild-type and p27S10A/S10A lymphocytes (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of p27 on Ser10 is not required for the degradation of p27 at the G0-G1 transition. Nuclear Export of p27 in p27S10A/S10A Cells—We and others previously showed that the S10A mutation reduced the efficiency of nuclear export of p27 (28Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L.

Here we report that Rea1 is required for maturation and nuclear export of the pre-60 S subunit. Rea1 exhibits a predominantly nucleoplasmic localization and is present in a late pre-60 S particle together with members of the Rix1 complex. To study the role of Rea1 in ribosome biogenesis, we generated a repressible GAL::REA1 strain and temperature-sensitive rea1 alleles. In vivo depletion of Rea1 results in the significant reduction of mature 60 S subunits concomitant with defects in pre-rRNA processing and late pre-60 S ribosome stability following ITS2 cleavage and prior to the generation of mature 5.8 S rRNA. Strains depleted of the components of the Rix1 complex (Rix1, Ipi1, and Ipi3) showed similar defects. Using an in vivo 60 S subunit export assay, a strong accumulation of the large subunit reporter Rpl25-GFP (green fluorescent protein) in the nucleus and at the nuclear periphery was seen in rea1 mutants at restrictive conditions.

The synthesis of ribosomes is one of the major and most energy-consuming processes in the cell. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome biogenesis begins in the nucleolus with the transcription of two rRNA precursors, the 35 S and the pre-5 S RNA, by RNA polymerases I and III, respectively. The 35 S pre-rRNA contains the sequences for the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs, two external transcribed spacers (ETS) 1The abbreviations used are: ETS, external transcribed spacer; ITS, internal transcribed spacer; AAA, ATPases associated with different activities; CaM, calmodulin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MIDAS, metal ion dependant adhesion signal; sl, synthetic lethal; ts, temperature-sensitive strain; td, temperature-sensitive degron mutant; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HA, hemagglutinin. and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS). During the maturation process, the pre-rRNA has to undergo a number of modifications and is subjected to cleavages and trimming events. At least 170 accessory proteins including putative RNA helicases, endo- and exonucleases, and putative GTPases and AAA-ATPases as well as small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles are involved in the maturation of rRNA and its assembly into ribosomal subunits (1Kressler D.

Concomitant with rRNA processing, ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins are assembled on the pre-35 S rRNA, giving rise to a large 90 S pre-ribosomal particle (see Fig. 6B) (3Dragon F. Gallagher J.E.

The pre-40 S subunit is exported relatively rapidly to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes further processing. In contrast, the maturation of the large subunit continues in the nucleoplasm with recruitment of 60 S-specific biogenesis factors and further processing of the 27 S pre-rRNA. This includes the late cleavage and processing in the ITS2 region, which generates mature 5.8 S and 25 S rRNA. In the last few years, the maturation of 40 S and 60 S pre-ribosomes has been extensively analyzed by purification of pre-ribosomal particles (5Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D.

Interestingly, a large number of non-ribosomal proteins were identified in pre-60 S particles without an assigned function in RNA metabolism. In contrast to the pre-40 S particles, the nascent 60 S particles contain several putative GTPases and AAA-type ATPases (2Tschochner H. Hurt E.

Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To understand the events of ribosome biogenesis, we previously purified pre-ribosomal 60 S particles, which represent different maturation states from early nucleolar through cytoplasmic export (5Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). One of these, the late nucleoplasmic Rix1 particle, was selected for further study. The Rix1 particle is specifically enriched in the products of three uncharacterized open reading frames, YHR085w (Ipi1), YNL182c (Ipi3), and Rea1. Ipi1 has a single ARM repeat motif (12Mulder N.J.

In contrast, Rea1, which at 560 kDa is the largest protein identified in the yeast genome, contains several interesting domains and homologies. The N terminus of Rea1 possesses six AAA ATPase protomers and a C-terminal region containing the MIDAS (metal ion-dependant adhesion site) motif. Furthermore, sequence analysis has indicated relatedness to dynein (13Garbarino J.E. Gibbons I.R. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterize Rea1 and the Rix1 complex-containing pre-60 S particle. Our results show that Rea1 and the Rix1 complex exhibit similar subcellular localization and a similar late ITS2 rRNA processing defect. Although the Rix1 complex mutants accumulate the Rpl25-GFP reporter throughout the nucleoplasm, rea1 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants also show a later defect, with accumulation around the nuclear periphery. Our data demonstrate that Rea1 and the Rix1 complex play an essential role in maturation and nuclear export of nascent 60 S subunits from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Genomic integration of GFP (HIS3MX6 marker) as a C-terminal tag into yeast strains to create fusion proteins of Ipi1 (strain DS1-2b, MATa, ura3, trp1, his3, leu2) and Ipi3 (strain JBa, MATa trp1 ura3 ade2 ade3 leu2 his3) was performed as described (14Longtine M.S.

For construction of GAL1::GFP-REA1 and GAL1::HA-REA1 strains, GAL1::GFP and GAL1::HA cassettes containing the TRP1 marker were integrated 5′ upstream of the ATG start codon of REA1 (strain RS453). Integration of the GFP and HA tags was confirmed by Western blot. The REA1 shuffle strain was obtained by transforming plasmid pYCG-YLR106c (REA1) into the heterozygous strain BY4743 (rea1::kanMX4/REA1; derived from EUROSCARF) and selection of kanrURA+ haploid progeny after tetrad dissection.

The degron strains were grown at 23 °C in selective raffinose-glucose medium containing CuSO4 (permissive condition) before shift to galactose medium lacking CuSO4, first for 40 min at 23 °C for induction of Ubr1 expression and then to 37 °C to induce protein degradation of the mutant proteins (15Kanemaki M.

For construction of plasmid pLEU2-REA1, the LEU2 gene was amplified by PCR from plasmid pRS315 and used to replace the URA3 gene from plasmid pYCG-YLR106c. Generation of Rea1 ts Alleles—20 μg of pLEU2-REA1 plasmid DNA was incubated in 500 μl of 2 m hydroxylamine buffer for 20 h at 55 °C (20Amberg D.C. Fleischmann M. Stagljar I. Cole C.N. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The REA1 shuffle strain was transformed with the mutagenized plasmid, and cells were streaked on plates containing selection medium lacking leucine for 5 days at 23 °C in the dark. About 2000 single colonies were picked and streaked twice on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates at 23 °C before it was streaked on YPD plates at 23 and 37 °C. Two ts rea1 mutants (rea1-7 and rea1-21) were derived from this screen from which the mutagenized pLEU2-REA1 plasmids were recovered and reintroduced into the REA1 shuffle strain to verify the ts phenotype. The ts mutant rea1-21 was used for further characterization.

Normal buffer composition for purification was 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.75% Nonidet P-40. For MgCl2 salt elution, the Rix1-TAP purification was as described until after the beads were bound to calmodulin (CaM)-Sepharose. The beads were then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with LB-buffer plus 100 mm MgCl2, the eluate was collected, and the column was washed with 5 ml of LB + 100 mm MgCl2. After repeating the procedure with LB + 200 mm MgCl2, the sample was eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5).

Haploid progeny containing either the rix1-1 or the rix7-1 mutation and the rea1 deletion were transformed with pRS315 plasmids containing no insert or rea1-7 or rea1-21 mutant alleles.

High Salt Dissociates Rea1 and 60 S Subunits from the Rix1 Complex—We have previously reported the isolation and identification of 60 S pre-ribosomal particles, which are characterized by the presence of different ribosomal precursors depending on the maturation state of each of the particles (5Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 10Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The Rix1 particle represents a late intermediate in 60 S biogenesis and is highly enriched in the AAA-ATPase Rea1/Mdn1, as well as in two other non-ribosomal proteins, Yhr085/Ipi1 and Ynl182/Ipi3 (Fig. 1A; see also Ref. 5Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All three proteins are specifically associated with the Rix1 particle since they are largely absent both from earlier and from later pre-60 S ribosomes. The observation that Rix1, Ipi1, Ipi3, and Rea1 co-enrich during biochemical purification indicates that these four proteins could be organized in a complex attached to nascent 60 S subunits. To test this possibility, we affinity-purified Rix1-TAP by the tandem affinity purification method. However, instead of eluting the purified complexes from the final CaM-Sepharose with EGTA (as in Fig. 1A), we treated the beads with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 (Fig. 1B). The additional salt should release the interacting proteins that are not tightly bound with the affinity-purified bait proteins (26Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). When Rix1-TAP, which is immobilized on CaM beads, was incubated with a MgCl2 step gradient, Rea1 and 60 S subunit proteins were released with 100 mm salt (Fig. 1B, lane 1). However, Rix1, Ipi1, and Ipi3 remained bound under these conditions and were also resistant to 200 mm MgCl2, but they eluted by SDS-sample buffer (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Ipi1 reproducibly appeared substoichiometric after salt washing. It remains to be shown whether Ipi1 is present in lower amounts in the Rix1 complex or is not stained effectively by Coomassie Blue. Similar results were obtained for salt-treated Ipi3-TAP purification (data not shown). We conclude that Rix1, Ipi1, and Ipi3 form a salt-stable complex, to which Rea1 and the nascent 60 S subunit are less tightly attached. Recently, Krogan et al. (27Krogan N.J. Peng W.T. Cagney G.

Finally, since Rea1 was observed to be specifically enriched in the Rix1-TAP purification, we examined whether a synthetic lethal relationship exists between the rea1 ts mutants and the rix1-1 mutant (10Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any sl phenotype (data not shown). Rea1 and the Rix1 Complex Members Exhibit a Nucleoplasmic Location—Since Rea1 and the Rix1 complex are co-enriched, we wanted to know whether their subcellular distribution is also similar. Previously, we showed that Rix1 is localized in the nucleus (5Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Ipi1 and Ipi3 were genomically tagged with the GFP epitope at their C terminus, which ensures that protein expression remains under the control of the native promoter. Expression of the genomically N-terminally tagged GFP-Rea1 is under the GAL promoter due to difficulties in obtaining a fully functional C-terminal GFP fusion protein. 2K. Galani, unpublished data. After confirming that the GFP tagging had no effect on the growth rate of the strains (Supplemental Fig. 1), we examined the yeast cells under the fluorescence microscope. Similar to Rix1, Rea1, Ipi1, and Ipi3 were localized throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 2). We also expressed the DsRed-tagged nucleolar protein Nop1 in the GFP-tagged strains, and we did not observe nucleolar concentration for any of the proteins as this can be judged by the lack of colocalization between the GFP and the DsRed signals (Supplemental Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with the previously reported localization of Ipi1 and Rea1 proteins (28Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K.

Thus, Rea1 and the Rix1 complex could function in late nucleoplasmic maturation of pre-60 S subunits and/or their export to the cytoplasm. Taken together, the identified Rix1 complex is present together with the AAA-type ATPase Rea1 in a late pre-60 S particle that is located in the nucleoplasm. Rea1 and the Rix1 Complex Are Required for Nuclear Export of the 60 S Subunit—We wanted to determine whether Rea1 and the components of the Rix1 complex are involved in late nucleoplasmic steps during 60 S subunit biogenesis. Previously, we showed that the rix1-1 ts mutant is strongly impaired in 60 S subunit export, but rRNA processing was not significantly affected (10Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We followed different strategies to obtain conditional-lethal mutants of the Rea1 protein and Rix1 complex members. For REA1, both a repressible GAL1::REA1 construct and ts rea1 alleles were generated (see “Experimental Procedures”). For the essential Rix1, Ipi1, and Ipi3, conditional-lethal degron (td) mutants were used. These degron mutants target the proteins for rapid degradation in vivo upon shift to 37 °C (15Kanemaki M. Sanchez-Diaz A. Gambus A. Labib K. Nature. 2003; 423: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have confirmed that rea1-7 and rea1-21 ts mutants could be rescued by the presence of a plasmid carrying the REA1 wild-type gene (Supplemental Fig. 3A). In the case of the td mutants, we used the available RIX1 wild-type plasmid (10Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) to verify that the expression of the wild-type gene is sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype of rix1-td mutant (Supplemental Fig. 3B). The Rpl25-GFP reporter assay was developed to monitor 60 S export in vivo (18Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 29Hurt E. Hannus S. Schmelzl B. Lau D. Tollervey D. Simos G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, Rpl25-GFP is incorporated into nascent pre-60 S ribosomes and is rapidly exported to the cytoplasm. In all ts mutants generated (rea1-21, rix1, ipi1, and ipi3), the reporter protein was cytoplasmic at steady state (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with the rea1-7 mutant (data not shown). At early time points upon shift to the restrictive condition, the td mutants exhibited a mixed phenotype with cells accumulating the Rpl25-GFP protein either at their nucleolus or throughout their nucleoplasm (Fig. 3A, 1-h shift). At a later time point, all td mutants exhibited strong nuclear accumulation, whereas the nucleolus was either similar to nucleoplasmic staining or else devoid of any signal (Fig. 3A, 2-h shift; Supplemental Fig. 4). A similar assay for nuclear export of the small subunit showed cytoplasmic localization of Rps2-GFP comparable with wild-type in all of the mutants (Fig. 3). Both the rea1-21 ts and the repressible GAL::REA1 mutants accumulated the Rpl25-GFP in their nucleoplasm upon shift to restrictive conditions (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, in the case of the rea1-21 ts mutant, ∼20% of the cells accumulated the Rpl25-GFP protein at their nuclear periphery after 9 h of shift. The same phenotype was also observed with the rea1-7 ts mutant, albeit to a lesser extent (15%; data not shown). The fact that pre-60 S ribosomes accumulated in the entire nucleoplasm or at the nuclear periphery (Fig. 3, rea1-21 insert; Supplemental Fig. 5) suggests that a late step in nuclear export from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm is blocked in rea1 and rix1 complex mutants. Rea1 and the Rix1 Complex Are Required for Normal Levels of the 60 S Subunit—As the export is impaired for Rea1 and the Rix1 complex mutants, we wished to see whether the overall production of 60 S subunits is likewise reduced. For this reason, we analyzed the ribosomal and polysomal profiles in rea1 and rix1 complex mutants by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This analysis revealed a significant reduction of 60 S subunits as compared with 40 S in the mutants. Moreover, the appearance of half-mer polysomes was observed in mutant strains (Fig. 4), indicating a lack of mature 60 S to bind to the 43 S preinitiation complex. These data are consistent with the export defect, demonstrating that it is specific to the 60 S pathway. Depletion of Rea1 or the Rix1 Complex Inhibits Synthesis of the 5.8 S rRNA—To determine whether the rea1 and rix1 complex member mutants are impaired in pre-rRNA processing, we performed Northern hybridization and primer extension analyses. The locations of oligonucleotide probes are indicated in Fig. 6A. Analyses of low molecular weight RNAs (Fig. 5A, upper panel) revealed that genetic depletion of Rea1 resulted in strong inhibition of processing from 7 S pre-rRNA to 5.8 S + 30 and 6 S pre-rRNA, as shown by their substantial loss 16 h after transfer of the GAL::REA1 strain to glucose medium. Since the 7 S pre-rRNA was mildly accumulated, whereas the normal products of its processing were drastically reduced, it is likely that much of the 7 S pre-rRNA is degraded, presumably reflecting degradation of the entire pre-60 S particle. It is, however, difficult to directly assess this experimentally since 7 S is only faintly visible in pulse-chase labeling of wild-type strains, and the 5.8 S + 30 and 6 S pre-rRNAs are not observed (data not shown). Mature 5.8 S was reduced relative to the tRNA Leu3 loading control, as was the 5 S rRNA component of the 60 S subunit. Analyses of high molecular weight RNA by Northern hybridization (Fig. 5A, middle panel) and primer extension (Fig. 5A, lower panel) showed the accumulation of the 35 S pre-rRNA and 23 S RNA, accompanied by a mild reduction in the 20 S and 27 SA2 pre-rRNA. Very similar processing defects were observed in the rea1-21 ts strain 4 h after transfer to the non-permissive temperature (data not shown). These phenotypes indicate a delay in early pre-rRNA processing at sites A0, A1, and A2 (Fig. 6B), which are very frequently seen in strains defective in 60 S subunit synthesis (30Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The 27 SB pre-rRNAs were mildly accumulated, with little alteration in the levels of processing at the alternative B1S and B1L sites, indicating that the early steps in 60 S synthesis continue in the Rea1-depleted strain. Related defects in 5.8 S synthesis were seen in strains depleted of Rix1, Ipi1, or Ipi3 (Fig. 5B, upper panel). In each case, the 7 S pre-rRNA was accumulated relative to the wild-type control following transfer to non-permissive conditions, accompanied by reduced 6 S pre-rRNA. The level of the 5.8 S + 30 was reduced in the wild-type following transfer to 37 °C but was further reduced in the mutant strains. Some reduction in the levels of the mature 5.8 S was seen after 4 h in non-permissive conditions. The mature rRNAs are not generally turned over and are therefore depleted only by growth under non-permissive conditions. Greater depletion would not therefore have been expected over this perio"

However, the mechanisms of synergistic action of these factors in transcriptional regulation and subsequent cell fate specification are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel gene, Corl1, encoding a nuclear protein with homology to the Ski oncoprotein. Corl1 was highly selectively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). In the embryonic CNS, Corl1 was expressed in a certain subset of postmitotic neurons generated posterior to the midbrain-hindbrain border. In the developing spinal cord, Corl1 was selectively expressed in the dorsal horn interneurons where a homeodomain transcription factor, Lbx1, is required for proper specification. Corl1 was localized in a nuclear dot-like structure and interacted with general transcriptional corepressors. In addition, Corl1 showed transcriptional repression activity in the GAL4-fusion system, indicating its involvement in the regulation of transcriptional repression. Furthermore, Corl1 interacted with Lbx1 and cooperatively repressed transcription, suggesting that it acts as a transcriptional corepressor for Lbx1 in regulating cell fate determination in the dorsal spinal cord. Corl1 corepressor activity did not depend on Gro/TLE activity, and Gro/TLE also functioned as a corepressor for Lbx1. Thus, Lbx1 can select two independent partners, Corl1 and Gro/TLE, as corepressors. Identification of a novel transcriptional corepressor with neuronal subtype-restricted expression might provide insights into the mechanisms of cell fate determination in neurons.

Neuronal patterning is regulated by extrinsic inductive signals and downstream intrinsic signals mediated by transcription factors (1Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Jessell T.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 3Schuurmans C. Guillemot F. Curr.

In early development, neural progenitor cells are specified by secreted molecules such as sonic hedgehog (Shh), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CNS, central nervous system; RT, reverse transcription; aa, amino acids; WT, wild type; Corl, corepressor for Lbx1; TGF, transforming growth factor. Wnts and fibroblast growth factors, which regulate the expression pattern of downstream transcription factors including bHLH and homeodomain factors. These signals regulate sets of transcription factors at different concentration thresholds. Thus, the neural tube is regionalized into distinct progenitor domains expressing different sets of transcription factors along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes depending on distance from the organizing centers expressing secreted factors. As development proceeds, different classes of postmitotic neurons emerge from the individual progenitor domains during neurogenesis. Accumulating evidence has elucidated the mechanism of development in several central nervous system (CNS) regions. For example, in the ventral spinal cord, the gradient of Shh, which is secreted from the organizer regions, notochord and floor plate, is established in the ventral half of the neural tube during early development (2Jessell T.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 5Lee S.K. Pfaff S.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Graded Shh repressed expression of the class I homeodomain transcription factors, and instead induced the class II transcription factors (6Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2000; 101: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Cross-inhibitory interactions between complementary pairs of class I and class II factors establish a sharp boundary for each progenitor domain (6Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2000; 101: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Evidences obtained by ectopic expression and loss-of-function experiments revealed that these transcription factors specify the cell fate of neural progenitors and derived neurons (6Briscoe J.

Cell. 2002; 109: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In the dorsal spinal cord, similar extrinsic and intrinsic signaling mechanisms have been revealed (1Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 13Caspary T. Anderson K.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that BMPs- and TGFβ-related factors are secreted from the roof plate and specify dorsal neurons in a concentration-dependent manner (14Lee K.J. Mendelsohn M. Jessell T.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3394-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Lee K.J. Dietrich P. Jessell T.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Liem Jr., K.F.

Cell. 1997; 91: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Distinct classes of proneural bHLH transcription factors, which can constructively induce the different types of dorsal neurons, are expressed in individual dorsal progenitor domains through cross-repressive regulation (18Gowan K. Helms A.W. Hunsaker T.L. Collisson T. Ebert P.J. Odom R. Johnson J.E. Neuron. 2001; 31: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 19Nakada Y. Hunsaker T.L. Henke R.M. Johnson J.E. Development. 2004; 131: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, in both ventral and dorsal neural tubes, specification of neural progenitors by secreted signaling molecules and subsequent cross-repressive interactions between downstream transcription factors is a common mechanism for producing different classes of neurons. Expression of most transcription factors that specify progenitor cell fate is extinguished after exit from the cell cycle (1Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Instead, distinct sets of transcription factors are induced postmitotically, and these factors determine the identity of each neuron. These postmitotic factors have been shown to be able to re-specify neuronal identity by ectopic expression, but in many cases these activities are cellular context-dependent (20Cheng L. Chen C.L. Luo P. Tan M. Qiu M. Johnson R. Ma Q. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9961-9967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tanabe Y. William C. Jessell T.M.

Cell. 2002; 110: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, these postmitotically expressed transcription factors might function in a combinatorial manner with other transcription factors to specify neuronal cell fate. In the case of spinal cord motor neurons, two LIM homeodomain transcription factors, Isl1 and Lhx3, have been shown to form a complex containing a common LIM domain-interacting adopter protein, NLI, when determining cell fate (22Thaler J.P. Lee S.K. Jurata L.W. Gill G.N. Pfaff S.L. Cell. 2002; 110: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition, this complex acts cooperatively with neurogenic bHLH factors, Ngn2 or NeuroM, to synchronously regulate neurogenesis and subtype specification (23Lee S.K. Pfaff S.L. Neuron. 2003; 38: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the cooperation among transcription factors is important in unmasking the mechanism of neuronal cell fate specification. However, although many factors are reportedly involved in cell fate specification, in most cases, the cooperation among these transcription factors and involvement of cofactors is not yet understood. Thus, the precise mechanism of cell fate specification by transcription factors remains mostly unknown. Most homeodomain transcription factors expressed in ventral spinal cord progenitors contain the EH1 motif, which recruits Gro/TLE family transcriptional corepressors, and act as transcriptional repressors in specifying progenitor identity (24Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, patterning of the ventral neural tube seems to be achieved by the derepression strategy (5Lee S.K. Pfaff S.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, some postmitotically expressed homeodomain transcription factors have a putative EH1 motif (24Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and have been shown to repress the expression of transcription factors, which are normally expressed in other types of neurons, in specifying neuronal identity (25Cheng L. Arata A. Mizuguchi R. Qian Y. Karunaratne A. Gray P.A. Arata S. Shirasawa S. Bouchard M. Luo P. Chen C.L. Busslinger M. Goulding M. Onimaru H. Ma Q. Nat.

Development. 2003; 130: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the derepression mechanism might also be involved in postmitotic specification events. However, the mode of action of these transcriptional repressors and molecular mechanism of synergy among these factors remain largely unknown. In the dorsal spinal cord, distinct interneuron populations are generated from the same progenitor domains at different developmental stages (1Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). During the early phase of neurogenesis (E10.5-E11.5), six classes of interneurons (dI1-dI6) emerge along the dorsoventral axis. At later staged (E12-E13.5), distinct populations (dILA and dILB) are generated from a common progenitor domain. A number of transcription factors that are selectively expressed in particular subsets of dorsal interneurons have been identified (1Helms A.W. Johnson J.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). One of these, a homeodomain transcription factor, Lbx1, is specifically expressed during early and late phases of dorsal neurogenesis, and gene-targeting experiments revealed that Lbx1 is required for proper specification of these populations (26Gross M.K. Dottori M. Goulding M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 535-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Muller T. Brohmann H. Pierani A. Heppenstall P.A. Lewin G.R. Jessell T.M. Birchmeier C. Neuron. 2002; 34: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of Lbx1 repressed the expression of transcription factors such as Isl1 and LH2A/B, which mark other classes of dorsal interneurons (26Gross M.K. Dottori M. Goulding M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 535-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Muller T. Brohmann H. Pierani A. Heppenstall P.A. Lewin G.R. Jessell T.M. Birchmeier C. Neuron. 2002; 34: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that Lbx1 acts as a transcriptional repressor in specifying cell fate by blocking differentiation into other classes of neurons. However, the precise mechanism of transcriptional repression and cell fate specification by Lbx1 has not been clarified. In this study, we identified a novel transcriptional corepressor, Corl1 (Corl: Corepressor for Lbx1). Corl1 was selectively expressed in subsets of dorsal horn interneurons in the developing spinal cord, where Lbx1 is required for proper specification. Corl1 showed a corepressor activity through binding to Lbx1, suggesting that Corl1 regulates cell fate determination in the dorsal spinal cord with Lbx1. Here, we discuss the cell fate determination strategy in the developing CNS by a combination of DNA binding factors and transcriptional corepressors with neuronal subtype-restricted expression. Isolation of Corl1—The mesencephalon region was dissected from an E12.5 mouse embryo and divided into two portions, the ventral and dorsal regions. Subtractive PCR was performed as described previously (31Ono Y. Fukuhara N. Yoshie O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6939-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using the ventral region as a tester and dorsal region as a driver. After four rounds of subtractive hybridization, the amplified cDNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. Full-length cDNAs were screened from an E12.5 mouse brain cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of the Corl1 cDNA was deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base under accession number AB185113. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously (32Nakatani T. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Sakamoto Y. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16356-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ExTaq polymerase (TAKARA) was used for amplification, which was carried out by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s (2 min in the first cycle), annealing at 65 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 30 s (2 min in the last cycle). The numbers of cycles were 35 for Corl1 and 25 for G3PDH.

The Corl1 fragment was digested with SalI and cloned into the XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAG-NII, pcDNA-HA-NII and pcDNA-myc-NII, and SalI sites of pMX-FLAG-NII and pMX-GAL4 (32Nakatani T. Mizuhara E.

The N-CoR fragment was digested with SalI/NotI and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pcDNA-FLAG-NII and pcDNA-HA-NII. The HIPK2 fragment was digested with EcoRI/NotI and cloned into the same sites of pBS-SK+(Stratagene), yielding pBS-HIPK2. pCMV-EGFPN was constructed by ligating the XhoI fragment of pMXII-EGFPN encoding EGFP into the SalI sites of pCMV5 (Stratagene). The SalI/NotI fragment of pBS-HIPK2 was cloned into the same site of pCMV-EGFPN. The HDAC1, mSin3A, Grg1, and CtBP fragments were digested with SalI/NotI and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pcDNA-HA-NII. The Grg1 fragment was digested with SalI/NotI and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pcDNA-HA-NII and SalI/NotI site of pMX-FLAG-NII.

Various mutant constructs for Corl1, Grg1, and Lbx1 containing the following amino acid residues (aa) were made: Corl1-WT: aa 1–936 (full-length); Corl1-N1: aa 1–271; Corl1-N2: aa 1–418; Corl1-N3: aa 1–825; Corl1-C1: aa 264–936; Corl1-C2: aa 419–936; Corl1-C3: aa 725–936; Corl1ΔCH1: aa 1–263 + 419–936; Corl1CH1: aa 264–418; Grg1-WT: aa 1–770 (full-length); Grg1-ΔC: aa 1–194; Lbx1-WT: aa 1–282 (full-length); and Lbx1-ΔN: aa 52–282. pMX-derived constructs were used for the reporter assay and subcellular localization experiments. pcDNA-derived constructs were used for the coimmunoprecipitation assay. For the in situ hybridization probe, Corl1 and PLZF cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following primers, Corl1: 5′-ACA ATC ACT CGA CGA CAG CCG ACG AC-3′/5′-ACG GAT ACA GGT CTC CCC AAA TAG GC-3′ and PLZF:5′-TCT TTC GGT CTC TCA GCC ATG AGT CC-3′/5′-GTG TGT TCT CAG GTG CTT GAT CAT GG-3′. Amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and used as templates for the transcription of DIG-labeled probes. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (32Nakatani T. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Sakamoto Y. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16356-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit anti-Corl1 antibody was raised against GST-Corl1 (aa 569–813) and affinity purified. A polyclonal rabbit anti-Lbx1 antibody was raised against GST-Lbx1 (aa 1–81) and affinity-purified. Primary antibodies used for double staining included: anti-βIII-tubulin (Covance), anti-Pax7, anti-Lim1/2, anti-Isl1/2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-Brn3a (Chemicon). Immunofluorescence analysis of the transfected 293E cells was performed as described previously (33Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293E cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids using TransIT LT1 reagent (Mirus Corporation). After the transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, they were replated onto glass coverslips, further cultured for 16 h, and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (SIGMA). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments and detection by Western blotting were performed essentially as described previously (32Nakatani T. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Sakamoto Y. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16356-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected 293E cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for1hat4 °C. After decreasing the NaCl concentration to 150 mm by the addition of lysis buffer lacking NaCl, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG M2 beads. Immunoprecipitation experiments with a cross-link reagent were performed as follows: transfected 293E cells were cross-linked with 1.5 mm DSP reagent (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 4°C then lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. After decreasing the SDS concentration to 0.1% by adding lysis buffer lacking SDS and containing 0.1% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Reporter Assay—The reporter assay was performed essentially as described previously (32Nakatani T. Mizuhara E. Minaki Y. Sakamoto Y. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16356-16367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, NS20Y cells (5×104) were transfected with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.4 μg of pMX-FLAG-NII expression vector together with 0.005 μg of pRL-SV40 (Promega) using a TransIT LT1 reagent. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared and assayed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized with Renilla luciferase activity. Identification of a Novel Ski-related Gene, Corl1—To identify the transcription factors regulating neuronal differentiation in the developing CNS, we screened the genes differentially expressed in developing CNS regions by subtractive PCR. One of the genes isolated encoded a novel protein and was designated Corl1. Corl1 has a 936-amino acid long open reading frame. A computer data base search identified another novel gene with significant homology to Corl1, namely Corl2. Corl1 and Corl2 have a cysteine-rich region at the N terminus, which shows significant homology to that of the Ski oncoprotein (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, Corl1 has a coiled-coil domain at its C terminus as do Ski, Sno, and Dachs, indicating that the overall domain structure is well conserved among Corls, Ski, Sno, and Dachs, and suggesting that Corls are involved in similar pathway, probably transcriptional regulation. In addition to these motifs, there is a conserved region (CH1) in both Corl1 and Corl2, suggesting Corl family-specific functions.Fig. 5Corl1 is a transcriptional corepressor. A, Corl1 localized in a nuclear dot-like structure. 293E cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector for FLAG-Corl1 (panel a), GFP-Corl1 and FLAG-N-CoR (panel b), and FLAG-Corl1 and GFP-HIPK2 (panel c) and stained with anti-FLAG antibody. Corl1 was partially colocalized with N-CoR and HIPK2 in the nuclear dot-like structure. B, interaction of Corl1 with transcriptional corepressors. 293E cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for each tagged protein as indicated. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were immunoblotted using an anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody as indicated. C, Corl1 has a transcriptional repressor activity. Structures of the Corl1 mutants used in this study are shown. NS20Y cells were transfected with UAS-SV40-luc and the indicated expression vectors for GAL4-fusion proteins. The results show the fold repression of luciferase activity from the reporter with the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone. The mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1Structure and phylogenetic analysis of Corl1 and Corl2.

Note that the cysteine-rich domains of Drosophila CG11093 and mouse Corls are highly conserved. C, phylogenetic analysis of Corl, Ski/SnoN, and Dach family proteins. Amino acid sequences of N-terminal cysteine-rich domains were used for analysis. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ClustalW method. Accession numbers: mouse Corl1, AB185113; mouse Corl2, XM_355050; mouse Ski, AF435852; mouse SnoN, U36203; mouse Dach1, AF090436; mouse Dach2, BC059233; fly CG11093, NM_143689; fly CG7233, NM_135322; fly Dac, U19269.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the evolutionary relationship of Corls to Ski, Sno, and Dachs, amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis were performed. Six mouse proteins and three Drosophila proteins were identified in the GenBank™ data base, and these proteins were subdivided into three subfamilies, Corl, Ski/Sno, and Dach (Fig. 1C). There were two members in each subfamily of mouse proteins, and one individual counterpart for each subfamily of Drosophila. Thus, these three distinct subfamilies are evolutionally conserved from flies to mammals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, only one member, DAF-5, which is highly related to Ski/SnoN both in sequence and function, has been identified (34da Graca L.S. Zimmerman K.K. Mitchell M.C. Kozhan-Gorodetska M. Sekiewicz K. Morales Y. Patterson G.I. Development. 2004; 131: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the N-terminal cysteine-rich regions among Corl subfamily members show striking identities (mouse Corl1 and mouse Corl2, 92%; mouse Corl1 and Drosophila CG11093, 84%), compared with the homologies among members of Ski/SnoN or Dach subfamilies, suggesting highly conserved roles for Corls and CG11093. Corl1 Is Differentially Expressed in Developing CNS Regions—We first examined the tissue distribution of Corl1 by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2A). Corl1 mRNA was detected in the brain, and more abundantly in the developing brain, suggesting a role in regulating CNS development. In other adult tissues, Corl1 mRNA was detected in the testis. Thus, Corl1 is expressed in a highly restricted manner in adult mouse tissues. Next, we examined embryonic expression of Corl1 by in situ hybridization analysis. In E12.5 mouse embryos, expression of Corl1 was restricted to the CNS (Fig. 2B), and the highest expression was detected in the spinal cord. Scattered signals were also observed in the dorsal metencephalon and myelencephalon (Fig. 2C). In addition, Corl1 expression was detected in some ventral metencephalon and myelencephalon cells in mid-sagittal sections (data not shown). It should be noted that Corl1 expression was not detected in the CNS region anterior to the midbrain-hindbrain border. As revealed in a transverse section of the E12.5 spinal cord, the Corl1 signal was mainly detected in the dorsal part, indicating neuronal lineage-restricted expression of Corl1 in the spinal cor"

We have previously demonstrated that endothelial cell COX-2 is required for integrin αVβ3-dependent activation of Rac-1 and Cdc-42 and for endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (Dormond, O., Foletti, A., Paroz, C., and Ruegg, C. (2001) Nat. Med. 7, 1041–1047; Dormond, O., Bezzi, M., Mariotti, A., and Ruegg, C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 45838–45846). In this study, we addressed the question of whether integrin-mediated cell adhesion may regulate COX-2 expression in endothelial cells. We report that cell detachment from the substrate caused rapid degradation of COX-2 protein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) independent of serum stimulation. This effect was prevented by broad inhibition of cellular proteinases and by neutralizing lysosomal activity but not by inhibiting the proteasome. HUVEC adhesion to laminin, collagen I, fibronectin, or vitronectin induced rapid COX-2 protein expression with peak levels reached within 2 h and increased COX-2-dependent prostaglandin E2 production. In contrast, nonspecific adhesion to poly-l-lysine was ineffective in inducing COX-2 expression. Furthermore, the addition of matrix proteins in solution promoted COX-2 protein expression in suspended or poly-l-lysine-attached HUVEC. Adhesion-induced COX-2 expression was strongly suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38, extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2, and, to a lesser extent, protein kinase C and by the inhibition of mRNA or protein synthesis. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that integrin-mediated cell adhesion and soluble integrin ligands contribute to maintaining COX-2 steady-state levels in endothelial cells by the combined prevention of lysosomal-dependent degradation and the stimulation of mRNA synthesis involving multiple signaling pathways.

Tumor angiogenesis, i.e. the formation of new blood vessels in response to angiogenic stimuli, promotes tumor progression by stimulating tumor cell survival, tumor invasion, and metastasis formation (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7350) Google Scholar). Many molecules mediating or regulating angiogenesis have been identified (2Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). They include vascular endothelial growth factors and their cell surface receptors, matrix-degrading enzymes, vascular remodeling ligands (i.e. angiopoietins), and their receptors and adhesion molecules of the integrin and cadherin families.

Besides promoting physical adhesion, integrins also transduce signaling events (“outside-in” signaling), which are essential for cell spreading, migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Signaling molecules downstream of integrins include Src family kinases, integrin-linked kinase, focal adhesion kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), stress-regulated kinases (e.g. p38, and JNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) (5Giancotti F.G.

COX-2 and its main metabolite prostaglandin (PG) E2 promote tumor progression through two distinct but complementary mechanisms. First, they stimulate tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and second, they induce tumor angiogenesis, which in turn favors local tumor progression and metastatic spreading. COX-2 stimulates angiogenesis by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor expression in tumor and stromal cells (23Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N.

Although much is known regarding the role of growth factors and cytokines in the induction of COX-2 expression, little is known regarding the contribution of cell adhesion.In this study, we investigated the role of cell adhesion in modulating COX-2 protein level in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Here we report that COX-2 protein is rapidly degraded through a lysosomal-dependent pathway upon HUVEC detachment from the substrate and that integrin-mediated adhesion to ECM proteins induced de novo COX-2 synthesis involving signaling through multiple pathways (i.e. p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3-K, PKC, and c-Src).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Bovine gelatin, bovine plasma fibronectin, human plasma vitronectin, rat collagen I, BSA, murine laminin, poly-l-lysine (PLL), ammonium chloride, and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma.

Alder S. Kumar S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2365-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); ammonium chloride (34Seglen P.O. Reith A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 100: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) at 40 mm; or lactacystin (35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) at a 10 μm final concentration. Cells were left in suspension for different periods of time and subsequently analyzed for COX-2 protein by Western blotting.Assays with Pharmacological Inhibitors—Cells were serum-starved for 2 h before plating at 2 × 105 cells/well on 12-well plates coated with ECMs (see above). Pharmacological inhibitors were added at the time of plating at the following concentrations: LY294002, 20 μm; SB203580, 20 μm; PD98059, 20 μm; RAD001, 0.1 μm; PKC 412, 1 μm; STI571, 10 μm; and CGP77675, 5 μm. Cells were collected 2 h later, and total protein extracts were analyzed for COX-2 protein by Western blotting.Cell Adhesion Assays—Maxisorp II Nunc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 10 μg/ml laminin, collagen I, fibronectin, or vitronectin overnight at 4 °C and blocked with BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Assays were done as previously described (32Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). HUVEC were collected by trypsin digestion and seeded in serum-free M199 medium at 2 × 104 cells/well. Blocking anti-integrin-mAbs were added at this step (at 10 μg/ml). After 1 h at 37°C, wells were gently washed with PBS and attached cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Absorbance of each well was read at 620 nm in a plate reader (Packard Spectra Count, Meriden, CT). Results are expressed as the mean value ± S.D of triplicate determinations.PGE2 Determinations—PGE2 was measured in conditioned culture medium using an enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences). Results are expressed as pg of PGE2/ml of a 2 × 105 cell culture supernatant and represent the mean ± S.D. of duplicate determinations.Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was prepared from HUVEC using RNAsol B (Biogenesis) and following manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed (Superscript II, Invitrogen), and cDNA was subjected to PCR amplifications using primer pairs specific for human COX-2 (forward, 5′-TTCAAATGAGATTGTGGGAAAATTGCT-3′; reversed, 5′-AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTT-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-CAACTACATGGTTTACATGTTC-3′; reversed, 5′-CATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAG-3′ (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland).SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland), and incubated in 1% BSA with anti-COX-2 mAb or anti-COX-1 antibody and anti-actin mAb followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (DAKO, Zug, Switzerland). The ECL system was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences). Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were carried out at a minimum of three times to yield similar results. Representative experiments are shown.RESULTSEndothelial Cell Detachment Causes COX-2 Degradation—We have previously shown that endothelial cell COX-2 activity is required for αVβ3 integrin-mediated endothelial cell spreading and migration in vitro and fibroblast growth factor 2-induced angiogenesis in vivo (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 27Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that adhesion itself may be involved in regulating COX-2 protein expression and activity (36Dormond O. Rüegg C. Drug Res. Updates. 2001; 4: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To experimentally address this hypothesis, we analyzed COX-2 protein levels by Western blotting in HUVEC cultured under adhesive conditions and in HUVEC detached by trypsin treatment and cultured for up to 3 h in suspension. HUVEC were serum-starved for 2 h before detachment, and upon detachment, they were further cultured in the absence of FCS to avoid any possible effects of serum on COX-2 expression. Adherent HUVEC expressed significant amounts of COX-2 protein, and this level rapidly and dramatically dropped after detachment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, HUVEC expressed only low levels of COX-1, and this was not altered by cell detachment (Fig. 1A). Within the experimental conditions tested throughout these experiments (i.e. detachment and culture in suspension up to 3 h), HUVEC viability remained above 90% (data not shown). To directly test for the effects of serum on COX-2 expression, HUVEC were maintained in complete medium (i.e. medium supplemented with FCS and growth factors) before detachment and during cultures in suspension. FCS and growth factors did not prevent the drop in COX-2 protein level observed after cell detachment (Fig. 1B). To obtain additional evidence that adhesion was required for maintaining COX-2 protein expression, we induced HUVEC detachment by adding 3 mm EDTA to confluent HUVEC cultures. Consistently, we observed a decrease in COX-2 protein level but with a slower kinetic compared with trypsin treatment (Fig. 1C).COX-2 protein is mostly localized on the luminal side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (37Hashimoto Y. Kondo Y. Kimura G. Matsuzawa I. Sato S. Ishizaki M. Imura N. Akimoto M. Hara S. Histopathology. 2004; 44: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) through asymmetric insertion into the membrane via a monotopic membrane binding domain (38Spencer A.G. Thuresson E. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Nina M. Berneche S. Roux B. Eur. Biophys. J. 2000; 29: 439-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This localization suggested the possibilities that the decrease in COX-2 protein induced by cell detachment could be either due to cell surface transport and extracellular secretion or to intracellular proteolytic degradation. To test the first possibility, we separately monitored COX-2 protein content in cells and conditioned culture supernatant following EDTA-induced cell detachment. Whereas cell-associated COX-2 protein levels progressively decreased, there was no detectable COX-2 protein accumulation in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2A). To address the second possibility, HUVEC were detached by trypsin and cultured in suspension in the presence or absence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”). Broad inhibition of protease activity suppressed COX-2 degradation in HUVEC cultured in suspension (Fig. 2B). We then repeated the experiment in the presence of ammonium chloride, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteolytic activity (34Seglen P.O. Reith A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 100: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or lactacystin, a drug that inhibits trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activities of the proteasome (35Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Ammonium chloride, but not lactacystin treatment, prevented the decrease in COX-2 protein observed upon cell detachment (Fig. 2, C and D).Fig. 2COX-2 is degraded via the lysosmal pathway upon HUVEC detachment.A, confluent HUVEC were washed with PBS, and EDTA (3 mm) was added at t = 0 to induce cell detachment. Cells (P) and conditioned culture supernatants (S) were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by Western blotting for COX-2 protein expression. Adh, adherent cells before the addition of EDTA. B–D, HUVEC were collected by trypsin digestion and maintained in suspension in the absence (– PI) or presence (+ PI) of a mixture of protease inhibitors (B), in the absence (– AC) or presence (+ AC) of ammonium chloride (40 mm) to inhibit the proteolytic lysosomal activity (C), or in the absence (– LC) or presence (+ LC) of lactacystin (10 μm), a proteasome inhibitor (D). Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for COX-2 protein at the indicated time points. Blots were concomitantly probed for actin to demonstrate equal protein loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together these data demonstrate that the HUVEC detachment from the substrate causes a rapid decrease in COX-2 protein level, independently of serum stimulation, and that this decrease is due to lysosomal-mediated degradation.HUVEC Adhesion to Multiple Extracellular Matrix Proteins Induces COX-2 Protein Synthesis—We next tested whether integrin-mediated HUVEC adhesion to ECM proteins did induce COX-2 protein expression. To this purpose, HUVEC were detached and maintained in suspension for 2 h to deplete COX-2 protein and then plated on laminin, collagen I, fibronectin, vitronectin, PLL, a substrate that promotes nonspecific integrin-dependent cell attachment to the substrate (40Bershadsky A. Chausovsky A. Becker E. Lyubimova A. Geiger B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), or on BSA (a non-adhesive substrate). The integrin specificity of the adhesion was confirmed in short-term cell adhesion experiments by adding function blocking anti-integrin mAbs to HUVEC at the time of plating on the different substrates. Adhesion to laminin was mostly mediated by α6β1. Adhesion to collagen I was largely mediated by α2β1 with a minor contribution by α1β1 and α3β1. Adhesion to fibronectin was largely mediated by α5β1 with a minor contribution of αVβ3, whereas adhesion to vitronectin was mediated by integrin αVβ3 (Fig. 3). HUVEC adhesion to each of the four ECM proteins induced a time-dependent increase in COX-2 protein level, whereas integrin-independent adhesion to PLL or lack of adhesion (i.e. HUVEC on BSA) did not increase the level (Fig. 4A). Increase in COX-2 protein levels were observed as soon as 30 min after plating, whereas peak levels were observed at 2 h. At this time point, we observed some differences in the relative induction of COX-2 by with collagen I and laminin being the most potent inducers (Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Integrin specificity of HUVEC adhesion to ECM proteins. HUVEC were collected and seeded into wells previously coated with laminin (LM), collagen I (Col I), fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN), PLL, or BSA in the absence or presence of integrin function-blocking mAbs (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2055345586,"Colorectal carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving genetic mutations and alterations in rigorously controlled signaling pathways and gene expression that control intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is aberrantly expressed in premalignant adenomatous polyps and colorectal carcinomas and is associated with increased epithelial cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and increased cell invasiveness. Currently, knowledge of the regulation of expression of COX-2 by endogenous cell-surface receptors is inadequate. Recently, in a non-transformed rat intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-18), we showed induction of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis by angiotensin II (Ang II) via the endogenous Ang II type 1 receptor (Chiu, T., Santiskulvong, C., and Rozengurt, E. (2003) Am. J. Physiol. 285, G1–G11). We report that Ang II potently stimulated expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein as an immediate-early gene response through the Ang II type 1 receptor, correlating with an increase in prostaglandin I2 production. Ang II induced Cdc42 activation and filopodial formation. COX-2 expression was induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF), which activated Rac with lamellipodial formation. Inhibition of small GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B blocked COX-2 expression by Ang II and EGF. Inhibition of ERK activation by U0126 or PD98059 significantly decreased EGF-dependent COX-2 expression, but did not affect Ang II-dependent COX-2 expression. Conversely, inhibition of p38MAPK by SB202190 or PD169316 inhibited COX-2 expression by Ang II, but did not block COX-2 induction by EGF. Ang II caused Ca2+ mobilization. Inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by 2-aminobiphenyl borate blocked Ang II-dependent COX-2 expression. EGF did not induce Ca2+ mobilization, and 2-aminobiphenyl borate did not inhibit EGF-dependent COX-2 expression. Inhibition of COX-2 expression correlated with inhibition of prostaglandin I2 production. Luciferase promoter assays showed that Ang II-dependent transcriptional activation of the COX-2 promoter was dependent on activation of small GTPases and p38MAPK and on Ca2+ signaling via the cAMP-responsive element/activating transcription factor cis-acting element.

Consequently, the identification of the pathways and regulatory elements that control COX-2 expression in general and in intestinal cells in particular is the subject of major interest. The sequential proliferation, lineage-specific differentiation, migration, and cell death of epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa are a tightly regulated process that is modulated by a broad spectrum of regulatory peptides (22Kanai M.

A recent study reports that specific COX-2 inhibitors and ACE inhibitors synergistically reduce tumor growth in an in vivo mouse model for colon cancer (46Yasumaru M. Tsuji S. Tsujii M. Irie T.

These data suggest that Ang II could have a significant role in colon carcinogenesis possibly by induction of COX-2 expression. We report that Ang II potently induced COX-2 mRNA and protein in non-transformed rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells via an endogenous AT1 receptor. Multiple signaling cascades mediated by AT1 receptor activation involving pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq and possibly G12 families of heterotrimeric G-proteins combine to induce transient COX-2 expression. Furthermore, we show an absolute requirement for Ca2+ signaling and activation of small GTPases for Ang II-dependent COX-2 expression and PGI2 production in IEC-18 cells. These findings define signaling pathways coupled to an endogenous AT1 receptor that regulate COX-2 expression as a potential mechanism for epigenetic changes that play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Materials—Ang II, epidermal growth factor (EGF), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, thapsigargin, bisindolylmaleimide (GF 109203X), 2-aminobiphenyl borate (2-APB), PD122319, PD98059, and U0126 were purchased from Sigma. Clostridium difficile toxin B, SB202190, and PD169316 were purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Losartan was provided by DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and Fura-2/AM were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—IEC-18 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Stock cultures of these cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For experiments, cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL) at 105 cells/dish, allowed to growth to confluency (5–7 days), and then changed to serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 18–24 h prior to experiments. Expression Vectors—IEC-18 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. The COX-2 promoter-reporter plasmid pTIS-10s contains luciferase cDNA under the control of the murine COX-2 promoter (-371 to +70). The other COX-2 promoter-reporter plasmids are described (47Slice L.W. Bui L. Mak C. Walsh J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). phRG-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) contains Renilla luciferase cDNA under the control of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Western Blot Analysis—IEC-18 cells were grown on 60-mm dishes. When confluent and quiescent, the cells were incubated in Opti-MEM (18 h) prior to stimulation with agonists. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Equal volumes of protein extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight with anti-COX-2 antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) at a 1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies specific for ERK1/2, phospho-ERK, p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK, and activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and the antibody against phospho-ATF-2 was from BIO-SOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Isolation of RNA and TaqMan Analysis—Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative levels of COX-2 mRNA to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were measured using the real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The COX-2 primers used were 5′-GGCACAAATATGATGTTCGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCGCTTCTGATCTGTCTTGA-3′ (reverse), and the probe used was carboxyfluorescein-5′-TCTTTGCCCAGCACTTCACTCATCAGTTT-3′-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. GAPDH mRNA was measured using the rodent GAPDH TaqMan primer set (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Dual reaction mixtures were made using the TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems, Inc.), 25 ng of sample RNA, and either the COX-2 or GAPDH primer/probe set. Assays were run on an ABI 7700 system using settings of 30 min at 48 °C; 10 min at 95 °C; and forty cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C at the Human Genetics Core Facility of UCLA. The change in COX-2 mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA was calculated from the measured CT value using the following formula: -fold RNA induction = 2-ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = ΔCT(f) - ΔCT(i), ΔCT(f) = ΔCT(f)COX-2 - ΔCT(f)GAPDH, and ΔCT(i) = ΔCT(f)COX-2 - ΔCT(i)GAPDH. Measurement of COX-2 mRNA Stability—IEC-18 cells were serum-starved overnight prior to stimulation with Ang II (100 nm) or EGF (25 ng/ml). After induction for 1 h, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was purified at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. COX-2 and GAPDH mRNA expression levels were measured by TaqMan analysis. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells (5 × 104/well) were plated onto 6-well dishes (Nunc). The next day, a transfection mixture was prepared by adding 0.51 μg of the COX-2 promoter-reporter vector, 0.1 μg of phRG-TK, and a combination of pcDNA3 and other expression vectors (totaling 0.24 μg) to 51 μl of Opti-MEM. Following a 20-min incubation after addition of Superfect (5 μl; QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA), the transfection mixture was combined with 0.6 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed on the cells in each well. After 2 days, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM. The next day, the cells were treated with agonists. After the indicated times, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with passive lysis buffer (150 μl; Promega). The relative light units from firefly and Renilla luciferases (20 μl) were measured using the Dual-Luciferase activity assay kit (100 μl; Promega) on a Turner TD20/20 luminometer. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity was calculated. The results are reported as relative changes in the ratio, with a relative -fold increase of 1.0 signifying no change. The results are reported as the means ± S.E. of three or more sets of transfections done in triplicate. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—IEC-18 cells were grown on glass coverslips and then loaded with Fura-2/AM (5 μm) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.2) supplemented with 35 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, and 1% bovine serum albumin (buffer A) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslip was mounted in a chamber on the stage of a Zeiss 100TV inverted microscope with a ×40 objective (Fluar). Mounted cells were perfused with buffer A (∼1 ml/min) using a two-channel peristaltic pump (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA) at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i was measured with a fluorescent video microscopy system (RatioVision, Atto Instruments, Inc., Rockville, MD) using 334- and 380-nm excitation filters as described previously (48Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calibration of the Fura-2 fluorescence ratios was accomplished in vitro with a series of buffered Ca2+ standards containing Mg2+. Small GTPase Activity Assay—Confluent serum-starved IEC-18 cells were untreated or treated with either Ang II (100 nm, 5 min) or EGF (25 ng/ml, 5 min) prior to harvesting. The levels of GTP-bound Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were measured using the appropriate activation assay kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclei from agonist-treated IEC-18 cells (107) were isolated and stored in liquid N2 (49Slice L.W. Hodikian R. Zhukova E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In vitro run-on transcription was carried out using 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP/agonist condition at 30 °C for 30 min. The labeled RNA transcripts were isolated using TRIzol. Equal amounts of radioactivity (5 × 106 cpm) for each assay condition were hybridized to filter-immobilized cDNA in 1 ml of Ultra-hyb (Ambion Inc., Austin TX) for 48 h at 30 °C. The filters were washed twice with 2× SSC at 52 °C for 1 h and then incubated with RNase A (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a final wash with 2× SSC at 52 °C for 1 h. The filters were exposed to PhosphorImager screens for 2–3 days, and the radioactivity was measured using Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences). Prostaglandin Assay—Confluent IEC-18 cells grown on 24-well plates were incubated with Opti-MEM 18 h prior to stimulation. Opti-MEM was replaced, and the cells were stimulated with Ang II (100 nm) or EGF (25 ng/ml) for 6 h. The medium was collected, and the level of 6-keto-PGF1α was measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t distribution using average values and the associated standard errors. A comparative p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Ang II Induces COX-2 Expression in IEC-18 Cells through the AT1 Receptor—To determine whether Ang II induces COX-2 expression in non-transformed intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells, total RNA was isolated from cells that were treated with this agonist for various times (0.5–8 h). The levels of COX-2 mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA were measured by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). Ang II rapidly induced COX-2 mRNA, which peaked 1 h after addition of agonist and then returned to basal levels by 4 h. Induction of COX-2 mRNA in these cells is an immediate-early gene response because inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide did not block induction by Ang II (data not shown). We next examined whether the transient increase in the expression of COX-2 mRNA induced by Ang II leads to an increase in the levels of COX-2 protein. Proteins from extracts of cells treated with Ang II for up to 24 h were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using anti-COX-2 antibody (Fig. 1A, inset). Confluent serum-starved IEC-18 cells expressed low relative levels of COX-2 protein. Stimulation of these cells with Ang II induced a marked increase in COX-2 protein, which was evident within 1 h after agonist treatment and reached a maximum at 8 h. By 24 h after Ang II treatment, the level of COX-2 protein had declined to near basal levels. Ang II induced COX-2 expression in serum-starved IEC-18 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). COX-2 mRNA levels were measured in cells treated with increasing amounts of Ang II. An EC50 value of 1.76 ± 0.01 nm was calculated for Ang II from a sigmoidal dose-response curve that was modeled to the data. The level of COX-2 protein also increased in response to increasing doses of Ang II (Fig. 1B, inset). Ang II is known to exert its biological effects through binding to two receptor subtypes, AT1 and AT2 receptors, which are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (50Ardaillou R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S30-S39PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that Ang II potently activates multiple kinase signaling pathways through the AT1 receptor (38Chiu T. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C929-C942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chiu T. Santiskulvong C. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine which receptor subtype mediates Ang II-dependent induction of COX-2, cells were pretreated with losartan, a specific AT1 receptor antagonist (50Ardaillou R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S30-S39PubMed Google Scholar), prior to treatment with Ang II (Fig. 1C). The increases in the levels of COX-2 mRNA in response to Ang II were significantly reduced in the presence of losartan. Pretreatment of cells with the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (51Widdop R.E. Gardiner S.M. Kemp P.A. Bennett T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H226-H231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not inhibit COX-2 mRNA induction by Ang II (data not shown). The AT1 receptor can be coupled to several distinct families of heterotrimeric G-proteins (e.g. Gq,Gi, and G12). To determine whether Gi signaling is involved in Ang II-dependent COX-2 expression, IEC-18 cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (52Serventi I.M. Moss J. Vaughan M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 43-67PubMed Google Scholar), followed by induction with Ang II (Fig. 1D). Treatment with pertussis toxin did not decrease the level of Ang II-dependent COX-2 mRNA expression. Western blot analysis of cells treated with pertussis toxin showed no decrease in Ang II-dependent COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 1D, inset). EGF Induces COX-2 Expression in IEC-18 Cells—EGF and transforming growth factor-α are structurally related peptides that stimulate DNA synthesis and cell growth in various systems, including the gastrointestinal tract (53Barnard J.A.

In this study we investigated the molecular basis of synthesis of highly phosphorylated inositol polyphosphates (such as inositol tetrakisphosphate, inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)) in rat cells. We report that heterologous expression of rat inositol polyphosphate kinases rIPK2, a dual specificity inositol trisphosphate/inositol tetrakisphosphate kinase, and rIPK1, an IP5 2-kinase, were sufficient to recapitulate IP6 synthesis from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in mutant yeast cells. Overexpression of rIPK2 in Rat-1 cells increased inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (I(1,3,4,5,6)P5) levels about 2–3-fold compared with control. Likewise in Rat-1 cells, overexpression of rIPK1 was capable of completely converting I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to IP6. Simultaneous overexpression of both rIPK2 and rIPK1 in Rat-1 cells increased both IP5 and IP6 levels. To reduce IPK2 activity in Rat-1 cells, we introduced vector-based short interference RNA against rIPK2. Cells harboring the short interference RNA had a 90% reduction of mRNA levels and a 75% decrease of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5. These data confirm the involvement of IPK2 and IPK1 in the conversion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to IP6 in rat cells. Furthermore these data suggest that rIPK2 and rIPK1 act as key determining steps in production of IP5 and IP6, respectively. The ability to modulate the intracellular inositol polyphosphate levels by altering IPK2 and IPK1 expression in rat cells will provide powerful tools to study the roles of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6 in cell signaling.

In yeast, I(1,4,5)P3, which is hydrolyzed from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C, is sequentially phosphorylated to IP6 by two inositol polyphosphate kinases, a multiple specificity IP3/IP4 kinase (inositol polyphosphate kinase 2 (Ipk2)) and an IP5 2-kinase (inositol polyphosphate kinase 1 (Ipk1)). On the other hand, a synthetic pathway of IP6 from I(1,4,5)P3 in mammalian cells is thought to be more complex and to be a sequence of I(1,4,5)P3 → I(1,3,4,5)P4 → I(1,3,4)P3 → I(1,3,4,6)P4 → I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 → IP6 (2Irvine R.F.

Additionally IP6 stimulates non-homologous DNA end joining of double strand DNA breaks by binding to the Ku70/80 subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase in vitro (19Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M.

Yeast genetic data also suggest that these kinases and/or their inositol polyphosphate products are involved in transcription of specific genes, mRNA export, and chromatin remodeling (5York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D.

Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, most of the data mentioned above were determined in vitro or in yeast, and evidence in mammalian cells is still lacking. Additionally some of the data obtained from in vitro studies may be experimental artifacts due to the effect of the highly polarized negative charge of these inositol polyphosphate molecules (25Shears S.B. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To address the synthetic pathway and the function of inositol polyphosphates in mammalian cells, it is important to establish a model system whereby the inositol polyphosphate levels can be modulated in vivo. In this study, we analyzed the effects of either overexpression or knock-down of inositol polyphosphate kinase(s) on inositol polyphosphate levels in Rat-1 cells. We showed the accumulation of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6 by overexpression of IPK2 and IPK1. We also succeeded in decreasing cellular I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 levels by RNA interference (RNAi). These data reveal the involvement of IPK2 and IPK1 in I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6 synthesis in vivo. Furthermore the ability to modulate the intracellular inositol polyphosphate levels shown here by altering IPK2 and IPK1 expression in rat cells will provide powerful tools to study the roles of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6 in eukaryotic cell signaling. Cell Culture and Transfection—Phoenix and Rat-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Culture medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cell lines expressing tetracycline-inducible constructs were maintained in the same condition except using 10% Tet system-approved FBS (Clontech). Retroviruses were produced by transient transfection of the plasmid into phoenix cells by the calcium phosphate method as described elsewhere (26Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were infected with retrovirus-containing media in the presence of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma) for overnight. Thirty-six hours later, cells were selected in the presence of appropriate antibiotics for at least 2 weeks and then used for experiments. The concentration of antibiotics used for selection were: Geneticin, 800 μg/ml; hygromycin, 400 μg/ml; and puromycin, 1.5 μg/ml, respectively. RNA Preparation and Cloning of Rat IPK2 and Rat IPK1 by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Briefly 1 × 107 Rat-1 cells were lysed into Buffer RLT with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and then applied to the RNeasy minicolumn. After washing the column, total RNA was eluted with 40 μl of RNase-free water. RT-PCR was performed using the RobusT I RT-PCR kit (Finnzymes). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of RNA was performed at 42 °C for 1 h in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1× RobusT I reaction buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm oligo(dT), 0.2 μm sense and antisense primers, 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 1 unit of DyNAzyme EXT DNA polymerase. The subsequent PCR was done at 94 °C for an initial 2 min followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primers were designed to amplify the entire open reading frame of the rat ortholog of IPK2 (rIPK2) (GenBank™ accession number AY014898) (10Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X.

The RT-PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The substitution of Asp-127 to Ala in rIPK2 (rIPK2 D127A) was performed by PCR with the following mutagenic primers (the D127A mutation is underlined): sense, 5′-AAG CCC TGT ATA ATG GCC GTG AAG ATT GGG CGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCG CCC AAT CTT CAC GGC CAT TAT ACA GGG CTT-3′.

All constructs were sequenced by the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of Recombinant GST Fusion Protein— The expression and purification of GST-rIPK2 and GST-rIPK1 were performed as described previously (29Stevenson-Paulik J. Odom A.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42711-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly competent BL21 Escherichia coli cells were transformed by pGST/rIPK2 or pGST/rIPK1. One liter of LB was cultured at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.8–1.0 at 600 nm. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration). The cells were grown for 20 h at 20 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and one Complete™ Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml of buffer). The cells were lysed by five passages through a cell cracker (a high shear fluid-processing system for cell rupture, Microfluidics Corp.). Triton X-100 was added to lysates at final concentrations of 1%, and then lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 1 ml of 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The Sepharose was washed three times with 15 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the GST fusion proteins were eluted from the Sepharose with 1 ml of 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and stored at –80 °C in aliquots. Inositol Phosphate Kinase Assays—To synthesize [3H]I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, [3H]I(1,4,5)P3 was phosphorylated by 100 ng of recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog of Ipk2 (AtIpk2β), which phosphorylates I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (29Stevenson-Paulik J.

Briefly 10–100 ng of purified recombinant GST-rIPK2 or GST-rIPK1 were incubated independently with 1–10 μm [3H]inositol, [3H]I(1)P, [3H]I(1,4)P2, [3H]I(1,3,4)P3, [3H]I(1,4,5)P3, [3H]I(1,3,4,5)P4, or [3H]I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 2 mm ATP, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 0.2 units/μl phosphocreatine kinase. To determine whether the IP4 product of I(1,4,5)P3 phosphorylation was I(1,3,4,5)P4 or I(1,4,5,6)P4, the reaction was terminated by incubation for 3 min at 95 °C and then dispensed in half. One half of the reaction was incubated with 100 ng of purified recombinant type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (9Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol.

To test whether rIPK2 or rIPK1 phosphorylated a range of different inositol polyphosphates, 100 ng of GST-rIPK2 or GST-rIPK1 were incubated independently with 10 μm I(1,4,5)P3, I(1,3,4,5)P4, I(1,3,4,6)P4, I(1,4,5,6)P4, or I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and a trace amount of [γ-32P]ATP (200,000 cpm) for 30 min at 37 °C. All reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 times the reaction volume of 10 mm NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.5) and analyzed by HPLC as described previously (5York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Blotting Analysis—2 × 105 Rat-1 cells stably expressing the indicated plasmid were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes containing 5 ml of the appropriate media with or without 2 μg/ml doxycycline and cultured for 2–3 days. Cells were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted with 200 μl of ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete™ Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml of buffer). After a 15-min incubation on ice, the lysate was recovered by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C). The supernatants were subjected to protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. One microgram of cell lysates was separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunostaining of gels was carried out using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech). Fluorescence Microscopy—Rat-1 cells stably expressing GFP fusion constructs were washed with prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution and observed under the Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a confocal head using a LCPlan Fl 40×/0.60 numerical aperture lens. Images were recorded using UltraVIEW™ imaging software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). myo-[3H]Inositol Labeling, Isolation, and Analysis of Soluble Inositol Phosphates—S. cerevisiae cells carrying expression plasmid were grown in 1 ml of complete minimal medium lacking uracil with 100 μm CuSO4 and 40 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol to late logarithmic phase. The cells were harvested, and the soluble lysate containing the inositol polyphosphates was isolated according to York et al. (5York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). 1 × 105 Rat-1 cells stably expressing the indicated plasmid were seeded into a 60-mm culture dish containing 3 ml of appropriate media. One day after incubation, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of prewarmed Medium-199 and then labeled with 10–20 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol for 2 days in 2 ml of Medium-199 supplemented with dialyzed 10% FBS with or without 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in 500 μl of 1 n HCl. The soluble fraction containing the inositol polyphosphates was isolated as mentioned above. To determine whether the IP5 product in the rIPK2-expressing Rat-1 cells was I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, the lysate was dried using a SpeedVac and resuspended to 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). The lysate was incubated with 100 ng of purified recombinant GST-AtIpk1 for 30 min at 37 °C. Northern Blotting Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Stevenson et al. (33Stevenson J.M. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The entire open reading frame of each gene was used as probe and labeled using Ready-To-Go™ DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Colony Formation Assay in Soft Agar—5 × 104 Rat-1 cells stably expressing the indicated plasmid were seeded into a 35-mm culture dish containing 1 ml of culture media with 0.4% agar. The dishes had been coated with 2 ml of culture media containing 0.7% agar. Cells were fed with 0.5 ml of culture media containing 0.4% agar once a week. Colony formation was scored after 3 weeks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cloning of Rat IPK2 and Rat IPK1 Orthologs—To investigate the function of inositol polyphosphates in mammalian cells, we first cloned rat orthologs of IPK2 and IPK1. Saiardi et al. (10Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Sawa A. Luo X. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have published the cloning of rIPK2, so we used this sequence information for cloning (see “Experimental Procedures”). When we started this project, the DNA sequence information of rIPK1 was not available. However, we could use both the human and mouse sequences of IPK1. These two orthologs possess about 88% identity at the DNA level. Based on this information, we designed cloning primers for rIPK1 and performed RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rat ortholog of IPK1 possesses 91.9 and 96.3% of amino acid identity to the human and mouse orthologs, respectively. The rIPK1 contains the conserved motifs EXKPK, CRXC, (F/Y)CPLDL, and D(L/V)DLK(P/S)X(E/M) (13Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002;"
https://openalex.org/W2021597184,"Emerging evidence suggests that Ca2+ release evoked by certain G-protein-coupled receptors can be voltage-dependent; however, the relative contribution of different components of the signaling cascade to this response remains unclear. Using the electrically inexcitable megakaryocyte as a model system, we demonstrate that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ mobilization stimulated by several agonists acting via Galphaq-coupled receptors is potentiated by depolarization and that this effect is most pronounced for ADP. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ release was not induced by direct elevation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, by agents mimicking diacylglycerol actions, or by activation of phospholipase Cgamma-coupled receptors. The response to voltage did not require voltage-gated Ca2+ channels as it persisted in the presence of nifedipine and was only weakly affected by the holding potential. Strong predepolarizations failed to affect the voltage-dependent Ca2+ increase; thus, an alteration of G-protein betagamma subunit binding is also not involved. Megakaryocytes from P2Y1(-/-) mice lacked voltage-dependent Ca2+ release during the application of ADP but retained this response after stimulation of other Galphaq-coupled receptors. Although depolarization enhanced Ca2+ mobilization resulting from GTPgammaS dialysis and to a lesser extent during AlF4- or thimerosal, these effects all required the presence of P2Y1 receptors. Taken together, the voltage dependence to Ca2+ release via Galphaq-coupled receptors is not due to control of G-proteins or down-stream signals but, rather, can be explained by a voltage sensitivity at the level of the receptor itself. This effect, which is particularly robust for P2Y1 receptors, has wide-spread implications for cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2083229127,"The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promotes tumor progression through activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. MMP-9 is a gelatinase secreted by both cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells, and it contributes to TNF-α-stimulated tumor invasion and metastasis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), the catalytic component of positive transcription elongation factor-b, phosphorylates serine 2 residues in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II for productive transcription elongation and is up-regulated upon exposure to various stresses. This study investigated roles of CDK9 in TNF-α-stimulated MMP-9 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. CDK9 activity was inhibited using three different strategies, including the CDK9 pharmacological inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a dominant-negative CDK9, and a CDK9-specific small interfering RNA. All three approaches reduced TNF-α-mediated accumulation of MMP-9 in the conditioned media as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transforming growth factor-β1-induced accumulation of MMP-2 was unaffected by DRB. Expression of the MMP-9 gene was examined using reverse transcription real time PCR and using a transient transfection assay to evaluate MMP-9 promoter activity. DRB reduced the TNF-α-induced increase in MMP-9 mRNA levels but did not effect transforming growth factor-β1-induced MMP-2 mRNA expression. Consistently DRB and dominant-negative CDK9 completely abrogated TNF-α-stimulated human MMP-9 promoter activity. TNF-α did not regulate expression or localization of CDK9 or its regulatory partner Cyclin T. However, TNF-α stimulated CDK9 binding to Cyclin T and MMP-9 gene occupancy by both CDK9 and the serine 2-phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II. Our findings indicate that CDK9 mediates TNF-α-induced MMP-9 transcription. Disruption of TNF-α signaling using CDK9 inhibitors could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against tumor invasion and metastasis. The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promotes tumor progression through activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. MMP-9 is a gelatinase secreted by both cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells, and it contributes to TNF-α-stimulated tumor invasion and metastasis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), the catalytic component of positive transcription elongation factor-b, phosphorylates serine 2 residues in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II for productive transcription elongation and is up-regulated upon exposure to various stresses. This study investigated roles of CDK9 in TNF-α-stimulated MMP-9 expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. CDK9 activity was inhibited using three different strategies, including the CDK9 pharmacological inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), a dominant-negative CDK9, and a CDK9-specific small interfering RNA. All three approaches reduced TNF-α-mediated accumulation of MMP-9 in the conditioned media as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transforming growth factor-β1-induced accumulation of MMP-2 was unaffected by DRB. Expression of the MMP-9 gene was examined using reverse transcription real time PCR and using a transient transfection assay to evaluate MMP-9 promoter activity. DRB reduced the TNF-α-induced increase in MMP-9 mRNA levels but did not effect transforming growth factor-β1-induced MMP-2 mRNA expression. Consistently DRB and dominant-negative CDK9 completely abrogated TNF-α-stimulated human MMP-9 promoter activity. TNF-α did not regulate expression or localization of CDK9 or its regulatory partner Cyclin T. However, TNF-α stimulated CDK9 binding to Cyclin T and MMP-9 gene occupancy by both CDK9 and the serine 2-phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II. Our findings indicate that CDK9 mediates TNF-α-induced MMP-9 transcription. Disruption of TNF-α signaling using CDK9 inhibitors could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against tumor invasion and metastasis. Metastasis is one of the six hallmarks of cancer (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

Moreover TNF-α promotes carcinoma progression, at least in part, through stimulating malignant epithelial cell migration, invasion, and subsequent metastasis (7Rosen E.M. Goldberg I.D. Liu D.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-9 also promotes tumor angiogenesis through remodeling of the vascular structure and release of matrix-trapped angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (10Kalluri R.

Tremendous effort has been invested in understanding intracellular signaling pathways that mediate activation of expression of TNF-α-responsive genes. It is known that the signaling molecule protein kinase C and the transcription factors NF-κB and activator protein-1 are essential for induction of MMP-9 by TNF-α (12Esteve P.O. Chicoine E.

Balkwill F.R. Owens D.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4728-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for activation of the MMP-9 promoter by TNF-α upon NF-κB binding remain largely unknown.Positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb), which is comprised of CDK9 and its regulatory partner Cyclin T, converts RNA polymerase II from a transcription initiation-competent form into a transcription elongation-competent form via phosphorylation of serine 2 residues in the heptapeptide repeats of the C-terminal domain (21Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of CDK9 have been identified with the apparent molecular mass of 55 (CDK955) and 42 kDa (CDK942), respectively (22Shore S.M. Byers S.A. Maury W. Price D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 307: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CDK955 expression is regulated by a second promoter located upstream of the transcription start point used to generate mRNAs encoding CDK942. Both isoforms are able to bind to Cyclin T1 and phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (22Shore S.M. Byers S.A. Maury W. Price D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 307: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite a well characterized role of P-TEFb in regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, long terminal repeat promoter by Tat (23Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), our understanding of the roles of P-TEFb in regulating transcription of cellular genes and cell behavior is still limited. Expression and activity of P-TEFb appears to be regulated by diverse physiological and pathological cues in a variety of cell types. Proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, increase levels of CDK9 and Cyclin T upon activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes (24Herrmann C.H. Carroll R.G. Wei P. Jones K.A. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9881-9888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ghose R. Liou L.Y. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11336-11343Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of the CDK955 and CDK942 isoforms varies according to cell type and experimental condition (22Shore S.M. Byers S.A. Maury W. Price D.H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 307: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of CDK9 can be stimulated by stress (26Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q.

In addition to regulation of P-TEFb function at levels of expression and catalytic activity, selective promoter loading of P-TEFb by sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors provides temporal and spatial regulation of P-TEFb function. For example, P-TEFb can be recruited by NF-κB (33Barboric M. Nissen R.M. Kanazawa S. Jabrane-Ferrat N. Peterlin B.M. Mol.

Our results indicated that CDK9 was essential for the induction of MMP-9 by TNF-α. Inhibition of CDK9 activity diminished the TNF-α-stimulated increase in MMP-9 transcript and enzymatic activity in the conditioned media. Furthermore CDK9 was required for regulation of the MMP-9 promoter by TNF-α as demonstrated by a reduction in the TNF-α-induced MMP-9 promoter activity upon introduction of 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) and dominant-negative CDK9. Moreover TNF-α up-regulated CDK9 binding to Cyclin T. Lastly TNF-α stimulated CDK9 binding and phosphorylation of serine 2 of RNA Pol II on the MMP-9 gene in A549 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that CDK9 mediates the MMP-9 response to TNF-α in human lung adenocarcinoma cells via a transcriptional regulatory mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The pharmacological inhibitor of CDK9, DRB, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. DRB and PMA were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C. The pNF-κB-Luc reporter construct (NF-κB.Luc) harboring five repeats of the NF-κB enhancer element was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pRL-TK vector expressing Renilla luciferase driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The MMP-9pGL-3 reporter construct (MMP-9.Luc) in which expression of firefly luciferase is regulated by the human MMP-9 promoter (37Sanceau J. Boyd D.D. Seiki M. Bauvois B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35766-35775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Boyd at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. CMV2-FLAG (pFlag) and CMV2-FLAG-CDK9dn (CDK9dn), which express the epitope FLAG or FLAG-tagged dominant-negative CDK9 fusion protein (38Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. A. P. Rice at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Recombinant human TNF-α and TGF-β1 were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and stored at –80 °C. The Silencer Validated siRNA targeting human CDK9 (CDK9si) and the negative control siRNA (CTLsi) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for CDK9 (C-20), a goat polyclonal antibody specific for Cyclin T1 (T-18), and a goat polyclonal antibody specific for actin (I-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for RNA Pol II with serine 2 or serine 5 phosphorylated in the C-terminal domain (H5 and H14) were purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA).Cell Culture—The human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. To serum-starve cells, A549 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h prior to further treatments.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—A549 cells were split and seeded into a 24-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. On the next day, 50 ng of each luciferase reporter (firefly and Renilla) construct was co-transfected into A549 cells along with the indicated amount of either pFlag or CDK9dn plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were serum-starved for 24 h after transfection and then exposed to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. The treated cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold) along with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. Variation in transfection efficiency was monitored and corrected with co-transfected pRL-TK. The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity in each sample served as a measurement of normalized luciferase activity. The -fold change of normalized luciferase activity was obtained by setting the values from the untreated cells at one. To determine the effect of DRB on the response of the MMP-9 promoter to TNF-α, transient transfections were performed essentially the same as above except that increasing doses of DRB were added simultaneously with TNF-α to the transfected cells in place of the CDK9dn.siRNA Transfection—A549 cells were seeded into 6-well culture dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. On the following day the cells were transfected with 50 pmol of either CDK9si or CTLsi using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One group of cells was exposed to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) 36 h after transfection. The transfected cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer at 36 h postexposure to TNF-α and boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were immunoblotted for CDK9 as described below. Conditioned medium was also collected for gelatin zymography.Fractionation and Immunoblots—Serum-starved A549 cells were exposed to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The treated cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli buffer. To fractionate the cells, the stimulated cells were lysed as described for the chromatin immunoprecipitation except for the cross-linking step. The nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g, resuspended in the sonication buffer, and designated as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and designated as the cytosolic fraction. The concentration of each protein sample was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Equal amounts of total protein from each sample were loaded into precast Novex Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted for CDK9, Cyclin T1, RNA Pol II with serine 2 phosphorylated, and actin as described previously (39Garriga J. Peng J. Parreno M. Price D.H. Henderson E.E. Grana X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3093-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Real Time Reverse Transcription PCR—Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed to determine mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the A549 cells subjected to the indicated treatments. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out with 2 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT)20 in a reaction volume of 20 μl using a cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided. Real time PCR was carried out in 20 μl of PCR mixture consisting of 10 μl of 2× iQ SYBR Green Supermix and 2 μl of each cDNA sample on an iCycler iQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) in duplicates. The PCRs were recorded in real time and analyzed using the accompanying program, iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system software Version 3.0A (Bio-Rad). The mRNA level of the 36B4 housekeeping gene was also determined by real time reverse transcription-PCR in each cDNA sample to normalize the expression of genes of interest (GOI). All the PCR primers used were designed using Beacon Designer 2.0 (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used were as follows: human 36B4 (GenBank™ accession number NM001002), forward primer (nucleotides 97–116), 5′-CGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTAC-3′, and reverse primer (nucleotides 205–188) 5′-ATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG-3′; human MMP-2 (GenBank™ accession number NM004530), forward primer (nucleotides 2219–2236) 5′-AGTCTGAAGAGCGTGAAG-3′, and reverse primer (nucleotides 2410–2392) 5′-CCAGGTAGGAGTGAGAATG-3′; human MMP-9 (GenBank™ accession number NM004994), forward primer (nucleotides 1156–1173), 5′-TGACAGCGACAAGAAGTG-3′, and reverse primer (nucleotides 1298–1280) 5′-CAGTGAAGCGGTACATAGG-3′. The PCR condition for each particular amplicon was optimized using a series of one to eight dilutions of cDNA samples to establish a linear relationship between threshold cycle (Ct) values and the input amount of cDNA (a correlation coefficient >95%) and to achieve PCR efficiency around 100% (±5%). A one-cycle difference in the Ct values among samples can be converted into a 2-fold difference in the amount of cDNA when these two parameters are around 100%. The optimal PCR condition for MMP-9 was 95 °C for 20 s followed by 60 °C for 30 s. The optimal PCR condition for MMP-2 was 95 °C for 20 s followed by 58 °C for 30 s. The optimal PCR condition for 36B4 was 95 °C for 20 s followed by 58 °C for 20 s. Melt curve analysis was performed at the end of each PCR to confirm the specificity of the PCR product. To compare mRNA levels of genes of interest, Ct values of GOI among samples were compared after correction for 36B4 expression. The ratio of GOI versus the corresponding 36B4 of each sample was determined based on the equation GOI/36B4 = 2Ct(36B4) – Ct(GOI) (40Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24795) Google Scholar, 41Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The ratio of MMP/36B4 was compared among samples, and the -fold change of GOI expression was obtained by setting the values from the untreated cells to one.Gelatin Zymography—Serum-starved A549 cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml TNF-α or TGF-β1 with or without increasing doses of DRB. Conditioned medium was collected 48 h after the specified treatments and processed for gelatin zymography. The medium was concentrated using Microcon Ym10 concentrators (Millipore). Twenty μg of concentrated protein was used for gelatin zymography using precast Novex gelatin zymogram gels (Invitrogen) as described previously (42Becerril C. Pardo A. Montano M. Ramos C. Ramirez R. Selman M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified human MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used as migration standards for the assays. The intensity of MMP-9/-2 gelatinolytic zones on the gels was quantified using the AlphaImager 2200 documentation analysis system with AlphaEase Version 5.04 stand alone software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts prepared from A549 cells subjected to the indicated experimental conditions were used in immunoprecipitations with antibodies specific for Cyclin T1 as described elsewhere (43Haaland R.E. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly the TNF-α-stimulated A549 cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol). One milligram of each lysate was precleared with bovine serum albumin/Protein G-agarose slurry (Invitrogen) followed by immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of Cyclin T1-specific antibody. The amount of CDK9 in the immune complexes was determined by immunoblotting as described above.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Real Time PCR—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described elsewhere with minor modifications (44Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Shan B. Xu J. Zhuo Y. Morris C.A. Morris G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44009-44017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly A549 cells were serum-starved for 48 h followed by exposure to TNF-α and/or DRB for the indicated times. The treated A549 cells were then cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Sheared chromatin prepared from roughly 107 cells was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the antibody specific for CDK9, 5 μl of the antibodies for RNA Pol II with serine 2 or serine 5 phosphorylated, or a negative control antibody. The immunoprecipitated DNA was then recovered using a standard ethanol precipitation procedure with the addition of 20 μg of yeast tRNA as a carrier. The precipitated DNA was air-dried and dissolved in 40 μl of nuclease-free water. Each sample of 2 μl was used for real time PCR in duplicates as described above. The primers for the human MMP-9 gene (GenBank™ accession number NM004994) were: forward primer (nucleotides 38–55), 5′-CTGGTCCTGGTGCTCCTG-3′; reverse primer (nucleotides 148–130), 5′-CTGCCTGTCGGTGAGATTG-3′. The primers for the human 36B4 gene are as described above. The PCR primers were designed to amplify the coding regions with fewer than 25 nucleotides downstream of the ATG site. The optimal PCR condition allowing quantitative analysis was established as described above. The optimal PCR condition for MMP-9 (nucleotides 38–148) is 95 °C for 20 s followed by 60 °C for 30 s. The input of MMP-9 and 36B4 genes for each immunoprecipitation was determined by real time PCR. The ratios of immunoprecipitated MMP-9 or 36B4 gene versus the corresponding input for each sample were determined based on Ct values as described above and compared across the samples to assess change in abundance of CDK9 or phosphorylated RNA Pol II-occupied MMP-9 and 36B4 genes. The -fold change was established by setting the values in the unstimulated cells to one. The amount of immunoprecipitated MMP-9 and 36B4 by a specific antibody was 2–4 times more than that immunoprecipitated with a control antibody.RESULTSRequirement of CDK9 for TNF-α-stimulated Expression of MMP-9 Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells—To investigate a potential role of CDK9 in TNF-α-stimulated expression, we examined MMP-9 activity in the conditioned media from TNF-α-stimulated cells in the presence or absence of DRB, a pharmacological inhibitor of CDK9. A549 cells were used as our experimental system due to its intact response to TNF-α (46Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Gelatin zymography was utilized to evaluate MMP-9 activity in the conditioned media collected from the treated cells. Serum-starved A549 cells exhibited a gradual increase in MMP-9 activity over time in response to exposure to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) with an appreciable increase at 24 h and a peak at 48 h postexposure (Fig. 1A). In contrast, MMP-2, the other member of the type IV collagenase family, was not affected by TNF-α (Fig. 1A). DRB substantially reduced TNF-α-stimulated MMP-9 activity at 48 h in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal 80% decrease at a concentration of 20 μm (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 2 and 4–6). The solvent Me2SO alone had little effect on MMP-9 activity (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 3 versus lane 2). MMP-2 was not altered by either TNF-α or DRB (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). These findings suggested that the inhibitory effect of DRB on MMP-9 response to TNF-α was not due to global inhibition of gene expression. To further address the concern of a global inhibitory effect of DRB, we examined the effect of DRB upon induction of MMP-2 in response to TGF-β1. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of DRB on TNF-α induction of MMP-9, MMP-2 activity in the conditioned media was induced and remained elevated in the presence of DRB at a dose capable of blocking the MMP-9 response to TNF-α (Fig. 1C). These findings indicate that DRB selectively inhibits the MMP-9 response to TNF-α (Fig. 1, compare B and C). Similar observations were made in A549 cells cultured in serum-free media exposed to the treatments as above (data not shown), indicating that the components in the residual serum did not contribute to the observations. The tumor promoter PMA activates MMP-9 expression through activation of NF-κB as does TNF-α (18Sat"

One alternatively spliced neuregulin-1 form has a distinct heparin-binding immunoglobulin-like domain that enables it to adhere to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at key locations during development and substantially potentiates its activity. We examined the structural specificity needed for neuregulin-1-heparin interactions using a gel mobility shift assay together with an assay that measures the ability of specific oligosaccharides to block erbB receptor phosphorylation in L6 muscle cells. Whereas the N-sulfate group of heparin was most important, the 2-O-sulfate and 6-O-sulfate groups also contributed to neuregulin-1 binding in these two assays. Optimal binding to neuregulin-1 required eight or more heparin disaccharides; however, as few as two disaccharides were still able to bind neuregulin-1 to a lesser extent. The physiological importance of this specificity was shown both by chemical and siRNA treatment of cultured muscle cells. Pretreatment of muscle cells with chlorate that blocks all sulfation or with an siRNA that selectively blocks N-sulfation significantly reduced erbB receptor activation by neuregulin-1 but had no effect on the activity of neuregulin-1 that lacks the heparin-binding domain. These results suggest that the regulation of glycosaminoglycan sulfation is an important biological mechanism that can modulate both the localization and potentiation of neuregulin-1 signaling.

HSPGs have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell adhesion, motility, proliferation, differentiation, tissue morphogenesis, and carcinogenesis (4Turnbull J.

Many of these biological processes are mediated through numerous heparin-binding growth and differentiation factors that include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) (6Deguchi Y. Okutsu H. Okura T.

The NRGs have many functions in the nervous system and cardiac development and in the regulation of cell growth and carcinogenesis (12Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Four NRG genes have been discovered thus far of which NRG1 is the best characterized. The NRG1 gene produces multiple alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble isoforms. Soluble isoforms of NRG1 are composed of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is sufficient for receptor binding and activation of homodimers and heterodimers of erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4, and an immunoglobulin-like domain, NH2-terminal to the EGF-like domain, that is responsible for binding heparin (13Li Q.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interactions with HSPGs appear to direct the distribution of NRG1 in the developing nervous system. For example, HSPGs including agrin become restricted to the basal lamina of neuromuscular synapses coincident with NRG1 during embryonic development in the chick (16Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development. 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here agrin and NRG1 can work synergistically by forming localized complexes that optimally concentrate acetylcholine receptors at the synapses (17Li Q. Esper R.M. Loeb J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 558-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This synergy results by both potentiation of NRG1-induced erbB receptor phosphorylation and by producing a sustained signal critical for up-regulating acetylcholine receptor genes (13Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NRG1 accumulation along early motor and sensory axons, radial glia, spinal axonal tracts, and neuroepithelial cells through associations with HSPGs raises other potentially important roles for NRG1 in nervous system development (16Loeb J.A. Khurana T.S. Robbins J.T. Yee A.G. Fischbach G.D. Development. 1999; 126: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because HSPGs are expressed on the surface of virtually every cell, a key question is how heparin-binding growth factors preferentially associate with HSPGs on some cells but not others. Recent evidence suggests that this specificity may be encoded by the diversity generated by differences in sugar composition and sulfation pattern of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (2Gabius H.J. Naturwissenschaften. 2000; 87: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). HSPGs are composed of repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid or iduronic acid and N-acetyl or N-sulfoglucosamine with potential sulfation sites located on the amino group or positions 2, 3, and 6 of each sugar molecule (19Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Both FGF1 and FGF2 require N-sulfated pentasaccharide sequences for optimal binding but differ in the requirements for O-sulfation (20Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Sturiale L. Gimenez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30744-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and lipoprotein lipase all depend on the presence of one or more N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfate groups (21Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol.

Sinay P. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further specificity in the FGF signaling system may also result from either simultaneous or sequential interactions between heparan sulfate and FGF and its receptors (25Allen B.L. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here we have defined specific structural features required for NRG1-heparin interactions and shown the physiological importance of these features in vitro. We demonstrate a clear hierarchy of importance for specific sulfate groups with the N-sulfate group being most important followed by 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups for binding to NRG1 and blocking erbB receptor phosphorylation. Consistently, the removal of all of the endogenous sulfate groups with chlorate or selective blockade of N-sulfation with an siRNA directed against the enzyme that promotes N-sulfation resulted in decreased NRG1-induced erbB receptor activation. This specificity provides a means by which tissues can localize and potentiate NRG1 signaling through modifications in GAG composition. Reagents—Recombinant human NRG1 β1-polypeptides were from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). The isolated EGF-like domain corresponded to amino acids 177–246, and the intact IgEGF form of NRG1 corresponded to amino acids 14–246. Sodium chlorate was purchased from Sigma. The heparan sulfate antibody, 10e4, was from Seikagaku. De-N-sulfated, De-2-O-sulfated, and De-6-O-sulfated heparins were prepared as described previously (27Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Different sized heparin fragments from 12 to 2 disaccharides in length were prepared by high resolution gel chromatography of low molecular weight heparin as described previously (28Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For all of the experiments, the heparins were used at equal weight/volume (μg/ml) concentrations. Cell Cultures and Western Blots for p185 Phosphorylation—L6 cells were used to quantify erbB receptor phosphotyrosine (p185) as described previously (13Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well and grown for 8 days. Chlorate was filter-sterilized and incubated with L6 cells for 2 days prior to the assay. Inhibition assays of p185 were performed by preincubating 75 pm IgEGF NRG1 and various concentrations of the heparins at room temperature for 20 min. 150 μl of this mixture was then applied to 8-day-old L6 cells for 45 min at 37 °C in 10% CO2. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were solubilized in 50 μl of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min as described previously (13Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 15 μl of this buffer was resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The phosphorylated forms of the erbB receptors (p185) were detected by Western blot analysis using the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) and then verified and quantified by reprobing with a mixture of antibodies against erbB2 (Neomarkers Ab-17) and erbB3 (Neomarkers Ab-6). Quantitation was performed by determining the ratio of p185/(erbB2 + erbB3) using Metamorph imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp.) on non-saturated images as described previously (29Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assay (GMSA)—NRG1 alone or NRG1 plus various heparins at various concentrations were incubated with binding buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min and run on a 6% (29:1 acrylamide:bis) non-denaturing gel (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min at 200 V as described previously (30Wu Z.L.

Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the electrophoresis buffer consisted of 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, changing the pH to 9.0 above the isoelectric point of NRG1 (pI = 8.8) did not appreciably change the mobility of NRG1 with or without added heparin. However, the band resolution was sharper at pH 8.0 and was therefore used for our studies here. Protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) for 1 h at 100 V. NRG1 bands were detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (AD03) developed against the IgEGF polypeptide (Assay Designs Inc.). The filters were then probed with a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase (Chemicon) and exposed to X-blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.) after treatment with chemiluminescence reagents, and the bands were quantified as above. siRNA Silencing—siRNA molecules were designed with on-line software from Qiagen using the entire rat NDST-1 cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number M92042). The target sequence of 1406–1427 was chosen because of a 19/21-base pair identity to NDST-2. 24 h after plating, L6 cells were incubated with either 2 μg of NDST siRNA or random non-silencing siRNA (Qiagen) in 12 μl of suspension buffer diluted to 200 μl of L6 media. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days and either treated with NRG1 for 45 min followed by phosphotyrosine Western blot as above. Parallel siRNA-treated cultures were used to document reduced NDST mRNA levels by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and sulfation activity by immunostaining with an N-sulfate-specific antibody. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. To reduce genomic DNA contamination, the column was treated with DNase (137.5 μg/ml) for 15 min. The concentration of mRNA eluted from the column was measured using the Ribogreen kit (Molecular Probes), and 1 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The following primers were designed using Primer Express software against NDST-1: primer set 1 (forward 5′-GAG GAC AAA CGC CAC AAA GAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGG CTG TGG TGC CTG TTT T-3′); primer set 2 (forward, 5′-CCA GCT CCG AGA CCT TTG AG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTG TTG GAG GGA ATA GGG AAG A-3′); primer set 3 (forward, 5′-AAA GTG ATG GAC ACA GTG CAG AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCT GGC ACC AAA ATC CTT TC-3′); and GAPDH (forward, 5′-AGT ATG ACT CTA CCC ACG GCA AGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCT CGC TCC TGG AAG ATG GT-3′). Each of these primer sets produced a single band of the correct size of ∼100 bp. We used Amplitaq Gold polymerase (Promega) with the following cycling parameters: 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 50 s. For real-time quantitative PCR, we used the SybrGreen system (Molecular Probes) on an MJ Research Opticon machine and calculated the change in gene expression relative to GAPDH for each sample as described previously (29Esper R.M. Loeb J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6218-6227Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed on L6 cells plated at 50,000 cells/well on an 8-well Flexiperm chamber and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked for 40 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the 10e4 antibody at a 1:30 dilution in the block buffer overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 × 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline, and then visualized with Alexa 546 goat-anti-mouse IgM (Molecular Probes) at 1:300 for 2 h at room temperature using a Nikon Eclipse 600 epifluorescent microscope with a Princeton Micromax cooled CCD camera. Quantitation of fluorescence was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) in a similar manner as described previously (17Li Q. Esper R.M. Loeb J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 558-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The entire fields of three separate pairs of NDST-1 siRNA and control siRNA-treated cells from 8-well Flexiperm chambers were compared after subtracting the background of nearby regions without cells. siRNA-treated cells were reduced to 39, 43, and 60% of the values from control-treated cells, which gave an average of a 47 (± 11)% reduction relative to the control. The mean ± S.E. represents one standard deviation. Specific Heparin Sulfate Groups Are Required for NRG1 Binding—We prepared a set of chemically modified heparins lacking either all of the sulfate groups (completely desulfated), the N-sulfate groups (De-N-sulfated), the 2-O-sulfate groups (De-2-O-sulfated), or the 6-O-sulfate groups (De-6-O-sulfated) to assess their importance in heparin-NRG1 interactions using a GMSA modeled after that described by Rosenberg and colleagues (30Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Yabe T. Kuberan B. Beeler D.L. Love A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17121-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Heparin oligosaccharides were chosen, because they were highly and uniformly sulfated, but had a high degree of structural similarity to the endogenous cell-surface heparan sulfates (32Honke K. Taniguchi N. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 637-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This GMSA utilized a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which separated protein/oligosaccharide complexes based on their charge to mass ratio and conformation. The buffer conditions were optimized so that NRG1 (pI = 8.8) was close to a net neutral charge, resulting in minimal mobility in the charged field (Fig. 1A). However, when complexed with heparin, NRG1-heparin complexes migrated further and demonstrated a “shift” in the mobility of NRG1 by Western blot. Fig. 1A shows that increasing concentrations of heparin shift NRG1 in a dose-dependent manner that is quantified in Fig. 1B.Fig. 1Heparin binds and shifts NRG1 in a dose-dependent fashion.A, 35 ng of NRG1 was incubated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μg/ml heparin for 20 min and run on a non-denaturing gel. As the heparin concentration was increased, NRG1 shifted in a dose-dependent manner to form NRG1-heparin complexes as determined by Western blot using a NRG1 antibody and quantified in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using this gel mobility shift assay, we compared fully sulfated heparin to completely desulfated and De-N-sulfated heparin. The completely desulfated heparin was unable to shift NRG1 mobility (Fig. 2A). This is not surprising because the relatively neutrally charged desulfated heparin should have very low mobility even if complexed with NRG1. However, the De-N-sulfated sugars, which should still migrate in the electric field, also did not shift NRG1, suggesting a critical importance of N-sulfation for NRG1 binding. We next examined the importance of 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation on NRG1 binding using heparins lacking each of these groups. Both of these chemically modified heparins were equally effective in shifting NRG1, although not as effective as fully sulfated heparin, and more effective than the De-N-sulfated heparin. This finding suggests an intermediate but equal importance of these two sulfate groups for NRG1 binding (Fig. 2B). The Same Rank Order of Desulfated Heparins Block NRG1-induced Receptor Phosphorylation in L6 Muscle Cells—A limitation of our gel shift assays using Western blots for NRG1 rather than radiolabeled oligosaccharides, as has been done for other heparin-binding proteins (30Wu Z.L.

Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was that unbound NRG1 barely entered the gel, even at a higher pH. This produced variability in the intensity of the NRG1 band representing unbound NRG1 at the top of the gel. Because of this problem and as a second independent means to confirm the relative importance of specific heparin sulfation patterns on heparin-NRG1 interactions, we examined the ability of these same desulfated heparins to block erbB receptor phosphorylation in L6 muscle cells. Although the exact mechanism by which soluble heparins block erbB receptor activation is not known, it is a useful assay to compare the affinity of NRG1-heparin interactions in a biologically relevant system and has been used previously to define the relative affinities of different sulfated oligosaccharides (14Loeb J.A. Fischbach G.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that NRG1-induced erbB receptor phosphorylation is inhibited by fully sulfated heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. 3B shows a reduced efficacy for each of the modified heparins to block NRG1-induced erbB receptor phosphorylation. Similar to the gel mobility shift assay, completely desulfated and De-N-sulfated heparins had little inhibition even at 100 μg/ml. Similarly, the 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparins again showed similar intermediate effects compared with fully sulfated heparin. The results were quantified in Fig. 3C and were presented as a percentage of control. Curiously, low concentrations (1 μg/ml) of the De-N-sulfated heparin had a modest stimulatory effect on receptor phosphorylation. This reproducible observation raises the possibility that low concentrations of a low affinity heparin can potentiate erbB receptor activation by releasing NRG1 from endogenous HSPG-binding sites on the cell surface. Heparin Chain Length Effects on NRG1 Binding and erbB Receptor Blockade—The results thus far suggest an importance of the specific sulfation pattern to promote NRG1-heparin interactions and demonstrate an hierarchy of importance for the sulfate groups. We next investigated the importance of chain length on the NRG1-heparin interactions using a set of fully sulfated heparin fragments decreasing in size from 12 to 2 disaccharides on both GMSA (Fig. 4A) and receptor phosphorylation assays (Fig. 4B). As the heparin chain length was decreased, equal weight/volume concentrations of these oligosaccharides produced an upward shift in the predominant NRG1-heparin complex. The relative amount of NRG1 shifted also decreased with shorter heparin chain length, suggesting that longer heparins bind NRG1 more efficiently. If we had used equimolar amounts of each oligosaccharide, we would have expected an even greater difference between the larger and smaller oligosaccharides. The appearance of multiple bands for a given oligosaccharide length raises the possibility that either the multiple NRG1 monomers bind a single heparin chain or multiple oligosaccharide monomers bind a single NRG1. Heparins as small as two disaccharides in length were able to shift small amounts of NRG1 seen on the right side of the gel (and clearly seen on longer film exposures, data not shown). When we compared the ability of various sized heparin fragments to block NRG1-induced receptor phosphorylation parallel to the effects of NRG1 binding in Fig. 4A, we found that, as heparin chain length decreased, its ability to inhibit NRG1-induced erbB receptor phosphorylation was progressively impaired (Fig. 4B). Once the chain length was reduced to approximately four disaccharides or smaller, there was no significant inhibition by heparin. Endogenous Heparan Sulfate Groups Potentiate NRG1-induced erbB Receptor Activation—We have shown previously that endogenous HSPGs significantly enhanced erbB receptor activation by heparin-binding forms of NRG1 (IgEGF) but not by forms of NRG1 that lack the heparin-binding Ig-like domain (EGF) (13Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of endogenous sulfation by treating L6 muscle cells for 48 h with chlorate, which competitively inhibits the formation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, the sulfate donor for sulfotransferase reactions (33Safaiyan F.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using the full-length heparin-binding form of NRG1 (IgEGF), chlorate treatment reduced receptor phosphorylation by 53%, whereas no reduction was seen with the EGF form that lacks the heparin-binding domain (Fig. 5, A and B). This documents the importance of endogenous HSPG sulfate groups to potentiate cellular interactions with NRG1. Based on the specificity observed in the GMSA and erbB phosphorylation inhibition assays, we examined the importance of the endogenous N-sulfate group for HSPG-NRG1 interactions in muscle cells. We did this by reducing endogenous N-sulfation with an siRNA against N-acetylglucosamine N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (NDST-1), which is the most ubiquitously expressed of the four N-sulfotransferase isoforms and shares a close homology with NDST-2 (4Turnbull J. Drummond K. Huang Z. Kinnunen T. Ford-Perriss M. Murphy M. Guimond S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 36Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The treatment of L6 cells with this siRNA resulted in a 2–3-fold reduction in NDST-1 mRNA using three different primer pairs (primer set 1, -2.3-fold; primer set 2, -3.2-fold; and primer set 3, -1.4-fold). The reduction in mRNA levels translated into a 47 (± 11)% reduction in the staining of the N-sulfate groups using 10e4 antibodies that have been shown to require N-sulfate groups for their recognition (Fig. 6A) (37David G. Van der Bai X.M. Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Compared with the control siRNA, NDST-1 siRNA produced a 58% reduction in NRG1-induced (IgEGF) receptor phosphorylation (p = 0.004). An insignificant 20% reduction in NRG1-induced erbB phosphorylation was observed with NDST-1 siRNA treatment using the isolated EGF domain of NRG1 (p = 0.28) (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest an importance of endogenous N-sulfation on NRG1-HSPG interactions that parallels our results with the chemically modified heparins. Given that virtually all of the cells express HSPGs and that the list of heparin-binding factors continues to grow, mechanisms are needed to discriminate which factors bind to and concentrate along a given cell surface in response to dynamic requirements during development and throughout life. Variations in the amount of HSPGs and their specific sulfation patterns are ways that this could be accomplished. If a certain growth factor is needed, the cell could regulate the expression of enzymes that modify the GAG chains accordingly. In fact, regional specificity in HSPG structure has been observed with anti-heparan sulfate monoclonal antibodies, each of which stains a unique region of the skeletal muscle during development (38Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R. Veerkamp J.H. van Kuppevelt T.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4099-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localized expression of two different 6-O-sulfotransferase enzymes in the anterior and posterior proximal chick limb bud, respectively, and a more uniform expression of 2-O-sulfotransferase throughout the entire limb bud suggest that this diversity is not random but highly coordinated during development through the expression of synthetic enzymes (39Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8219-8229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Post-synthetic modifications of heparan sulfate chains have also been described that may regulate the sulfation state of HSPGs through the activation of specific sulfatases. This includes the avian sulfatase Q-sulf1, which targets the S-domains of heparan sulfate and promotes Wnt signaling (40Dhoot G.K. Gustafsson M.K. Ai X. Sun W. Standiford D.M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and the mammalian homologue, Hsulf-1, that has been shown to be required to up-regulate growth factor signaling in cancer (41Lai J. Chien J. Staub J. Avula R. Greene E.L. Matthews T.A. Smith D.I. Kaufmann S.H. Roberts L.R. Shridhar V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23107-23117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Here we have used a set of chemically modified heparins to identify the specific sulfation requirements for optimal NRG1 binding. Using two independent assays, GMSA and erbB receptor phosphorylation, we found a reproducible hierarchy of importance with the N-sulfate groups most important for NRG1-heparin interactions followed by the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups. The similar affinities seen with the De-2-O- and the De-6-O-sulfated heparins suggest that each contributes to NRG1 binding to a similar extent. In addition to the sulfation state, the disaccharide chain length was important for optimal heparin-NRG1 interactions. We showed that, whereas 8–12 disaccharides in length were necessary for maximal binding to NRG1, heparin fragments as small as two disaccharides could still bind but to a limited extent. This raises further questions as to the exact stoichiometry and potential functions of NRG1-heparin interactions with heparins of various sizes. Because the erbB receptors exist as both homodimers and heterodimers, binding multiple NRG1 polypeptides to a given oligosaccharide chain may potentiate erbB receptor signaling. The specific sulfation requirements for NRG1-heparin interactions described here may also help explain the precise localization and potentiation of biological functions of NRG1 that associates with endogenous HSPGs at distinct tissue regions during development (11Loeb J.A. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We found that blocking all of the endogenous HSPG sulfation with chlorate significantly reduced the ability of NRG1 to activate erbB receptors in L6 muscle cells. The effect of chlorate treatment on reducing NRG1 activity in muscle cells was not as pronounced as that seen previously after removing all of the HSPG GAGs with heparitinase (13Li Q. Loeb J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38068-38075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by β-d-xyloside treatment that removes and releases GAGs into the culture media (42Sudhalter J. Whitehouse L. Rusche J.R. Marchionni M.A. Mahanthappa N.K. Glia. 1996; 17: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is perhaps not too surprising, because the desulfation produced by chlorate is often not complete and can be selective for specific sulfate groups (33Safaiyan F. Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Gottfridsson E. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36267-36273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of N-sulfation in mediating NRG1-heparin interactions was substantiated by reducing endogenous N-sulfation in muscle cells using an siRNA against NDST-1. These cells showed a 2-fold reduction in NRG1-induced receptor phosphorylation comparable to the effects seen with chlorate treatment that was not seen with an isolated NRG1 EGF domain that lacks the heparin-binding domain. The effectiveness of the siRNA treatment was documented by a 2–3-fold reduction in NDST-1 mRNA and a corresponding ∼50% decrease in staining intensity with an antibody that requires an N-sulfated glucosamine residue (37David G. Van der Bai X.M. Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 43Van der Bai X.M. Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The relatively modest (∼2-fold) effects seen here with the siRNA treatment may have resulted from residual NDST-1 activity or from compensation by other sulfotransferases (NDST-2–4) (4Turnbull J. Drummond K. Huang Z. Kinnunen T. Ford-Perriss M. Murphy M. Guimond S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the siRNA sequence used against NDST-1 overlapped with NDST-2 for 19 of 21 nucleotides and resulted in an ∼2-fold reduction in NDST-2 mRNA as well (data not shown). Another potential difficulty in interpreting these results stems from the observation that N-sulfation of nascent GAGs of HSPGs is an early step in a sequential process (4Turnbull J. Drummond K. Huang Z. Kinnunen T. Ford-Perriss M. Murphy M. Guimond S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, by silencing NDST-1 expression, we might have also reduced 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation. Taken together, although the chlorate result highlights the general importance of endogenous sulfation, the siRNA results suggest that specific HSPG sulfation patterns modulate NRG1-heparan sulfate interactions important for NRG1 localization and activation. Further analyses of mice with disruptions in genes that regulate heparan sulfation (3Inatani M. Irie F. Plump A.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Yamaguchi Y.

These genes have been shown to be mandatory for neuronal and β-cell functions. Re-introduction of exogenous REST suppresses expression of its target genes, preventing cells from differentiating and secreting insulin in response to glucose in neuronal-like PC12 cells and in insulin-secreting cells, respectively (15Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G.

In vivo, expression of REST target genes is tightly controlled and is thought to be a marker for the terminal differentiation of neuronal cells. The homozygous disruption of REST in mice leads to a precocious expression of its target genes in neuronal progenitors and induces an early embryonic lethality (7Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). On the other hand, suppression of REST target genes by introducing REST in differentiating neurons of chicken causes axon pathfinding errors (17Paquette A.J. Perez S.E. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12318-12323Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal and in non-β-cells, REST silences the expression of its target genes by its two independently acting repressor domains (18Lietz M. Bach K. Thiel G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal repressor domain of REST has been shown to recruit some co-repressors such as mSIN3 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) into the vicinity of the promoter. Histone deacetylation leads to a more compact chromatin that prevents accessibility of transcription factors. The C-terminal repressor domain (CTRD) of REST has been shown to interact with at least one factor, the transcriptional co-repressor CoREST that may serve as a platform protein for the recruitment of molecular machinery that imposes silencing across a chromosomal interval (19Lunyak V.V. Burgess R. Prefontaine G.G. Nelson C. Sze S.H. Chenoweth J. Schwartz P. Pevzner P.A. Glass C. Mandel G. Rosenfeld M.G.

Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Some studies have revealed the existence of additional repression mechanisms mediated by REST. This has been postulated because HDAC inhibitors fail to derepress the CTRD repression of some REST target genes such as GluR2 receptor and SCG10 (21Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 22Naruse Y. Aoki T. Kojima T. Mori N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13691-13696Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this study, we hypothesized that inactivation of transcriptional activators might be an additional mechanism by which REST silences the expression of its target genes. Elucidating such a mechanism could help in understanding the mechanism by which expression of most REST target genes is positively activated in neuronal and β-cells Herein, we showed that the Sp1 transcriptional activator controlled expression of most REST target genes in neuronal-like PC12 cells and in insulin-secreting βTC3 cells where REST is absent. REST prevented Sp1-dependent activation in REST endogenously expressing HeLa cells. This result was reproduced in βTC3 cells transiently expressing REST. Deletion constructs followed by co-immunoprecipitation and transfection assays indicated that the CTRD of REST was required for interaction with Sp1 and inhibited its activity. Altogether, our data indicated that the inhibition of Sp1 is required to silence expression of REST target genes outside neuronal and β-cell types. We propose that the silencing of Sp1 by REST is a required event to determine the β-cell and the neuronal cell expression of REST target genes. Plasmid Construction—Mutation in the sp1 sequence of the MAPK8IP1 promoter (mIB1luc) was generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuikChange ™, Stratagene). In vitro mutagenesis was carried out on full-length human MAPK8IP1 promoter linked to luciferase gene reporter (IB1luc) (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A.

The mutated nucleotides are underlined. To create the plasmid encoding the full-length cDNA of human REST under the control of a CMV promoter, the fragment encompassing the coding region (amino acids 1–1098) of REST was amplified by PCR from RIP REST (6Abderrahmani A.

The plasmids RESTΔC and RESTΔN encode for REST mutants amino acids 1–417 and 212–1098 of REST, which retain either the N-terminal or the C-terminal repression domain of REST. These different fragments of REST were generated by PCR using primers containing BamHI and XbaI restriction sites in the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The primer set used were as follows: RESTΔC sense, 5′-TGGCCGAATGGATCCATGGCCACC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TGAGACTCTAGATTGTTAATTAGGACA-3′ and RESTΔN sense, 5′-GGGAGATGGATCCAAGGGCCCC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TTCAAGTCTAGATCATTACTCCTGCC-3′. The PCR products were then subcloned into pCDNA3 vector. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The construct encoding the Sp1 transcription factor under a CMV promoter (pCMV-Sp1) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, California). Cell Lines, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Human carcinoma HeLa cells, the mouse insulin-secreting βTC3 cells, and the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells that are derived from neural crest-derived tissue were cultured as described previously (6Abderrahmani A.

All cells were transiently transfected using Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then incubated for 48 h, and luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega). RNA Preparation, Reverse Transcription PCR, and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA extraction from cell lines was conducted as described (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G.

For reverse transcription PCR, 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed with the superscript II reverse transcriptase, using random hexamers [pd(N)6] as primers. PCRs were carried out with one-tenth volume of reverse transcription in a final volume of 50 μl using the recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Each PCR cycle consisted of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 s, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. Primer sets used for IB1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (26Okamoto S. Sherman K. Bai G. Lipton S.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 107: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were as follows: sense, 5′-AGTGTCCAGCTTCCCTTGTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-TTACTGTGGCCCTCTCCTTG-3′; the β-actin was amplified with the primer set sense, 5′-AACGGCTCCGGCATGTGCAA-3′ and antisense, 5′-ATTGTAGAAGGTGTGGTGCCA-3′; for connexin 36, the primer set used was sense, 5′-GCAGAACACAGAGACCACCA-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCCACCAGAAACCCAATC-3′. Nuclear Protein Extract Preparation and Electromobility Shift Assays—Nuclear protein extracts and electromobility shift assays were performed as previously reported (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Primers used as labeled probes were as follows: sp1 sense, 5′-TCCGGGGGCGGGGCTGCGG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CCGCAGCCCCGCCCCCGGA-3; MLTF sense, 5′-TAGGTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGGTGTTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAACACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTACACCTA-3′. Complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides were hybridized and then filled in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Roche Diagnostics) in the presence of [γ32P]deoxycytosine triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences). For binding, 5 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated on ice, in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled competitor DNA, for 10 min in 20 μl of a solution containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Approximately 100 fmol of double strand-labeled oligonucleotide were mixed with nuclear proteins, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated on ice with or without SP1 or REST antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min before the addition of the labeled probe. Western Blotting Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear proteins (50 μg) from HeLa and βTC3 cells were prepared and subjected to Western blot as described (23Abderrahmani A. Niederhauser G. Plaisance V. Roehrich M.E. Lenain V. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Waeber G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 100 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.5 μg of the appropriate antibodies (Sp1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 16 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein A-agarose beads (25 μl) were used to precipitate the associated protein. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. The Transcriptional Activator Sp1 Controls the Expression of REST Target Genes—A computer search was performed to identify the regulatory elements that could be responsible for the neuronal and β-cell-specific expression of REST target genes. G/C boxes sequences (GGGGGCGGGGC), consensus nucleotide-binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor, were found in most REST target genes (Table I). This observation is consistent with the fact that the promoters of these genes lack identifiable TATA elements. Independent studies have confirmed the functional implication of Sp1 in expression of some of REST target genes. These include N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, dynamin I, synaptophysin, and glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate-5 genes (24Chew L.J. Yuan X. Scherer S.E. Qie L. Huang F. Hayes W.P. Gallo V. J.

To assess the functionality of G/C box sequences on expression of other REST target genes, βTC3 cells and PC12 cells that contain a detectable expression of some REST target genes (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were treated with mithramycin A, a DNA-binding drug that binds to G/C-specific regions of DNA including G/C box sequences. This has been already shown to prevent subsequent Sp1-binding activity and, therefore, to selectively inhibit the transcription of a number of Sp1-dependent genes (28Blume S.W. Snyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the mRNA levels of REST target genes including MAPK8IP1 encoding IB1/c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1, complexin I, and connexin 36 were decreased by mithramycin A in a dose-dependent manner both in βTC3 and in PC12 cells. In accordance with other studies, mithramycin A did not modify mRNA levels of β-actin (29Zhu G.H. Lenzi M. Schwartz E.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8477-8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Electromobility shift assay analyses confirmed the loss of Sp1-binding activity in βTC3 cells treated with mithramycin A (data not shown). These results indicate that Sp1 is required for expression of REST target genes in cells where REST is absent.Table IExamples of REST target promoters that contain GC-rich regionsGenesMitogen-activated protein kinase 8-interacting protein 1 (MAPK8IP1)Connexin36Complexin 1 (Cplx1)Superior cervical ganglion-10 protein (SCG10)Synapsin I (SYNI)N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDA)Glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2)Glycine receptor subunit α 1PAX4G protein-coupled receptor (GPR10)Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)Dynamin ICorticotropin-releasing hormone gene transcription (CRH)Type II sodium channelCell adhesion molecule L1m4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor Open table in a new tab The Transcriptional Repressor REST Represses Sp1-dependent Activation—As mentioned above, the REST target genes are not expressed outside differentiated neuronal and β-cells that contain the transcriptional repressor REST (1Atouf F.

Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sp1 is also expressed in these cells expressing REST (data not shown). We hypothesized that REST might prevent Sp1-dependent activation of REST target promoters. To verify this hypothesis, we took advantage of the previously described model of the MAPK8IP1 promoter. This promoter region has been previously reported to contain a functional REST-binding motif (NRSE) (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and a sp1 motif was found from positions -202 to -191 upstream of the initiation site of the transcription (Fig. 2A). To determine the functionality of this motif, we generated IB1luc constructs containing either wild type (IB1luc) or mutated (mIB1luc) sp1 motifs. Electromobility shift assays confirmed the inability of the cold-mutated sp1 motif to compete for the sp1-binding pattern compared with the unlabeled wild type sequence in competition experiments (data not shown). IB1luc and mIB1luc were transiently transfected in βTC3 cells. As expected, IB1luc drove a high luciferase activity in βTC3 cells. Moreover, co-introduction of the vector encoding Sp1 (Sp1) increased the luciferase activity of the MAPK8IP1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). This Sp1-dependent activation was abolished when the sp1 motif was mutated, confirming the direct effect of Sp1 on the MAPK8IP1 promoter activity. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with mithramycin A, which acts as a competitor for the binding G/C box sequences (Fig. 2C). In the presence of mithramycin A, the MAPK8IP1 promoter activity was reduced by 50% and the Sp1-mediated activation was abolished. These experiments were confirmed in PC12 cells (data not shown). The inactivation of REST in HeLa cells by using a REST dominant negative has been shown to partly restore the activity of IB1luc (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To examine the implication of Sp1 in this phenomenon, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with IB1luc and the Sp1-encoding vector in the presence of the dominant negative construct of REST (DNREST). DNREST corresponds to the human cDNA encoding only the DNA-binding domain of REST without the two repressor domains of the protein. The mutant has been shown to compete with the wild type protein for the binding to the NRSE (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sp1 did not significantly increase IB1luc activity in the absence of DNREST (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of DNREST, the IB1luc activity was derepressed and overexpression of Sp1 enhanced the IB1luc activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). In contrast, mutation in the sp1 motif reduced by 50% the relieved activity of IB1luc and abolished the Sp1 activation. To validate the negative action of REST on Sp1-induced activation, the IB1luc construct was transiently co-transfected in βTC3 cells in the presence of vectors encoding the human repressor REST and Sp1. As shown in Fig. 4, REST prevented the increase of IB1luc activity mediated by Sp1. This effect was abolished when NRSE was mutated (data not shown), indicating that the silencing of Sp1 requires the presence of the NRSE within the promoter. To verify that the silencing of Sp1 activity is not because of a particular context of the MAPK8IP1 promoter, another Sp1-dependent promoter construct was used. Two copies of the NRSE motif from the MAPK8IP1 promoter have been cloned upstream of the viral SV40 promoter that has been described to be controlled by Sp1 (NRSEluc) (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The constructs were transiently transfected in βTC3 cells in the presence or in the absence of REST and Sp1. In the absence of REST, overexpression of Sp1 increased the activity of NRSE-less SV40 promoter (SV40luc) and NRSEluc by 3-fold (Fig. 5). As expected, REST did not affect the Sp1-mediated activation on the SV40luc. In contrast, REST abolished the Sp1-mediated activation of the NRSEluc. Altogether these results indicate that REST represses the Sp1-mediated activation through the NRSE.Fig. 5REST silences the Sp1-mediated activation on a REST-dependent heterologous promoter. SV40luc and NRSEluc were transiently co-transfected in βTC3 cells with 0.1 μg of Sp1 in the presence or in the absence of REST or the empty vector as a control. REST did not significantly change the luciferase activity of SV40luc, whereas it prevented the Sp1-induced activity of NRSEluc. Experiments were performed at least five times in triplicate. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. **, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Silencing of Sp1-mediated Activation Is Trichostatin A (TSA)-sensitive—Previous studies have shown that the REST-mediated repression of IB1luc is TSA-sensitive (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To assess whether the silencing of Sp1 is HDAC-dependent, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with IB1luc or mIB1luc and incubated for 24h with 100 nm of TSA, a specific inhibitor of HDAC (6Abderrahmani A. Steinmann M. Plaisance V. Niederhauser G. Haefliger J.A. Mooser V. Bonny C. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7256-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the presence of TSA, as expected the luciferase activity of the IB1luc was relieved (Fig. 6). Overexpression of Sp1 increased the IB1luc activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was abolished when the sp1 motif was mutated. This result shows that the REST-mediated silencing of Sp1 activity requires histone deacetylases activity. The CTRD Is Required for Interaction with Sp1 and Abolishes Sp1-dependent Activation—We next explored the possibility that REST might repress expression of its target genes via interaction with Sp1. To assess this hypothesis, we examined the physical interaction of endogenous Sp1 and REST by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 7A, Sp1 and REST were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells. The inclusion in the complex of two co-repressors of REST, mSin3A and HDAC1, was investigated because REST was previously reported to associate with these co-factors to regulate expression of its target genes (15Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). mSin3A and HDAC1 were found to co-precipitate with Sp1 and REST in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells. As a control, we did not detect the presence of the ubiquitous transcription factor E47 in the immunoprecipitate, although it was present in lysates. To confirm these results described above, co-expression followed by coimmunoprecipitation was performed. A REST fused with GFP (REST-GFP) vector was constructed and transfected in HeLa cells. The lysates from cells expressing REST-GFP and GFP (negative control) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP or anti-Sp1 polyclonal antibodies and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-GFP or anti-Sp1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7B, both REST-GFP and GFP expressed in HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. The endogenous Sp1 factor and REST-GFP were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP and anti-Sp1 antibodies. In contrast, Sp1 did not co-precipitate with GFP alone using anti-Sp1 and anti-GFP antibodies. We further examined the domains of REST that were able to interact with Sp1. The REST protein displays a modular structure (18Lietz M. Bach K. Thiel G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain has been localized within the cluster of eight zinc fingers at the N terminus. Two repressor domains have been mapped at the N and the C termini of the protein (31Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Thiel G. Lietz M. Cramer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26891-26899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We constructed expression vectors encoding two mutants of REST that lack either the C-terminal (RESTΔC) or N-terminal repression (RESTΔN) domain of REST (Fig. 8A). Both proteins retain the eight zinc finger cluster that functions as the DNA-binding domain targeting the protein to its target genes and as a signal required for nuclear localization (18Lietz M. Bach K. Thiel G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shimojo M. Lee J.H. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13121-13126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, REST and the REST mutants should interact with the REST-binding site (NRSE) in a sequence-specific manner. Vectors encoding RESTΔN-GFP and RESTΔC-GFP were constructed and were transiently transfected in HeLa cells. GFP and REST-GFP were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The REST-GFP and RESTΔN-GFP were co-immunoprecipitated with Sp1 using Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 8B). However, we did not find immunoprecipitation of Sp1 with GFP and RESTΔC-GFP. We next sought to identify the domains of REST that were able to inhibit Sp1-dependent activation. Transient transfections of IB1luc in the presence of wild type or mutant REST constructs were performed in βTC3 cells. As expected, all REST constructs significantly reduced the luciferase activity of IB1luc in βTC3 cells (Fig. 9A) indicating that REST mutants were functionally active. No effect on IB1luc activity was observed when the NRSE was mutated in the MAPK8IP1 promoter, indicating that these constructs play a direct role through this element (data not shown). To assess the ability of these different mutants to prevent Sp1 activation, βTC3 cells were transiently co-transfected with IB1luc and mutant constructs in the presence of Sp1. The construct encoding the RESTΔN abolished the effect of Sp1, whereas RESTΔC did not inhibit the Sp1-induced activity of IB1luc (Fig. 9B). Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal domain of REST is required for interaction with Sp1 and prevents its transcriptional activation. In this study, we investigated the possibility that REST activity might include the inhibition of a transcriptional activator to control the neuronal- and β-cell expression of its target genes. First, we showed that the ubiquitous transcriptional factor Sp1 plays a key role in the activation of most REST target genes. Conversely, in REST-expressing cells, Sp1 was unable to exert its transcriptional activation on expression of REST target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Sp1 interacted with REST. This interaction required the CTRD of REST, which abolished the Sp1-dependent transcriptional activation. This result confirms the singular role of the CTRD to play different functions including the capture of transcriptional activators. A recent study has shown that CTRD is capable of interacting with the TATA-binding protein, a core promoter factor of the basal transcriptional machinery (34Murai K. Naruse Y. Shaul Y. Agata Y. Mori N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3180-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This interaction highlights another mechanism by which REST silences the expression of its target genes in addition to HDAC activity. Here, we provide evidence that inhibition of the transcriptional factor Sp1, an activator of the transcriptional machinery, is also required for the silencing of REST target genes. Sp1 plays a key role in maintaining expression of genes that lack TATA box. The TATA box is bound by a protein complex called TFIID. TFIID contains the TATA-binding protein and associated factors called TAFs such as hTAFII130, hTAFII55, and dTAFII110 that are also able to interact with Sp1 (35Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 36Philipsen S. Suske G.

Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In the absence of TATA box, Sp1 facilitates the binding of TFIID to the promoter, which in turn initiates the stepwise assembly of the preinitiation transcriptional complex for RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription (41Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 42Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This is followed by the ordered assembly of TFIIA, TFIIB, polymerase II/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH. Sp1 is then thought to be an essential factor for efficient initiation of genes transcription. The fact that REST inhibits Sp1 and the TATA-binding protein activities suggests the hypothesis of an early silencing of the transcriptional machinery. As a possible mechanism, interaction of REST with Sp1 could block the ability of Sp1 to make the necessary contacts with the transcriptional machinery, thus preventing the formation of the initiation transcriptional complex on the core promoter. Consistent with this hypothesis, an interaction of Sp1 with the Krüppel-like zinc finger repressor ZBP-89 has been proposed to interfere the association of Sp1 with hTAFII130 (43Zhang X. Diab I.H. Zehner Z.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2900-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thereby leading to the repression of the vimentin gene expression. Several data showed that the recruitment of HDAC1/2 can also contribute to the inactivation of Sp1. This scenario is supported by the fact that Sp1 co-precipitated with HDAC1 and that the treatment of HeLa cells with TSA, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, allowed Sp1 transcriptional activity to be restored. Moreover, the CTRD can recruit HDAC1/2 (15Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G. Neuron. 2001; 31: 353-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The ability of a repressor to inhibit the transcriptional activators in a HDAC-dependent manner has been observed for the retinoblastoma protein Rb, which exerts transcriptional repression by interacting with the transcription factor E2F. This interaction has been shown both to inhibit activation of E2F and additionally to allow the recruitment of HDAC1 to the E2F site (44Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 45Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Thus, Rb has been proposed to repress the transcription of genes both by interfering with the function of transcriptional activators and by effecting changes in the structure of the chromatin that surrounds the promoter. Similarly, REST could allow the recruitment of HDAC1 to Sp1. This in turn could prevent the interaction with other transcriptional factors and/or the accessibility of other transcriptional activators into the vicinity of the promoter. Compelling data show that REST is able to silence expression of its target genes via different mechanisms. These include the change of chromatin structure and/or the blocking of transcriptional core factor/activator. All these mechanisms are required to mediate full silencing of the target genes. The mechanism of Sp1 inactivation by REST is of importance to understand the molecular pathophysiology of certain diseases. In Huntington's disease, it has been proposed that mutant huntingtin inhibits Sp1-mediated transcription by interfering interaction of Sp1 with hTAFII130 (47Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). An independent study has reported that the huntingtin mutant increases the levels of REST in the nuclei of neuronal cells leading to REST-mediated gene silencing (48Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L. Cataudella T. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). We suggest that silencing of REST target genes in Huntington's disease could also be because of a loss of the Sp1-dependent activation resulting from the abnormal presence of REST in neuronal cells. The REST target genes play important roles in controlling neuronal differentiation and glucose-induced insulin secretion (15Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proper timing of REST target-gene expression during development is required for an appropriate terminal differentiation of the central nervous system (7Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The absence of REST and the presence of its target genes in differentiated β-cells suggest a similar function for REST during pancreas development. The spatial and temporal silencing of REST is therefore thought to be related with the appearance of β-cells and neuronal cell phenotypes during pancreas and neuronal development (15Ballas N. Battaglioli E. Atouf F. Andres M.E. Chenoweth J. Anderson M.E. Burger C. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Brehm P. Mandel G.

Chem. 232, 143-158) as an enzyme activity that cleaved lipoic acid from small lipoylated molecules and from pyruvate dehydrogenase thereby inactivating the enzyme. Although the partially purified enzyme was a key reagent in proving the crucial role of protein-bound lipoic acid in the reaction mechanism of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, the identity of the lipoamidase protein and the encoding gene remained unknown. We report isolation of the lipoamidase gene by screening an expression library made in an unusual cosmid vector in which the copy number of the vector is readily varied from 1-2 to 40-80 in an appropriate Escherichia coli host. Although designed for manipulation of large genome segments, the vector was also ideally suited to isolation of the gene encoding the extremely toxic lipoamidase. The gene encoding lipoamidase was isolated by screening for expression in E. coli and proved to encode an unexpectedly large protein (80 kDa) that contained the sequence signature of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad amidohydrolase family. The hexa-histidine-tagged protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to near-homogeneity. The purified enzyme was found to cleave both small molecule lipoylated and biotinylated substrates as well as lipoic acid from two 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and an isolated lipoylated lipoyl domain derived from the pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit. Lipoamidase-mediated inactivation of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases was observed both in vivo and in vitro. Mutagenesis studies showed that the residues of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad were required for activity on both small molecule and protein substrates and confirmed that lipoamidase is a member of the Ser-Ser-Lys triad amidohydrolase family.

Lipoic acid (6,8-thioctic acid or 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid) is a sulfur-containing cofactor found in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 2Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The cofactor is essential for the function of several key enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), 1The abbreviations used are: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; KGDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; AS, amidase signature; Lip-K(A-Me), ϵ-lipoyl-α-acetyl derivative of lysine methyl ester; lipoyl-PABA, lipoyl-p-aminobenzoic acid; biotinyl-PABA, biotinyl-p-aminobenzoic acid; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; pfu, plaque-forming units; Lpa, lipoamidase; FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase. 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, and the glycine cleavage system (1Perham R.N.

In each enzyme a specific subunit is modified by lipoic acid attachment, and the sites of attachment are specific lysine residues within the conserved domains of these subunits, called lipoyl domains. An amide linkage is formed between the carboxyl group of lipoic acid and the lysine residue ϵ-amino group of the enzyme subunit. In the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, the lipoyl domains are found at the N termini of the E2 subunits. During catalysis, the protein-bound lipoamide moieties serve as carriers of activated acyl groups between the active sites of these multienzyme complexes (1Perham R.N. Annu. Rev.

However, the removal of lipoic acid from lipoylated proteins, a reaction catalyzed by lipoamidase (Lpa), an Enterococcus faecalis enzyme described many years ago (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E.

Lpa was originally described in E. faecalis (then Streptococcus faecalis) strain 10C1 in the late 1950s (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol.

The enzyme cleaves the amide bond that links lipoic acid to the lipoylated lysine ϵ-amino groups, the cleavage products being free lipoic acid plus the unmodified protein (10Reed L.J. Koike M.

Lpa was discovered during studies of the E. faecalis pyruvate dehydrogenase. An ATP-requiring enzyme that is now called lipoate-protein ligase was discovered that catalyzed attachment of lipoic acid to the apo-form of pyruvate dehydrogenase and thereby activated the enzyme (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 143-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol.

Several amides of lipoic acid were synthesized for testing as possible inhibitors of the ligase activity. These amides failed to inhibit activation of the cell-free extract pyruvate dehydrogenase by lipoic acid and unexpectedly were found to replace lipoic acid in the ATP-requiring activation (ligase) reaction (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 143-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicated that E. faecalis contained an enzyme that hydrolyzed the amides thereby freeing the lipoate carboxyl group for use by lipoate protein ligase. The hydrolytic enzyme activity, first designated lipoyl X-hydrolase, was purified about 100-fold and was also found to inactivate the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases by removal of lipoic acid (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 143-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol.

Inactivation was shown to be due only to the removal of lipoic acid because dehydrogenase activity returned upon treatment of inactivated preparations with lipoate-protein ligase. These data provided a rigorous proof of the key role of protein-bound lipoic acid in the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase reaction mechanism (10Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 143-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Koike M. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1931-1938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Lpa had not received recent study, partially purified enzyme preparations have been used in studies of several 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (13Liu S. Baker J.C. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Koike K. Ishibashi H. Koike M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Hale G. Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1992; 248: 247-253Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In bacteria Lpa activity has thus far been detected only in E. faecalis. Escherichia coli, the organism in which lipoic acid metabolism is best understood, lacks Lpa activity (11Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4021-4025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as does Bacillus subtilis. 2Y. Jiang and J. E. Cronan, unpublished data. Lipoic acid metabolism in E. coli involves three enzymes as follows: the lipoic acid biosynthetic enzyme LipA (17Miller J.R. Busby R.W. Jordan S.W. Cheek J. Henshaw T.F. Ashley G.W. Broderick J.B. Cronan Jr., J.E. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15166-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and two lipoate-protein attachment enzymes, LplA (6Morris T.W. Reed K.E.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), that are responsible for forming the amide bond that links lipoic acid to apoproteins. E. faecalis lipoic acid metabolism is distinctly different. This organism is a naturally occurring lipoic acid auxotroph when grown on pyruvate (19Deibel R. Bacteriol. Rev. 1964; 28: 330-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reed L.J. De B.B. Gunsalus I.C. Hornberger Jr., C.S. Science. 1951; 114: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and the genome lacks sequences encoding LipA and LipB homologues. The E. faecalis genome encodes two LplA homologues, the biochemical functions of which have not yet been demonstrated. To begin to understand the role of Lpa in E. faecalis and to facilitate the use of the enzyme as a reagent for studies of lipoic acid metabolism, we have isolated the gene encoding Lpa by expression cloning, and we have purified the enzyme to homogeneity. The purified Lpa showed activity toward both high molecular weight protein substrates such as a lipoyl domain and intact 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases as well as small molecule substrates such as lipoyl-lysine. Both activities were shown to be dependent on the same active site residues, the Ser-Ser-Lys triad of the amidase signature family. Materials—The CopyControl Fosmid Library Production kit, End-Repair Enzyme Mix, Colony Fast-Screen kit (Size Screen), and MaxPlax Lambda Packaging Extracts were purchased from Epicenter (Madison, WI). The Large Construct kit for isolation of cosmid DNA free of genomic DNA was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Phage λCE6 and its host strain LE392 were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). [1-14C]Octanoate was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The ϵ-lipoyl-α-acetyl derivative of lysine methyl ester, Lip-K(A-Me), was a gift from Wacker Chemie (Munich, Germany). Lipoyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (biotinyl-PABA) was synthesized according to Tate (21Tate R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Ph.D. Thesis, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK1998Google Scholar). Biotinyl-lysine and biotinyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (biotinyl-PABA) were purchased from Sigma. The genomic DNA of E. faecalis 10C1 was prepared using the Genome DNA kit from QBIOgene (Carlsbad, CA). The Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign performed the mass spectrometry. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial stains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. All E. coli strains were K12 derivatives. The 10C1 strain of E. faecalis and E. faecalis V583 genomic DNA were from the American Type Culture Collection. E. faecalis V583 is a pathogenic strain of known genome sequence (22Paulsen I.T.

The parental strain, EP1300, and cosmid pCC1FOS were purchased from Epicenter (as components of the CopyControl Fosmid Library Production kit). Plasmid pCY598 was constructed by ligation of the 4-kb fragment of pDLK30 (containing the replication origin plus the kanamycin determinant) to the 5.1-kb araC-pBAD fragment of pTara (23Wycuff D.R.

A, first round screening of the E. faecalis cosmid expression library. Crude extracts of four pools of 50 colonies each, S2, S3, S4, and M4, were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (“Experimental Procedures”), and the resulting preparations were assayed for Lpa activity by the gel shift method after overnight incubation at 37 °C. B, final round screening of the E. faecalis cosmid expression library. The individual colonies of pool S2 16-20 were each grown as a separate culture that was induced and assayed for lipoamidase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pool S2 6-10 gave a similar result (data not shown). The plus signs denote assays performed with the partially purified E. faecalis crude extract as a positive control, and the minus signs denote assays containing only the holo-domain. Marker proteins consisting of purified apo- and hololipoyl domains plus a mixture of apo- and holo-domains (denoted as Stds) were loaded on each gel. The band (labeled D) that migrated faster than the holo-domain (below the holo-band) was presumably the product formed by deamidation of a holo-domain amino acid amide residue during storage. This band is converted to its apo-form by Lpa. This apo-form can in turn be converted back to the holo-form by LplA treatment (see Fig. 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrains or plasmidsRelevant characteristics or derivationSource or Ref.Strains E. faecalis 10C1Strain in which Lpa was originally detectedATCC 11700 JK1Wild type27Reed K.E.

Thus for cloning into pCR2.1-TOPO vector, the products were purified (Qiagen QIAprep spin columns), and a 3′-A nucleotide was added by Taq DNA polymerase.Table IIPCR primersPrimerSequence (5′–3′)LplA 2CTTCTCTCATCCGCCAAAACLplA 3CATATGTCCACATTACGCCTGCTpCC1 forGGATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTpCC1 revCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCEF1008CATGAATATTACGGGCCGCTTCEF1032CAGATAGCCTTTAGTAATAGAATGAGTGGEF1033 UPCCTCCGTTTCTATTCTATTTTAGCAEF1033 DOWNCACTGGTTATCATTTTCTAGTTTTCCEF1034 DOWNAAATCTCAATCCCTTTCTTTGAATAGTTGEF1033 NdeICATATGTTGGCACAAGAAAGTATACTAGEF1033 BamHIGGATCCTTATCATTTTCTAGTTTTCCTTATATAAEF1033 S259A 1GTGATGCTGGTGGCGCTATCCGCATCCCTGCEF1033 S259A 2GCAGGGATGCGGATAGCGCCACCAGCATCACEF1033 S235A 1CATTATTCAGGTGGTGCTTCAGGCGGAGCGGGEF1033 S235A 2CCCGCTCCGCCTGAAGCACCACCTGAATAATGEF1033 K159A 1GGTGTGCCGCTCTTACTAGCAGGGTTAGGACAATCCTTGAAAGGEF1033 K159A 2CCTTTCAAGGATTGTCCTAACCCTGCTAGTAAGAGCGGCACACCpETBlue-1 UPGAAGCACTTCAATTGTGAGCGCTCACAATTCTCGTGApETBlue-1 DOWNGAAGTGCTTCGGTTATGCTAGTTATTGCT Open table in a new tab Plasmids pYFJ66, pYFJ68, and pYFJ70, which encoded three mutant derivatives (S259A, S235A and K159A respectively) of E. faecalis V583 Lpa in vector pET16b, were obtained by used of the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DNA template was pYFJ62, and the primers (all beginning with EF1033 as in Table II) used were the S259A, S235A, and K159A primers for pYFJ66, pYFJ68, and pYFJ70, respectively. The PCR products were transformed into strain TOP10F′ after DpnI digestion. The presence of the expected mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers (Table II) used in the PCRs were synthesized by the Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Urbana, IL) and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Culture Media and Growth Conditions—E. faecalis 10C1 was cultured in the lipoic acid-deficient synthetic medium of Gunsalus et al. (25Gunsalus I.C. Dolin M.I. Struglia L. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 194: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with vigorous aeration at 37 °C. E. coli strain TM245 was cultured in LB medium supplemented with 10 mg/liter of lipoic acid for the lipoylated lipoyl domain preparation, whereas for preparation of the apolipoyl domain E. coli strain TM250 was grown in 2× YT medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 5 mm sodium succinate, and 5 mm sodium acetate. To prepare the octanoylated lipoyl domain, E. coli strain YFJ38 was grown in minimal E supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 5 mm sodium succinate, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 5 mm octanoic acid. The screening medium used for E. faecalis cosmid expression library construction and screening was LB medium supplemented with medium E, 0.1% glucose, 5 mm sodium succinate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The medium E components were the same concentrations as those used in the defined minimal medium. Partial Purification of Lpa from E. faecalis—The method used was a modification of that of Suzuki and Reed (11Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4021-4025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This partially purified preparation was used as the source of Lpa activity prior to the isolation of the lpa gene. E. faecalis 10C1 cells were washed and resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and disrupted by sonication. The cell-free supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min was subjected to a three-step ammonium sulfate fractionation (11Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4021-4025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and dialyzed against two changes of the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The enzyme preparation was stored at -20 °C for several years without significant loss of activity. Expression and Purification of Apo- and Hololipoyl Domains—The lipoylated and apo-forms of the E. coli lipoyl domain were purified from E. coli strains TM245 and TM250, respectively, and cultured as described above. Domain expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mm, and the purification procedure was simplified from the prior protocol (26Ali S.T. Moir A.J. Ashton P.R. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed and resuspended in lipoyl domain buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3 (pH 7.0)) and disrupted by two passages through a French press cell at 20,000 pounds/square inch and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The cell-free crude extracts were adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 m HCl, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The pH of the resulting supernatants was then adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m NaOH, and the neutralized supernatant was dialyzed against freshly prepared 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0). This solution was loaded on a POROS QE anion exchange chromatography column (column volume of 0.831 ml) and eluted with 30 column volumes of a 10-600 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) gradient. Protein fractions were analyzed on a 20% nondenaturing PAGE gel system described previously (26Ali S.T. Moir A.J. Ashton P.R. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in which the apo- and holo-forms of the domains readily separate. The appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 mm ammonium acetate buffer, and the modification status of the purified domains (apo, octanoylated, or lipoylated) was confirmed by mass spectroscopy (8Zhao X. Miller J.R. Jiang Y. Marletta M.A. Cronan J.E. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The domain preparations were stored at -20 °C. Assays of Lpa Activity—The gel shift assay was conducted at 37 °C in a 100-μl total volume containing purified hololipoyl domain (2-3 μm), 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.3 mm DTT, and an Lpa preparation. The reaction was allowed to proceed for various times (0.5-12 h) depending on the concentration and the activity of the Lpa preparation. Part or all of the reaction mixtures were th"

PDR5 induction in ρ0 cells requires the presence of the zinc cluster transcription factor Pdr3p. The PDR3 gene is positively autoregulated in ρ0 cells by virtue of the presence of two binding sites for Pdr3p in its promoter. We identify the novel protein Lge1p as a required participant in the ρ0 activation of PDR3 and PDR5 expression. Lge1p is a nuclear protein that has been found to play a role in ubiquitination of histone H2B at Lys123. This ubiquitination requires the presence of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6p and the ubiquitin ligase Bre1p. Interestingly, ρ0 strains lacking Lge1p failed to induce PDR3 transcription, but induction was still seen in Δrad6, Δbre1, and H2B-K123R mutant strains. Microarray experiments also confirmed that the pattern of gene expression changes seen in cells lacking Lge1p, Bre1p, or Rad6p or containing the H2B-K123R mutant as the only form of H2B share some overlap but are distinct. These findings provide a strong argument that Lge1p has roles in gene regulation independent of its participation in the Rad6p-dependent ubiquitination of H2B.

In eukaryotic cells, coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression is a critical physiological feature. Alterations in this communication circuit can lead to an array of metabolic consequences, including programmed cell death (reviewed in Ref. 1Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (2Amuthan G. Biswas G. Zhang S-Y. Klein-Szanto A.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial/nuclear communication in a signaling pathway called retrograde regulation. Loss of the mitochondrial organellar DNA (ρ0 cells) triggers the induction of a number of nuclear genes, including CIT2 and DLD3, via activation of the transcriptional regulatory proteins Rtg1p and Rtg3p (4Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell.

A major function of the Rtg1p/Rtg3p-regulated retrograde signaling pathway is to permit adequate synthesis of amino acids that rely on the tricarboxylic acid cycle for their production. Global analysis of the genome-wide transcriptional profile of ρ0 cells indicates that the expression of a large number of genes is induced, including locus coding for cell-surface components, membrane transporters, and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and of glycolysis (7Traven A.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of some of these genes is not strictly dependent on the function of Rtg1p/Rtg3p, indicating that other pathways of retrograde regulation must exist in S. cerevisiae. One of these additional pathways is defined by the Zn2-Cys6 cluster-containing transcription factor Pdr3p. Pdr3p, along with its homolog Pdr1p, regulates the expression of a group of proteins involved in membrane transport and biogenesis referred to as the Pdr network (see Refs. 10Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Wolfger H. Mamnun Y.M. Kuchler K. Res.

Pdr1p and Pdr3p exert their influence by binding to DNA sites termed Pdr1p/Pdr3p response elements (PDREs) 1The abbreviations used are: PDREs, Pdr1p/Pdr3p response elements; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MRE, metal response element. present in target gene promoters and by increasing gene expression (13Katzmann D.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An important target gene in the Pdr pathway is the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene PDR5 (16Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Dyck VanL. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr.

Pdr5p is a major determinant in multidrug resistance (19Kolaczkowski M. Kolaczowska A. Luczynski J. Witek S. Goffeau A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1998; 4: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and contains three PDREs in its minimal promoter region (15Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23049-23054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Microarray experiments have indicated that PDR5 is one of the most highly induced genes upon activation of the Pdr pathway (20van den DeRisi J. Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A search for genes that negatively regulate the expression of PDR5 led to the finding that PDR5 transcription is dramatically induced in ρ0 cells (21Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This retrograde regulation is exclusively dependent upon the presence of Pdr3p and triggers the induction of PDR3 expression via positive autoregulation of this gene. Unlike PDR1, the PDR3 locus contains two PDREs in its promoter and responds to the level of Pdr3p activity in the cell (22Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the ρ0 signal provided evidence that although some Pdr target genes such as PDR5 and PDR3 are highly induced, others are not (23Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data indicate the selectivity of the Pdr3p-mediated response to loss of the mitochondrial genome. To identify proteins that participate in the transduction of the mitochondrial signal to nuclear Pdr3p (24Delahodde A. Pandjaitan R. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we carried out transposon mutagenesis of cycloheximide-hyper-resistant ρ0 cells. The LGE1 gene was found to be required for the activation of PDR3 and PDR5 that would normally occur in these cells. Recent work has demonstrated that Lge1p acts with the ubiquitin ligase Bre1p and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6p to attach ubiquitin to histone H2B, a modification important for gene silencing (25Roguev A.

Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that Δbre1 or Δrad6 mutants, along with cells lacking the Rad6p-dependent ubiquitination site on H2B, can still support ρ0-mediated PDR3 induction. Microarray experiments indicated that Lge1p has both positive and negative effects on gene expression, but only a fraction of these overlap with the effects of Rad6p. These data provide evidence that Lge1p clearly has actions in addition to those executed with Rad6p/Bre1p. Strains, Media, and β-Galactosidase Assay—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were grown on rich YPD medium (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose) or on synthetic complete medium lacking the appropriate auxotrophic components (29Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method (30Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient plate assays (31Hallstrom T.C. Katzmann D.J. Torres R.J. Sharp W.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and standard β-galactosidase assays (32Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Luminescent β-galactosidase assays (Clontech) were performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. All assays were done with at least four independent transformants. Disruption mutations in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA were generated by disruption of a given gene in our previously characterized ρ0 background with the exception of the H2B mutant strains, YZ276 and YZ277. We produced ρ0 derivatives of these strains by integrative disruption of the FZO1 gene. FZO1 is required for normal mitochondrial segregation, and Δfzo1 cells become uniformly ρ0 (33Hermann G.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All strains thought to be ρ0 were tested for their inability to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source medium (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 3% glycerol, and 3% ethanol). The rad6-Δ::kanMX4 and bre1-Δ::kanMX4 gene disruption strains were obtained from Research Genetics. PCR primers specific for nucleotide sequences 150 bp upstream and 200 bp downstream of the kanMX4 gene replacement were used to PCR-amplify the specific locus. These products were used to disrupt the corresponding genes in SEY6210 and SEY6210 ρ0 by homologous recombination and selection on G418-containing plates. The fzo1-Δ::natRMX4 gene disruption in YZS276 and YZS277 backgrounds was generated following a PCR-based protocol (35Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR primers were designed with 50 bp from either the 5′- or 3′-end of the FZO1 gene and with 21 bp specific for amplification of the natRMX4 cassette. The allele was generated using the 5′- and 3′-primers to PCR-amplify the nat gene carried on the p4339 plasmid (provided by Brenda Andrews), transforming cells with the PCR product, and selecting for strains that grew on plates containing nourseothricin (clonNAT, WERNER BioAgents). Correct integration in all strains constructed was determined by PCR.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrain designationGenotypeSourceBY4742MATα leu2 ura3 his3 met15Research GeneticsBY4742Δlge1MATα leu2 ura3 his3 met15 lge1-Δ[ρ]::kanMX4Research GeneticsSEY6210MATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 lys2-801 trp1-Δ901 his3-Δ200 suc2-Δ9 Mel-Scott EmrSEY6210 ρoMATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 lys2-801 trp1-Δ901 his3-Δ200 suc2-Δ9 mel- [ρo]Ref. 21Hallstrom T.C.

The sequence of the complete LGE1 gene was verified by automated sequencing. The plasmid pXTZ164 was constructed by transferring the NotI-SpeI fragment containing the LGE1 gene from pXTZ161 to the same sites of pRS313 (CEN, HIS3) (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene fusion with the C terminus of LGE1 was generated by one-step PCR combined with in vivo recombination in yeast. First, a GFP-TRP1 cassette was PCR-amplified with primers C-LGE1cGFPF70 (TAA ATA TTC AAC TGA CCC AAG AAA AGC TGG ACT CAT TGT TAT TAA TGC AGC GGA TCC CCG GGT TAA TTA A) and Cyor1GFPR70d (ACG CCA AGC TCG GAA TTA ACC CTC ACT AAA GGG AAC AAA AGC TGG GTA CCG AAT TCG AGC TCG TTT AAA C) and pFA6aGFP-TRP1 as template (40Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Primer C-LGE1cGFPF70 contains 50 nucleotides corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the LGE1 open reading frame, followed by 20 nucleotides of GFP sequence (underlined). Primer Cyor1GFPR70d consists of 50 nucleotides of the pRS313 vector sequence, followed by 20 nucleotides of GFP sequence. The PCR product was purified and transformed into BY4741 along with the Asp718-cut pXTZ164 plasmid. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete plates lacking histidine. Plasmids from His+ transformants were then retrieved and characterized. The PDR15-lacZ construct contains PCR-amplified promoter sequences (from –795 to +3 relative to the ATG codon) fused to lacZ in the low copy number plasmid pSEYC102 (37Emr S.D. Vassarotti A.

Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TRP5 (tryptophan synthase), HSP12 (small heat shock protein), and CUP1 (copper metallothionein) have been described previously (20van den DeRisi J. Hazel B. Marc P. Balzi E. Brown P. Jacq C. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Localization of Lge1p-GFP and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of DNA in live yeast cells were performed using cultures grown to A600 = 0.8 in minimal medium. Cells were observed at a magnification of ×100 using Nomarski optics or fluorescence through a green filter to observe GFP. Images were captured by a Hammamatsu ORCA CCD camera mounted on Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope. All images were processed identically using Adobe PhotoShop Version 5.0. Immunological Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit as recommended by the supplier. Equal amounts of protein were resuspended in SDS loading buffer prior to analysis by Western blotting as described (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with anti-Pdr5p antibody, anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Covance), or anti-Vph1p antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Anti-Pdr5p antibody was provided by Karl Kuchler. Microarray and Northern Blot Analyses—The MicroFast Track mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen) was used to isolate mRNA from the total RNA used for Northern blot analyses. We used homemade microarray slides containing probes for most of the yeast open reading frames (∼6000 oligonucleotides) deposited in duplicates. The oligonucleotides were supplied by MWG Biotech (yeast oligonucleotide set). The slides used were Ultragaps from Corning. Four micrograms of mRNA were used for each reverse transcription reaction. Detailed protocols are at www.biologie.ens.fr/fr/genetiqu/puces/protocolespuces.html. The arrays were read by a Genepix 4000 scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and were analyzed with Genepix Version 3.0 software. Each microarray result presented here is an average of at least two independent biological measurements. We excluded artifactual spots, saturated spots, and low signal spots (foreground < background + 2 S.D.). Assuming that most of the genes have unchanged expression, the Cy3/Cy5 ratios were normalized by use of the median of all the ratios for each experiment. We considered ratios >1.8-fold as representing significant gene expression changes. The choice of this threshold is based on an error model constructed from control versus control experiments (data not shown) in which, after filtering and averaging of two independent measurements (see above), no ratio was above 2-fold, and only one or two features per replicate experiment were above 1.8-fold. Northern blotting was performed as described previously using radiolabeled probes for PDR5 and ACT1 mRNAs (9Devaux F. Carvajal E. Moye-Rowley S. Jacq C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Genetic Screen for Regulators of Retrograde Control of Pdr3p Activity—We have previously found that expression of the multidrug-resistant ABC transporter gene PDR5 is strongly induced in cells that have lost their mitochondrial genomic DNA (ρ0) (21Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or that have defects in biogenesis of the F0 component of the mitochondrial ATPase (23Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This mitochondrial dysfunction leads to activation of the zinc cluster transcription factor Pdr3p, which in turn positively autoregulates PDR3 gene expression. Pdr3p levels rise with accompanying stimulation of the expression of target genes such as PDR5. To identify participants in the pathway of mitochondrial signaling to nuclear Pdr3p, we carried out transposon mutagenesis with the goal of blocking Pdr3p activation in ρ0 cells that are cycloheximide-hyper-resistant. A ρ0 strain was transformed with DNA corresponding to a S. cerevisiae genomic library containing randomly inserted transposons. About 5000 transformants were first selected on minimal plates and then replica-plated onto minimal plates containing 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Five colonies failed to grow on plates containing cycloheximide, and these colonies were retested for PDR5-lacZ expression. Three strains that exhibited both phenotypes, cycloheximide sensitivity and decreased PDR5-lacZ expression, were selected for further study. Additional genetic analyses indicated that the behavior of only one of these mutants could be consistently linked to the presence of the transposon, and we focused on this isolate. The transposon insertion point in this mutant strain was found 42 bp upstream of the translation start site for the gene LGE1 (YPL055C, GenBank™/EBI accession number NP_015270). LGE1 encodes a basic protein of 333 amino acids with no significant homology to known proteins. Lge1p has recently been identified as a component of a protein complex that mediates ubiquitination of histone H2B, although its exact function is still unknown (39Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed effects of cycloheximide sensitivity and reduced PDR5 expression were indeed due to disruption of the LGE1 locus rather than a special property of the transposon mutant allele, gene disruption forms of LGE1 were constructed in both ρ+ and ρ0 strains. The entire LGE1 open reading frame was replaced with the kanMX4 marker (40Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) in otherwise isogenic ρ+ and ρ0 cells. These disruption mutants were then tested for their ability to tolerate cycloheximide (Fig. 1). As seen for the transposon insertion mutant, deletion of the LGE1 open reading frame dramatically reduced cycloheximide resistance in ρ0 cells. A reduction in cycloheximide tolerance was also seen upon elimination of Lge1p production in ρ+ cells. In either case, the cycloheximide-sensitive phenotype elicited by the Δlge1 lesion could be fully complemented by introduction of the wild-type LGE1 gene into a low copy number plasmid. The effect of the Δlge1 mutation on gene expression was assayed in two different ways. Gene fusions between Escherichia coli lacZ and two different Pdr-regulated genes (PDR5 and PDR15) as well as two genes not responsive to Pdr regulatory signals (TRP5 and HSP12) were tested in these backgrounds. Western blot experiments were carried out to confirm that the expression level of Pdr5p produced from the authentic PDR5 locus also responded to loss of Lge1p. Whereas expression of both PDR5-lacZ and PDR15-lacZ was strongly induced in ρ0 cells, expression levels were markedly decreased when the Δlge1 mutation was present in these same ρ0 strains (Fig. 1B). In ρ+ cells, the presence of the Δlge1 mutation did not affect expression of either PDR5 or PDR15. HSP12-lacZ and TRP5-lacZ expression was not significantly influenced in these same strains. Expression of Pdr5p from its normal chromosomal location was also evaluated by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Immunoreactive Pdr5p levels were strongly induced in ρ0 cells. This level of induction was sensitive to the presence of Lge1p, as Pdr5p was seen to decrease in abundance upon introduction of the Δlge1 mutation into the ρ0 background. Interestingly, residual induction of Pdr5p was still seen in ρ0 Δlge1 cells, which could be eliminated by removing PDR3 from this background. The decrease in expression of Pdr5p in ρ0 Δlge1 cells could be reversed by introduction of the low copy number LGE1 clone in a fashion that correlated well with the cycloheximide resistance phenotypes of these same strains. Deletion of LGE1 Decreases PDR3 Expression in ρ0 Cells—As previously reported, autoregulation of PDR3 is critical for induction of PDR5 expression in cells with mitochondrial defects (21Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47844-47852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine whether PDR3 autoregulation in ρ0 cells is also affected by the deletion of LGE1, a low copy number plasmid containing PDR3-lacZ was transformed into wild-type or Δlge1 cells and their ρ0 derivatives. We also tested expression of a PDR1-lacZ fusion gene in these same backgrounds since this gene is insensitive to mitochondrial status (21Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The activity of the PDR3 promoter was enhanced (7-fold) in the ρ0 background (Fig. 2) (21Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, this induction was nearly abolished in ρ0 cells lacking Lge1p. LGE1 deletion did not have any effect on PDR3 expression in ρ+ cells. This is in line with microarray analyses in which expression of Pdr3p-regulated genes in ρ+ cells was unchanged upon deletion of LGE1 (see Fig. 7 and Supplemental Table I). Together, these data indicate that the Δlge1 mutation impaired PDR3 autoregulation; moreover, this effect was observed only in ρ0 cells. Expression of PDR1-lacZ was not significantly altered in the various backgrounds tested, reflecting the specificity of the Lge1p effect on Pdr3p activity.Fig. 7Global transcriptional effects of mutants lacking different aspects of H2B ubiquitination. DNA microarray comparison of isogenic ρ+ strains lacking Lge1p (Δlge1), Rad6p (Δrad6), Bre1p (Δbre1) or the ubiquitin acceptor site in H2B (H2B-K123R) was performed. The changes in mRNA levels are presented using a color code, and gene descriptions were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 5. A, negative effects of H2B ubiquitination. Genes that are up-regulated in response to loss of the indicated components of H2B ubiquitination are shown andare grouped relative to their behavior in a Δlge1 background. The presence of more than one gene product name next to a given category indicates that multiple mutants influence this group of genes in a similar fashion. B, positive targets of H2B ubiquitination.

Since normal PDR3 expression appears to rely on Lge1p only in ρ0 cells, we wanted to determine the possible mode of action of Lge1p when mitochondrial function is compromised. To determine whether the subcellular localization of Lge1p is regulated in response to the presence of the mitochondrial genome, we constructed an Lge1p-GFP fusion in a low copy number plasmid. This Lge1p-GFP fusion protein was able to complement Δlge1 defects in both ρ+ and ρ0 strains (data not shown). Transformants were then visualized by fluorescence microscopy to determine the subcellular distribution o"

https://openalex.org/W2033259824,"The virus infectivity factor (Vif) is a protein encoded by most primate lentiviruses. Recent evidence suggests that HIV-1 Vif reduces the intracellular levels of the host cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (Apo3G) and inhibits its packaging into virions. These functions of Vif are thought to be species-specific. Accordingly, HIV-1 Vif can target only human Apo3G (hApo3G), whereas, African green monkey simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) Vif can inhibit African green monkey but not human Apo3G. Consistent with this, we found that SIVagm Vif does not affect the stability of exogenously and endogenously expressed hApo3G and does not prevent packaging of exogenous and endogenous hApo3G into SIVagm virions. Nevertheless, SIVagm Vif supported spreading infection of SIVagm virus in the hApo3G-positive human A3.01 T cell line and rescued infectivity of viruses produced from Apo3G-expressing HeLa cells. Sequence analysis verified that SIVagm Vif inhibited the accumulation of hApo3G-induced mutations, suggesting that SIVagm Vif is indeed active in human cells. Our data suggest that SIVagm Vif can inhibit hApo3G activity without inducing its intracellular degradation or preventing its packaging into virions."

https://openalex.org/W2058130691,"Previous work has shown that a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor α (dnRARα), expressed under the K14 promoter, causes severe epidermal defects. Similar defects are, however, not seen in RARαγ double null mutant mice, which lack the entire complement of RARs expressed in the epidermis. To investigate the mechanism of action of these dominant-negative receptors, dnRARα or a DNA binding-deficient variant, dnRARαDBD, were targeted to the basal epidermis. Expression of either receptor type led to similar epidermal phenotypes suggesting that both RAR mutants acted through a common mechanism. The epidermal phenotype was reminiscent of defects seen in p63-/- mice. Consistent with this, reduced p63 expression was observed in transgenic offspring expressing either RAR mutant, suggesting that down-regulation of p63 might underlie the effects of these receptors on epidermal development. By contrast, expression of p63 in the epidermis of RARαγ-/- offspring was unaffected, indicating that RARs were not essential for p63 expression. These findings suggest that dnRARs may impact on epidermal development through one or more non-canonical pathways, which are independent of receptor-DNA interaction.

Williams M.L. Brown B.E. Nemanic M. Grayson S. Lab. Invest. 1981; 44: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, deprivation of dietary vitamin A, the precursor of RA, generally leads to epidermal hyperkeratosis (12Frazier C. Hu C. Arch. Intern.

The biological functions of RA are mediated by two groups of nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ and their isoforms) and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ and their isoforms). RA target genes are regulated by heterodimers between RARs and RXRs, which impact on gene expression by binding to cis-acting regulatory sequences (RAREs). RAREs usually consist of direct repeats of the consensus PuG(G/T)TCA with five nucleotides intervening the repeats (DR5), although a number of variant motifs have been described (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar, 8Ross S.A. McCaffery P.J. Drager U.C. De Luca L.M. Physiol.

Unliganded RXR/RAR heterodimers can recruit transcriptional co-repressor (CoR) complexes to RAREs. These CoR complexes are associated with histone deacetylase activity, which results in chromatin condensation and repression of transcription. Ligand binding to the RAR moiety leads to conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor, causing co-repressor release and recruitment of co-activators. Histone acetylation mediated by acetyltransferase associated with such co-activator complexes results in chromatin decondensation that facilitates gene transcription (2Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar, 15Wei L.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Altucci L.

Med. 1925; 42: 753-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), the role of the RARs in epidermal development and homeostasis under physiological conditions is less clear. Mice double null for RARα and RARγ exhibit minor epidermal abnormalities affecting the granular layer (9Chapellier B. Mark M. Messaddeq N. Calleja C. Warot X. Brocard J. Gerard C. Li M. Metzger D. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative RARα in basal keratinocytes display severe skin defects suggestive of an early block in epidermal differentiation (21Saitou M. Sugai S. Tanaka T. Shimouchi K. Fuchs E. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These disparate outcomes are not due to functional rescue by RARβ in the knockout animals, because RARβ remains undetectable in the epidermis of RARαγ-/- offspring (9Chapellier B. Mark M. Messaddeq N. Calleja C. Warot X. Brocard J. Gerard C. Li M. Metzger D. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rather it has been suggested that the dnRARα might impact on epidermal development via a non-canonical pathway (22Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 118-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The dnRARα used in the above transgenic experiments contained one amino acid mutation in the ligand-binding domain (G303E), which significantly reduces ligand binding without affecting heterodimerization or DNA binding. Because of this, RA is likely to be compromised in its ability to dissociate CoR complexes associated with the dnRARα, leading to “constitutive” repression of RA target genes (23Iulianella A. Lohnes D. Dev. Biol. 2002; 247: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Matsushita A. Misawa H. Andoh S. Natsume H. Nishiyama K. Sasaki S. Nakamura H. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19101-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it is conceivable that such non-physiological repression could result in the epidermal phenotype observed in the transgenic offspring. Alternatively, other mechanisms, such as titration of co-factors used by multiple signaling pathways, may contribute to the transgenic phenotype. To investigate these potential mechanisms of action, we compared the skin phenotypes of transgenic offspring expressing either a dnRARα or an identical dominant-negative receptor incapable of DNA binding (designated dnRARαDBD) as well as RARαγ double null mutants. Consistent with prior work (21Saitou M. Sugai S. Tanaka T. Shimouchi K. Fuchs E. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), dnRARα transgenic mice exhibited severe epidermal abnormalities, including reduced suprabasal layers, underdeveloped hair follicles, and abnormal expression of several differentiation markers. These histological and molecular defects were recapitulated in transgenic offspring expressing dnRARαDBD, suggesting a mechanism of action that does not require receptor-DNA interaction. In addition, because the RARαγ double null mice did not exhibit similar defects, it is likely that these receptors affect epidermal differentiation in a manner not related to canonical retinoid signaling. The phenotype of the dnRAR transgenics bore similarity to the defects exhibited by p63 null mutants. p63, a homolog of p53, is essential for development and maintenance of a number of epithelial tissues, including the epidermis (26Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 27Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C.

Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Consistent with a relationship between p63 and dnRAR function, immunohistochemistry revealed that p63 expression was severely compromised in both dnRARα and dnRARαDBD offspring. By contrast, RARαγ-/- epidermis, which can be considered as a pan-RAR null material (9Chapellier B. Mark M. Messaddeq N. Calleja C. Warot X. Brocard J. Gerard C. Li M. Metzger D. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was histologically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates and exhibited normal expression of p63. These data suggest that interference with expression of p63 may underlie the epidermal defects elicited by dnRARs. Generation and Characterization of Mutant RARs—A cysteine to alanine mutation in codon 88 (C88A) or a glycine to glutamic acid mutation in codon 303 (G303E) were introduced into the murine RARα1 cDNA using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. These mutations were predicted to disrupt DNA binding and to generate a dnRARα, respectively, based on prior work (25Saitou M. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19101-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Costa S.L. McBurney M.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A PstI-SmaI fragment from the RARα1 (G303E) mutant (designated dnRARα) was used to replace the same region from RARα1 (C88A), giving rise to a DNA binding-deficient variant of dnRARα, denoted dnRARDBD. DNA binding of the RAR mutants was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a canonical RARE as previously described (19Goyette P. Feng C.C. Wang W. Seguin F. Lohnes D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transcriptional potency of the mutant receptors was assessed by transient transfection assays in P19 embryocarcinoma cells using a 3×βRARE reporter vector as previously detailed (19Goyette P.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Generation of Mice—The dnRARα and dnRARDBD cDNAs were excised from the parental vector by digestion with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and inserted into pGEM3Z-K14 (32Vassar R. Rosenberg M. Ross S. Tyner A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1563-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), which had been linearized with BamHI and blunted with Klenow fragment. Transgenes were excised by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis, and injected into fertilized mouse eggs. F0 transgenic offspring were recovered at embryonic day (E)18.5 by cesarean section and identified by Southern blot analysis using DNA prepared from tail biopsies. Dorsal skin from transgenic and control littermates was recovered and either fixed in Bouin's solution, for histological or immunohistochemistry analysis, or frozen at -80 °C. Transgene expression was assessed by RT-PCR. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA isolated from epidermal samples using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) by reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Primers specific for dnRARα (CGCATCTACAAGCCTTG and CAAGTCGGTGAGGGGCT) or for dnRARαDBD (CGCATCTACAAGCCTGC and CAAGTCGGTGAGGGGCT) were used to amplify the relevant cDNAs by PCR. As a control, expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was also monitored by RT-PCR using the primers TCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG and ATTCTCGGCCTTGACTGT. RARαγ-/- mutants were generated by RARαγ+/- intercrosses, recovered by cesarean section at E18.5 and identified by PCR as described previously (33Lufkin T. Lohnes D. Mark M. Dierich A. Gorry P.

Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Dorsal skin samples from E18.5 offspring were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 μm. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (23Iulianella A. Lohnes D. Dev. Biol. 2002; 247: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Lanctot C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1416-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after deparaffination and rehydration, sections were blocked with 10% serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies (K5 (Covance), 1:500 dilution; K10 (Abcam), 1:25 dilution; or p63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:25 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Slides were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Tween 20, re-blocked with 10% serum, and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:150 dilution, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. Samples were subsequently washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (1:1000, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and reactivity revealed by incubation with a diamino benzidine (Sigma; 0.05%; imidazole, 0.01 m; NiCl2, 0.064%; H2O2, 0.009%) solution in Tris-buffered saline for 3-10 min. Specimens were counterstained with methyl green (Sigma) before mounting. Transient Transfection—Keratinocytes were cultured in S-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% Chelex-treated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, 0.5 mm final calcium concentration), insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μm), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), cholera toxin (1.2 × 10-11 m), adenine (24 μg/ml), gentamycin (10 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). Cells were transfected using Lipofect-Ace (Invitrogen) as previously described (19Goyette P. Feng C.C. Wang W. Seguin F. Lohnes D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16497-16505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Chen C.F. Goyette P. Lohnes D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA used for transfections included ΔN-p63 promoter-luc (36Waltermann A. Kartasheva N.N. Dobbelstein M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5686-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), 3×βRARE-luc (19Goyette P. Feng C.C. Wang W. Seguin F. Lohnes D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), pLuc-CYP4A-Z (PPARE-luc) (37Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and VDRE-lacZ (a gift from J. White) and pSG5-hPPARα (a gift from W. Wahli). pSG5-RARα, pSG5-dnRARα, pSG5-dnRARαDBD, and pSG5-RARγ expression vectors were derived by sub-cloning the appropriate cDNAs into pSG5 (Stratagene). pSG5 was added, where needed, to normalize the total DNA amount for each transfection. After transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with all-trans-RA (10-6 m, in Me2SO), 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (10-8 m, in ethanol), or WY-14,643 (50 μm, in Me2SO) for various times, as noted. Monolayer cultures were subsequently treated with lysis buffer (Nonidet P-40, 10%; Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 m; dithiothreitol, 1 mm), and luciferase activity was measured using an LB953 Autolumat luminometer (Berthold). Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity as described (19Goyette P. Feng C.C. Wang W. Seguin F. Lohnes D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16497-16505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Chen C.F. Goyette P. Lohnes D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of independent triplicate transfections. For β-galactosidase activity assays, lysates were incubated with 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma; in NaH2PO4, 23 nm; Na2HPO4, 77 nm; MnCl2, 0.1 mm; MgSO4, 2 mm; β-mercaptoethanol, 40 mm), and enzyme activity was measured as a function of optical density at 405 nm. Analysis of p63 Expression in Transfected Keratinocytes—Keratinocytes were grown on 10-cm tissue culture dishes (Nunc) and transfected with the relevant RAR expression vector (pSG5-RARα, dnRARα, or dnRARαDBD, 20 μg/transfection) together with a pEGFP-C1 construct (Clontech, 10 μg/transfection) as described above. EGFP-positive cells were subsequently isolated using a MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation), and total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using cDNA synthesized as described above, and PCR was carried out using primers specific for ΔN-p63 as done previously (38Nakamuta N. Kobayashi S. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2004; 66: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Characterization of dnRARα and dnRARαDBD—The dnRARα used in the present study was generated as previously described (25Saitou M. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19101-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, binding of this dnRARα to a consensus DR-5 RARE did not differ from that of the wild-type receptor as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1A). In transfection assays in P19 embryocarcinoma cells, dnRARα strongly inhibited transactivation mediated by endogenous RARs, attenuating greater than 90% of the activity of the wild-type receptors at the lowest concentration tested (Fig. 1B). An identical dominant-negative effect was also observed in wild-type keratinocytes. To generate a DNA binding-deficient RARα, we mutated codon 88 (in the first zinc finger) from cysteine to alanine. This mutation was then shuttled into dnRARα to generate dnRARαDBD. As expected, dnRARαDBD did not exhibit detectable DNA binding to canonical RAREs from the RARβ promoter as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1A; compare lanes 9-11 with lanes 3-8). In transfection assays, dnRARαDBD also failed to inhibit target gene transcription mediated by endogenous or co-transfected RARs in either P19 cells or keratinocytes (Fig. 1B and data not shown). This double mutant, therefore, did not appear to impact on DNA binding-dependent transactivation functions of wild-type RARs. Skin Phenotypes Elicited by dnRARα and dnRARαDBD— RARαγ-/- newborns lack the entire complement of RARs normally expressed in the epidermis, but did not exhibit any significant epidermal phenotype upon gross examination, apart from a slightly “shiny” skin as previously described (Fig. 2A) (9Chapellier B. Mark M. Messaddeq N. Calleja C. Warot X. Brocard J. Gerard C. Li M. Metzger D. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overt histological abnormalities were likewise absent (Fig. 2B), although minor defects in the granular layer of RARγ-/- and RARαγ-/- offspring have been reported (7Ghyselinck N.B. Chapellier B. Calleja C. Kumar I.A. Li M. Messaddeq N. Mark M. Metzger D. Chambon P. Ann. Dermatol. Venereol. 2002; 129: 793-799PubMed Google Scholar). The keratinocyte terminal differentiation program was also not perturbed in the RARαγ null offspring, because expression of K5, K14, K1, K10, fillagrin, and involucrin was comparable between mutant and control littermates (9Chapellier B. Mark M. Messaddeq N. Calleja C. Warot X. Brocard J. Gerard C. Li M. Metzger D. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3402-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dnRARs were expressed in basal keratinocytes using the human K14 promoter (Fig. 3A) (32Vassar R. Rosenberg M. Ross S. Tyner A. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1563-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Approximately 15% of the pups recovered at E18.5 were identified as transgenics for dnRARα (19/127) or dnRARαDBD (24/169), respectively, as assessed by genomic Southern blot (Fig. 3B and data not shown). A similar percentage of offspring from either the dnRARα or the dnRARαDBD transgenes exhibited severe skin abnormalities. In all such cases, the affected pups expressed the mutant RARs in the epidermis, as assessed by transgene-specific PCR (Fig. 3C and data not shown). In these offspring, the skin appeared shiny and sticky and was extremely thin and fragile (Fig. 4A; compare transgenics with littermate controls). Transgene expression was not detectable in unaffected littermates (data not shown).Fig. 4Epidermal phenotype of dnRAR transgenic offspring. Transgenic offspring were procured by cesarean section at term (E18.5). A, transgenic offspring were photographed with non-transgenic littermates. Note the overt epidermal defects in both dnRARα and dnRARαDBD offspring. B, histological assessment. Dorsal skin samples were fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Relative to the non-transgenic offspring (B, upper panel), transgenic offspring exhibited poorly developed suprabasal (SB) layers and markedly fewer hair follicles (HF). Note that similar defects were evident in offspring from both transgenes. B, basal layer; S, spinous layer; G, granular layer; SC, stratum corneum; D, dermis; E, epidermis; arrows indicated the dermal/epidermal junctions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Histologically, the skin from affected transgenic offspring contained an intact basal layer. However, in all the cases, the suprabasal layers were greatly reduced, and there was also a marked decline in the number of hair follicles, which, when present, appeared to be arrested at early stages of development (Fig. 4B). These effects were similar to those elicited by a dn-hRARα transgenic construct expressed from the K14 promoter (21Saitou M. Sugai S. Tanaka T. Shimouchi K. Fuchs E. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Offspring derived from either transgene also exhibited perturbed expression patterns for several markers of epidermal differentiation. Affected offspring from either dnRARα or dnRARαDBD constructs expressed K5, a basal epidermal marker, but at a reduced level when compared with non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 5, B and C; compare with A). This differed somewhat from previous observations from K14-dn-hRARα transgenic pups, which exhibited strong ectopic K5 expression in the suprabasal layers (21Saitou M. Sugai S. Tanaka T. Shimouchi K. Fuchs E. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nature. 1995; 374: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The basis for this discrepancy is presently unknown but might be related to the different hybrid transgenic backgrounds between these two studies. In addition to a reduction in K5 expression, both dnRARα and dnRARαDBD transgenic offspring exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of K10, an early epidermal differentiation marker (Fig. 5, E and F, compare with D). These striking phenotypic similarities between dnRARα and dnRARαDBD transgenics suggested that these RAR mutants affected epidermal development through a common mechanism that was independent of receptor-DNA association. Loss of p63 Expression in Transgenic Epidermis—p63 is a homolog of the tumor suppressor p53. p63-/- offspring exhibit severe epidermal defects (26Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1984562515,"Prions cause transmissible and fatal diseases that are associated with spongiform degeneration, astrogliosis, and loss of axon terminals in the brains. To determine the expression of proteins involved in neurosecretion and synaptic functions after prion infection, gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal cell line subclone (GT1-1) was infected with the RML scrapie strain and analyzed by Western blotting, real time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. As revealed by Western blotting of lysates exposed to different temperatures, the levels of complexed SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and synaptophysin were decreased in scrapie-infected GT1-1 cells (ScGT1-1), whereas the level of monomeric forms of these proteins was increased and correlated to the level of scrapie prion protein (PrPSc). However, when complex formation was prevented by prolonged heating of samples in SDS, the levels of monomeric SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A and synaptophysin in ScGT1-1 cells were decreased in comparison to GT1-1 cells. The reduced level of SNAP-25 was observed as early as 32 days postinfection. Increased mRNA levels of both splice variants SNAP-25a and -b in ScGT1-1 cells were seen. No difference in the morphology, neuritic outgrowth or distribution of SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, or synaptophysin could be observed in ScGT1-1 cells. Treatment with quinacrine or pentosan polysulfate cleared the PrPSc from the ScGT1-1 cell cultures, and the increase in levels of monomeric SNAP-25 and synaptophysin was reversible. These results indicate that a scrapie infection can cause changes in the expression of proteins involved in neuronal secretion, which may be of pathogenetic relevance for the axon terminal changes seen in prion-infected brains."
