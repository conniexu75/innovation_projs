We do so by combining (1) a massive, geo-tagged data set comprising over 80 million words generated over the course of several recent years on the social network service Twitter and (2) annually-surveyed characteristics of all 50 states and close to 400 urban populations. Among many results, we generate taxonomies of states and cities based on their similarities in word use; estimate the happiness levels of states and cities; correlate highly-resolved demographic characteristics with happiness levels; and connect word choice and message length with urban characteristics such as education levels and obesity rates. Our results show how social media may potentially be used to estimate real-time levels and changes in population-level measures such as obesity rates."
https://openalex.org/W2035856790,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved anabolic agent to treat osteoporosis; however, the cellular targets of PTH action in bone remain controversial. PTH modulates bone turnover by binding to the PTH/PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) type 1 receptor (PPR), a G-protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in bone and kidneys. Osteocytes, the most abundant cells in adult bone, also express PPR. However, the physiological relevance of PPR signaling in osteocytes remains to be elucidated. Toward this goal, we generated mice with PPR deletion in osteocytes (Ocy-PPRKO). Skeletal analysis of these mice revealed a significant increase in bone mineral density and trabecular and cortical bone parameters. Osteoblast activities were reduced in these animals, as demonstrated by decreased collagen type I α1 mRNA and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression. Importantly, when subjected to an anabolic or catabolic PTH regimen, Ocy-PPRKO animals demonstrated blunted skeletal responses. PTH failed to suppress SOST/Sclerostin or induce RANKL expression in Ocy-PPRKO animals compared with controls. In vitro, osteoclastogenesis was significantly impaired in Ocy-PPRKO upon PTH administration, indicating that osteocytes control osteoclast formation through a PPR-mediated mechanism. Taken together, these data indicate that PPR signaling in osteocytes is required for bone remodeling, and receptor signaling in osteocytes is needed for anabolic and catabolic skeletal responses."
https://openalex.org/W2033899321,"The role of B cells in cancer and the underlying mechanisms remain to be further explored. Here, we show that tumor-associated B cells with activated STAT3 contribute to tumor development by promoting tumor angiogenesis. B cells with or without Stat3 have opposite effects on tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in both B16 melanoma and Lewis Lung Cancer mouse models. Ex vivo angiogenesis assays show that B cell-mediated tumor angiogenesis is mainly dependent on the induction of pro-angiogenic gene expression, which requires Stat3 signaling in B cells. Furthermore, B cells with activated STAT3 are mainly found in or near tumor vasculature and correlate significantly with overall STAT3 activity in human tumors. Moreover, the density of B cells in human tumor tissues correlates significantly with expression levels of several STAT3-downstream pro-angiogenic genes, as well as the degree of tumor angiogenesis. Together, these findings define a novel role of B cells in promoting tumor progression through angiogenesis and identify STAT3 in B cells as potential therapeutic target for anti-angiogenesis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2102920891,"Emerging evidence suggests that excessive exposure to traffic-derived air pollution during pregnancy may increase the vulnerability to neurodevelopmental alterations that underlie a broad array of neuropsychiatric disorders. We present a mouse model for prenatal exposure to urban freeway nanoparticulate matter (nPM). In prior studies, we developed a model for adult rodent exposure to re-aerosolized urban nPM which caused inflammatory brain responses with altered neuronal glutamatergic functions. nPMs are collected continuously for one month from a local freeway and stored as an aqueous suspension, prior to re-aerosolization for exposure of mice under controlled dose and duration. This paradigm was used for a pilot study of prenatal nPM impact on neonatal neurons and adult behaviors. Adult C57BL/6J female mice were exposed to re-aerosolized nPM (350 µg/m(3)) or control filtered ambient air for 10 weeks (3×5 hour exposures per week), encompassing gestation and oocyte maturation prior to mating. Prenatal nPM did not alter litter size, pup weight, or postnatal growth. Neonatal cerebral cortex neurons at 24 hours in vitro showed impaired differentiation, with 50% reduction of stage 3 neurons with long neurites and correspondingly more undifferentiated neurons at Stages 0 and 1. Neuron number after 24 hours of culture was not altered by prenatal nPM exposure. Addition of exogenous nPM (2 µg/ml) to the cultures impaired pyramidal neuron Stage 3 differentiation by 60%. Adult males showed increased depression-like responses in the tail-suspension test, but not anxiety-related behaviors. These pilot data suggest that prenatal exposure to nPM can alter neuronal differentiation with gender-specific behavioral sequelae that may be relevant to human prenatal exposure to urban vehicular aerosols."
https://openalex.org/W2018297233,"Legumes have the unique ability to host nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium bacteria as symbiosomes inside root nodule cells. To get insight into this key process, which forms the heart of the endosymbiosis, we isolated specific cells/tissues at different stages of symbiosome formation from nodules of the model legume Medicago truncatula using laser-capture microdissection. Next, we determined their associated expression profiles using Affymetrix Medicago GeneChips. Cells were collected from the nodule infection zone divided into a distal (where symbiosome formation and division occur) and proximal region (where symbiosomes are mainly differentiating), as well as infected cells from the fixation zone containing mature nitrogen fixing symbiosomes. As non-infected cells/tissue we included nodule meristem cells and uninfected cells from the fixation zone. Here, we present a comprehensive gene expression map of an indeterminate Medicago nodule and selected genes that show specific enriched expression in the different cells or tissues. Validation of the obtained expression profiles, by comparison to published gene expression profiles and experimental verification, indicates that the data can be used as digital “in situ”. This digital “in situ” offers a genome-wide insight into genes specifically associated with subsequent stages of symbiosome and nodule cell development, and can serve to guide future functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2091867308,"The thermal limit for metazoan life, expected to be around 50°C, has been debated since the discovery of the Pompeii worm Alvinella pompejana, which colonizes black smoker chimney walls at deep-sea vents. While indirect evidence predicts body temperatures lower than 50°C, repeated in situ temperature measurements depict an animal thriving at temperatures of 60°C and more. This controversy was to remain as long as this species escaped in vivo investigations, due to irremediable mortalities upon non-isobaric sampling. Here we report from the first heat-exposure experiments with live A. pompejana, following isobaric sampling and subsequent transfer in a laboratory pressurized aquarium. A prolonged (2 hours) exposure in the 50–55°C range was lethal, inducing severe tissue damages, cell mortalities and triggering a heat stress response, therefore showing that Alvinella’s upper thermal limit clearly is below 55°C. A comparison with hsp70 stress gene expressions of individuals analysed directly after sampling in situ confirms that Alvinella pompejana does not experience long-term exposures to temperature above 50°C in its natural environment. The thermal optimum is nevertheless beyond 42°C, which confirms that the Pompeii worm ranks among the most thermotolerant metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2114072986,"Cachexia is a wasting condition defined by skeletal muscle atrophy in the setting of systemic inflammation. To explore the site at which inflammatory mediators act to produce atrophy in vivo, we utilized mice with a conditional deletion of the inflammatory adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Although whole-body MyD88-knockout (wbMyD88KO) mice resist skeletal muscle atrophy in response to LPS, muscle-specific deletion of MyD88 is not protective. Furthermore, selective reexpression of MyD88 in the muscle of wbMyD88KO mice via electroporation fails to restore atrophy gene induction by LPS. To evaluate the role of glucocorticoids as the inflammation-induced mediator of atrophy in vivo, we generated mice with targeted deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor in muscle (mGRKO mice). Muscle-specific deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor affords a 71% protection against LPS-induced atrophy compared to control animals. Furthermore, mGRKO mice exhibit 77% less skeletal muscle atrophy than control animals in response to tumor growth. These data demonstrate that glucocorticoids are a major determinant of inflammation-induced atrophy in vivo and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemic and cancer cachexia.—Braun, T.

https://openalex.org/W2140721485,"In this manuscript, we use genetic data to provide a three-faceted analysis on the links between molecular subclasses of glioblastoma, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CD133 cell surface protein. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: First, we use a newly identified signature for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that genes in this signature have significant overlap with genes differentially expressed in all known GBM subtypes. However, the overlap between genes up regulated in the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and in the EMT signature was more significant than other GBM subtypes. Second, we provide evidence that there is a negative correlation between the genetic signature of EMT and that of CD133 cell surface protein, a putative marker for neural stem cells. Third, we study the correlation between GBM molecular subtypes and the genetic signature of CD133 cell surface protein. We demonstrate that the mesenchymal and neural subtypes of GBM have the strongest correlations with the CD133 genetic signature. While the mesenchymal subtype of GBM displays similarity with the signatures of both EMT and CD133, it also exhibits some differences with each of these signatures that are partly due to the fact that the signatures of EMT and CD133 are inversely related to each other. Taken together these data shed light on the role of the mesenchymal transition and neural stem cells, and their mutual interaction, in molecular subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme."
https://openalex.org/W2161212110,"The interface between cognition, emotion, and motivation is thought to be of central importance in understanding complex cognitive functions such as decision-making and executive control in humans. Although nonhuman apes have complex repertoires of emotional expression, little is known about the role of affective processes in ape decision-making. To illuminate the evolutionary origins of human-like patterns of choice, we investigated decision-making in humans' closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). In two studies, we examined these species' temporal and risk preferences, and assessed whether apes show emotional and motivational responses in decision-making contexts. We find that (1) chimpanzees are more patient and more risk-prone than are bonobos, (2) both species exhibit affective and motivational responses following the outcomes of their decisions, and (3) some emotional and motivational responses map onto species-level and individual-differences in decision-making. These results indicate that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision-making, like humans. We explore the hypothesis that affective and motivational biases may underlie the psychological mechanisms supporting value-based preferences in these species."
https://openalex.org/W2131037984,"Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with the occurrence of various types of cancer, but causal relationships remain elusive. We therefore aimed to determine the relationship between genetic determinants of vitamin D serum levels and the risk of developing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Associations between CYP2R1, GC, and DHCR7 genotypes that are determinants of reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D3) serum levels and the risk of HCV-related HCC development were investigated for 1279 chronic hepatitis C patients with HCC and 4325 without HCC, respectively. The well-known associations between CYP2R1 (rs1993116, rs10741657), GC (rs2282679), and DHCR7 (rs7944926, rs12785878) genotypes and 25(OH)D3 serum levels were also apparent in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The same genotypes of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with reduced 25(OH)D3 serum levels were found to be associated with HCV-related HCC (P = 0.07 [OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.99-1.28] for CYP2R1, P = 0.007 [OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.12-2.15] for GC, P = 0.003 [OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.13-1.78] for DHCR7; ORs for risk genotypes). In contrast, no association between these genetic variations and liver fibrosis progression rate (P>0.2 for each SNP) or outcome of standard therapy with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (P>0.2 for each SNP) was observed, suggesting a specific influence of the genetic determinants of 25(OH)D3 serum levels on hepatocarcinogenesis.Our data suggest a relatively weak but functionally relevant role for vitamin D in the prevention of HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108329693,"Toward generating new tools for fighting multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, we assessed the ability of a membrane-active peptide to sensitize gram-negative bacteria to various antibiotics. The mechanism for affecting inner and/or outer membrane functions was assessed by complementary biophysical methods (SPR, DSC, ITC). The implication of efflux pumps was examined using Acr-AB mutants, as tested with representative antibiotics, host defense peptides, and synthetic mimics. The ability to affect disease course systemically was compared for a single therapy and combination therapy, using the mouse thigh-infection model. The data show that potent antibiotic action can be provoked in vitro and in vivo, by a treatment combining two antibacterial compounds whose individual inefficiency against gram-negative bacteria stems from their efflux. Thus, at subminimal inhibitory concentrations, the lipopeptide-like sequence, N(α)(ω7)dodecenoyl-lysyl-[lysyl-aminododecanoyl-lysyl]-amide (designated C12(ω7)K-β12), has, nonetheless, rapidly achieved a transient membrane depolarization, which deprived bacteria of the proton-motive force required for active efflux. Consequently, bacteria became significantly sensitive to intracellular targeting antibiotics. Collectively, these findings suggest a potentially useful approach for expanding the antibiotics sensitivity spectrum of MDR gram-negative bacteria to include efflux substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2011625196,"Background Prior research shows that work in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations increases the risk of environmental heat-associated death. Purpose To assess the risk of environmental heat-associated death by occupation. Methods This was a case-control study. Cases were heat-caused and heat-related deaths occurring from May-October during the period 2002–2009 in Maricopa County, Arizona. Controls were selected at random from non-heat-associated deaths during the same period in Maricopa County. Information on occupation, age, sex, and race-ethnicity was obtained from death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for heat-associated death. Results There were 444 cases of heat-associated deaths in adults (18+ years) and 925 adult controls. Of heat-associated deaths, 332 (75%) occurred in men; a construction/extraction or agriculture occupation was described on the death certificate in 115 (35%) of these men. In men, the age-adjusted odds ratios for heat-associated death were 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.55, 3.48) in association with construction/extraction and 3.50 (95% confidence interval 1.94, 6.32) in association with agriculture occupations. The odds ratio for heat-associated death was 10.17 (95% confidence interval 5.38, 19.23) in men with unknown occupation. In women, the age-adjusted odds ratio for heat-associated death was 6.32 (95% confidence interval 1.48, 27.08) in association with unknown occupation. Men age 65 years and older in agriculture occupations were at especially high risk of heat-associated death. Conclusion The occurrence of environmental heat-associated death in men in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations in a setting with predictable periods of high summer temperatures presents opportunities for prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2016852812,"We have shown previously that the murine prolactin/growth hormone family member proliferin plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis induced by the FGF2/STAT5 signaling cascade. To delineate the signaling pathway downstream of STAT5 in the human system, where proliferin does not exist, we expressed constitutively active (CA) or dominant-negative (DN) mutant STAT5A in hCMEC/D3 human brain endothelial cells. We found that conditioned medium from CA-STAT5A- but not from DN-STAT5A-overexpressing endothelial cells (EC) is sufficient to induce EC migration and tube formation but not proliferation, indicating that STAT5A regulates the secretion of autocrine proangiogenic factors. We identified prolactin (PRL) as a candidate autocrine factor. CA-STAT5A expression stimulates PRL production at the RNA and protein level, and STAT5A binds to the PRL promoter region, suggesting direct transcriptional regulation. Medium conditioned by CA-STAT5A-overexpressing EC induces phosphorylation of the PRL receptor and activates MAPK. Knockdown of PRL expression by shRNA or blocking of PRL activity with neutralizing antibodies removed the CA-STAT5A-dependent proangiogenic activity from the conditioned medium of EC. The addition of recombinant PRL restores this activity. STAT5A-induced PRL in the conditioned medium can activate STAT5, STAT1, and to a lesser extent STAT3 in hCMEC/D3 cells, suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop between STAT5 and PRL that promotes angiogenesis. Furthermore, we find that VEGF, a potent proangiogenic factor, is induced by activation of STAT5A, and VEGF induction depends on PRL expression. These observations demonstrate a STAT5/PRL/VEGF signaling cascade in human brain EC and implicate PRL and VEGF as autocrine regulators of EC migration, invasion, and tube formation."
https://openalex.org/W1985803032,"4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) has been widely implicated in the mechanisms of oxidant-induced toxicity, but the detrimental effects of HNE associated with DNA damage or cell cycle arrest have not been thoroughly studied. Here we demonstrate for the first time that HNE caused G2/M cell cycle arrest of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 (p53 wild type) and Hep3B (p53 null) cells that was accompanied with decreased expression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 and activation of p21 in a p53-independent manner. HNE treatment suppressed the Cdc25C level, which led to inactivation of CDK1. HNE-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser-216 resulted in its translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, thereby facilitating its degradation via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. This phosphorylation of Cdc25C was regulated by activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)/checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) pathway. The role of HNE in the DNA double strand break was strongly suggested by a remarkable increase in comet tail formation and H2A.X phosphorylation in HNE-treated cells in vitro. This was supported by increased in vivo phosphorylation of H2A.X in mGsta4 null mice that have impaired HNE metabolism and increased HNE levels in tissues. HNE-mediated ATR/Chk1 signaling was inhibited by ATR kinase inhibitor (caffeine). Additionally, most of the signaling effects of HNE on cell cycle arrest were attenuated in hGSTA4 transfected cells, thereby indicating the involvement of HNE in these events. A novel role of GSTA4-4 in the maintenance of genomic integrity is also suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2103068156,"There has been little research on the determinants of Campylobacter coli infection, despite its contributing up to 10% of human Campylobacter infections. A case-control and two case-case study methods explored the aetiology of C. coli over a one year period across Scotland. The case-control multivariate model found an increased risk of C. coli infection in people older than 19 years (O.R. = 3.352), and during the summer months (O.R. = 2.596), while residing in an urban area decreased the risk (O.R. = 0.546). The first case-case study compared C. coli and C. jejuni cases and also showed a higher risk of C. coli during the summer (O.R. = 1.313) and in people older than 19 years (O.R. = 0.791). Living in an urban area was associated with a reduced risk of infection (O.R. = 0.769). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) indicated that sheep and chicken C. coli sequence types (STs) were most frequently found in humans whilst those from cattle and pigs were rarer. MLST diversity was high in isolates from pigs and chicken, intermediate in human isolates, and low in ruminant isolates. The second case-case study used MLST data to ascribe putative sources of infection to the cases. The putative source for 40% of cases was chicken, with 60% acquired from other sources (ruminants 54% and pigs 6%). The case-case analysis also showed that female gender was a risk factor (O.R. = 1.940), which may be explained by females being more likely to prepare poultry in the home. These findings indicate differences between the aetiology of C. coli and C. jejuni infections: this should be taken into account by public health professionals when developing strategies to reduce the burden of human campylobacteriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2129693031,"Existing methods to measure influenza vaccine immunogenicity prohibit detailed analysis of epitope determinants recognized by immunoglobulins. The development of highly multiplex proteomics platforms capable of capturing a high level of antibody binding information will enable researchers and clinicians to generate rapid and meaningful readouts of influenza-specific antibody reactivity.We developed influenza hemagglutinin (HA) whole-protein and peptide microarrays and validated that the arrays allow detection of specific antibody reactivity across a broad dynamic range using commercially available antibodies targeted to linear and conformational HA epitopes. We derived serum from blood draws taken from 76 young and elderly subjects immediately before and 28±7 days post-vaccination with the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine and determined the antibody reactivity of these sera to influenza array antigens.Using linear regression and correcting for multiple hypothesis testing by the Benjamini and Hochberg method of permutations over 1000 resamplings, we identified antibody reactivity to influenza whole-protein and peptide array features that correlated significantly with age, H1N1, and B-strain post-vaccine titer as assessed through a standard microneutralization assay (p<0.05, q <0.2). Notably, we identified several peptide epitopes that were inversely correlated with regard to age and seasonal H1N1 and B-strain neutralization titer (p<0.05, q <0.2), implicating reactivity to these epitopes in age-related defects in response to H1N1 influenza. We also employed multivariate linear regression with cross-validation to build models based on age and pre-vaccine peptide reactivity that predicted vaccine-induced neutralization of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains with a high level of accuracy (84.7% and 74.0%, respectively).Our methods provide powerful tools for rapid and accurate measurement of broad antibody-based immune responses to influenza, and may be useful in measuring response to other vaccines and infectious agents."
https://openalex.org/W1998541478,"The intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are abundant in marine fish meat and oil, has been shown to exert many beneficial effects. The mechanisms behind those effects are numerous, including interference with the arachidonic acid cascade that produces pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, formation of novel bioactive lipid mediators, and change in the pattern of secreted adipocytokines. In our study, we show that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) increases secreted adiponectin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in plasma of mice as early as 4 days after initiation of an EPA-rich diet. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we report for the first time that 15-deoxy-δ12,14-PGJ3 (15d-PGJ3), a product of EPA, also increases the secretion of adiponectin. We demonstrate that the increased adiponectin secretion induced by 15d-PGJ3 is partially peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ)-mediated. Finally, we show that 3T3-L1 adipocytes can synthesize 15d-PGJ3 from EPA. 15d-PGJ3 was also detected in adipose tissue from EPA-fed mice. Thus, these studies provide a novel mechanism(s) for the therapeutic benefits of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids dietary supplementation."

ROP was categorized by development of no, mild (<prethreshold), type 2, or type 1 ROP, as well as markers of ROP severity including stage 3 ROP, zone 1 disease, and plus disease. Associations between nutritional intake and ROP severity were compared.Greater risk for Type 1 ROP (risk/95% confidence intervals) was found for infants with lowest quartile receipt of lipids (2.1/1.1, 3.8), total calories (2.2/1.4, 3.6), and carbohydrates (1.7/1.1, 2.9). Development of zone 1 ROP was associated with lipid or total calorie intake in the lowest quartile, and development of stage 3 ROP was associated with lowest quartile of total calorie intake. Growth velocity in the lowest quartile was associated with increased risk of any ROP, including type 1 ROP.The risk of developing severe ROP in extremely premature infants might be reduced by improving nutritional support, specifically targeting lipids and total calories, and perhaps by improving weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W2001430754,"The PI3-kinase pathway is commonly activated in tumors, most often by loss of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity or the amplification or mutation of p110α. Oncogenic mutants have commonly been found in p110α, but rarely in any of the other catalytic subunits of class I PI3-kinases. We here characterize a p110β helical domain mutation, E633K, first identified in a Her2-positive breast cancer. The mutation increases basal p110β activity, but does not affect activation of p85/p110β dimers by phosphopeptides or Gβγ. Expression of the mutant causes increases in Akt and S6K1 activation, transformation, chemotaxis, proliferation and survival in low serum. E633 is conserved among class I PI3 Ks, and its mutation in p110β is also activating. Interestingly, the E633K mutant occurs near a region that interacts with membranes in activated PI 3-kinases, and its mutation abrogates the requirement for an intact Ras-binding domain in p110β-mediated transformation. We propose that the E633K mutant activates p110β by enhancing its basal association with membranes. This study presents the first analysis of an activating oncogenic mutation of p110β."

The basal forms of this group are represented by incomplete or disarticulated material. Here, we report a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a new basal therizinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Jianchang County, western part of Liaoning Province, which sheds light on our understanding of anatomy of basal therizinosaurs. This new dinosaur shows some typical therizinosaur features, such as neural spines of the anterior caudal vertebrae that possess anterior and posterior alae, a rectangular buttress on the ventrolateral side of the proximal end of metacarpal I, and appressed metatarsal shafts. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a basal therizinosaur (sister taxon to Therizinosauroidea) because it bears many basal therizinosaur characters in the dentition, pelvis and hind limbs. The new therizinosaur described here has unique tooth and jaw characters such as the offsetting of the tooth row by a shelf and dentary teeth with labially concave and lingually convex dentary teeth, similar to ornithopods and ceratopsians."
https://openalex.org/W2023688367,"1. Because of recent technological improvements in the way computer and digital camera perform, the potential use of imaging for contributing to the study of communities, populations or individuals in laboratory microcosms has risen enormously. However its limited use is due to difficulties in the automation of image analysis. 2. We present an accurate and flexible method of image analysis for detecting, counting and measuring moving particles on a fixed but heterogeneous substrate. This method has been specifically designed to follow individuals, or entire populations, in experimental laboratory microcosms. It can be used in other applications. 3. The method consists in comparing multiple pictures of the same experimental microcosm in order to generate an image of the fixed background. This background is then used to extract, measure and count the moving organisms, leaving out the fixed background and the motionless or dead individuals. 4. We provide different examples (springtails, ants, nematodes, daphnia) to show that this non intrusive method is efficient at detecting organisms under a wide variety of conditions even on faintly contrasted and heterogeneous substrates. 5. The repeatability and reliability of this method has been assessed using experimental populations of the Collembola Folsomia candida. 6. We present an ImageJ plugin to automate the analysis of digital pictures of laboratory microcosms. The plugin automates the successive steps of the analysis and recursively analyses multiple sets of images, rapidly producing measurements from a large number of replicated microcosms."
https://openalex.org/W2024076139,"Steap4 is a cell surface metalloreductase linked to obesity-associated insulin resistance. Initial characterization of its cell surface metalloreductase activity has been reported, but thorough biochemical characterization of this activity is lacking. Here, we report detailed kinetic analysis of the Steap4 cell surface metalloreductase activities. Steap4 shows physiologically relevant Km values for both Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) and retains activity at acidic pH, suggesting it may also function within intracellular organelles to reduce these metals. Flavin-dependent NADPH oxidase activity that was much greater than the equivalent Steap3 construct was observed for the isolated N-terminal oxidoreductase domain. The crystal structure of the Steap4 oxidoreductase domain was determined, providing a structural explanation for these differing activities. Structure-function work also suggested Steap4 utilizes an interdomain flavin-binding site to shuttle electrons between the oxidoreductase and transmembrane domains, and it showed that the disordered N-terminal residues do not contribute to enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2107197567,"Morbi-mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) is mainly related to chronic lung infection and inflammation, uncontrolled tissue rearrangements and fibrosis, and yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We evaluated inflammatory and fibrosis responses to bleomycin in F508del homozygous and wild-type mice, and phenotype of fibroblasts explanted from mouse lungs and skin. The effect of vardenafil, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, was tested in vivo and in culture. Responses of proinflammatory and fibrotic markers to bleomycin were enhanced in lungs and skin of CF mice and were prevented by treatment with vardenafil. Purified lung and skin fibroblasts from CF mice proliferated and differentiated into myofibroblasts more prominently and displayed higher sensitivity to growth factors than those recovered from wild-type littermates. Under inflammatory stimulation, mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory mediators were higher in CF than in wild-type fibroblasts, in which CFTR expression reached similar levels to those observed in other non-epithelial cells, such as macrophages. Increased proinflammatory responses in CF fibroblasts were reduced by half with submicromolar concentrations of vardenafil. Proinflammatory and fibrogenic functions of fibroblasts are upregulated in CF and are reduced by vardenafil. This study provides compelling new support for targeting cGMP signaling pathway in CF pharmacotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1991068889,"In the search for structural models of integral-membrane metallopeptidases (MPs), we discovered three related proteins from thermophilic prokaryotes, which we grouped into a novel family called ""minigluzincins."" We determined the crystal structures of the zymogens of two of these (Pyrococcus abyssi proabylysin and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii projannalysin), which are soluble and, with ∼100 residues, constitute the shortest structurally characterized MPs to date. Despite relevant sequence and structural similarity, the structures revealed two unique mechanisms of latency maintenance through the C-terminal segments previously unseen in MPs as follows: intramolecular, through an extended tail, in proabylysin, and crosswise intermolecular, through a helix swap, in projannalysin. In addition, structural and sequence comparisons revealed large similarity with MPs of the gluzincin tribe such as thermolysin, leukotriene A4 hydrolase relatives, and cowrins. Noteworthy, gluzincins mostly contain a glutamate as third characteristic zinc ligand, whereas minigluzincins have a histidine. Sequence and structural similarity further allowed us to ascertain that minigluzincins are very similar to the catalytic domains of integral membrane MPs of the MEROPS database families M48 and M56, such as FACE1, HtpX, Oma1, and BlaR1/MecR1, which are provided with trans-membrane helices flanking or inserted into a minigluzincin-like catalytic domain. In a time where structural biochemistry of integral-membrane proteins in general still faces formidable challenges, the minigluzincin soluble minimal scaffold may contribute to our understanding of the working mechanisms of these membrane MPs and to the design of novel inhibitors through structure-aided rational drug design approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1996503044,"Group II chaperonins play important roles in protein homeostasis in the eukaryotic cytosol and in Archaea. These proteins assist in the folding of nascent polypeptides and also refold unfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Chaperonin-mediated protein folding is dependent on the closure and opening of a built-in lid, which is controlled by the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Recent structural studies suggest that the ring structure of the chaperonin twists to seal off the central cavity. In this study, we demonstrate ATP-dependent dynamics of a group II chaperonin at the single-molecule level with highly accurate rotational axes views by diffracted X-ray tracking (DXT). A UV light-triggered DXT study with caged-ATP and stopped-flow fluorometry revealed that the lid partially closed within 1 s of ATP binding, the closed ring subsequently twisted counterclockwise within 2-6 s, as viewed from the top to bottom of the chaperonin, and the twisted ring reverted to the original open-state with a clockwise motion. Our analyses clearly demonstrate that the biphasic lid-closure process occurs with unsynchronized closure and a synchronized counterclockwise twisting motion."
https://openalex.org/W2053901275,"Molecular biology and literature databases represent essential infrastructure for life science research. Effective integration of these data resources requires that there are structured cross-references at the level of individual articles and biological records. Here, we describe the current patterns of how database entries are cited in research articles, based on analysis of the full text Open Access articles available from Europe PMC. Focusing on citation of entries in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), UniProt and Protein Data Bank, Europe (PDBe), we demonstrate that text mining doubles the number of structured annotations of database record citations supplied in journal articles by publishers. Many thousands of new literature-database relationships are found by text mining, since these relationships are also not present in the set of articles cited by database records. We recommend that structured annotation of database records in articles is extended to other databases, such as ArrayExpress and Pfam, entries from which are also cited widely in the literature. The very high precision and high-throughput of this text-mining pipeline makes this activity possible both accurately and at low cost, which will allow the development of new integrated data services."

Pathogenic mycobacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis have been attributed to induce substantial morbidity and mortality all over the world (1.Kaufmann S.H.

Although many species of mycobacteria elicit T cell-mediated cytokine responses such as IFN-γ, the mounted immune response is able to contain, but not eliminate the infection (4.Ulrichs T. Kaufmann S.H. New insights into the function of granulomas in human tuberculosis.J. Pathol. 2006; 208: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This is due to a series of immune evasion strategies employed by the pathogenic mycobacteria that strongly interfere in the function of the macrophages, a critical necessity for ensuing robust host innate and adaptive immunity (5.Bansal K.

Furthermore, human subjects deficient for IFN-γ receptor or IFN-γ exhibit heightened susceptibility to pathogenic mycobacterial infections (13.Holland S.M. Dorman S.E. Kwon A. Pitha-Rowe I.F.

This selective refractoriness of macrophages involve significant inhibition of IFN-γ-triggered expression of a subset of genes including class II transactivator (CIITA), 3The abbreviations used are: CIITA, class II transactivator; TLR, Toll-like receptor; DN, dominant-negative; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; IP, immunoprecipitation; KLF4, Krüppel-like factor 4; SIN1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ANOVA, analysis of variance; GSI-I, γ-secretase inhibitor-I; BCG, bacillus Calmette-Guérin. a crucial transcription factor required for expression of MHC-II as well as H-2M or invariant chain (14.Pai R.K.

In this context, engagement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 by pathogenic mycobacteria or cell wall antigens could contribute as an early receptor proximal molecular event underlying mycobacteria-mediated inhibition of IFN-γ responses. iNOS is an immunomodulatory gene regulated by pathogen-induced TLR2 signaling that determines the outcome of infection (16.Bansal K.

Importantly, in addition to its antimicrobial properties, NO modulates a wide range of signaling cascades in different cell types by nitration, nitrosation, and nitrosylation of key signaling molecules. Such modulations have significant effects on factors that regulate cell-fate decisions of macrophages or dendritic cells during the course of infection with pathogenic mycobacteria (20.Ehrt S.

Thus, mycobacterial infection-triggered expression of iNOS/NO production assumes critical importance. Apart from the numerous functions attributed to NO in the cellular signaling, its role in antigen presentation has rather been context dependent, wherein NO can induce or inhibit antigen presentation depending upon the cytokine milieu (25.Bang K.W.

Nevertheless, the role of NO in regulating a crucial immunological process like IFN-γ-induced CIITA/MHC-II expression remains elusive. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms involved in mycobacteria-induced iNOS expression and NO production have been inadequately addressed. In view of these observations, we characterized molecular mechanisms that contribute to mycobacteria responsive down-regulation of IFN-γ-triggered expression of MHC-II and CIITA. This study provides evidence that M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-mediated TLR2 signaling triggers iNOS/NO production, which negatively regulates IFN-γ-induced CIITA and MHC-II expression. Deficiency in IFN-γ-induced CIITA or MHC-II expression requires dynamic cross-talk among NOTCH-PKCδ-p38-NF-κB signaling pathways. Importantly, NO-induced expression of KLF4 during M. bovis BCG infection acts as a crucial regulatory switch to inhibit CIITA or MHC-II expression by directing epigenetic modifications mediated by EZH2 at the CIITA promoter and post-translational regulation of CIITA mRNA by miR-150. As a consequence, infection-induced expression of KLF4 negatively regulates antigen processing and presentation of ovalbumin by M. bovis BCG-infected macrophages to antigen-specific T cells. Collectively, these findings identify novel roles for NO/KLF4 to be what we propose as significant regulators of host-mycobacterial interactions. Macrophages were isolated from peritoneal exudates of BALB/c, C57BL/6, or iNOS−/− mice maintained in a central animal facility at the Indian Institute of Science.

In all experiments with inhibitors, a tested concentration was used after careful titration experiments assessing the viability of the macrophages using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The cells were treated with inhibitor for 60 min before experimental treatment. NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN1) (Sigma), was used as indicated in the experiments. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA or miRNA mimic using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was more than 50% throughout all experiments as determined by counting the number of siGLO Lamin A/C positive cells in a microscopic field using a fluorescent microscope. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated as indicated and processed for analysis. siRNA specific to Notch1, Klf4, control siRNA, and siGLO Lamin A/C were obtained from Dharmacon as siGENOMETM SMART pool reagents, which contains a pool of four different double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR for miR-150 was performed using TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. U6 snRNA was used for normalization. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer constituting 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml of aprotenin, leupetin, pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Whole cell lysate was collected and equal amounts of protein from each cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by the semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad) method. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 60 min. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in 5% BSA (in TBST).

Cells were treated as indicated, gently lysed in ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cell membrane was disrupted with 10% Nonidet P-40 and nuclear pellets were recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants from this step were used as cytosolic extracts.

For immunofluorescence studies, peritoneal macrophages or RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded on coverslips. After the indicated treatment, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with primary antibody anti-MHC class II-FITC in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclear staining was done using DAPI (1 μg/ml) for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted on a slide with glycerol and confocal images were taken on Zeiss LSM 710 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope using plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 Oil DIC objective and images were analyzed using ZEN 2009 software. ChIP assays were carried out using the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology, with certain modifications. Briefly, macrophages were fixed with 1.42% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by inactivation of formaldehyde with addition of 125 mm glycine. Nuclei were isolated from macrophages using modified RIPA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and chromatin was sheared using a cup sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc.). Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies or rabbit preimmune sera.

All results were normalized to amplification of 28 S rRNA and all ChIP experiments were repeated at least three times and the primers utilized are listed in supplemental Table S1. IP assays were carried out using protocol provided by Millipore, with certain modifications. Briefly, macrophages were gently lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer on an orbital shaker. The cell lysates were incubated with anti-KLF4, anti-EZH2, or rabbit preimmune sera at 4 °C for 2 h on an orbital shaker. The immunocomplexes were captured using Protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were harvested, washed, and boiled in 5× Laemmli buffer for 10 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and further subjected for immunoblotting. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as vehicle control or 106 M. bovis BCG was injected intravenously into the tail vein of mice. After 4 days of infection, mice were sacrificed, and spleen and lymph nodes were collected. Alternatively, mice were infected intraperitoneally with 106 M. bovis BCG for 12 h and peritoneal macrophages were isolated. Each in vivo experiment involved 4 animals per group. The cells obtained from spleen, lymph node, and peritoneal exudates were utilized for ChIP experiments. Peritoneal macrophages or RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates (5 × 105 cells/well). In the experiments involving RAW 264.7 cells, transient transfection was carried out using KLF4 pcDNA3.1 or KLF4 DN or pcDNA3.1 alone. After 48 h, cells were infected with 10:1 multiplicity of infection of M. bovis BCG for 12 h and then incubated with IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) as indicated. Furthermore, the cells were treated with ovalbumin (500 μg/ml) for 6 h, washed, and incubated with splenocytes (1.5 × 106 cells/well) obtained from C57BL/6 (H-2b) or BALB/c (H-2d) mice in case of experiments with peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice or RAW 264.7 (H-2d) macrophages, respectively. The splenocytes used were obtained from mice that were intravenously challenged with 500 μg/ml of ovalbumin for 5 days. Macrophages-splenocytes were co-cultured for 48 h and culture supernatants were utilized for IL-2 ELISA. Enzyme immunoassays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, USA) using cell-free culture supernatant. Sandwich ELISA was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, assay plates were incubated with capture antibody at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were incubated with cell-free supernatants for 2 h and then with biotinylated detection antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were further incubated with streptavidin-HRP for 1 h at 37 °C and developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). Levels of significance for comparison between samples were determined by the Student's t test distribution and one-way ANOVA. The data in the graphs are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and p < 0.05 were defined as significant. GraphPad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software) was used for all statistical analysis. The representative immunoblots were quantified by the Multi Gauge version 2.3 application (Fujifilm Medical Systems), using profile lane quantification with band detection and subtraction of respective background. Induced expression of iNOS in macrophages upon infection with various pathogenic microbes often acts as a key mediator to regulate the initiation and maintenance of kinetics of ensuing protective immunity (29.Bogdan C. Nitric oxide and the immune response.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). In addition to its antimicrobial attributes, iNOS/NO modulate a wide range of signaling cascades that can have significant bearings on built-in regulatory circuits that control cell-fate decisions of macrophages during the course of infection with pathogenic mycobacteria (17.Kapoor N. Narayana Y. Patil S.A. Balaji K.N. Nitric oxide is involved in Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin-activated Jagged1 and Notch1 signaling.J.

In view of above mentioned observations, we explored a role for iNOS/NO in the ability of the M. bovis BCG to down-regulate MHC-II expression in macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, M. bovis BCG infection critically abrogated IFN-γ-induced MHC-II expression both at transcript and protein levels in macrophages. Antigen processing involving MHC-II is tightly regulated by a key transcription factor, CIITA. Mice deficient for CIITA exhibit a marked reduction in MHC-II expression (31.Sims T.N. Afrouzian M. Urmson J. Zhu L.F. Halloran P.F. The role of the class II transactivator (CIITA) in MHC class I and II regulation and graft rejection in kidney.Am. J.

Mycobacteria or its antigens that reduce MHC-II expression have been demonstrated to involve inhibition of CIITA expression (15.Pennini M.E. Pai R.K. Schultz D.C. Boom W.H. Harding C.V.

As shown, M. bovis BCG infection significantly down-regulated IFN-γ-induced CIITA expression levels (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1C). Next, we assessed the role for iNOS/NO during M. bovis BCG-mediated subdued expression of CIITA or MHC-II. Infection of macrophages derived from iNOS null mice, but not WT mice, exhibited a marked deficiency to down-regulate MHC-II and CIITA expression (Fig. 1, D–F). Furthermore, pretreatment of macrophages with 1400W, an iNOS activity inhibitor, severely reduced the capacity of the M. bovis BCG to inhibit CIITA expression (Fig. 1G). Additionally, treatment of macrophages with a NO donor like 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN1) was sufficient to abrogate the IFN-γ-induced MHC-II expression, validating the crucial role of NO in CIITA expression (Fig. 1, F and H).

Here, we examined Rab-mediated control of RGS4 internalization and recycling. Wild type and constitutively active Rab5 decreased RGS4 PM levels while increasing its endosomal targeting. Rab5, however, did not appreciably affect the PM localization or function of the M1 muscarinic receptor (M1R)/Gq signaling cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2068449895,"Gene discovery in the Malaysian giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) has been limited to small scale data collection, despite great interest in various research fields related to the commercial significance of this species. Next generation sequencing technologies that have been developed recently and enabled whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), have allowed generation of large scale functional genomics data sets in a shorter time than was previously possible. Using this technology, transcriptome sequencing of three tissue types: hepatopancreas, gill and muscle, has been undertaken to generate functional genomics data for M. rosenbergii at a massive scale. De novo assembly of 75-bp paired end Ilumina reads has generated 102,230 unigenes. Sequence homology search and in silico prediction have identified known and novel protein coding candidate genes (∼24%), non-coding RNA, and repetitive elements in the transcriptome. Potential markers consisting of simple sequence repeats associated with known protein coding genes have been successfully identified. Using KEGG pathway enrichment, differentially expressed genes in different tissues were systematically represented. The functions of gill and hepatopancreas in the context of neuroactive regulation, metabolism, reproduction, environmental stress and disease responses are described and support relevant experimental studies conducted previously in M. rosenbergii and other crustaceans. This large scale gene discovery represents the most extensive transcriptome data for freshwater prawn. Comparison with model organisms has paved the path to address the possible conserved biological entities shared between vertebrates and crustaceans. The functional genomics resources generated from this study provide the basis for constructing hypotheses for future molecular research in the freshwater shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W2075046861,"A ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factor, ERα has two transactivating functional domains (AF), AF-1 and AF-2. AF-1 is localized in the N-terminal region, and AF-2 is distributed in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the ERα protein. Helix 12 (H12) in the LBD is a component of the AF-2, and the configuration of H12 is ligand-inducible to an active or inactive form. We demonstrated previously that the ERα mutant (AF2ER) possessing L543A,L544A mutations in H12 disrupts AF-2 function and reverses antagonists such as fulvestrant/ICI182780 (ICI) or 4-hydoxytamoxifen (OHT) into agonists in the AF2ER knock-in mouse. Our previous in vitro studies suggested that the mode of AF2ER activation is similar to the partial agonist activity of OHT for WT-ERα. However, it is still unclear how antagonists activate ERα. To understand the molecular mechanism of antagonist reversal activity, we analyzed the correlation between the ICI-dependent estrogen-responsive element-mediated transcription activity of AF2ER and AF2ER-LBD dimerization activity. We report here that ICI-dependent AF2ER activation correlated with the activity of AF2ER-LBD homodimerization. Prevention of dimerization impaired the ICI-dependent ERE binding and transcription activity of AF2ER. The dislocation of H12 caused ICI-dependent LBD homodimerization involving the F-domain, the adjoining region of H12. Furthermore, F-domain truncation also strongly depressed the dimerization of WT-ERα-LBD with antagonists but not with E2. AF2ER activation levels with ICI, OHT, and raloxifene were parallel with the degree of AF2ER-LBD homodimerization, supporting a mechanism that antagonist-dependent LBD homodimerization involving the F-domain results in antagonist reversal activity of H12-mutated ERα."
https://openalex.org/W2008331309,"Peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs) are responsible for bacterial cell lysis. Most PGHs have a modular structure comprising a catalytic domain and a cell wall-binding domain (CWBD). PGHs of bacteriophage origin, called endolysins, are involved in bacterial lysis at the end of the infection cycle. We have characterized two endolysins, Lc-Lys and Lc-Lys-2, identified in prophages present in the genome of Lactobacillus casei BL23. These two enzymes have different catalytic domains but similar putative C-terminal CWBDs. By analyzing purified peptidoglycan (PG) degradation products, we showed that Lc-Lys is an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, whereas Lc-Lys-2 is a γ-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl endopeptidase. Remarkably, both lysins were able to lyse only Gram-positive bacterial strains that possess PG with D-Ala(4)→D-Asx-L-Lys(3) in their cross-bridge, such as Lactococcus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Enterococcus faecium. By testing a panel of L. lactis cell wall mutants, we observed that Lc-Lys and Lc-Lys-2 were not able to lyse mutants with a modified PG cross-bridge, constituting D-Ala(4)→L-Ala-(L-Ala/L-Ser)-L-Lys(3); moreover, they do not lyse the L. lactis mutant containing only the nonamidated D-Asp cross-bridge, i.e. D-Ala(4)→D-Asp-L-Lys(3). In contrast, Lc-Lys could lyse the ampicillin-resistant E. faecium mutant with 3→3 L-Lys(3)-D-Asn-L-Lys(3) bridges replacing the wild-type 4→3 D-Ala(4)-D-Asn-L-Lys(3) bridges. We showed that the C-terminal CWBD of Lc-Lys binds PG containing mainly D-Asn but not PG with only the nonamidated D-Asp-containing cross-bridge, indicating that the CWBD confers to Lc-Lys its narrow specificity. In conclusion, the CWBD characterized in this study is a novel type of PG-binding domain targeting specifically the D-Asn interpeptide bridge of PG."
https://openalex.org/W2022988299,"Scope Traditional medicinal herbs are increasingly used as alternative therapies in patients with inflammatory diseases. Here we evaluated the effect of Wedelia chinensis, a medicinal herb commonly used in Asia, on the prevention of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis in mice. General safety and the effect of different extraction methods on the bioactivity of W. chinensis were also explored. Methods and Results C57BL/6 mice were administrated hot water extract of fresh W. chinensis (WCHF) orally for one week followed by drinking water containing 2% DSS for nine days. WCHF significantly attenuated the symptoms of colitis including diarrhea, rectal bleeding and loss of body weight; it also reduced the shortening of colon length and histopathological damage caused by colonic inflammation. Among four W. chinensis extracts prepared using different extraction techniques, WCHF showed the highest anti-colitis efficacy. Analyses of specific T-cell regulatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-17, TGF-β, IL-12) revealed that WCHF treatment can suppress the Th1 and Th17, but not Th2, responses in colon tissues and dendritic cells of DSS-induced colitis mice. A 28-day subacute toxicity study showed that daily oral administration of WCHF (100, 500, 1000 mg/kg body weight) was not toxic to mice. Conclusion Together, our findings suggest that specific extracts of W. chinensis have nutritional potential for future development into nutraceuticals or dietary supplements for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2030460790,"In adult mammals, after optic nerve injury, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) do not regenerate their axons and most of them die by apoptosis within a few days. Recently, several strategies that activate neuronal intracellular pathways were proposed to prevent such degenerative processes. The rho-related small GTPase Rac1 is part of a complex, still not fully understood, intracellular signaling network, mediating in neurons many effects, including axon growth and cell survival. However, its role in neuronal survival and regeneration in vivo has not yet been properly investigated. To address this point we intravitreally injected selective cell-penetrating Rac1 mutants after optic nerve crush and studied the effect on RGC survival and axonal regeneration. We injected two well-characterized L61 constitutively active Tat-Rac1 fusion protein mutants, in which a second F37A or Y40C mutation confers selectivity in downstream signaling pathways. Results showed that, 15 days after crush, both mutants were able to improve survival and to prevent dendrite degeneration, while the one harboring the F37A mutation also improved axonal regeneration. The treatment with F37A mutant for one month did not improve the axonal elongation respect to 15 days. Furthermore, we found an increase of Pak1 T212 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 expression in RGCs after F37A treatment, whereas ERK1/2 was more activated in glial cells after Y40C administration. Our data suggest that the selective activation of distinct Rac1-dependent pathways could represent a therapeutic strategy to counteract neuronal degenerative processes in the retina."

When bound to DNA, filaments of DrRecA protein exhibit active and inactive states that are readily interconverted in response to several sets of stimuli and conditions. At 30 °C, the optimal growth temperature, and at physiological pH 7.5, DrRecA protein binds to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and forms extended helical filaments in the presence of ATP.

During this reaction, the duplex DNA strand that is complementary to the RecA-bound ssDNA is transferred to form a new duplex, and the identical strand of the duplex is displaced.

Thus, a simplified view of EcRecA-mediated DNA strand exchange begins with the formation of active nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA. The EcSSB protein facilitates filament extension in this phase and is displaced as the filaments form. The subsequent search for homology does not require ATP hydrolysis. Once homologous alignment is secured, ATP hydrolysis facilitates the formation of extensive tracts of the product heteroduplex DNA and also facilitates the eventual dissociation of the RecA filament. The EcRecA protein is regulated at several levels. First, transcription of the recA gene is regulated as part of the SOS response (40.Michel B. After 30 years of study, the bacterial SOS response still surprises us.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 41.Fonville N.C. Bates D. Hastings P.J. Hanawalt P.C.

Second, the C terminus of EcRecA is an autoregulatory flap; removal of 17 C-terminal residues enhances a number of EcRecA activities (15.Cox M.M. Rothstein R. Aguilera A.

Magnesium ion-dependent activation of the RecA protein involves the C terminus.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Third, and finally, certain activities of EcRecA, prominently filament assembly on and dissociation from DNA, are subject to regulation by an array of other proteins (16.Cox M.M. Regulation of bacterial RecA function.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 41-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Based on changes in filament cooperativity, ATP hydrolysis rates, and other properties, there are at least four EcRecA filament states that can be identified at different stages of EcRecA-mediated DNA strand exchange (15.Cox M.M. Rothstein R. Aguilera A. Topics in Current Genetics: Molecular Genetics of Recombination. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2007: 53-94Google Scholar, 30.Haruta N. Yu X. Yang S. Egelman E.H.

RecA protein dynamics in the interior of RecA nucleoprotein filaments.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For example, when EcRecA nucleoprotein filaments are bound to ssDNA, ATP hydrolysis proceeds with a kcat of ∼30 min−1 at 37 °C. Addition of a homologous duplex DNA triggers a change in filament state that is manifested by an abrupt 30% decline in ATPase rate (31.Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Homology-dependent changes in adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis during RecA protein promoted DNA strand exchange: evidence for long paranemic complexes.Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5616-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Once EcRecA filaments are assembled on DNA, they are consistently active in the hydrolysis of ATP, although the rate is modulated by changes in filament state. The Deinococcus RecA protein (DrRecA) appears to be quite similar to the EcRecA in many respects (46.Kim J.I. Sharma A.K. Abbott S.N. Wood E.A. Dwyer D.W. Jambura A. Minton K.W. Inman R.B. Daly M.J. Cox M.M. RecA protein from the extremely radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans: Expression, purification, and characterization.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, at 37 °C, the DrRecA initiates DNA strand exchange primarily from the dsDNA instead of initiating from a bound ssDNA, inverse of other bacterial RecA proteins (47.Kim J.-I. Cox M.M. The RecA proteins of Deinococcus radiodurans and Escherichia coli promote DNA strand exchange via inverse pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the EcRecA can promote an inverse reaction under extraordinary reaction conditions (48.Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. A novel pairing process promoted by Escherichia coli RecA protein: inverse DNA and RNA strand exchange.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 740-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is the preferred mode for the DrRecA under at least some conditions (47.Kim J.-I. Cox M.M. The RecA proteins of Deinococcus radiodurans and Escherichia coli promote DNA strand exchange via inverse pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The DrRecA protein forms filaments on dsDNA, nucleating much faster than EcRecA but extending slower (49.Hsu H.-F. Ngo K.V. Chitteni-Pattu S. Cox M.M. Li H.-W. Investigating Deinococcus radiodurans RecA protein filament formation on double-stranded DNA by a real-time single-molecule approach.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8270-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This combination of attributes would tend to create a larger number of shorter DrRecA filaments, an adaptation that may facilitate the repair of the large number of double strand breaks created by extreme irradiation events. Deinococcus also encodes an SSB protein that is unusual. The DrSSB is approximately twice the size of a typical bacterial SSB (50.Bernstein D.A. Eggington J.M. Killoran M.P. Misic A.M. Cox M.M.

Genome reconstitution after heavy irradiation relies greatly on DNA double strand break repair, and the DrRecA and DrSSB proteins play key roles. The process of genome reconstitution is set up in its earliest steps, where DNA fragments are processed and DrRecA filaments are formed in potentially productive locations. This phase of “setting the stage” may involve quite a number of auxiliary proteins. However, we cannot understand how various proteins affect DrRecA until we better understand the properties of DrRecA itself. In this report, we further investigate one of the earliest stages of double strand DNA break repair, i.e. the formation of DrRecA protein filaments and filament dynamics. We also investigate the dependence of DrRecA function on DrSSB. The results reveal a highly constrained DrRecA protein that forms filaments on dsDNA, and ssDNA with SSB, but with no ATPase function at 30 °C and pH 7.5 or higher. Relative to EcRecA, changes in filament state are highly exaggerated in the DrRecA protein, highlighted by the ATPase inactive state that provides a potential new point of regulation. Activation of DrRecA is facilitated by a range of ligands and/or conditions, some of which reflect the situation likely to be present when double strand break repair is required. The results also show an unusually intimate functional relationship with DrSSB. We conclude our investigation with a working model that describes the potential dynamics of the RecA protein and its activities in D. radiodurans. The native DrRecA protein was purified as described (46.Kim J.I. Sharma A.K. Abbott S.N. Wood E.A. Dwyer D.W. Jambura A. Minton K.W. Inman R.B. Daly M.J. Cox M.M.

Differential diagnosis may be difficult, prognosis is poorly apprehended by histoclinical features, and no effective therapy exists for advanced stages.We profiled 16 SFT samples using whole-genome DNA microarrays and analyzed their expression profiles with publicly available profiles of 36 additional SFTs and 212 soft tissue sarcomas (STSs). Immunohistochemistry was applied to validate the expression of some discriminating genes.SFTs displayed whole-genome expression profiles more homogeneous and different from STSs, but closer to genetically-simple than genetically-complex STSs. The SFTs/STSs comparison identified a high percentage (∼30%) of genes as differentially expressed, most of them without any DNA copy number alteration. One of the genes most overexpressed in SFTs encoded the ALDH1 stem cell marker. Several upregulated genes and associated ontologies were also related to progenitor/stem cells. SFTs also overexpressed genes encoding therapeutic targets such as kinases (EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1, JAK2), histone deacetylases, or retinoic acid receptors. Their overexpression was found in all SFTs, regardless the anatomical location. Finally, we identified a 31-gene signature associated with the mitotic count, containing many genes related to cell cycle/mitosis, including AURKA.We established a robust repertoire of genes differentially expressed in SFTs. Certain overexpressed genes could provide new diagnostic (ALDH1A1), prognostic (AURKA) and/or therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2003676157,"Human mortality exhibits a strong seasonal pattern with deaths in winter far exceeding those in the summer. While the pattern itself is clear, there have been very few studies examining whether the magnitude or timing of seasonal mortality varies considerably across space. Thus, the goal of this study is to conduct a comprehensive geographic analysis of seasonal mortality across the United States and to uncover systematic regional differences in such mortality. Unique seasonal mortality curves were created for 28 metropolitan statistical areas across the United States, and the amplitude and timing of mortality peaks were determined. The findings here indicate that the seasonality of mortality exhibits strong spatial variation with the largest seasonal mortality amplitudes found in the southwestern United States and the smallest in the North, along with South Florida. In addition, there were strong intra-regional similarities that exist among the examined cities, implying that environmental factors are more important than social factors in determining seasonal mortality response. This work begins to fill a large gap within the scientific literature concerning the geographic variation and underlying causes of seasonal mortality across the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2052150188,"Earlier studies have shown considerable intersubject synchronization of brain activity when subjects watch the same movie or listen to the same story. Here we investigated the across-subjects similarity of brain responses to speech and non-speech sounds in a continuous audio drama designed for blind people. Thirteen healthy adults listened for ∼19 min to the audio drama while their brain activity was measured with 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An intersubject-correlation (ISC) map, computed across the whole experiment to assess the stimulus-driven extrinsic brain network, indicated statistically significant ISC in temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Group-level independent component (IC) analysis was used to parcel out the brain signals into functionally coupled networks, and the dependence of the ICs on external stimuli was tested by comparing them with the ISC map. This procedure revealed four extrinsic ICs of which two-covering non-overlapping areas of the auditory cortex-were modulated by both speech and non-speech sounds. The two other extrinsic ICs, one left-hemisphere-lateralized and the other right-hemisphere-lateralized, were speech-related and comprised the superior and middle temporal gyri, temporal poles, and the left angular and inferior orbital gyri. In areas of low ISC four ICs that were defined intrinsic fluctuated similarly as the time-courses of either the speech-sound-related or all-sounds-related extrinsic ICs. These ICs included the superior temporal gyrus, the anterior insula, and the frontal, parietal and midline occipital cortices. Taken together, substantial intersubject synchronization of cortical activity was observed in subjects listening to an audio drama, with results suggesting that speech is processed in two separate networks, one dedicated to the processing of speech sounds and the other to both speech and non-speech sounds."

Fibrocytes have been considered to play a role in allergic asthma. Here we sought to investigate the functional interaction of cockroach allergens with CD206 in fibrocytes.Profiling of N-linked glycans from natural purified cockroach allergen Bla g 2 was accomplished by MALDI-MS. The binding activity of cockroach allergens to CD206 was determined by solid-phase binding assays. Levels of CD206 expression on human fibrocytes and CD206 mediated signaling and cytokine production in Bla g 2 treated fibrocytes were determined.Profiling of N-linked glycans from Bla g 2 revealed a predominance of small, mannose-terminated glycans with and without fucose. Significant binding of Bla g 2 to CD206 was observed, which was inhibited by yeast mannan (a known CD206 ligand), free mannose, and a blocking antibody (anti-hMR). Flow cytometric analyses of human fibrocytes (CD45(+) and collagen-1(+)) showed selective expression of CD206 on fibrocytes. Functionally, a concentration-dependent uptake of FITC labeled Bla g 2 by fibrocytes was observed, but was significantly inhibited by anti-hMR. Bla g 2 can stimulate up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-6 and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB/p65), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38), ERK, and JNK in cultured fibrocytes. This increased secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and activation of NF-kB, ERK, and JNK was significantly inhibited by the addition of either mannan or mannose. Furthermore, Bla g 2 induced increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 production was also inhibited by the use of NF-kB, ERK, and JNK inhibitors.These results provide evidence supporting the existence of a functional cockroach allergen-CD206 axis in human fibrocytes, suggesting a role for CD206 in regulating allergen induced allergic responses in asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2162771864,"Two paralog transcriptional regulators of the MerR family, CueR and GolS, are responsible for monovalent metal ion sensing and resistance in Salmonella enterica. Although similar in sequence and also in their target binding sites, these proteins differ in signal detection and in the set of target genes they control. Recently, we demonstrated that selective promoter recognition depends on the presence of specific bases located at positions 3' and 3 within the operators they interact with. Here, we identify the amino acid residues within the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of these sensor proteins that are directly involved in operator discrimination. We demonstrate that a methionine residue at position 16 of GolS, absolutely conserved among GolS-like proteins but absent in all CueR-like xenologs, is the key to selectively recognize operators that harbor the distinctive GolS-operator signature, whereas the residue at position 19 finely tunes the regulator/operator interaction. Furthermore, swapping these residues switches the set of genes recognized by these transcription factors. These results indicate that co-evolution of a regulator and its cognate operators within the bacterial cell provides the conditions to avoid cross-recognition and guarantees the proper response to metal injury."
https://openalex.org/W1977981949,"Neonatal brains develop through a program that eliminates about half of the neurons. During this period, neurons depend on neurotrophins for their survival. Recently, we reported that, at the conclusion of the naturally occurring death period, neurons become neurotrophin-independent and, further, that this developmental switch is achieved by the emergence of a second survival pathway mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Here I show that calcineurin plays a key role in controlling the developmental switch in mouse hippocampal neurons. Calcineurin promotes the degradation of STAT3 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of calcineurin acutely increases total levels of STAT3 as well as its activated forms, resulting in decreased levels of the tumor suppressor p53 and its proapoptotic target, Bax. In vivo and in vitro, calcineurin regulates levels of STAT3 and neurotrophin dependence. TMF/ARA 160 (TATA element modulatory factor/androgen receptor co-activator 160), the key mediator of STAT3 ubiquitination, is required for calcineurin-dependent STAT3 degradation. Thus, these results show that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway controls the critical developmental switch of neurotrophin dependence in the newborn hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2004110360,"Crustaceans are key components of marine ecosystems which, like other exploited marine taxa, show seasonable patterns of distribution and activity, with consequences for their availability to capture by targeted fisheries. Despite concerns over the sustainability of crab fisheries worldwide, difficulties in observing crabs' behaviour over their annual cycles, and the timings and durations of reproduction, remain poorly understood. From the release of 128 mature female edible crabs tagged with electronic data storage tags (DSTs), we demonstrate predominantly westward migration in the English Channel. Eastern Channel crabs migrated further than western Channel crabs, while crabs released outside the Channel showed little or no migration. Individual migrations were punctuated by a 7-month hiatus, when crabs remained stationary, coincident with the main period of crab spawning and egg incubation. Incubation commenced earlier in the west, from late October onwards, and brooding locations, determined using tidal geolocation, occurred throughout the species range. With an overall return rate of 34%, our results demonstrate that previous reluctance to tag crabs with relatively high-cost DSTs for fear of loss following moulting is unfounded, and that DSTs can generate precise information with regards life-history metrics that would be unachievable using other conventional means."
https://openalex.org/W2021601235,"A major challenge in the agricultural industry is the development of techniques that can screen plant samples for viroid infection. Microarrays are promising in this regard, as their high throughput nature can potentially allow for the detection of a range of viroids in a single test. In this paper we present a microarray that can detect a wide spectrum of all 8 reported viroid genera including 37 known plant viroid species. The array was constructed using an automated probe design protocol which generated a minimal number of probes to detect viroids at the genus level. The designed microarray showed a high specificity and sensitivity when tested with a set of standard virus samples. Finally, the microarray was applied to screen infected field samples, with Hop stunt viroid infection identified as the major disease causing pathogen for an infected citrus sample."
https://openalex.org/W2032313792,"Proteolytic activity of cell surface-associated MT1-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (MMP-14) is directly related to cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. MT1-MMP is regulated as a proteinase by activation and conversion of the latent proenzyme into the active enzyme, and also via inhibition by tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) and self-proteolysis. MT1-MMP is also regulated as a membrane protein through its internalization and recycling. Routine immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, reverse transcription-PCR, and immunoblotting methodologies do not allow quantitative imaging and assessment of the cell-surface levels of the active, TIMP-free MT1-MMP enzyme. Here, we developed a fluorescent reporter prototype that targets the cellular active MT1-MMP enzyme alone. The reporter (MP-3653) represents a liposome tagged with a fluorochrome and functionalized with a PEG chain spacer linked to an inhibitory hydroxamate warhead. Our studies using the MP-3653 reporter and its inactive derivative demonstrated that MP-3653 can be efficiently used not only to visualize the trafficking of MT1-MMP through the cell compartment, but also to quantify the femtomolar range amounts of the cell surface-associated active MT1-MMP enzyme in multiple cancer cell types, including breast carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma. Thus, the levels of the naturally expressed, fully functional, active cellular MT1-MMP enzyme are roughly equal to 1 × 10(5) molecules/cell, whereas these levels are in a 1 × 10(6) range in the cells with the enforced MT1-MMP expression. We suggest that the reporter we developed will contribute to the laboratory studies of MT1-MMP and then, ultimately, to the design of novel, more efficient prognostic approaches and personalized cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2034122836,"Spermatid specific thioredoxin-3 (SPTRX3 or TXNDC8) is a testis/male germ line specific member of thioredoxin family that accumulates in the superfluous cytoplasm of defective human spermatozoa. We hypothesized that semen levels of SPTRX3 are reflective of treatment outcome in assisted reproductive therapy (ART) couples treated by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Relationship between SPTRX3 and treatment outcome was investigated in 239 couples undergoing ART at an infertility clinic. Sperm content of SPTRX3 was evaluated by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy, and correlated with clinical semen analysis parameters, and data on embryo development and pregnancy establishment. High SPTRX3 levels (>15% SPTRX3-positive spermatozoa) were found in 51% of male infertility patients (n = 72), in 20% of men from couples with unexplained, idiopathic infertility (n = 61) and in 14% of men from couples previously diagnosed with female-only infertility (n = 85). Couples with high SPTRX3 produced fewer two-pronuclear zygotes and had a reduced pregnancy rate (19.2% pregnant with >15% SPTRX3-positive spermatozoa vs. 41.2% pregnant with <5% SPTRX3-positive sperm; one-sided p<0.05). The average pregnancy rate of all 239 couples was 25.1%. Live birth rate was 19.2% and lowest average SPTRX3 levels were found in couples that delivered twins. Men with >15% of SPTRX3-positive spermatozoa, a cutoff value established by ROC analysis, had their chance of fathering children by IVF or ICSI reduced by nearly two-thirds. The percentage of SPTRX3-positive spermatozoa had predictive value for pregnancy after ART. Gradient purification and sperm swim-up failed to remove all SPTRX3-positive spermatozoa from semen prepared for ART. In summary, the elevated semen content of SPTRX3 in men from ART couples coincided with reduced incidence of pregnancy by IVF or ICSI, identifying SPTRX3 as a candidate biomarker reflective of ART outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2053954959,"The glycoprotein (G protein) and fusion protein (F protein) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) both show genetic variability, but few studies have examined the F protein gene. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology and phylodynamics of the F protein gene in clinical RSV strains isolated in northern Taiwan from 2000-2011.RSV isolates from children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms between July 2000 and June 2011 were typed based on F protein gene sequences. Phylogeny construction and evaluation were performed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Phylodynamic patterns in RSV F protein genes were analyzed using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. Selection pressure on the F protein gene was detected using the Datamonkey website interface.From a total of 325 clinical RSV strains studied, phylogenetic analysis showed that 83 subgroup A strains (RSV-A) could be further divided into three clusters, whereas 58 subgroup B strains (RSV-B) had no significant clustering. Three amino acids were observed to differ between RSV-A and -B (positions 111, 113, and 114) in CTL HLA-B*57- and HLA-A*01-restricted epitopes. One positive selection site was observed in RSV-B, while none was observed in RSV-A. The evolution rate of the virus had very little change before 2000, then slowed down between 2000 and 2005, and evolved significantly faster after 2005. The dominant subtypes of RSV-A in each epidemic were replaced by different subtypes in the subsequent epidemic.Before 2004, RSV-A infections were involved in several small epidemics and only very limited numbers of strains evolved and re-emerged in subsequent years. After 2005, the circulating RSV-A strains were different from those of the previous years and continued evolving through 2010. Phylodynamic pattern showed the evolutionary divergence of RSV increased significantly in the recent 5 years in northern Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W1998917502,"Glucose/carbon metabolism is a fundamental cellular process in living cells. In response to varying environments, eukaryotic cells reprogram their glucose/carbon metabolism between aerobic or anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and/or gluconeogenesis. The distinct type of glucose/carbon metabolism that a cell carries out has significant effects on the cell's proliferation and differentiation. However, it is poorly understood how the reprogramming of glucose/carbon metabolism is regulated. Here, we report a novel endosomal PI(3,5)P2 lipid-dependent regulatory mechanism that is required for metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Certain gluconeogenesis genes, such as FBP1 (encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1) and ICL1 (encoding isocitrate lyase 1) are under control of the Mig1 repressor and Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor complex. We previously identified the PI(3,5)P2-dependent Tup1 conversion (PIPTC), a mechanism to convert Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor to Cti6-Cyc8-Tup1 coactivator. We demonstrate that the PIPTC plays a critical role for transcriptional activation of FBP1 and ICL1. Furthermore, without the PIPTC, the Cat8 and Sip4 transcriptional activators cannot be efficiently recruited to the promoters of FBP1 and ICL1, suggesting a key role for the PIPTC in remodulating the chromatin architecture at the promoters. Our findings expand our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms for metabolic reprogramming in eukaryotes to include key regulation steps outside the nucleus. Given that Tup1 and the metabolic enzymes that control PI(3,5)P2 are highly conserved among eukaryotes, our findings may provide important insights toward understanding glucose/carbon metabolic reprogramming in other eukaryotes, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2043135886,"The natural world contains a rich and ever-changing landscape of sensory information. To survive, an organism must be able to flexibly and rapidly locate the most relevant sources of information at any time. Humans and non-human primates exploit regularities in the spatial distribution of relevant stimuli (targets) to improve detection at locations of high target probability. Is the ability to flexibly modify behavior based on visual experience unique to primates? Chickens (Gallus domesticus) were trained on a multiple alternative Go/NoGo task to detect a small, briefly-flashed dot (target) in each of the quadrants of the visual field. When targets were presented with equal probability (25%) in each quadrant, chickens exhibited a distinct advantage for detecting targets at lower, relative to upper, hemifield locations. Increasing the probability of presentation in the upper hemifield locations (to 80%) dramatically improved detection performance at these locations to be on par with lower hemifield performance. Finally, detection performance in the upper hemifield changed on a rapid timescale, improving with successive target detections, and declining with successive detections at the diagonally opposite location in the lower hemifield. These data indicate the action of a process that in chickens, as in primates, flexibly and dynamically modulates detection performance based on the spatial probabilities of sensory stimuli as well as on recent performance history."
https://openalex.org/W2010211647,"Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is elicited by the MecI-MecR1-MecA axis encoded by the mec locus. Recently, MecR2 was also identified as a regulator of mec through binding of the methicillin repressor, MecI. Here we show that plasmid-encoded full-length MecR2 restores resistance in a sensitive S. aureus mecR2 deletion mutant of the resistant strain N315. The crystal structure of MecR2 reveals an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, an intermediate scaffold domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain that contributes to oligomerization. The protein shows structural similarity to ROK (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family proteins, which bind DNA and/or sugar molecules. We found that functional cell-based assays of three point mutants affecting residues participating in sugar binding in ROK proteins had no effect on the resistance phenotype. By contrast, MecR2 bound short double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides nonspecifically, and a deletion mutant affecting the N-terminal DNA-binding domain showed a certain effect on activity, thus contributing to resistance less than the wild-type protein. Similarly, a deletion mutant, in which a flexible segment of intermediate scaffold domain had been replaced by four glycines, significantly reduced MecR2 function, thus indicating that this domain may likewise be required for activity.

Most recently, comparative genomic sequence analysis revealed that, in some clinical MRSA strains, a putative gene is found upstream of mecA, which is co-transcribed with mecI and mecR1 (34.Arêde P. Milheiriço C. de Lencastre H. Oliveira D.C. The anti-repressor MecR2 promotes the proteolysis of the mecA repressor and enables optimal expression of β-lactam resistance in MRSA.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Its transcript could be detected by reverse transcriptase PCR of cultures induced with oxacillin—a methicillin analog that has replaced the latter in clinical use—from a set of prototype clinical MRSA strains, paralleling mecA induction. Furthermore, in the presence of fully functional MecR1 and MecI, this gene was essential for the optimal expression of BLA resistance. Finally, in vitro and in vivo assays showed that the encoded protein acted as an antirepressor by disrupting MecI binding to the mecA promoter and fostering its MecR1-independent proteolytic inactivation (34.Arêde P. Milheiriço C. de Lencastre H. Oliveira D.C. The anti-repressor MecR2 promotes the proteolysis of the mecA repressor and enables optimal expression of β-lactam resistance in MRSA.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicated that the long sought-for gene encoding MecR2/BlaR2 had been found, and so it was termed mecR2 (34.Arêde P. Milheiriço C. de Lencastre H. Oliveira D.C. The anti-repressor MecR2 promotes the proteolysis of the mecA repressor and enables optimal expression of β-lactam resistance in MRSA.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To shed light on the structural determinants of folding and function of MecR2, we developed an efficient protocol to produce and purify large quantities of the functional wild-type protein. Furthermore, we assayed activity of MecR2 in cell-based assays and in vitro and determined its x-ray crystal structure. We report here the molecular determinants of its function, which were further validated by mutational studies. The mecR2gene was amplified from genomic DNA from S. aureus strain HU25 (Met1–Ala376; see GenBankTM accession number AF422694, protein sequence identical to UniProt entry Q99XE2) by PCR and cloned into expression vector pCri8a between NcoI and XhoI restriction sites, giving rise to plasmid pCri8::mecR2 (for strains and plasmids used in this study, see Table 1). This construct added an N-terminal His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, so that the N terminus of the mature protein was preceded by a 20-residue segment (−21MGSSHHHHHHSSGENLYFQGP−1; negative superscript numbers refer to extra N-terminal residues preceding the mature N terminus, which is Met1 according to Q99XE2). A mutant, in which segment Thr150–Ile160 had been replaced by four glycine residues (termed MecR2 Thr150–Ile160 → GGGG), was amplified from the pST181::spac::mecR2 recombinant plasmid by PCR and cloned into expression vector pCri8a at the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. Expression vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells, and 1-liter cultures of transformed bacteria were induced for protein expression with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18 °C for 24 h when the optical density at λ = 600 nm (A600) reached 0.6. Cultures were subsequently centrifuged at 7,000 × g (4 °C, 20 min), and pellets were resuspended in 70 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, 0.5 m sodium chloride, pH 8.0). The cells were lysed with a cell disruptor (Constant Cell Disruption Systems Ltd.) operated at 1.35 KBar, and the lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 75,600 × g in an Avanti J-25 centrifuge with a JA-25.50 rotor (4 °C, 20 min). The soluble fraction containing His6-TEV-MecR2 was applied onto a His-trap FF crude column (GE Healthcare) attached to an ÄKTA Purifier UPC-10 FPLC system previously equilibrated with buffer A. The protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient (0–0.5 m imidazole in buffer A), and fractions containing the protein were subjected to a final size exclusion chromatography step in a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl, 0.2 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4. Protein purity was assessed by 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE. TEV protease digestion of the N-terminal His6 tag was assayed under different conditions, but yields were not satisfactory. As such, crystallization trials were performed using tagged MecR2 (hereafter wild-type MecR2). The selenomethionine variant of MecR2 was obtained in the same manner, except that 30 min before induction, the cells were added to 500 ml of medium lacking methionine and containing 25 mg of selenomethionine (Sigma-Aldrich) instead.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsStrain/plasmidRelevant characteristicsSourceStrainsE. coli DH5αRecipient strain for recombinant plasmidsStratageneE. coli BL21 (DE3)Recipient strain for expression vector pCri8aNovageneBL21 + pCri8a::mecR2E. coli BL21 (DE3) overexpressing mecR2 with an N-terminal His6 tag and a TEV protease cleavage siteThis studyS. aureus RN4220Restriction-deficient derivative of reference strain NCTC8325–4R.

https://openalex.org/W2117177083,"The clinical tumor-node-metastasis (T, N and M) classes of breast cancers provide important prognostic information. However, the possible association of TNM classes with reproductive factors has remained largely unexplored. Because every woman has a reproductive history, implications to outcome prediction are potentially significant.During the study period from 2002 through 2008, 5,614 pre- and 27,310 postmenopausal patients were identified in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for TNM classes of breast cancers by histology. The reproductive variables were parity, age at first and last childbirth and time interval between first and last childbirth.Among postmenopausal patients, the ORs for high-T class (T2-T4) (tumor size ≥2 cm) and metastasis were decreased by parity. A late age at first and last childbirth associated with high-T class and the effects were higher for lobular (OR for late age at first childbirth = 2.85) than ductal carcinoma. Overall, long time interval between first and last childbirth was related to high-T class and metastasis. However, a short time interval between first and last childbirth in patients with late age at first or last childbirth increased the risk of metastasis. Late age at last childbirth was associated with increased occurrence of lobular carcinoma in situ. Among premenopausal ductal carcinoma patients, nulliparity and early age at first childbirth were associated with high-T class.Increasing parity was protective against high-T class and metastasis; late ages at first and last childbirth were risk factors for high-T class in postmenopausal breast cancers. The current decline in parity and delayed age at first childbirth in many countries may negatively influence prognosis of breast cancer."
