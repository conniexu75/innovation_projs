https://openalex.org/W1978498418,"The nature-nurture issue has provided some of the most keenly contested debates in the fields of biology, psychology, sociology, and physics during the past 5 years. As is well known, the same questions have been a source of controversy for more than a hundred years in diverse political and social climates. From time to time, practical measures have been implemented whose nature has often depended on the relation between the political ideals of the regime of the time and the ideals of the contemporary scientific participants in the naturenurture controversy. Some of the history of this interaction in the United States as it pertains to intelligence has been surveyed by Kamin (I) and Allen (2). The most recent explosion of interest in the question is probably attributable to Jensen's (3, 4) contention that, since inequalities in cognitive performance are largely genetic in origin, environmental intervention through educational or social innovations will be of minimal value in reducing these inequalities. The premise for this argument is based on Jensen's analyses of the data from a large number of empirical studies. From these analyses, Jensen also argues that there is probably a strong genetic component to the observed differences in mean IQ between black and white children in the United States. The analyses and arguments that were made by Jensen for IQ, and by others for"

This augmented peroxisome population was accompanied by significant elevation of liver catalase activity. These two hypolipidemic peroxisome proliferators are structurally different from ethyl Î±-p-chlorophenozyisobutyrate (clofibrate) and other hypolipidemic, aryloxyisobutyrate derivatives which cause hepatic peroxisome proliferation. Induction of peroxisome proliferation by these structurally unrelated hypolipidemic compounds suggests a possible relation between hepatic peroxisome proliferation and hypolipidemia."

https://openalex.org/W2069752196,"The hepatomegaly that appears after long-term feeding of ethanol results in accumulation of protein that is quantitatively as important as the increase in lipid. The bulk of protein accumulates in the soluble fraction of the cell. Hepatic albumin and transferrin concentrations increase and colchicine-binding protein decreases, thus suggesting an intrahepatic retention of export proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2042387002,"The distribution of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm following a local rise in Ca2+ concentration is visualized by means of aequorin luminescence and a television system with an image intensifier. Diffusion of Ca2+ through the cytosol is so constrained that a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration produced by local Ca2+ entry through cell membrane or by local Ca2+ injection is confined to the immediate vicinity of these sites. The diffusion constraints are lifted by treatment with cyanide or ruthenium red. Thus, energized calcium sequestering, probably by mitochondria, is the dominant factor in the constraints. In cell regions where the sequestering machinery is sufficiently dense, different Ca2+ message functions inside a cell may be effectively segregated, permitting private-line intracellular communication."

https://openalex.org/W2152392333,"Secretory immunoglobulin A is the predominant immunoglobulin in labial minor salivary gland secretions. Its mean concentration is four times higher in these secretions than in parotid gland secretion. The minor salivary glands can produce 30 to 35 percent of the immunoglobulin A that enters the oral cavity. This, together with the potential accessibility of these glands to antigenic stimulation, suggest that they may be an important source of the immune factors that are involved in the regulation of the microorganisms in the oral environment."

https://openalex.org/W2012852572,"Male crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, show different behaviors toward males (aggression) and females (submission, courtship). Behavioral and neurophysiological tests with water in which the crayfish had been held demonstrated the existence of sex pheromones. The inner rami of the antennules are the site of reception, and the chemicals are probably carbohydrates."

Their judgments of taste intensity and pleasantness of sweet and salty stimuli are in accord with European population estimates, which suggests that dietary history may alter preferences for simple taste stimuli without affecting the gustatory system."

Failure of skeletal remodeling became evident within a few weeks after transplantation as calcified cartilage and bone accumulated excessively in the active metaphyses of the long bones. The massive lesions produced were extensively infiltrated with abnormal osteoclasts."

https://openalex.org/W2017617356,Removal of perilymph from the cochlea has been reported to destroy the sharp tuning of cochlear neurons. That these changes are mechanical in origin is refuted by the concurrent recording of sharp neural tuning with broad basilar membrane responses from the same region of the partially drained cat cochlea. A second cochlear filter is therefore necessary.

https://openalex.org/W2050701648,"Many kinds of ants use odor trails to recruit nestmates to food discoveries and new sites; minor workers of the myrmicine Pheidole dentata also use them to recruit major workers (""soldiers"") to the vicinity of intruders. This newly discovered alarm-recruitment system has proved to be narrowly specific. Only fire ants and other members of the genus Solenopsis, which include some of the potentially most dangerous enemies of Pheidole, have been found to evoke the response when present as single scouts or small invading forces. The glandular source of the Pheidole trail pheromone and the cues by which Pheidole recognize Solenopsis have been experimentally determined."

https://openalex.org/W2025696598,"Treatment of duodenal tissue from rats deficient in vitamin D with 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2-D3] led to more than a doubling of calcium uptake by the isolated cells and the appearacne in those cells of previously undetectable calcium-binding protein (CaBP). Treatment with the precursor, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3, was without effect on calcium uptake or CaBP. Cells from vitamin D-replete animals took up three and a half times more calcium than cells from deficient animals. This rapid (90-minute) effect of in vitro treatment with a physiological dose (4.7 X 10(-8)M) of 1,25-(OH)2-D is the first such report and is in accord with the regulatory role of the hormone-like sterol."

https://openalex.org/W2010421901,"Fibroblasts freshly isolated from embryonic tendons were incubated with a proline analog, cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, which is incorporated into protein and which leads to the intracellular accumulation of nonhelical procollagen. Evidence is presented here that the nonhelical procollagen containing the analog is retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum and does not pass to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi vacuoles at a normal rate."
https://openalex.org/W2048277641,"The effect of centrifugal and gravitational forces whose resultant ranged between 26 degrees and 45 degrees on comb construction by hornet workers was assessed experimentally. Comb construction by hornets exposed to centrifugation at 1 to 2 days of age differed from that of hornets similarly exposed at 3 to 7 days of age. Juvenile hornets built their cells in the direction of the resultant force, whereas adults resisted the centrifugal force and tried to build in the direction of the gravitational force. Juveniles started their comb from the side walls, whereas adults started from the roof, as did nonspinning, control hornets. The findings suggest that hornets rapidly learn the gravitational force during the first days of life, and that they are aided by geometric cues of the breeding box to build in the direction of the force to which they had become habituated."

When these are suitably aligned by placing two gaps, 40 percent of the amino acids in corresponding positions are identical. This indicates that the doubling of an ancestral structural gene occurred during the evolution of the transferrins."

https://openalex.org/W2151320050,Cystathionase activity in a lymphoid cell line extract from a vitamin B6-responsive patient with cystathioninuria was increased strikingly by pyridoxal phosphate. Immunodiffusion with antiserum to human hepatic cystathionase showed identity between this cystathionase protein and cystathionase from an extract of normal lymphoid cells. Neither an increase in cystathionase activity nor immunochemical identity was found using extract of cells from a B6-unresponsive patient.

No significant difference in paternal social class was associated with the occurrence of the XYY or the XXY karyotype. This argues against the suggestion that socioeconomic factors significantly affect the frequency of the nondisjunctional events leading to these chromosome abnormalities."
