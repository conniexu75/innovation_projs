https://openalex.org/W2007161557,"The fat-derived hormone leptin regulates energy balance in part by modulating the activity of neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. To study the intrinsic activity of these neurons and their responses to leptin, we generated mice that express distinct green fluorescent proteins in these two neuronal types. Leptin-deficient ( ob/ob ) mice differed from wild-type mice in the numbers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and postsynaptic currents onto neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons. When leptin was delivered systemically to ob/ob mice, the synaptic density rapidly normalized, an effect detectable within 6 hours, several hours before leptin's effect on food intake. These data suggest that leptin-mediated plasticity in the ob/ob hypothalamus may underlie some of the hormone's behavioral effects."

https://openalex.org/W2060559393,"Epigenetic silencing can mimic genetic mutation by abolishing expression of a gene. We hypothesized that an epimutation could occur in any gene as a germline event that predisposes to disease and looked for examples in tumor suppressor genes in individuals with cancer. Here we report two individuals with soma-wide, allele-specific and mosaic hypermethylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1. Both individuals lack evidence of genetic mutation in any mismatch repair gene but have had multiple primary tumors that show mismatch repair deficiency, and both meet clinical criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The epimutation was also present in spermatozoa of one of the individuals, indicating a germline defect and the potential for transmission to offspring. Germline epimutation provides a mechanism for phenocopying of genetic disease. The mosaicism and nonmendelian inheritance that are characteristic of epigenetic states could produce patterns of disease risk that resemble those of polygenic or complex traits."

https://openalex.org/W2051149841,"Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) has been demonstrated in epithelial origin tumors. However, the methylation profiling of tumor-related gene promoter regions in cutaneous melanoma tumors has not been reported. Seven known or candidate TSGs that are frequently hypermethylated in carcinomas were assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in 15 melanoma cell lines and 130 cutaneous melanoma tumors. Four TSGs were frequently hypermethylated in 86 metastatic tumor specimens: retinoic acid receptor-β2 (RAR-β2) (70%), RAS association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A) (57%), and O6-methylguanine DNA methylatransferase (MGMT) (34%), and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) (19%). Hypermethylation of MGMT, RASSF1A, and DAPK was significantly lower in primary melanomas (n=20) compared to metastatic melanomas. However, hypermethylation of RAR-β2 was 70% in both primary and metastatic melanomas. Cell lines had hypermethylation profiles similar to those of metastatic melanomas. The analysis of these four markers of metastatic tumors demonstrated that 97% had ⩾1 gene(s) and 59% had ⩾2 genes hypermethylated. The methylation of genes was verified by bisulfite sequencing. The mRNA transcripts could be re-expressed in melanoma cell lines having hypermethylated genes following treatment with 5′-aza 2′-deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC). Analysis of melanoma patients’ plasma (preoperative blood; n=31) demonstrated circulating hypermethylated MGMT, RAR-β2, and RASSF1A DNA for at least one of the markers in 29% of the patients. Our findings indicate that the incidence of TSG hypermethylation increases during tumor progression. Methylation of TSG may play a significant role in cutaneous melanoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2055687679,"Ionizing radiation (IR) induces p53-dependent apoptosis in radiosensitive tissues, suggesting that p53 is a determinant of radiation syndromes. In fact, p53-deficient mice survive doses of IR that cause lethal hematopoietic syndrome in wild-type animals. Surprisingly, p53 deficiency results in sensitization of mice to higher doses of IR, causing lethal gastro-intestinal (GI) syndrome. While cells in the crypts of p53-wild-type epithelium undergo prolonged growth arrest after irradiation, continuous cell proliferation ongoing in p53-deficient epithelium correlates with accelerated death of damaged cells followed by rapid destruction of villi and accelerated lethality. p21-deficient mice are also characterized by increased sensitivity to GI syndrome-inducing doses of IR. We conclude that p53/p21-mediated growth arrest plays a protective role in the epithelium of small intestine after severe doses of IR. Pharmacological inhibition of p53 by a small molecule that can rescue from lethal hematopoietic syndrome has no effect on the lethality from gastro-intestinal syndrome, presumably because of a temporary and reversible nature of its action."

https://openalex.org/W1963945928,"Point mutations constitute a major mode of oncogenic activation of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Met is aberrantly activated in many types of human malignancies and its deregulated activity is correlated with aggressive tumor traits such as abnormal proliferation and survival, leading to tumor growth, local invasion and metastasis. Here we report that the Met kinase inhibitor SU11274 differentially affects the kinase activity and subsequent signaling of various mutant forms of Met. Two Met variants tested, M1268T and H1112Y, were potently inhibited by 2 μ M SU11274, while two other variants, L1213V and Y1248H, remained resistant under similar experimental conditions. Inhibition of the kinase altered cell proliferation, morphology and motility, while cells containing resistant mutants appeared unaffected by the compound. The basis for the sensitivity or resistance to SU11274 is discussed in terms of the position of the mutations predicted from a homology model."
https://openalex.org/W2048099772,"To increase our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma (MB), we utilized the technique of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify genes that are dysregulated in MB when compared to cerebellum. SSH-enriched cDNA libraries from both human and Ptch+/- heterozygous murine MBs were generated by subtracting common cDNAs from corresponding non-neoplastic cerebellum. For the human classic MB library, total human cerebellar RNA was used as control tissue; for the Ptch+/- heterozygous MB, non-neoplastic cerebellum from an unaffected Ptch+/- littermate was used as the control. Through differential screening of these libraries, over 100 upregulated tumor cDNA fragments were isolated, sequenced and identified with the NCBI BLAST program. From these, we selected genes involved in cellular proliferation, antiapoptosis, and cerebellar differentiation for further analysis. Upregulated genes identified in the human MB library included Unc33-like protein (ULIP), SOX4, Neuronatin (NNAT), the mammalian homologue of Drosophila BarH-like 1(BARHL1), the nuclear matix protein NRP/B (ENC1), and the homeobox OTX2 gene. Genes found to be upregulated in the murine MB library included cyclin D2 (Ccnd2), thymopoietin (Tmpo), Musashi-1 (Msh1), protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor-2 (I-2pp2a), and Unc5h4(D). Using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNA expression levels for these genes were markedly higher in human MBs than in cerebellum. Western blot analysis was used to further confirm the overexpression of a subset of these genes at the protein level. Notch pathway overactivity was demonstrated in the TE671 MB cell line expressing high levels of MSH1 through HES1-Luciferase transfections. This study has revealed a panel of developmentally regulated genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of MB."
https://openalex.org/W2065136628,"Ras proteins exert a pivotal regulatory function in signal transduction involved in cell proliferation and their activation mutation leads to malignant cell transformation. However, the role of Ras proteins in autophagy, an intracellular protein degradation process in cell growth control is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that the degradation of long-lived proteins in NIH3T3 cells in response to nutrient starvation was significantly suppressed by oncogenic RasVal12 transformation in a rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor)-sensitive manner. Morphologic observations also show the decrease in the formation of autophagic vacuoles upon the Ras transformation. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor or serum downregulated the protein degradation induced by serum starvation and the dominant-negative RasAsn17 mutant counteracted this suppressive effect, indicating that Ras mediates the growth factor downregulation of autophagy. The suppression of protein degradation by the activated RasVal12 was mediated by the class I phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not either or Raf Ral GDS. Consistent with this, RasVal12 and class I PI3-kinase inhibited the rate of autophagic sequestration of LDH. These data suggest that Ras plays a critical role as a negative regulator for nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy through the class I PI3-kinase signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1995931752,"Germline mutations in succinate dehydrogenase subunits B, C and D (SDHB, SDHC and SDHD), genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial complex II, cause hereditary paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas. In SDHB (1p36)- and SDHC (1q21)-linked families, disease inheritance is autosomal dominant. In SDHD (11q23)-linked families, the disease phenotype is expressed only upon paternal transmission of the mutation, consistent with maternal imprinting. However, SDHD shows biallelic expression in brain, kidney and lymphoid tissues (Baysal et al., 2000). Moreover, consistent loss of the wild-type (wt) maternal allele in SDHD-linked tumours suggests expression of the maternal SDHD allele in normal paraganglia. Here we demonstrate exclusive loss of the entire maternal chromosome 11 in SDHD-linked paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas, suggesting that combined loss of the wt SDHD allele and maternal 11p region is essential for tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that this is driven by selective loss of one or more imprinted genes in the 11p15 region. In paternally, but not in maternally derived SDHD mutation carriers, this can be achieved by a single event, that is, non-disjunctional loss of the maternal chromosome 11. Thus, the exclusive paternal transmission of the disease can be explained by a somatic genetic mechanism targeting both the SDHD gene on 11q23 and a paternally imprinted gene on 11p15.5, rather than imprinting of SDHD."
https://openalex.org/W1964540535,"Individualized outcome prediction classifiers were successfully constructed through expression profiling of a total of 8644 genes in 50 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, which had been consecutively operated on within a defined short period of time and followed up for more than 5 years. The resultant classifier of NSCLCs yielded 82% accuracy for forecasting survival or death 5 years after surgery of a given patient. In addition, since two major histologic classes may differ in terms of outcome-related expression signatures, histologic-type-specific outcome classifiers were also constructed. The resultant highly predictive classifiers, designed specifically for nonsquamous cell carcinomas, showed a prediction accuracy of more than 90% independent of disease stage. In addition to the presence of heterogeneities in adenocarcinomas, our unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed for the first time the existence of clinicopathologically relevant subclasses of squamous cell carcinomas with marked differences in their invasive growth and prognosis. This finding clearly suggests that NSCLCs comprise distinct subclasses with considerable heterogeneities even within one histologic type. Overall, these findings should advance not only our understanding of the biology of lung cancer but also our ability to individualize postoperative therapies based on the predicted outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2031368804,"Cell growth is promoted by mitogens and survival factors, which activate intracellular signalling pathways to control cell cycle progression and cellular integrity. Proliferation signals are transmitted through Ras and Rho family small G-proteins coupled to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, while survival signals are propagated by lipid-dependent kinases such as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB). Recently, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins were identified as positive regulators of proliferation in a variety of cell types. Persistent activation of these pathways is associated with tumour cell growth, whereas their inhibition can halt proliferation and precipitate apoptotic cell death. The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum-sensing signal molecules (QSSMs) to regulate virulence gene expression. QSSMs also suppress host immune responses although the mechanism of suppression is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the QSSM N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) from P. aeruginosa blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in human BC cell lines. Analyses of signalling events reveal that OdDHL has little or no effect on MAPK cascades, partially inhibits the Akt/PKB pathway and ablates STAT3 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of each pathway independently indicates that STAT3 activity is critical for BC cell proliferation and survival, while a constitutively active STAT3 confers resistance to OdDHL. These results support the notion of OdDHL as a bioactive molecule in eukaryotic systems and a paradigm for a novel class of antiproliferative compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2022741840,"Gastric carcinogenesis involves multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. Epigenetic silencing of tumor-related genes due to CpG island methylation (CIM) has been recently reported in gastric cancer, but the role in precursor lesions is not well understood. We analysed the methylation status of the tumor suppressor gene p16, the DNA mismatch repair gene hMLH1, and four CpG islands (MINT1, MINT2, MINT25, and MINT31) using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 35 polypoid adenomas and 46 flat dysplasias unassociated with carcinoma, 34 early adenocarcinomas (T1N0M0) and associated adenomas/dysplasias, and corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic mucosa. The extent of CIM was defined by the fraction of methylated loci (methylation index), and compared with previously characterized genetic alterations (microsatellite instability (MSI) and APC gene mutation). We found that methylation of p16 was more frequent in adenocarcinoma-associated dysplasias/adenomas (29%) and adenocarcinomas (44%) as compared to flat dysplasias (4%) and adenomas (18%) unassociated with adenocarcinoma (P=0.001). The mean methylation index increased from normal/chronic gastritis (CG) mucosa (0.09) to intestinal metaplasia (IM) (0.16), flat dysplasias (0.40) or polypoid adenomas (0.41) unassociated with carcinoma, dysplasias/adenomas associated with carcinoma (0.44), and adenocarcinomas (0.44). There was no difference in frequencies of high-level CpG island methylation (CIM-H, methylation index > or =0.5) among flat dysplasias (50%) and polypoid adenomas (51%) unassociated with carcinoma, dysplasias/adenomas associated with adenocarcinoma (47%), and adenocarcinoma (47%). CIM-H was present in 15% of IM, but not in normal/CG mucosa. There was a significant correlation between methylation of hMLH1 and high-level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H): methylation of hMLH1 was present in 71% of MSI-H tumors, but only 8% of MSI-low tumors and 13% of microsatellite-stable tumors (P=0.0001). There was no statistical difference between methylation index and APC mutation. Our results indicate that concurrent promoter methylation is an early and frequent event in gastric tumorigenesis, including both MSI-H and microsatellite-stable neoplasms. Methylation of the p16 gene may contribute to the malignant transformation of gastric precursor lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2084739125,"WWOX, the gene that maps to common chromosomal fragile site FRA16D, is frequently affected by aberrations in multiple types of cancers. WWOX encodes a 46 kDa protein that contains two WW domains and a short-chain oxidoreductase (SDR) domain. We recently demonstrated that ectopic expression of WWOX inhibits xenograft tumor growth of tumorigenic breast cancer cells. Little is known of the biochemical function(s) of WWOX. The SDR domain is predicted to be involved in sex-steroid metabolism and the WW domains are likely involved in protein-protein interactions. In this report, we identify the specific proline-rich ligand for WWOX as PPXY and show that the amino-terminal WW domain is responsible for this interaction. Using the WWOX WW domains as a probe, we screened high-density protein arrays and identified five candidate-binding partners. The binding to one of these candidates, small membrane protein of the lysosome/late endosome (SIMPLE), was further analysed, and we observed that a specific PPSY motif in the SIMPLE amino-acid sequence was required to interact with the amino-terminal WW domain of WWOX. In addition, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that endogenous WWOX and SIMPLE co-localize to perinuclear compartments of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrate that WWOX contains a Group I WW domain that binds known cellular proteins containing the specific ligand PPXY. Identification and characterization of WWOX interacting proteins will lead to an understanding of the biological functions of WWOX in normal and tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038556753,"Secreted signaling proteins of the Wnt family are known to regulate a diverse range of developmental processes, and their signaling pathway through β-catenin is frequently activated in cancer. The identification of both Frizzled and LRP5/6 (LRP: low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) proteins as components of cell-surface receptors for Wnt proteins has raised questions about their individual functions. We have investigated this issue through a structure–function analysis of Frizzled and LRP proteins that have been implicated in Wnt1 signaling. Consistent with other reports, we find that LRP6/Arrow proteins deleted for their extracellular domain are able to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Importantly, our results demonstrate that this signaling from LRP6/Arrow derivatives can occur in a Frizzled- and ligand-independent manner. Furthermore, we show that the PPSP motifs within the intracellular domain of LRP6 are required for signaling. In contrast to results with LRP6, overexpression of Frizzled proteins did not activate the pathway. Based on evidence of ligand binding to both Frizzled and LRP6, current models suggest that both proteins are components of a Wnt receptor complex that signals to β-catenin. In light of these models, our data imply that LRP5/6/Arrow proteins constitute the distal signal-initiating component of these receptors. The results also support the notion that LRP5/6 are candidate oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2075347516,"Gene fission and fusion, the processes by which a single gene is split into two separate genes and two adjacent genes are fused into a single gene, respectively, are among the primary processes that generate new genes. Despite their seeming reversibility, nothing is known about the mechanism of gene fission. Because the nucleotide sequences of fission genes record little about their origination process, conventional analysis of duplicate genes may not be powerful enough to unravel the underlying mechanism. In a survey for young genes in species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified a young gene family, monkey king, whose genesis sheds light on the evolutionary process of gene fission. Its members originated 1-2 million years ago as retroposed duplicates and evolved into fission genes that separately encode protein domains from a multidomain ancestor. The mechanism underlying this process is gene duplication with subsequent partial degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1981376684,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been linked to fundamental processes such as control of cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and tumor progression. The expression of MIF has been reported in several tumors. However, the precise role of MIF in tumor cells remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression pattern and the function of MIF in neuroblastoma. Our results showed that intracellular MIF was upregulated in neuroblastoma tumor tissues and cell lines. MIF protein expression significantly correlated with the grade of tumor differentiation. In addition, we found that MIF induced a significant dose-dependent increase of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8 secretion. We also observed that an increased MIF expression level correlated with N-Myc protein (the N-myc oncogene product) expression in neuroblastoma tissues. MIF increased the expression of N-myc mRNA and N-Myc protein and induced N-Myc translocation from the cytoplasm to nucleus in neuroblastoma cell lines. MIF-induced N-Myc expression was found to be dependent on ERK signaling pathways. The inhibition of ERK activation reduced MIF-mediated N-Myc expression. These results suggest that MIF may contribute to the progression of neuroblastoma by (a) inducing N-Myc expression and (b) upregulating the expression of angiogenic factors."

https://openalex.org/W2036230182,"We previously reported that the PPARgamma agonist troglitazone (TRO) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. To understand the mechanisms of antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of TRO, we screened a limited DNA array containing 23 genes involved in regulating either the cell cycle and/or apoptosis. Four of the 23 genes screened exhibited regulation by TRO, with growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) being the most strongly upregulated. TRO induced GADD45 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Depletion of GADD45 by siRNA abrogated TRO-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells demonstrating the physiological relevance of GADD45 upregulation. Signaling pathways mediating TRO-induced GADD45 were also investigated. Several mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were involved in the induction of GADD45 by TRO. Inhibition of the c-jun N-terminal kinase MAPK pathway by SP600125 partially abolished TRO-induced GADD45 mRNA, and protein expression and apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580, or through overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK, augmented GADD45 mRNA induction and GADD45 promoter activation as well as cell apoptosis by TRO. Blockade of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK pathway by PD98059 also enhanced TRO's effects on GADD45 and apoptosis. Two other PPARgamma agonists pioglitazone and rosiglitazone did not induce GADD45 expression. Our finding of GADD45 induction by TRO may provide a new insight concerning the mechanisms for TRO's antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1991920961,"To understand the relationship between oncogenic signaling and the reprogramming of gene expression, we performed transcriptional profiling in rat ovarian surface epithelial cells (ROSE), in which neoplastic transformation is driven by a mutated KRAS oncogene. We identified >200 genes whose expression was elevated or reduced following permanent KRAS expression. Deregulated KRAS-responsive genes encode transcriptional regulators, signaling effectors, proteases, extracellular matrix and adhesion proteins, transformation-suppressing proteins and negative growth regulators. Many of them have not been previously identified in cells expressing oncogenic RAS genes or in other well-studied models of oncogenic signaling. The number of critical genes related to the execution of anchorage-independent proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition was narrowed down to 79 by selectively inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Blocking MAPK/ERK-signaling caused reversion to the normal epithelial phenotype in conjunction with the reversal of deregulated target transcription to pretransformation levels. In addition, silencing of the overexpressed transcriptional regulator Fra-1 by RNA interference resulted in growth reduction, suggesting that this factor partially contributes to, but is not sufficient for the proliferative capacity of KRAS-transformed epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028785832,"The human MSH2/6 complex is essential for mismatch recognition during the repair of replication errors. Although mismatch repair components have been implicated in DNA homologous recombination repair, the exact function of hMSH2/6 in this pathway is unclear. Here, we show that the recombinant hMSH2/6 protein complex stimulated the ability of the Bloom's syndrome gene product, BLM, to process Holliday junctions in vitro, an activity that could also be regulated by p53. Consistent with these observations, hMSH6 colocalized with BLM and phospho-ser15-p53 in hydroxyurea-induced RAD51 nuclear foci that may correspond to the sites of presumed stalled DNA replication forks and more likely the resultant DNA double-stranded breaks. In addition, we show that hMSH2 and hMSH6 coimmunoprecipitated with BLM, p53, and RAD51. Both the number of RAD51 foci and the amount of the BLM-p53-RAD51 complex are increased in hMSH2- or hMSH6-deficient cells. These data suggest that hMSH2/6 formed a complex with BLM-p53-RAD51 in response to the damaged DNA forks during double-stranded break repair."
https://openalex.org/W1996971225,"Many mouse models of breast cancer form large primary tumors that rarely metastasize. Models with aggressive metastasis express oncoproteins that simultaneously affect growth and apoptosis pathways. To define the role of apoptotic resistance and to model a challenge faced by tumor cells during metastatic dissemination, we focused on apoptosis induced by cell shape change. Inhibiting actin polymerization with Latrunculin-A causes cell rounding and death within hours in nontumorigenic human 10A-Ras mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast tumor cells resist LA-induced death, and survive for days despite cell rounding. Infecting 10A-Ras cells with a MDA-MB-231 retroviral expression library, and selecting with Latrunculin-A repeatedly identified Bcl-xL as a suppressor of cytoskeleton-dependent death. Although Bcl-xL enhances the spread of metastatic breast tumor cell lines, the distinct effects of apoptotic resistance on tumor growth in the mammary gland and during metastasis have not been compared directly. We find that Bcl-xL overexpression in mouse mammary epithelial cells does not induce primary tumor formation or enhance MEK-induced tumorigenesis within the mammary gland environment. However, it strongly enhances metastatic potential. These results with Bcl-xL provide novel evidence that isolated apoptotic resistance can increase metastatic potential, but remain overlooked by assays based on breast tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W2055865889,"The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway mediates cell death through the release of various pro-apoptotic factors including cytochrome c and Smac, the second mitochondrial activator of caspases, into the cytosol. Smac was shown previously to inhibit IAP proteins and to facilitate initiation of the caspase cascade upon cytochrome c release. To investigate Smac function during apoptosis and to explore Smac as an experimental cancer therapeutic, we constructed an expression system based on a single adenoviral vector containing Smac under control of the Tet-off system supplied in cis. Conditional expression of Smac induced apoptosis in human HCT116 and DU145 carcinoma cells regardless of the loss of Bax or overexpression of Bcl-xL. Nevertheless, apoptosis induced by Smac was associated with cytochrome c release and breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This indicates that Smac acts independently of Bax and Bcl-xL during initiation of apoptosis and triggers a positive feedback loop that results in Bax/Bcl-xL-independent activation of mitochondria. In caspase-proficient cells, Smac-induced apoptosis could be inhibited partially by cell-permeable LEHD (caspase-9 inhibitor) and DEVD (caspase-3 inhibitor) peptides. Furthermore, loss of caspase-3 expression in MCF-7 cells carrying a caspase-3 null mutation completely abrogated the sensitivity for Smac-induced apoptotic or nonapoptotic, necrosis-like cell death, while re-expression of caspase-3 conferred sensitivity. Altogether, caspase-3 but not caspase-9 activation was necessary for execution of Smac-induced cell death. Notably, Smac did not induce caspase-9 processing in the absence of caspase-3. Thus, caspase-9 processing occurs secondary to caspase-3 activation during Smac-induced apoptosis. Altogether, Smac is capable of circumventing defects in mitochondrial apoptosis signaling such as loss of Bax or overexpression of Bcl-xL that are frequently observed in tumor cells resistant to anticancer therapy. Consequently, Smac appears to be a promising therapeutic target in anticancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2153871419,"We previously reported that cdk2 phosphorylates two serine residues near the DNA-binding domain of the YA subunit of NF-Y transcription factor and this phosphorylation is essential for DNA binding of NF-Y. In this study, we examined the effects of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of YA, YA-aa, in which the two serine residues are replaced with alanine, on the cell cycle and expression of the NF-Y target genes. Transient transfection assays show that YA-aa inhibits transcription from the NF-Y target promoters, such as cdc2, cyclin A, and cdc25C. Moreover, this inhibitory function of YA-aa can be suppressed by the expression of wild-type YA, implying that YA-aa inhibits transcription of those NF-Y target genes by inactivating wild-type YA. Since NF-Y target genes include the cell cycle-regulatory genes that ensure orderly progression of the cell cycle, we examined the effects of YA-aa in cell cycle progression. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus encoding YA-aa and found that YA-aa expression leads to repression of cell cycle-regulatory genes, such as cyclin A, RNR R2, DNA polymerase α, cdc2, cyclin B, and cdc25C. Consistently, YA-aa expression results in the inactivation of both cdc2 and cdk2. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis reveals that YA-aa induces cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2/M. These results suggest that cdk2-dependent phosphorylation of NF-Y is essential for the expression of the cell cycle-regulatory genes and therefore for cell cycle progression at both G1/S and G2/M."

https://openalex.org/W2009628988,"Many interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes are also induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a component closely associated with the IFN system in the context of virus–host interactions. Recently, we demonstrated that the IFN-induced 3′ → 5′ exonuclease ISG20 possesses antiviral activities against RNA viruses. Here we show that ISG20 induction by synthetic dsRNA (pIpC) is stronger and faster than its induction by IFN. Two families of transcription factors are implicated in the transcriptional activation of ISG20 by dsRNA. Initially, the NF-κB factors p50 and p65 bind and activate the κB element of the Isg20 promoter. This is followed by IRF1 binding to the ISRE. As pIpC often induces protein movements in the cells, we questioned whether it could influence ISG20 localization. Interestingly and contrary to IFN, dsRNA induces a nuclear matrix enrichment of the ISG20 protein. dsRNA induction of ISG20 via NF-κB and its antiviral activity led us to suggest that ISG20 could participate in the cellular response to virus infection."

https://openalex.org/W1997321939,"Using a proteomic approach to screen for new growth factors released by melanoma cells, we identified follistatin as a major heparin-binding factor in medium conditioned by the Bowes melanoma cell line. Since follistatin is primarily studied in relation to its neutralization of activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β family of ligands, the expression and function of this receptor system was investigated in a panel of melanoma cell lines and melanocytes. All cell lines expressed activin receptors and showed phosphorylation of Smad signal transduction molecules upon treatment with activin. Secretion of follistatin, either native or after retroviral transduction, efficiently prevented Smad activation or activation of an activin-responsive luciferase reporter construct. In melanocytes, activin treatment led to growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. These effects were counteracted by cotreatment with follistatin. In summary, we characterized the activin–activin receptor system in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines and found that secretion of follistatin by melanoma cells may represent an effective way to circumvent activin's negative regulatory effects."

We have found a novel C/EBP-ɛ-dependent promyelocyte-specific gene, mXCP1. mXCP1 belongs to a family of XCP/FIZZ/Resistin genes, which includes four murine genes and two human genes, hXCP1 and hXCP2. These genes have four exons and encode short secreted proteins sharing a ten-cysteine motif. Murine mXCP1, mXCP2 and mXCP3 genes map to murine chromosome 16 and mXCP4 is positioned on chromosome 8; the hXCP1 and hXCP2 genes are located at homologous regions of chromosomes 3 and 19. Introduction of an inducible C/EBP-ɛ gene into the NIH3T3 and myeloid cells from C/EBP-ɛ-null mice line revealed that the conditional expression of C/EBP-ɛ induced mXCP1. The HXCP1 gene was identified as a C/EBP-ɛ-dependent regulatory homologue of mXCP1. The expression data for other members of XCP/FIZZ gene family are presented. Further studies indicate that XCP1 is a secreted protein that is chemotactic to myeloid cells from C/EBP-ɛ-null mice and is able to interact directly with α-defensin."
https://openalex.org/W2060333115,"The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor has been proposed to function as a key mediator of cell cycle checkpoints induced by chemotherapeutic agents. However, these prior studies have relied on embryonic fibroblasts harboring chronic loss of RB, a condition under which compensation of RB functions is known to occur. Here we utilized primary adult fibroblasts derived from mice harboring loxP sites flanking exon 3 of the Rb gene to delineate the action of RB in the chemotherapeutic response. In this system we find that targeted disruption of Rb leads to little overt change in cell cycle distribution. However, these cells exhibited deregulation of RB/E2F target genes and became aneuploid following culture in the absence of RB. When challenged with both DNA damaging and antimetabolite chemotherapeutics, RB was required for primary adult cells to undergo DNA damage checkpoint responses and loss of RB resulted in enhanced aneuploidy following challenge. In contrast, following spontaneous immortalization and the loss of functional p53 signaling, the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) failed to induce arrest despite the presence of RB. In these immortal cultures RB/E2F targets were deregulated in a complex, gene-specific manner and RB was required for the checkpoint response to camptothecin (CPT). Mechanistic analyses of the checkpoint responses in primary cells indicated that loss of RB leads to increased p53 signaling and decreased viability following both CPT and 5-FU treatment. However, the mechanism through which these agents act to facilitate cell cycle inhibition through RB were distinct. These studies underscore the critical role of RB in DNA-damage checkpoint signaling and demonstrate that RB mediates chemotherapeutic-induced cell cycle inhibition in adult fibroblasts by distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2037306197,"β-Catenin, a member of the Wnt signaling pathway, is downregulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-dependent phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues in the N-terminus of the protein, followed by ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. In human and rodent cancers, mutations that substitute one of the critical Ser/Thr residues in the GSK-3β region of β-catenin stabilize the protein and activate β-catenin/TCF/LEF target genes. This study examined three oncogenic β-catenin mutants from rat colon tumors containing substitutions adjacent to amino-acid residue Ser33, a key target for phosphorylation by GSK-3β. Compared with wild-type β-catenin (WT), the β-catenin mutants D32G, D32N, and D32Y strongly activated TCF-4-dependent transcription in HEK293 cells, and there was accumulation of β-catenin in the cell lysates. Immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies indicated that there was little if any effect on the phosphorylation of Ser37, Thr41 or Ser45; however, the phosphorylation of Ser33 appeared to be affected in the β-catenin mutants. Specifically, antiphospho-β-catenin 33/37/41 antibody identified high, intermediate and low expression levels of phosphorylated β-catenin in cells transfected with D32G, D32N and D32Y, respectively. Experiments with the proteosome inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) revealed ubiquitinated bands on all three mutant β-catenins, as well as on WT β-catenin. The relative order of ubiquitination was WT>D32G>D32N>D32Y, in parallel with findings from the phosphorylation studies. These results are discussed in the context of previous studies, which indicated that amino-acid residue D32 lies within the ubiquitination recognition motif of β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2113748824,"The C-terminus of p53 is responsible for maintaining the latent, non-DNA-binding form of p53. However, the mechanism by which the C-terminus regulates DNA binding is not yet fully understood. We show here that p53 interacts with RNA via its C-terminal domain and that disruption of this interaction, by RNase A treatment, truncation or phosphorylation of the C-terminus, restores DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, the oligomerization of p53 is significantly enhanced by disrupting the interaction between p53 and RNA. These findings suggest that binding of RNA to p53 is involved in the mechanism of p53 latency."
https://openalex.org/W2084452934,"The p53 tumor suppressor is phosphorylated in response to various cellular stress signals, such as DNA damage, leading to its release from MDM2 and consequent stabilization and activation as a transcription factor. In human U2OS cells, treatment with adriamycin causes p53 to be phosphorylated on all six serine residues tested, leading to the dissociation of p53 from MDM2 and transcription of the p21 and mdm2 genes. In contrast, in these cells, IPTG-dependent induction of p14ARF, which sequesters MDM2 away from p53, does not lead to detectable phosphorylation of any of the five N-terminal serine residues tested (6, 9, 15, 20, 37). Only C-terminal serine 392 is phosphorylated. However, the increase of p21 and mdm2 mRNAs was indistinguishable following treatment with adriamycin or induction of p14ARF. By using cDNA arrays to examine global p53-dependent gene expression in response to adriamycin or p14ARF, we found that most genes were regulated similarly by the two treatments. However, a subset of p53-regulated genes whose products have proliferative roles or regulate VEGF activity, newly described here, are repressed by p14ARF much more than by adriamycin. We conclude that the phosphorylation of p53 on N-terminal serine residues is not required for increased transcription of the great majority of p53-responsive genes and that the induction of p53 by p14ARF, with little phosphorylation, leads to substantial repression of genes whose products have roles in proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2003140679,"Sex steroid hormones play an essential role in the control of homeostasis in the mammary gland. Although the involvement of progesterone in cellular proliferation and differentiation is well established, its exact role in the control of cell death still remains unclear. As dysregulation of the apoptotic process plays an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis by progesterone in various breast cancer cell lines. Our results show that progesterone treatment protects against radiation-induced apoptosis. This prevention appears to be mediated by the progesterone receptor and is unrelated to p53 status. There is also no correlation with the intrinsic hormonal effect on cell proliferation, as the presence of cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle. Surprisingly, progesterone partly allows bypassing of the irradiation-induced growth arrest in G2/M in PgR+ cells, leading to an increase in cell proliferation after irradiation. One consequence of this effect is a higher rate of chromosome damage in these proliferating progesterone-treated cells compared to what is observed in untreated irradiated cells. We propose that progesterone, by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting the proliferation of cells with DNA damage, potentially facilitates the emergence of genetic mutations that may play a role in malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2058890884,"The hematopoietic transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 is an oncoprotein participating to the malignant transformation of proerythroblasts in the Friend erythroleukemia or in the erythroleukemic process developed in spi-1 transgenic mice. Overexpression of Spi-1 in proerythroblasts blocks their differentiation. We have shown that Spi-1 promotes the use of the proximal 5'-splice site during the E1A pre-mRNA splicing and interferes with the effect of TLS (Translocated in LipoSarcoma) in this splicing assay. TLS was identified from chromosomal translocations in human liposarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we determine the function of Spi-1 domains in splicing and in the interference with TLS. In transient transfection assays in erythroid cells, we show that the DNA binding domain cooperates with the transactivation domain or the PEST region of Spi-1 to modify the function of TLS in splicing. Interestingly, the 27 C-terminal amino acids, which determine the DNA binding activity of Spi-1, are necessary for the splicing function of Spi-1 as well as for its ability to interfere with TLS. Finally, we demonstrate that in leukemic proerythroblasts overexpressing Spi-1, TLS has lost its splicing effect. Thus, we hypothesize that oncogenic pathways in proerythroblasts may involve the ability of Spi-1 to alter splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2023449709,"Telomerase activity in tumours is often associated with p53 mutation. Many antitelomerase therapies take advantage of the inability of cells expressing mutant p53 to undergo replicative senescence, since this allows telomere erosion to continue until 'crisis', hence providing the desired cytotoxic effect. However, some tumour types, including breast, melanomas and thyroid, retain wild-type p53 function and the effectiveness of antitelomerase therapies in such tumour cells have not been adequately addressed. To explore this, we made use of two thyroid cancer cell lines K1 and K2, which retain wt p53. Telomere erosion induced by the expression of a dominant-negative (DN) hTERT resulted in delayed onset of growth arrest in K1 and K2 cells, reminiscent of replicative senescence, with low levels of BrdU labelling and apoptosis, associated with high p21(WAF1) and senescence-associated beta galactosidase expression. In contrast, abrogation of p53 function by the expression of HPV16 E6 in K1 and K2 cells either at the same time as DNhTERT or just prior to the onset of senescence allowed cells to continue growing until 'crisis'. Likewise, microinjection of a p53 neutralizing antibody into 'senescent' K1 DNhTERT cells permitted re-entry into the cell cycle. We conclude that thyroid tumour cells with wild-type p53 retain an intact p53-mediated growth arrest response to telomere erosion. This raises the intriguing question of why, therefore, p53 mutation is not selected for in such cancers, and also calls into question the therapeutic value of telomerase inhibitors in such cases."

https://openalex.org/W2059516018,"Cellular transformation occurs only in cells that express both ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors, but not in cells expressing only one or the other of these receptors. However, when both receptors are coexpressed and ligand-stimulated, they interact with virtually the same adaptor/effector proteins as when expressed singly. To reveal the underlying regulatory mechanism of the kinase/phosphatase network in ErbB homo- and heterodimer receptor signaling, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt activities were evaluated in the presence of several enzyme inhibitors in ligand-induced cells expressing ErbB1 (E1), ErbB4 (E4), and ErbB1/ErbB4 (E1/4) receptor. The PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid showed receptor-specific inhibitory profiles for ERK and Akt activities. Moreover, B-Raf isolated only from E1/4 cells could induce in vitro phosphorylation for MEK; this B-Raf kinase activity was abolished by pretreatment of the cells with okadaic acid. Our study further showed that the E1/4 cell-specific B-Raf activity was stimulated by PLCγ and subsequent Rap1 activation. The present study suggests that B-Raf kinase, which was specifically activated in the cells coexpressing ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors, elevates total ERK activity within the cell and, therefore, can induce cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2086478220,"The myb family of genes encodes highly homologous nuclear transcription factors that play distinct roles in the development of breast, germ cells and hematoid organs. While the mechanisms associated with the regulation of these genes remain unknown, the transactivation of c-Myb was previously shown to be upregulated by transcriptional cooperation with Ets-2. The present study examines the transactivation potential of the myb gene family in cooperation with Ets-2. A-Myb and c-Myb showed similar transcriptional cooperation with Ets-2, but not with Ets-1. Interestingly, B-Myb showed no cooperative activity with Ets-2 or Ets-1. Additionally, deletion mutants of A-Myb or c-Myb, where the C-terminal negative regulatory domain was deleted, did not abrogate their ability to cooperate with Ets-2. However, the deletion mutant of B-Myb, where the C-terminal positive regulatory domain was deleted, restored its ability to cooperate with Ets-2. Furthermore, studies using a series of ‘domain-swapped’ mutants between c-Myb and B-Myb revealed that the C-terminus of B-Myb, which is responsible for the protein's transactivation potential, blocks transcriptional cooperation with Ets-2. These results suggest that the myb gene family can be differentially modulated by Ets-2, and that the C-terminus is the domain that regulates this activity."
