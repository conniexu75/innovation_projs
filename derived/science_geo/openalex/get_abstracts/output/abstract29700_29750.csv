https://openalex.org/W1563119717,"The extreme carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the gamma chain of fibrinogen is involved in the binding of this adhesive protein to the platelet integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, and synthetic peptides corresponding to this region inhibit fibrinogen as well as fibronectin and von Willebrand factor binding to platelets. A chemical cross-linking approach was used to characterize the interaction of a 16-amino acid fibrinogen gamma chain peptide with platelets and to localize the site of its binding to GPIIb-IIIa. This peptide became specifically cross-linked to GPIIb, and platelet stimulation selectively enhanced its cross-linking to this alpha subunit. The cross-linking reaction was specifically inhibited by fibrinogen and an Arg-Gly-Asp peptide but not by an unrelated protein or a substituted peptide. Utilizing a combination of immunochemical mapping, enzymatic and chemical digestions, and amino acid sequencing, the cross-linking site of the gamma chain peptide in GPIIb was localized to a stretch of 21 amino acids. The identified region, GPIIb 294-314, contains the second putative calcium binding domain within GPIIb. The primary structure of this region is highly conserved among alpha subunits of other integrin adhesion receptors. These results identify a discrete region of GPIIb that resides in close proximity to a ligand binding site within GPIIb-IIIa. The homologous region may be involved in the functions of other integrin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1491755566,Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was found in isolated human mononuclear leukocytes and their purified components in millimolar concentration. Intracellular ascorbic acid was depleted greater than 96% during cell culture and was rapidly reaccumulated after addition of physiologic concentrations of ascorbic acid to the extracellular medium. Purified cells maintained concentration gradients of ascorbic acid as large as 100-fold across the plasma membrane. The ability to vary intracellular ascorbic acid concentrations over such a wide range makes it possible for the first time in these cells to study ascorbic acid function in direct relationship to intracellular concentration.
https://openalex.org/W1604032667,"Interaction of interleukin 2 (IL2) with its high affinity membrane receptor complex (IL2R) is sufficient to induce proliferation of T lymphocytes. However, the biochemical mechanisms by which IL2 induces this process remain unresolved. The IL2R complex consists of at least two distinct polypeptides that bind IL2, a 75-kDa intermediate affinity subunit (IL2R beta) and a 55-kDa low affinity subunit (IL2R alpha). As indicated by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies and confirmed by phosphoamino acid analysis, we now demonstrate that interaction of the T cell growth factor interleukin 2 (IL2) with its high affinity receptor on IL2-sensitive human peripheral blood lymphoblasts induces tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 92, 80, 78, 70-75, and 57 kDa. IL2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation in YT 2C2 cells which express only the 75-kDa intermediate affinity IL2 binding molecule (IL2R beta) but not in cells which either express only the 55-kDa low affinity IL2 receptor molecule (IL2R alpha) or no IL2-binding sites. Therefore, IL2R beta, in the absence of IL2R alpha, appears sufficient to transduce the transmembrane signal leading to tyrosine phosphorylation. Two different antibodies reactive with phosphotyrosine specifically immunoprecipitated IL2R beta cross-linked to radiolabeled IL2. These findings suggest that IL2R beta is a substrate for the tyrosine kinase which is activated by IL2 binding to its receptor. Thus, like several other growth factor receptors, activation of the IL2R results in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation with the receptor itself serving as one substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1525487916,"The administration of a hepatotoxic dose of acetaminophen (250 mg/kg) to mice induced the loss of protein thiols in mouse liver. Our data suggest that a significant portion of this loss was due to protein thiol oxidation. The administration of the nonhepatotoxic regioisomer, 3'-hydroxyacetanilide (600 mg/kg) did not produce a similar decrease in liver protein thiols despite producing similar levels of covalent binding. Mice treated with acetaminophen exhibited decreased glutathione peroxidase activity, decreased thioltransferase activity, and decreased adenine nucleotide concentrations in the liver. The increase in urinary allantoin after the administration of acetaminophen suggests that the decrease in adenine nucleotides was due to their degradation in the liver. Acetaminophen also promoted the conversion of the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase to the oxidase form, and pretreatment of mice with allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, significantly decreased acetaminophen-mediated hepatotoxicity. The conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to the oxidase form may lead to a transient increase in the production of activated oxygen species. The increase in activated oxygen species coupled with decreases in glutathione peroxidase and thioltransferase activity may be responsible in part for the increased levels of oxidized protein thiols observed following acetaminophen administration."
https://openalex.org/W1556087419,"Equilibrium binding studies of prothrombinase complex formation were undertaken using phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS), factor Va, and factor Xa modified with dansyl glutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (DEGR.Xa). The interaction between the Va.PCPS and DEGR.Xa.PCPS binary complexes was experimentally isolated using saturating concentrations of PCPS. Fluorescence titrations indicated that the membrane-bound proteins interact tightly (Kd approximately 10(-9) M) with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of Va bound/mol of DEGR.Xa at saturation. Complex formation was also investigated by kinetic studies of prothrombin activation using unmodified factor Xa. The kinetic studies yielded a Kd approximately 10(-9) M, which was independent of the concentration of prothrombin in the range of 0.5-5.0 microM. Fluorescence studies of complex assembly at limiting PCPS concentrations provided evidence for an altered DEGR.Xa-PCPS interaction when the enzyme was assembled into the complex. The data suggest that although both proteins are associated with PCPS when complexed with each other, the presence of factor Va on the membrane surface increases the affinity for the Xa-PCPS interaction by an estimated 100-fold. Prothrombinase complex assembly therefore proceeds independently of the availability of substrate and is stabilized by protein-protein and protein-phospholipid interactions. Linkage between the two protein-membrane combination events leads to the further stabilization of the complex on the vesicle surface."
https://openalex.org/W1650752673,"Stathmin is a 19-kDa phosphoprotein presumably involved in regulations of cell proliferation, differentiation, and functions as an intracellular relay for extracellular signals activating diverse second messenger pathways. Antisera prepared against the whole protein or against two peptides (residues 15-27 and 134-149) recognized the two isoforms (alpha and beta) of stathmin in their different phosphorylated states on immunoblots. Also, the possible existence of a family of stathmin-related proteins is suggested by the detection with some sera of proteins of 17, 21, and 60 kDa in brain. Stathmin and its diverse molecular forms were detected in all mouse tissues tested, in varying concentrations. Depending on the tissue, it is 2-100 times more abundant in the neonate than in the adult. It is most abundant in brain at both stages, the protein levels being paralleled by the expression of the corresponding mRNA as detected with a specific cDNA probe. Antibodies directed against the rat protein also reacted with stathmin-like proteins in the brain of other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish species, and the various isoforms could be recognized on immunoblots. In conclusion, our results suggest that stathmin is most likely involved in two distinct types of regulations: 1) developmental regulations, related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, and 2) functional regulations mostly at the adult stage, and typically in the nervous system. In addition, stathmin is also phylogenetically well conserved at least in vertebrates. Together, these observations support the proposed ubiquitous nature and general importance of stathmin in biological regulations."
https://openalex.org/W1492116544,"Ribosomal protein L32 mRNA moved from messenger ribonucleoprotein particles into polysomes following serum activation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. This redistribution of the mRNA into a translationally active state began by 1 h and was complete by 3 h after activation. In contrast, actin mRNA showed no translational control, being found predominantly in polysomes in both quiescent and activated cultures. The phosphorylation state of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, which binds mRNA caps, was examined in parallel. eIF-4E phosphorylation was elevated by 1 h following serum activation and reached a peak by 3-5 h. Treatment of resting cells with phorbol ester also simultaneously stimulated eIF-4E phosphorylation and the movement of L32 mRNA into polysomes. These results are consistent with a model in which mitogen-induced phosphorylation increases the pool of active eIF-4E molecules, which in turn cause the recruitment of translationally controlled mRNAs to actively synthesizing ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1501812048,"We have recently reported that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) becomes bound to the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) at or near the end of receptor translation in vitro (Dalman, F. C., Bresnick, E. H., Patel, P. D., Perdew, G. H., Watson, S. J., Jr., and Pratt, W. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19815-19821). In this paper we compare the hsp90 binding and DNA binding activities of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) to those of the GR after cell-free translation of the two receptors in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In contrast to the newly translated GR, which is bound to hsp90 and must be transformed to the DNA binding state, the TR is not bound to hsp90 and is translated in its DNA binding form without any requirement for transformation. When the GR is translated in wheat germ extract, which does not contain hsp90, it is translated in its DNA binding form in the same manner as the TR synthesized in reticulocyte lysate. These observations provide direct evidence that binding of GR to hsp90 is associated with repression of its DNA binding function. The fact that the TR does not bind to hsp90 and is translated in its DNA binding form is consistent with the different behavior of this receptor with respect to classic steroid receptors in the intact cell. We propose that binding to hsp90 may account for the fact that most of the steroid receptors are recovered in the cytosolic fraction after lysis of hormone-free cells in low salt buffer whereas the hormone-free TR is recovered in tight association with the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1637777503,"Incubation of human erythrocytes oxidized by iron catalysts, ADP/Fe3+ or xanthine/xanthine oxidase/Fe3+, with autologous IgG resulted in IgG binding as detected by enzyme immunoassay using protein A-beta-galactosidase conjugate. The binding of autologous IgG to ADP/Fe3(+)-treated erythrocytes maximized when the cells were treated with 1.8:0.1 mM ADP/Fe3+, and declined when treated above this concentration, suggesting that autologous IgG binds to moderately but not to excessively oxidized erythrocytes. The antibody involved in the binding was anti-Band 3, the autoantibody known to bind to aged erythrocytes, because isolated anti-Band 3 bound to the oxidized cells, but anti-Band 3-depleted autologous IgG did not. In addition, purified Band 3 inhibited the autologous IgG binding. Anti-alpha-galactosyl IgG, another natural antibody which has been reported to bind to aged erythrocytes, did not bind to the oxidized cells. Oxidation of membrane lipids, SH-groups of membrane proteins, and Hb of these cells was slight, but the cells contained an increased amount of membrane-bound native Hb, indicating that the oxidized cell membrane has an altered property. alpha-Tocopherol prevented the lipid oxidation and the subsequent IgG binding. Reduction of the oxidized erythrocytes with dithiothreitol resulted in a loss of the IgG binding. These results suggest that anti-Band 3 binding sites (Band 3 senescent antigen) are formed on moderately oxidized erythrocytes as a result of oxidation of membrane protein SH-groups which can be mediated by the membrane lipid oxidation and that formation of the anti-Band 3 binding sites on the oxidized cells is an essentially reversible membrane event which is linked to oxidation and restoration of the protein SH-groups."
https://openalex.org/W1541850468,"The kinetics of the deuteronation of one of the copper ligand histidines of the reduced Type I blue-copper protein amicyanin from Thiobacillus versutus was studied as a function of temperature by 300- and 600- MHz 1H NMR. The NMR data were analyzed with the help of a three site exchange model. Deuteron exchange between the histidine ligand and the solution appears to be catalyzed by phosphate. After deuteronation the histidine can occur in two conformations. The electron self-exchange rate of amicyanin was determined as a function of temperature and ionic strength. At 298 K, pD = 8.6, I = 0.05 M, the ese rate amounts to 1.3 x 10(5) M-1 S-1. The activation parameters amount to delta H not equal to = (52 +/- 3) kJ/mol and delta S not equal to = (26 +/- 9) J/mol.K. The dependence of the ese rate on ionic strength is small. The deuteronated amicyanin appears to be redox-inactive. The experimental findings clearly distinguish amicyanin from other classes of blue-copper proteins like the azurins and the pseudo-azurins."
https://openalex.org/W1484114593,"The monoclonal antibody A2B5 recognizes antigens at the surface of neuronal and glial cells but also at the surface of thymus epithelia and pancreatic islet cells. Although these antigens have been characterized as polysialogangliosides, A2B5 also reacts with other unidentified gangliosides. In order to characterize further the epitope of A2B5, two new ganglioside antigens isolated from chicken brain are identified in this study. One is the ganglioside NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuAc alpha 2-8NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1ceramide (GT3) and the other is a 9-O-acetylated derivative of GT3). This derivative was purified from 10-day embryonic chicken brain. Acetyl groups substituted on sialic acid were removed either by alkali treatment or by incubation with influenza virus C, which contains receptor-destroying enzyme (a neuraminidate 9-O-acetyl esterase). The product of alkali treatment or viral action was detected by the antibody 18B8 which is specific for GT3. The deacetylated product still reacts with A2B5. These data and the results of mild oxidation of the antigen with sodium periodate suggest that the epitope recognized by antibody A2B5 contains the trisialyl structure found in GT3 but does not include the polyalcohol chain of the terminal sialic acid which can be oxidized by periodate or acetylated without modifying the affinity for the antibody. The epitope recognized by A2B5 is different from the epitope recognized by the antibody 18B8 in that 18B8 requires the three sialic acids with an intact and unsubstituted polyalcohol chain. Antibody 18B8 does not bind to 9-O-acetylated GT3 or GT3 oxidized by sodium periodate."
https://openalex.org/W1593007620,"We have investigated the influence of the N-terminal domain of the 94-kDa glucocorticoid receptor on the DNA:receptor interaction. An alpha-chymotrypsin-induced 39-kDa receptor fragment, containing the hormone and DNA binding domains, binds DNA with a reduced specificity compared to the intact 94-kDa receptor. Various footprinting assays did not reveal any qualitative differences when comparing the DNA contact points made by the two different receptor entities. Like the intact receptor, the 39-kDa receptor fragment binds as a dimer to DNA. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking demonstrated a difference in the protein:protein contacts of the two homodimers. Furthermore, the dimeric 94-kDa receptor did not recognize a half-DNA site, while the dissociated 94-kDa receptor dimer and the dimeric 39-kDa receptor fragment allowed binding to such a site. These results suggest that the loss of the N-terminal domain of the receptor affects the steric arrangement and/or rigidity of the two DNA binding domains of the receptor homodimer, resulting in a decreased DNA binding specificity of the 39-kDa receptor fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1571838620,"We investigated the roles of lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein E (apoE) secreted from human monocyte-derived macrophages in the uptake of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). ApoCII-deficient VLDL were isolated from a patient with apoCII deficiency. The lipolytic conversion to higher density and the degradation of the apoCII-deficient VLDL by macrophages were very slight, whereas the addition of apoCII enhanced both their conversion and degradation. This suggests that the lipolysis and subsequent conversion of VLDL to lipoproteins of higher density are essential for the VLDL uptake by macrophages. VLDL incubated with macrophages obtained from subjects with E3/3 phenotype (E3/3-macrophages) showed a 17-fold greater affinity in inhibiting the binding of 2 micrograms/ml 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) to fibroblasts than native VLDL, whereas the incubation of VLDL with macrophages obtained from a subject with E2/2 phenotype (E2/2-macrophages) did not cause any increase in their affinity. Furthermore, 3 micrograms/ml 125I-VLDL obtained from a subject with E3/3 phenotype were degraded by E3/3-macrophages to a greater extent than by E2/2-macrophages (2-fold), indicating that VLDL uptake is influenced by the phenotype of apoE secreted by macrophages. From these results, we conclude that both lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase and incorporation of apoE secreted from macrophages alter the affinity of VLDL for the LDL receptors on the cells, resulting in facilitation of their receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1510574485,"Many anaerobic bacteria fix CO2 via the Wood pathway of acetyl-CoA synthesis. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), also called acetyl-CoA synthase, accepts the methyl group from the methylated corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP), binds a carbonyl group from CO, CO2, or the carboxyl of pyruvate, and binds coenzyme A. Then CODH catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from these enzyme-bound groups. Here, we have characterized the methyl transfer steps involved in acetyl-CoA synthesis. We have studied the reactions leading to methylation of CODH by methyl iodide and shown an absolute requirement of the C/Fe-SP in this reaction. In addition, we have discovered and partly characterized two previously unknown exchange reactions catalyzed by CODH: between the methylated C/Fe-SP and methylated CODH and between methylated CODH and the methyl moiety of acetyl-CoA. We have performed these two exchange reactions, methylation of the C/Fe-SP, and methylation of CODH at controlled potentials. The rates of all these reactions except the exchange between methylated C/Fe-SP and methylated CODH are accelerated (from 1 to 2 orders of magnitude) when run at low potentials. Our results provide strong evidence for a nucleophilic redox-active metal center on CODH as the initial acceptor of the methyl group from the methylated C/Fe-SP. This metal center also is proposed to be involved in the cleavage of acetyl-CoA in the reverse reaction."
https://openalex.org/W59969523,"The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) enhanced sensitivity to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (DPP) in human ovarina carcinoma 2008 cells by a factor of 2.53 +/- 0.74 fold (S.D.). Sensitization was maximum 3 h after a 1-h exposure to TPA and had disappeared completely by 7 h after treatment. An equivalent degree of sensitization was produced in a 2008 variant selected for 10-fold resistance to DDP. TPA neither increased nor decreased cellular accumulation of DDP. Phorbol, a TPA analog which does not activate protein kinase C, did not cause sensitization. This synergistic interaction between TPA and DDP was completely inhibited by pretreatment with staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Cellular cAMP was not altered by TPA stimulation. Furthermore, cycloheximide, a potent protein synthesis inhibitor, did not block the TPA-induced enhancement of drug sensitivity. These results strongly suggest that DDP sensitivity can be modulated by protein kinase C and regulated by phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate in both intrinsically sensitive and DDP-resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581479973,"Kinetic studies on the interaction of protein kinase C with cations and substrates were performed and the effects of essential activators on the interaction of protein kinase C with its substrates were studied. The catalytic fragment of protein kinase C interacted with protein substrate, MgATP, and Mg2+. The dual divalent cation requirement was shown by kinetic analysis as well as by the ability of Mn2+ to substitute for Mg2+. Analysis of kinetic data based on equilibrium assumptions suggested a random order of interaction of the catalytic fragment with its substrate and Mg2+ cofactor. Activation of intact protein kinase C required Ca2+, phosphatidylserine (PS), and diacylglycerol (DAG) as essential activators. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of activators with substrates indicated that Ca2+ and PS acted to increase the activity of the enzyme without modulating the KM for MgATP; PS and Ca2+ significantly decreased the KM for histone. DAG, on the other hand, did not affect the KM for either MgATP or histone but dramatically enhanced the kcat of the enzyme. These studies allow kinetic distinction between the effects of PS and Ca2+ on the one hand and DAG on the other. The possible interference of the kinetic analysis by histone was also examined by studying the requirements for autophosphorylation of protein kinase C; autophosphorylation showed similar dependencies on PS and DAG. There were no effects of histone on the lipid dependence of protein kinase C autophosphorylation, phorbol dibutyrate binding, and inhibition of autophosphorylation by sphingosine. These studies are discussed in relation to a kinetic model of protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1667375729,"A series of structurally modified phospholipids have been used to delineate the structural features involved in the interaction between cobra venom (Naja naja naja) phospholipase A2 and its substrate. Special emphasis has been placed on sn-2 amide analogues of the phospholipids. These studies have led to a very potent, reversible phospholipase A2 inhibitor. A six-step synthesis of this compound, 1-palmitylthio-2-palmitoylamino-1,2-dideoxy-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylethanolamine (thioether amide-PE), was developed. Other analogues studied included 1-palmitylthio-2-palmitoylamino-1,2-dideox-sn- glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, 1-palmityl-2-palmitoylamino-2- deoxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoylamino-2-deoxy-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylcholine, 1-palmitylthio- 2([(tetradecyloxy)carbonyl]amino)-1,2-dideoxy-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylcholine, 1-palmitoyl- 2([(octadecylylamino)carbonyl]amino)-2-deoxy-sn-glycero-3- phosphorylcholine, and sphingomyelin. Inhibition studies used the well defined Triton X-100 mixed micelle system and the spectroscopic thio assay. The phospholipid analogues showed varying degrees of inhibition. The best inhibitor was the thioether amide-PE which had an IC50 of 0.45 microM. In contrast, sphingomyelin, a natural phospholipid that resembles the amide analogues, did not inhibit but rather activated phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis. This systematic study of phospholipase A2 inhibition led to the following conclusions about phospholipid-phospholipase A2 interactions: (i) sn-2 amide analogues bind tighter than natural phospholipids, presumably because the amide forms a hydrogen bond with the water molecule in the enzyme active site, stabilizing its binding. (ii) Inhibitor analogues containing the ethanolamine polar head group appear to be more potent inhibitors than those containing the choline group. This difference in potency may be due solely to the fact that the cobra venom phospholipase A2 is activated by choline-containing phospholipids. Thus, choline-containing non-hydrolyzable analogues both inhibit and activate this enzyme. Both of these effects must be taken into account when studying phosphatidylcholine inhibitors of the cobra venom enzyme. (iii) The potency of inhibition of these analogues is significantly enhanced by increasing the hydrophobicity of the sn-1 functional group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1608030440,"A new polysialoglycoprotein, designated PSGP(On), was isolated from the unfertilized eggs of the kokanee salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka adonis. 400-MHz 1H NMR analyses showed the O. nerka adonis PSGP contained alpha -2,8-linked oligo- and polysialic acid (polySia) chains that were made up of 4-O-Ac-, 7-O-Ac-, and 9-O-Ac esters of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) residues. The presence of a new sialic acid derivative, identified by 1H NMR as 9-O-acetyl-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (trivial name, 9-O-acetyldeaminated neuraminic acid; 9-O-Ac-KDN), was also shown to be present as a minor component. The O-acetylated KDN residues appear to cap the nonreducing termini of the O-acetylated poly(Neu5Gc) chains. The O-acetylated polySia chains were resistant to depolymerization by bacterial exosialidases and a bacteriophage-derived endo-N-acylneuraminidase that is specific for catalyzing the hydrolysis of alpha -2,8-linkages in polySia containing either N-acetylneuraminic acid or Neu5Gc residues. After de-O-acetylation by mild alkali, the polySia chains were sensitive to digestion by endo-N-acylneuraminidase, yet partially resistant to exosialidase. These data confirm the alpha -2,8-ketosidic linkage in these chains and the nonreducing terminal location of the KDN residues. These results extend further the range of structural diversity in polySia-containing glycoconjugates, and in the family of naturally occurring sialic acids. They also suggest that the O-acetylated Neu5Gc and 9-O-Ac-KDN residues may have an important role during oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548589053,"Previous studies have indicated the existence of separate binding sites of ubiquitin-protein ligase, E3, specific for basic (Type I) or bulky hydrophobic (Type II) NH2-terminal amino acid residues of proteins. Another class (Type III) of protein substrates appeared to interact with E3 at regions other than the NH2 terminus (Reiss, Y., Kaim, D., and Hershko, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2693-2698). In the present study we have used affinity chromatography on immobilized protein substrates to examine the question of whether the different binding sites belong to one E3 enzyme, or to different E3 species. Another objective was to develop a procedure for the extensive purification of E3. When a crude extract of reticulocytes is applied to Type I or Type II protein substrates linked to Sepharose, E3 becomes strongly bound to the affinity columns and is not eluted with salt at high concentration. However, the enzyme can be specifically eluted by a dipeptide that has an NH2-terminal residue similar to that of matrix-bound protein substrate. A 350-fold purification is obtained in this single step. Preparations of E3 purified on either Type I or Type II protein substrate affinity columns act on both types of protein substrates, indicating that the separate binding sites for basic and hydrophobic NH2-terminal residues belong to one enzyme. Another species of E3 that acts strongly on some Type III protein substrates does not bind to Type I or Type II protein substrate affinity columns."

The molecular basis for this interaction was examined by analysis of hepatic mRNAslr levels, S14 gene tran- scription, and chromatin structure. While starvation of euthyroid rats inhibited hepatic S 14 gene transcrip- tion r90%, sucrose administration induced mRNAslr and 514 transcription to 82% of euthyroid-fed levels within 4 h. In contrast, administration of sucrose or Ts to starved hypothyroid animals restored S14 gene transcription to only 30% of euthyroid-fedvalues. Both Ts and sucrose were required to restore S14 run-on activity and mRNAs14 to euthyroid-fed levels within 4 h. Thus, TI and sucrose interact synergistically and rapidly to induce 514 gene transcription. Analysis of 514 chromatin structure showed that starvation of hypothyroid rats inhibited the formation of three DNase I-hypersensitive sites flanking the 5’-end of the S14 gene (Hss-1 at -65 to -265 base pairs; Hss-2 at -1.2 kilobases and Hss-3 at -2.67 kilobases). The loss of these sites correlated with the repression of 514 gene transcription in starved hypothyroid rats. Whereas administration of sucrose to starved hypothy- roid rats consistently induced the Hss-1 and Hss-2 sites, T3 consistently induced all three DNase I-hyper- sensitive sites. Yet, neither treatment alone induced 514 gene transcription to euthyroid levels. The com- bination of T3 and sucrose induced no additional change in S14 chromatin structure over that induced by Ts alone. Thus, regulation of S14 chromatin struc- ture alone is not the sole mechanism by which these stimuli regulate 514 gene transcription. We speculate that the synergistic regulation of 514 gene transcrip- tion by Ta and dietary carbohydrate involves a complex interaction between factors which regulate the acces- sibility of putative c&regulatory elements through changes in chromatin structure and the regulation of “transcription factors” which interact with these ele- ments. The mRNA (mRNA& coding for the rat liver S14 protein (Mr = 17,000, p1 4.9) is subject to tissue-specific, develop- mental, hormonal, and nutritional regulation (l-9).

https://openalex.org/W1559532543,"We have studied the effects of band 4.1 phosphorylation on its association with red cell inside-out vesicles stripped of all peripheral proteins. Band 4.1 bound to these vesicles in a saturable manner, and binding was characterized by a linear Scatchard plot with an apparent Kd of 1-2 x 10(-7) M. Phosphorylation of band 4.1 by purified protein kinase C reduced its ability to bind to membranes, resulting in a reduction in the apparent binding capacity of the membrane by 60-70% but little or no change in the apparent Kd of binding. By contrast, phosphorylation of band 4.1 by cAMP-dependent kinase had no effect on membrane binding. Digestion of the stripped inside-out vesicles with trypsin cleaved 100% of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 but had little or no effect on glycophorin. Binding of band 4.1 to these digested vesicles was reduced by 70%. Phosphorylation of band 4.1 by protein kinase C had no effect on its binding to the digested vesicles, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 contained the phosphorylation-sensitive binding sites. This was confirmed by direct measurement of band 4.1 binding to the purified cytoplasmic domain of band 3. Phosphorylation of band 4.1 by protein kinase C reduced its binding to the purified 43-kDa domain by as much as 90%, while phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase was without effect. These results show a selective effect of protein kinase C phosphorylation on the binding of band 4.1 to one of its membrane receptors, band 3, and suggest a mechanism whereby one of the key red cell-skeletal membrane associations may be modulated."
https://openalex.org/W1566907047,"The mechanism underlying the bradykinin (BK)-induced increase of acetylcholine (ACh) release was studied in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells and their synapses formed onto mouse muscle cells. External application of BK or iontophoretic injection of extrinsic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) into the cytoplasm of NG108-15 cells produced membrane hyperpolarization in the hybrid cells and an increase in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) in paired myotubes. Ba2+ blocked the hyperpolarization in response to BK, but facilitation of MEPPs was still observed. InsP3-dependent facilitation of MEPPs was also observed in cells where the InsP3 injections produced no detectable hyperpolarization or even depolarization. Real-time quantitative monitoring of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) with fura-2 in single NG108-15 cells showed that BK application or InsP3 injection induced an elevation of [Ca2+]i which coincided in time with membrane hyperpolarization recorded from the same cell. The [Ca2+]i rise produced by InsP3 injection started from the single site of injection and that produced by BK began from a deep compartment of the cytoplasm of the NG108-15 cells. The BK- and InsP3-evoked facilitation of MEPPs and the [Ca2+]i rise were relatively independent of extracellular Ca2+. These findings suggest that the BK-induced ACh release results not from membrane potential changes but from a transient InsP3-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1576144424,"Rhodopsin kinase was purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and blue-Sepharose. Kinase activity co-purified with a 62-kDa polypeptide, which bound light-dependently in the absence of ATP to purified vesicle-reconstituted rhodopsin. Purified rhodopsin kinase is free of any detectable arrestin or the retinal G-protein. Rhodopsin kinase is autophosphorylated on serine residues which is unaffected by the presence of bleached rhodopsin and results in a transition in molecular mass to 64 kDa. Autophosphorylation of the kinase did not appear to alter the overall rate of rhodopsin phosphorylation or the apparent KM (0.6 microM) for purified reconstituted rhodopsin. Peptides corresponding to sequences within opsin loops 3-4 and 5-6 and the COOH terminus inhibited kinase phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin, suggesting at least three potential sites to account for the stable high affinity binding of rhodopsin kinase to the bleached photoreceptor molecule that are at least in part distinct from the substrate sites for phosphorylation. These sequences are similar to those proposed for receptor recognition of G-proteins and indicate that the domains involved in light-dependent binding of rhodopsin kinase and retinal G-protein are similar or overlapping."
https://openalex.org/W1481921317,"Association and dissociation rate constants obtained by stopped-flow spectroscopy have permitted definition of a kinetic scheme for recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase that correctly predicts full time course kinetics of the enzymatic reaction over a wide range of substrate and product concentrations. The scheme is complex compared with that for the bacterial enzyme and involves branched pathways. It successfully accounts for observed rapid hysteresis preceding steady state and for the nonhyperbolic dependence of steady-state rate on substrate and product concentrations. The major branch point in the catalytic cycle occurs at E.NADP.H4folate because either NADP or H4folate can dissociate from the ternary product complex (koff = 84 s-1 and 46 s-1, respectively). The rate of conversion of enzyme-bound substrates to products is very fast (k = 1360 s-1) and nearly unidirectional (Kequ = 37) so that other steps limit the catalytic rate. At saturating substrate concentrations these steps include release of NADP and H4folate from E.NADP.H4folate and release of products from the two abortive complexes E.NADPH.H4folate (koff = 225 s-1) and E.NADP.H4folate (koff = 4.6 s-1). Since NADP dissociates slowly from E.NADP.H2folate nearly 90% of the enzyme accumulates as this complex at steady state. Nonetheless, the catalytic rate is maintained at 12 s-1 by rapid flux of a small portion of the enzyme through an alternate branch. At physiological concentrations of substrates and products the steady-state rate is limited primarily by the rate of H2folate binding to E.NADPH so that the enzyme is extremely efficient."
https://openalex.org/W1608327729,"The 5' and 3' ends of the lux mRNA of Vibrio harveyi, which extends over 8 kilobases, have been mapped, and two new genes, luxG and luxH, were identified at the 3' end of the lux operon. Both S1 nuclease and primer extension mapping demonstrated that the start site for the lux mRNA was 26 bases before the initiation codon of the first gene, luxC. The promoter region contained a typical -10 but not a recognizable -35 consensus sequence. By using S1 nuclease mapping the mRNA was found to be induced in a cell density- and arginine-dependent manner. The DNA downstream of the five known V. harveyi lux genes, luxCDABE, was sequenced and found to contain coding regions for two new genes, designated luxG and luxH, followed by a classical rho-independent termination signal for RNA polymerase. luxG codes for a protein of 233 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,108, and luxH codes for a protein of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25,326. The termination signal is active in vivo as demonstrated by 3' S1 nuclease mapping, confirming that the two genes are part of the V. harveyi lux operon. Comparison of the luxG amino acid sequence with coding regions immediately downstream from luxE in other luminescent bacteria has demonstrated that this gene may be a common component of the luminescent systems in different marine bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1583154648,"Estrogen rapidly, preferentially and markedly enhances the rate of N-linked glycoprotein synthesis in mouse uteri. In contrast, the rate of glycoprotein turnover is unaffected by the hormone. Estrogen's effect on the expression of mRNA coding for glycoproteins was studied using an in vitro translation-glycosylation system as well as by Northern/slot blot analyses. Both approaches indicated that estrogen did not have a preferential stimulatory effect on the general expression of glycoprotein mRNA. Neither was there a significant change in the relative levels of specific mRNA coding for several N-linked glycoproteins, i.e. laminin B1 and B2, fibronectin, and uvomorulin, as a function of estrogen treatment. Immunoprecipitation studies also demonstrated no change in the relative rates of synthesis of the corresponding core proteins for laminin or fibronectin. Taken together, these results suggested that estrogen primarily stimulated glycoprotein synthesis by stimulating the glycosylation apparatus, and not by increasing synthesis of protein acceptors. Previous studies have indicated that of a variety of potential regulatory points in the pathway of N-linked glycoprotein assembly, only expression of mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthase (MPDS) increases sufficiently to account for the increase in glycoprotein expression observed in response to estrogen. Consistent with these observations, it was found that injection of uterine poly(A+) RNA from estrogen-treated uteri into Xenopus oocytes markedly stimulated MPDS activity in the oocytes. In contrast, injection of RNA from non-estrogen-treated uteri did not stimulate MPDS activity in oocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that steroid hormones can modulate glycoprotein expression by preferentially stimulating the glycosylation apparatus. Nonetheless, one of estrogen's effects on the glycosylation apparatus, induction of MPDS activity, appears to occur at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1577867292,"In the present study we tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chain subunit of smooth muscle myosin (LC20) by the calcium-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C regulates contraction of chemically-permeabilized (glycerinated) porcine carotid artery smooth muscle. Purified protein kinase C and oleic acid were used to phosphorylate LC20 in glycerinated muscles in the presence of a CaEGTA/EGTA buffer system (pCa 8) to prevent activation of myosin light chain kinase. Phosphorylation of the light chain to 1.3 mol of PO4/mol of LC20 did not stimulate contraction. Tryptic digests of glycerinated carotid artery LC20 contained two major phosphopeptides which contained phosphoserine but not phosphothreonine. Incubation of glycerinated muscles with calcium (20 microM) and calmodulin (10 microM) resulted in contraction and LC20 phosphorylation to 1.1 mol of PO4/mol of LC20; tryptic digests of LC20 from these muscles contained a single phosphopeptide which could be distinguished by phosphopeptide mapping from the two phosphopeptides derived from muscles phosphorylated with protein kinase C. Further phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated muscles to 2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20, by incubation with protein kinase C, had no effect on either the level of isometric force or the lightly-loaded shortening velocity (after-load = 0.1 peak active force); removal of Ca2+ and calmodulin, but not protein kinase C and oleic acid, resulted in normal relaxation in spite of maintained phosphorylation to 1.2 mol of PO4/mol of LC20. Comparison of LC20 phosphopeptide maps from glycerinated muscles incubated with protein kinase C plus Ca2+/calmodulin (2.0 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) to maps from intact muscles stimulated with 10(-6) M phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (0.05 mol of PO4/mol of LC20) showed that the same three phosphopeptides were present in both the intact and glycerinated muscles. These findings show that phosphorylation of LC20 by protein kinase C in glycerinated muscles to levels at least 40 times higher than those present during contraction of intact, phorbol ester-stimulated muscles does not activate contraction nor does it significantly modify the contraction of smooth muscle which occurs in response to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of Ser19 by myosin light chain kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1627100014,"We compared the biochemical properties of receptors extracted from mouse lymphoma cells and complexed with the glucocorticoid, triamcinolone acetonide, or with the high affinity antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 [17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-17 alpha-(1-propynyl)-estra- 4,9-diene-3-one]. Upon salt treatment the high molecular weight receptor complexes of both types yielded dissociated forms that had the same affinity for DNA. Increased temperature caused subunit dissociation of the agonist complex but ligand dissociation of the antagonist complex. The latter was prevented if subunit dissociation was blocked by sodium molybdate but not by chemical cross-linking of the heteromeric receptor. Immunochemical studies suggest that the instability of the RU 38486 complex only affects the level of bound ligand but not the integrity of the receptor polypeptide. In intact cells at 37 degrees C the receptor polypeptide associated with nuclei only in the presence of hormone but not in its absence or if the antihormone was present. Cells incubated at 37 degrees C with RU 38486 retained in the cytosol the high molecular weight receptor in its ligand bound form. The data suggest that in intact cells under physiological conditions the antagonist binds to the heteromeric receptor and blocks its dissociation into subunits thus preventing nuclear receptor translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1518580058,"We utilized differential plaque hybridization to identify three cDNA clones for transcripts which increase in abundance during the salinity-induced transition from C3 photosynthesis to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. Although there are differences in the abundance of these transcripts in unstressed tissue, steady-state levels of all three increased within 30 h following irrigation with 0.5 M NaCl. One cDNA encodes the cytosolic form of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating) (NAD-GAPDH], an enzyme involved in the production of phosphoenolpyruvate for CO2 fixation at night and the conversion of pyruvate to storage carbohydrate during the day. Coding region and 3'-noncoding sequence probes were used to examine the expression of NAD-GAPDH transcripts in leaf and root tissue. We show that the gene encoding the NAD-GAPDH cDNA is expressed in both leaf and root tissue during C3 photosynthesis and CAM. NAD-GAPDH transcript levels increase rapidly in leaf (but not in root) tissue during the transition to CAM. Our data indicate that the predominant NAD-GAPDH transcript expressed during C3 photosynthesis and CAM is encoded by a single gene in M crystallinum. These results imply that the transition to CAM in some cases involves an upward readjustment in the level of a gene product expressed during C3 photosynthesis, rather than the expression of a CAM-specific isoform with unique regulatory or kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1542616110,"The enzyme rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) could be reversibly refolded from urea in the presence of lauryl maltoside, beta-mercaptoethanol, and sodium thiosulfate. The unfolding/folding transition monitored using intrinsic fluorescence was resolved into two two-state transitions with midpoints at 3.6 and 5.0 M urea. The analysis assumed an intermediate with an emission maximum at 345 nm. Monitoring anisotropy of intrinsic fluorescence also gave an asymmetric transition. Activity followed one two-state transition centered at 3.6 M urea with no major change of secondary structure. Without thiosulfate or mercaptoethanol, there was one two-state transition at 5.0 M urea giving a species, in dilute urea, with a fluorescence maximum at 345 nm. This intermediate slowly relaxed toward 335 nm (t1/2 = 85 min) if only thiosulfate was absent but without regaining activity. Subsequent addition of thiosulfate led to a first-order recovery of activity (t1/2 = 75 min). Thus, a possible folding intermediate can be trapped which displays increased access of water and solutes to its fluorescent tryptophans. This intermediate conformer, which is flexible, has considerable secondary structure, is inactive, has exposed hydrophobic surfaces, and requires specific reducing conditions to regain full activity. Refolding probably involves an initial, rapid, hydrophobic collapse with acquisition of secondary structure to form the intermediate, followed by slower adjustment to the native global conformation. Final reactivation requires reduction localized at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1520888531,"We have previously demonstrated that cytochrome P-450c and P-450d mRNAs can be induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes grown in serum-free hormonally defined medium (HDM) plus minimal salts (Silver, G., and Krauter, K. S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263; 11802-11807). Such cultures were used to investigate the role of the individual hormonal components present in the medium in the hydrocarbon-mediated induction process. Replacing HDM with minimal salts plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in a 4-fold reduction in the accumulation of P-450d mRNA in response to MCA. In contrast, no effect was seen on induced levels of P-450c mRNA. Mixing experiments, in which primary cultures of hepatocytes were grown in medium containing HDM plus 10% FBS, indicated that there was no negative acting component present in FBS, but rather there was a positive acting component present in the mixture of hormones in HDM which permitted P-450d induction by MCA. Testing the effects of singly deleting each of the 10 components in HDM on MCA-induced P-450d expression demonstrated that dexamethasone was the only factor which affected the induction of P-450d. Deletion of this component from HDM resulted in a 4-fold decrease in the maximum MCA induced expression of P-450d mRNA. Moreover, supplementation of minimal salts plus 10% FBS with dexamethasone restored full P-450d inducibility by MCA. Deletion of the other components from HDM had no effects on P-450d mRNA accumulation. Although substratum clearly contributed to the quality of primary hepatocyte cultures, we were unable to demonstrate any role of the substratum on MCA induction of P-450d. In vitro nuclear run-on experiments revealed that dexamethasone had little effect on the rate of transcription of the P-450d genes. Therefore, the effect of dexamethasone on induction must be at the posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1545110180,"The S49 mouse lymphoma mutant cell line Kin- is resistant to the cytotoxic effects of elevated cAMP levels, has no detectable cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, and has depressed levels of cAMP-binding regulatory subunits. We demonstrate that although the Kin- cell line lacks detectable catalytic subunit protein, these cells express wild-type levels of mRNA for both C alpha and C beta catalytic subunit isoforms. Translation of C alpha mRNA appears to be normal in the Kin- cell, based on the observation that C alpha mRNA associates with large polyribosomes in both wild-type and Kin- cells. We cloned the C alpha cDNA from Kin- cells and show that its transient expression in another cell type leads to activation of a cAMP-sensitive luciferase reporter gene, suggesting that functional C alpha protein is made. In addition to having catalytic activity, the C alpha subunit from Kin- cells is inhibited in the presence of mouse RI alpha regulatory subunit, indicating that formation of the holoenzyme complex is normal. We suggest that the mutation responsible for the Kin- phenotype is in a cellular component that directly or indirectly causes Kin- catalytic subunit protein to be degraded rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1586465868,"Cruciferin (12 S globulin) is a large, neutral, oligometric protein synthesized in rapeseed (Brassica napus) during seed development. It is the major seed protein and is composed of six subunit pairs. Each of these pairs is synthesized as a precursor containing one heavy alpha-chain and one light beta-chain. Electrophoretic analysis of cruciferin showed that four different alpha- and four different beta-chains exist. A cruciferin clone was selected from an embryo cDNA library. This clone, pCRU1, contains a 1518-base pair open reading frame corresponding to a truncated NH2-terminal signal sequence followed by an alpha-chain of 296 and a beta-chain of 190 amino acid residues. Individual cruciferin chains as well as peptides thereof were subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The sequences obtained from a specific alpha- and beta-chain pair (alpha 1 and beta 1) showed total identity with the deduced amino acid sequence from pCRU1. Further comparisons revealed that a previously characterized cruciferin cDNA clone encodes one of the precursors for the closely related alpha 2/ alpha 3-beta 2/beta 3 subunits. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two cDNA clones display 64% similarity."
https://openalex.org/W1527256260,"Complement factor C3, recently found to contain covalently bound phosphate, was phosphorylated in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and Ca2(+)-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Both protein kinases phosphorylated the same serine residue(s) located in the C3a portion of the alpha-chain. In addition, protein kinase C phosphorylated the beta-chain to a lesser extent. Protein kinase A gave a maximal incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of C3 while that value with protein kinase C was 1.5 mol of phosphate/mol of C3. The velocity in pmol of [32P]phosphate/(min x unit kinase) was 20 times higher for protein kinase C than for protein kinase A although a 10 times lower ratio of protein kinase to C3 was used in the former case. The apparent Km for C3 was 2.6 microM when protein kinase C was used. The phosphorylated C3 was found to be more resistant to partial degradation by trypsin than unphosphorylated C3. It was also found that phosphorylation of C3 in the C3a portion of the alpha-chain inhibited both the classical and alternative complement activation pathways on an approximately stoichiometric basis."
https://openalex.org/W1546420237,"The integrity of the alpha-sarcin loop in 28 S ribosomal RNA is critical during protein synthesis. The toxins alpha-sarcin, ricin, Shiga toxin, and Shiga-like toxin inhibit protein synthesis in oocytes by attacking specific nucleotides within this loop (Ackerman, E.J., Saxena, S. K., and Ulbrich, N. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17076-17083; Saxena, S.K., O'Brien, A.D., and Ackerman, E.J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 596-601). We injected Xenopus oocytes with deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the 17-nucleotide alpha-sarcin loop of Xenopus 28 S rRNA. Only injected oligonucleotides fully covering the alpha-sarcin loop or slightly beyond inhibited oocyte protein synthesis. Shorter alpha-sarcin domain deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the alpha-sarcin and ricin sites but not spanning the entire loop were less effective inhibitors of protein synthesis. The alpha-sarcin domain oligonucleotides covering the entire loop were more effective inhibitors of protein synthesis than injected cycloheximide at equivalent concentrations. Control oligonucleotides complementary to nine other regions of Xenopus 28 S rRNA as well as universal M13 DNA sequencing primers had no effect on oocyte protein synthesis. Oligonucleotides complementary to the highly conserved alpha-sarcin domain therefore represent an alternative to catalytic toxins for causing cell death and may prove effective in immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1549642844,"A photoactive coenzyme analog of NAD+ has been synthesized by chemically coupling [32P]2-azido-AMP and NMN to produce [32P]nicotinamide 2-azidoadenosine dinucleotide (2-azido-NAD+). The utility of 2-azido-NAD+ as an effective active-site-directed photoprobe was demonstrated using bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase as a model enzyme. In the absence of ultraviolet light, 2-azido-NAD+ is a substrate for this enzyme. Photoincorporation of probe was saturable with two different apparent dissociation constants of 10 microM and 40 microM. Protection of photoinsertion was seen with the natural substrate NAD+ with apparent dissociation constants of less than 5 microM and 25 microM. This observation may be explained on the basis of negative cooperative interaction between the subunits. The photoinsertion of 2-azido-NAD+ was increased by GTP and decreased by ADP in accordance with their known effects on NAD+ binding. When the enzyme was covalently modified by photolysis in the presence of saturating amounts of photoprobe, an approximately 40% inhibition of the enzyme activity was observed. These results demonstrate that the photoaffinity coenzyme analog has potential application as a probe to characterize NAD(+)-binding proteins and to identify the active sites of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1528987274,"Lipid peroxidation is known to affect the activity of several enzymes including microsomal enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase; but its effect on the enzymes of lipid biosynthesis has not been investigated. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) represents the first committed step and probably the rate limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis and thus may be a good candidate for study. Rat liver microsomal GPAT was assayed after preincubating the microsomes under conditions known to induce peroxidation. In 30 min, 10 microM Fe2+ can diminish the activity by as much as 80%. The inactivating effect can be blocked to different extents by several antioxidants, while ascorbic acid enhances it. These effects, along with the concomitant measurement of lipid peroxidation, indicate that microsomal GPAT activity is inactivated by lipid peroxidation in a sensitive and rapid fashion. This is further confirmed by the inactivating effect of carbon tetrachloride, which is known to induce lipid peroxidation in microsomes. Fe3+ also inactivates the enzyme, but at a higher concentration. Copper salts inactivate GPAT by a mechanism apparently different from that of iron. The mechanism might involve a direct sulfhydryl modification by copper and lipid peroxidation apparently different from that induced by iron. It is suggested that the inactivation of GPAT by lipid peroxidation could accelerate the process of membrane disintegration caused by lipid peroxidation in pathological conditions involving free radical-mediated tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2102198731,"The sequences flanking a psoralen interstrand cross-link may determine how it is repaired. Our comparison of the Escherichia coli UvrABC endonuclease incision of a variety of specific cross-link sequences in a single natural DNA fragment showed that DNA base composition determines which of two cross-linked DNA strands will be incised. G/C enrichment of the region 6-12 bases 5' of the modified T on the furan-side strand results in preferential incision of the furan-side strand. When the G/C-rich region is on the 3' side, or on neither side, incisions occur on either strand. These effects of DNA base composition suggest that UvrAB can bind in two ways to a psoralen cross-link."
https://openalex.org/W1497044879,"We have shown previously that Acanthamoeba myosin-II minifilaments assemble by three successive dimerization steps, forming, progressively, monomers, antiparallel dimers, antiparallel tetramers, and finally the full size octameric minifilament (Sinard, J. H., Stafford, W. F., and Pollard, T. D. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 1537-1548). In the current study, we investigate the kinetics of the assembly of these minifilaments, initiating assembly by the rapid dilution of salt in a stopped-flow light scattering apparatus. The majority of the reaction is completed within 50 ms and is greater than 90% completed within 1 s. Assembly data over a greater than 6-fold myosin concentration range can be fit using the successive dimerization mechanism with a single set of rate constants. Second order rate constants for the initial steps in the assembly reaction exceed 10(8) M-1 s-1, and equilibrium dissociation constants predict a very low critical concentration, consistent with previous data. Other possible assembly mechanisms do not adequately fit all of the available data. Filament disassembly at 300 mM KCl is even more rapid, and there is both an increase in the dissociation rate constants and a decrease in the association rate constants with increasing KCl. Aggregation of minifilaments induced by Mg2+ is much slower and takes many minutes to reach equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1534291862,"We find that the purified murine DNA polymerase.alpha-primase complex exhibits the greatest affinity for DNA templates in which CCC occurs 10 nucleotides downstream of a DNA primase initiation site (Km = 6.6 +/- 0.3 pM). Templates with 3'-CCA-5' at this position are less efficiently utilized (Km = 16 +/- 4 pM). Point mutations that disrupt the 3'-CC(C/A)-5' motif further decrease the affinity for DNA approximately 7-fold (Km = 105 +/- 58 pM). Mutations at the primase start site reduce Vmax 2-fold. Template pyrimidines are required for priming, and initiation with ATP is preferred to initiation with GTP. We conclude that a component of the DNA polymerase.alpha-primase complex recognizes a 3'-CC(C/A)-5' motif in the DNA template, downstream of a primase start site, and that this interaction controls site selection and frequency of initiation by DNA primase."
https://openalex.org/W1600874935,"Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated the existence of multiple tropoelasting mRNAs and protein isoforms. The present study was designed to examine the developmental expression of a specific tropoelastin mRNA, its encoded isoform, and the fate of that isoform in the extracellular matrix. A chick genomic DNA library was screened with a chick tropoelastin cDNA. Seven unique, overlapping clones spanning 39 kilobases were isolated. A synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to a variable tropoelastin mRNA sequence was used to identify a 1.5-kilobase PstI-BamHI genomic fragment. Nucleotide sequence data revealed that the putative exon was surrounded by intron sequences possessing canonical splice sites at the exon/intron borders. Using both immunologic and molecular probes specific to the tropoelastin isoform and mRNA, quantitative protein and RNA analyses were performed. Results demonstrate that total tropoelastin mRNAs increased significantly during aortic embryogenesis whereas the amount of mRNA containing the variable exon remained relatively constant. The amount of total tropoelastins within the same developmental period reflect the level of total tropoelastin mRNA. The amount of the tropoelastin isoform containing the variable exon essentially mirrored the corresponding mRNA with the exception that a decrease in the isoform at day 15 was not seen in the mRNA level. Immunoelectron micrographs of 13-day chick aortic tissue using both total and isoform-specific antisera showed ultrastructural localization to definable elastic fibers. Antibodies to the variable tropoelastin isoform occurred preferentially at sites where elastic fiber microfibril structures were evident."
https://openalex.org/W1604149400,"Factor IX is the zymogen of the serine protease factor IXa involved in blood coagulation. In addition to a catalytic domain homologous to the chymotrypsin family, it has Ca2+, phospholipid, and factor VIIIa binding regions needed for full biologic activity. We isolated a nonfunctional factor IX protein designated factor IXEagle Rock (IXER) from a patient with hemophilia B. The variant protein is indistinguishable from normal factor IX (IXN) in its migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, isoelectric point in urea, carbohydrate content and distribution, number of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, and beta-OH aspartic acid content, and in its binding to an anti-IXN monoclonal antibody which has been shown previously to inhibit the interaction of factor VIIIa with factor IXaN. Further, IXER is cleaved to yield a factor IXa-like molecule by factor XIa/Ca2+ at a rate similar to that observed for IXN. However, in contrast to IXaN, IXaER does not bind to antithrombin-III (specific inhibitor of IXaN) and does not catalyze the activation of factor X (substrate) to factor Xa. To identify the mutation in IXER, all eight exons of IXN and IXER gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technique and cloned. A single point mutation (G----T) which results in the replacement of Val for Gly363 in the catalytic domain of IXER was identified. Gly363 in factor IXa corresponds to the universally conserved Gly193 in the active site sequence of the chymotrypsin serine protease family. X-ray crystallographic data in the literature demonstrate a critical role of this Gly in stabilizing the active conformation of chymotrypsin/trypsin in two major ways: 1) in the formation of the substrate binding site; and 2) in the development of the oxyanion hole. Our computer structural data support a concept that the Gly363----Val change prevents the development of the active site conformation in factor IXa such that the substrate binding site and the oxyanion hole are not formed in the mutated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1514273575,"In a previous paper (Rath, H. M., Doyle, G. A. R., and Silbert, D. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13387-13390), we reported a selection for the isolation of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CCL39) defective in thrombin-induced mitogenesis. One mutant, D1-6b, had decreased production of inositol phosphates when challenged with activators of phosphatidylinositol turnover and extracts of this mutant showed a marked decrease in phospholipase C (PLC) activity toward phosphatidylinositol. In the current studies, the PLC activities of wild type CCL39 and D1-6b cytosolic extracts are further characterized. Wild type cytosol had at least two phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC isoenzymes, which could be separated by anion exchange chromatography and behaved differently in thermal inactivation studies. Since gel filtration of PLC activity in wild type extracts gave Mr values similar to that of previously characterized PLCs (140,000-200,000), immunoblots with antibodies to bovine brain isoenzymes were used to show that the PLC activities obtained by anion exchange chromatography were PLC-delta and PLC-gamma. Immunoblots with mutant D1-6b cytosol confirmed the presence of the PLC-gamma but showed no detectable PLC-delta. This activity in the mutant extracts eluted at the same conductivity on anion exchange columns and had the same kinetics of thermal inactivation as the PLC-gamma found in the wild type extracts. PLC-gamma from mutant extracts was active in assays containing phospholipid detergent mixed micelles but not in assays utilizing phospholipid vesicles, in sharp contrast to PLC-gamma from CCL39 extracts, which was active under either condition. Thus, the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity of mutant D1-6b is diminished both by the loss of PLC-delta and by the compromised behavior of PLC-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1536126683,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and oxidase (AO) enzymes from the tissue extracts of male and female tobacco budworm moth (Heliothis virescens) were identified after electrophoretic protein separation. AO activity was visualized using formazan- or horseradish peroxidase-mediated staining coupled to the AO-catalyzed oxidation of benzaldehyde. A set of six soluble AO enzymes with isoelectric points from pI 4.6 to 5.3 were detected primarily in the antennal extracts. Partially purified antennal AO enzymes also oxidized both (Z)-9-tetradecenal and (Z)-11-hexadecenal, the two major pheromone components of this moth. ALDH activity was detected using a tritium-labeled affinity reagent based on a known irreversible inhibitor of this enzyme. This labeled vinyl ketone, [3H](Z)-1,11-hexadecadien-3-one, was synthesized and used to covalently modify the soluble ALDH enzymes from tissue extracts. Molecular subunits of potential ALDH enzymes were visualized in the fluorescence autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated proteins of the antenna, head, and leg tissues. Covalent modification of these protein subunits decreased specifically in the presence of excess pheromone aldehyde or benzaldehyde. Labeled vinyl ketones are thus novel tools for the identification of molecular subunits of ALDH enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1612033399,"The immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic agent cyclosporin binds to a renal polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 75,000 which has been identified as a component of the renal Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter (Neeb, M., Kunz, U., and Koepsell, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10718-10729). The same Mr 75,000 polypeptide was covalently labeled with the D-glucose analog 10-N-(bromoacetyl)amino-1-decyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and with the cyclosporin analog N epsilon-(diazotrifluoroethyl)benzyl-D-Lys8- cyclosporin (CSDZ). CSDZ labeling was decreased when the brush-border membrane proteins were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter. In the presence of 145 mM Na+, CSDZ labeling was decreased by D-glucose (1 microM, 1 mM, or 100 mM) and by phlorizin (100 or 500 microM). In the absence of Na+, CSDZ labeling was distinctly increased by 50 microM phlorizin and was slightly increased by 1 mM D-glucose, whereas CSDZ labeling was decreased by 50 microM phloretin and by 500 microM phlorizin. Furthermore, Na(+)-dependent high affinity phlorizin binding to the Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter was competitively inhibited by cyclosporin A (Ki = 0.04 microM) while Na(+)-D-glucose cotransport was not influenced. The data suggest that a part of the cyclosporin binding domain on the Na(+)-D-glucose cotransporter is identical to the phloretin binding domain of the high affinity phlorizin binding site. While phloretin or the phloretin moiety of phlorizin may directly displace cyclosporin, interaction of D-glucose or of the D-glucose moiety of phlorizin with the transporter may alter the conformation of the cyclosporin binding site and this conformational change may be modulated by Na+."
https://openalex.org/W1590021411,"Haemophilus influenzae D(-)-lactate dehydrogenase (D(-)-lactate:NAD oxidoreductase; EC 1.1.1.28) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using salt fractionation, hydrophobic and dye affinity chromatography. The enzyme was purified 2100-fold with a 14% recovery and a final specific activity of 300 units/mg protein. The enzyme was demonstrated to be a tetramer of Mr 135,000. The enzyme catalyzed the reduction of pyruvate to give exclusively D(-)-lactate using NADH as coenzyme. The reaction catalyzed was essentially unidirectional, with the oxidation of D-lactate in the presence of NAD proceeding at less than 0.2% the rate of pyruvate reduction. Kinetic parameters for the reduction of pyruvate were determined for NADH and four structural analogs of the coenzyme. Coenzyme-competitive inhibition by adenosine derivatives indicated the presence of regions in the coenzyme binding site interacting with the adenosine and pyrophosphate moieties of the coenzyme. The purified enzyme was sensitive to oxidation and was effectively inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents. Conversion of D-lactate to pyruvate catalyzed by a membrane-bound D-lactate oxidase was demonstrated in cell-free extracts of H. influenzae."
https://openalex.org/W1491715592,"We have found that a chicken egg lysozyme derivative (beta-101-lysozyme) containing an L-isoaspartyl residue at position 101 has a Km for methylation by the human erythrocyte L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl protein methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) of 183 microM, about 30 times higher than that expected from previous studies with isoaspartyl-containing peptides. In the course of investigating the reasons for this poor enzyme recognition, we found that charged residues on the carboxyl side of isoaspartyl residues had a large effect on the affinity of the enzyme for synthetic peptides. This is best illustrated by the lysozyme-related peptide YVSisoDGDG, which has a Km for methylation of 469 microM. When the penultimate aspartyl residue is replaced by a cysteinyl residue, the Km drops to 4.6 microM, comparable to other peptides of similar size. Furthermore, replacing it with a cysteic acid residue results in a Km of 104 microM, suggesting that a negative charge at this position may lead to a weaker affinity of the peptide substrate for the methyltransferase. Assays with additional synthetic peptides indicate that moving the negative charge to the first or third residue on the carboxyl side of the isoaspartyl residue has a similar but less severe effect in reducing its affinity for the methyltransferase. Enzymatic methylation has recently been proposed to be the first step in the conversion of abnormal isoaspartyl residues to aspartyl residues. The results reported here, however, along with previous evidence that protein tertiary structure can inhibit isoaspartyl methylation, suggest that only a subclass of damaged sites are capable of efficiently entering a putative repair pathway; the sites not recognized by the methyltransferase may accumulate in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1603573704,"In order to improve the existing models of retinal-protein Schiff bases, a water-soluble polylysine-retinaldehyde imine has been synthesized and its stability assessed under a variety of conditions through changes in the visible absorption spectrum. The compound absorbs at 342 nm and consists of a 90-kDa poly-L-lysine containing a retinal Schiff base in about 2% of the lysyl epsilon-amino ends. Retinal is mostly in the all-trans form; under no conditions is more than 15% of the 13-cis isomer detected. The absorption maximum exhibits a pH-dependent reversible shift to 402 nm, with an apparent pKa approximately 3.4. In the presence of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate, this pKa is shifted to approximately 8.9, probably because of electric neutralization of lysyl epsilon-amino groups. Other detergents (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, Triton X-100) do not modify the Schiff base pKa, but rather promote its hydrolysis; in this case detergents act in the same way as certain solvent mixtures, by providing an amphiphillic environment to the imine that in turn stabilizes the products of hydrolysis. Our results suggest that once the surfactant reaches the Schiff base, preferential partition of retinal into detergent micelles is the main factor facilitating imine bond breakdown. The response of our synthetic Schiff base to changes in pH or solvent polarity point together to an important role of the supporting polypeptide in providing a suitable environment to the chromophore."
https://openalex.org/W1774704664,"Abstract Genomic sequencing of two CG sites located in the 5'-flanking promoter region of the mouse beta-globin major gene shows these sites to be heavily methylated in the DNA from L929 mouse fibroblasts, a cell line that does not express the beta-globin gene. By contrast, the same CG sites in the DNA obtained from murine erythroleukemia cells, which can express the beta-globin gene, are unmethylated. The results suggest that either differentiation of progenitor cells to form the erythroid precursor murine erythroleukemia cell and/or transformation by the Friend virus group leads to demethylation of these CG sites. Final activation of the transcription process for the mouse beta-globin gene does not require demethylation in the 5'-promoter region of the DNA."
