https://openalex.org/W3116055094,"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are major risk factors for critical disease progression. However, the underlying causes and the effects of the main anti-hypertensive therapies-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)-remain unclear. Combining clinical data (n = 144) and single-cell sequencing data of airway samples (n = 48) with in vitro experiments, we observed a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells in patients with hypertension that correlated with critical COVID-19 progression. ACEI treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and with increased cell intrinsic antiviral responses, whereas ARB treatment related to enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions. Macrophages and neutrophils of patients with hypertension, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3 and CCL4 and the chemokine receptor CCR1. Although the limited size of our cohort does not allow us to establish clinical efficacy, our data suggest that the clinical benefits of ACEI treatment in patients with COVID-19 who have hypertension warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3117755077,"Objective To study the U.S. public’s attitudes toward surveillance measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, particularly smartphone applications (apps) that supplement traditional contact tracing. Method We deployed a survey of approximately 2,000 American adults to measure support for nine COVID-19 surveillance measures. We assessed attitudes toward contact tracing apps by manipulating six different attributes of a hypothetical app through a conjoint analysis experiment. Results A smaller percentage of respondents support the government encouraging everyone to download and use contact tracing apps (42%) compared with other surveillance measures such as enforcing temperature checks (62%), expanding traditional contact tracing (57%), carrying out centralized quarantine (49%), deploying electronic device monitoring (44%), or implementing immunity passes (44%). Despite partisan differences on a range of surveillance measures, support for the government encouraging digital contact tracing is indistinguishable between Democrats (47%) and Republicans (46%), although more Republicans oppose the policy (39%) compared to Democrats (27%). Of the app features we tested in our conjoint analysis experiment, only one had statistically significant effects on the self-reported likelihood of downloading the app: decentralized data architecture increased the likelihood by 5.4 percentage points. Conclusion Support for public health surveillance policies to curb the spread of COVID-19 is relatively low in the U.S. Contact tracing apps that use decentralized data storage, compared with those that use centralized data storage, are more accepted by the public. While respondents’ support for expanding traditional contact tracing is greater than their support for the government encouraging the public to download and use contact tracing apps, there are smaller partisan differences in support for the latter policy."
https://openalex.org/W3116935429,"To slow the progression of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended wearing face coverings. However, very little is known about how occluding parts of the face might impact the emotion inferences that children make during social interactions. The current study recruited a racially diverse sample of school-aged (7- to 13-years) children from publicly funded after-school programs. Children made inferences from facial configurations that were not covered, wearing sunglasses to occlude the eyes, or wearing surgical masks to occlude the mouth. Children were still able to make accurate inferences about emotions, even when parts of the faces were covered. These data suggest that while there may be some challenges for children incurred by others wearing masks, in combination with other contextual cues, masks are unlikely to dramatically impair children’s social interactions in their everyday lives."
https://openalex.org/W3117831080,"Maternal infection and inflammation during pregnancy are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, but little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying this epidemiologic phenomenon. Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to profile transcriptional changes in the mouse fetal brain in response to maternal immune activation (MIA) and identified perturbations in cellular pathways associated with mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis and stress signaling. We found that MIA activates the integrated stress response (ISR) in male, but not female, MIA offspring in an interleukin-17a-dependent manner, which reduced global mRNA translation and altered nascent proteome synthesis. Moreover, blockade of ISR activation prevented the behavioral abnormalities as well as increased cortical neural activity in MIA male offspring. Our data suggest that sex-specific activation of the ISR leads to maternal inflammation-associated neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3115301926,"Histone methyltransferases of the nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein (NSD) family, including NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3, have crucial roles in chromatin regulation and are implicated in oncogenesis1,2. NSD enzymes exhibit an autoinhibitory state that is relieved by binding to nucleosomes, enabling dimethylation of histone H3 at Lys36 (H3K36)3-7. However, the molecular basis that underlies this mechanism is largely unknown. Here we solve the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NSD2 and NSD3 bound to mononucleosomes. We find that binding of NSD2 and NSD3 to mononucleosomes causes DNA near the linker region to unwrap, which facilitates insertion of the catalytic core between the histone octamer and the unwrapped segment of DNA. A network of DNA- and histone-specific contacts between NSD2 or NSD3 and the nucleosome precisely defines the position of the enzyme on the nucleosome, explaining the specificity of methylation to H3K36. Intermolecular contacts between NSD proteins and nucleosomes are altered by several recurrent cancer-associated mutations in NSD2 and NSD3. NSDs that contain these mutations are catalytically hyperactive in vitro and in cells, and their ectopic expression promotes the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumours. Together, our research provides molecular insights into the nucleosome-based recognition and histone-modification mechanisms of NSD2 and NSD3, which could lead to strategies for therapeutic targeting of proteins of the NSD family."
https://openalex.org/W3117063919,"How do we learn about what to learn about? Specifically, how do the neural elements in our brain generalize what has been learned in one situation to recognize the common structure of—and speed learning in—other, similar situations? We know this happens because we become better at solving new problems—learning and deploying schemas1–5—through experience. However, we have little insight into this process. Here we show that using prior knowledge to facilitate learning is accompanied by the evolution of a neural schema in the orbitofrontal cortex. Single units were recorded from rats deploying a schema to learn a succession of odour-sequence problems. With learning, orbitofrontal cortex ensembles converged onto a low-dimensional neural code across both problems and subjects; this neural code represented the common structure of the problems and its evolution accelerated across their learning. These results demonstrate the formation and use of a schema in a prefrontal brain region to support a complex cognitive operation. Our results not only reveal a role for the orbitofrontal cortex in learning but also have implications for using ensemble analyses to tap into complex cognitive functions. Rats learning to solve a succession of odour-sequence problems developed an orbitofrontal cortical representation that reflected the structure—or schema—common across problems."
https://openalex.org/W3116222416,"Background Colorectal cancer surgery is complex and can result in severe post-operative complications. Optimisation of surgical outcomes requires a thorough understanding of the background complexity and comorbid status of patients. Aim The aim of this study is to determine whether certain pre-existing comorbidities are associated with high grade post-operative complications following colorectal cancer surgery. The study also aims to define the prevalence of demographic, comorbid and surgical features in a population undergoing colorectal cancer resection. Method A colorectal cancer database at The Prince Charles Hospital was established to capture detailed information on patient background, comorbidities and clinicopathological features. A single-centre retrospective study was undertaken to assess the effect of comorbidities on post-operative outcomes following colorectal cancer resection. Five hundred and thirty-three patients were reviewed between 2010–2018 to assess if specific comorbidities were associated with higher grade post-operative complications. A Clavien-Dindo grade of three or higher was defined as a high grade complication. Results Fifty-eight percent of all patients had an ASA grade of ASA III or above. The average BMI of patients undergoing resection was 28 ± 6.0. Sixteen percent of all patients experienced a high grade complications. Patients with high grade complications had a higher mean average age compared to patients with low grade or no post-operative complications (74 years vs 70 years, p = 0.01). Univariate analysis revealed patients with atrial fibrillation, COPD, ischaemic heart disease and heart failure had an increased risk of high grade complications. Multivariate analysis revealed pre-existing atrial fibrillation (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.53–4.89, p &lt;0.01) and COPD (OR 2.02 1.07–3.80, p = 0.029) were independently associated with an increased risk of high grade complications. Conclusion Pre-existing atrial fibrillation and COPD are independent risk factors for high grade complications. Targeted perioperative management is necessary to optimise outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3117586180,"The peach fruit fly Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is an important invasive species causing substantial losses to the horticulture industry worldwide. Despite the severe economic impact caused by this pest in its native and invaded range, information on its potential range expansion under changing climate remains largely unknown. In this study, we employed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach to predict the global potential climatic suitability of B . zonata under current climate and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for the year 2050. Outputs from MaxEnt were merged with Spatial Production Allocation Model. A natural dispersal model using Gaussian dispersal kernel was developed. The Areas Under Curves generated by MaxEnt were greater than 0.92 for both current and future climate change scenarios, indicating satisfactory performances of the models. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of driest month and temperature seasonality significantly influenced the potential establishment of B . zonata . The models indicated high climatic suitability in tropical and subtropical areas in Asia and Africa, where the species has already been recorded. Suitable areas were predicted in West, East and Central Africa and to a lesser extent in Central and South America. Future climatic scenarios models, RCP 4.5 and 8.5 show significant potential range expansion of B . zonata in Western Sahara, while RCP 4.5 highlighted expansion in Southern Africa. Contrarily, RCP 2.6 showed considerable decrease in B . zonata range expansion in Central, East and West Africa. There was increased climatic suitability of B . zonata in Egypt and Middle East under RCP 6.0. The dispersal model revealed that B . zonata could spread widely within its vicinity with decreasing infestation rates away from the source points. Our findings can help to guide biosecurity agencies in decision-making and serve as an early warning tool to safeguard against the pest invasion into unaffected areas."
https://openalex.org/W3116722673,"The lack of control in voltage overshoot, transient response, and steady state error are major issues that are frequently encountered in a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, resulting in poor power quality performance and damages to the overall power system. This paper presents the performance of a control strategy for an inverter in a three-phase grid-connected PV system. The system consists of a PV panel, a boost converter, a DC link, an inverter, and a resistor-inductor (RL) filter and is connected to the utility grid through a voltage source inverter. The main objective of the proposed strategy is to improve the power quality performance of the three-phase grid-connected inverter system by optimising the proportional-integral (PI) controller. Such a strategy aims to reduce the DC link input voltage fluctuation, decrease the harmonics, and stabilise the output current, voltage, frequency, and power flow. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) technique was implemented to tune the PI controller parameters by minimising the error of the voltage regulator and current controller schemes in the inverter system. The system model and control strategies were implemented using MATLAB/Simulink environment (Version 2020A) Simscape-Power system toolbox. Results show that the proposed strategy outperformed other reported research works with total harmonic distortion (THD) at a grid voltage and current of 0.29% and 2.72%, respectively, and a transient response time of 0.1853s. Compared to conventional systems, the PI controller with PSO-based optimization provides less voltage overshoot by 11.1% while reducing the time to reach equilibrium state by 32.6%. The consideration of additional input parameters and the optimization of input parameters were identified to be the two main factors that contribute to the significant improvements in power quality control. Therefore, the proposed strategy effectively enhances the power quality of the utility grid, and such an enhancement contributes to the efficient and smooth integration of the PV system."
https://openalex.org/W3117503529,"Background Availability of essential medicines for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is poor in low- and middle-income countries. Availability and cost are conventionally assessed using cross-sectional data. However, these characteristics may vary over time. Methods We carried out a prospective, descriptive analysis of the availability and cost of essential medicines in 23 Ugandan health facilities over a five-week period. We surveyed facility pharmacies in-person up to five times, recording availability and cost of 19 essential medicines for NCDs and four essential medicines for communicable diseases. Results Availability of medicines varied substantially over time, especially among public facilities. Among private-for-profit facilities, the cost of the same medicine varied from week to week. Private-not-for-profit facilities experienced less dramatic fluctuations in price. Conclusions We conclude that there is a need for standardized, continuous monitoring to better characterize the availability and cost of essential medicines, understand demand for these medicines, and reduce uncertainty for patients."
https://openalex.org/W3117520266,"Acetamiprid (ACE) is a kind of broad-spectrum pesticide that has potential health risk to human beings. Aptamers (Ap-DNA (1)) have a great potential as analytical tools for pesticide detection. In this work, a label-free electrochemical sensing assay for ACE determination is presented by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). And the specific binding model between ACE and Ap-DNA (1) was further investigated for the first time. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and EIS demonstrated that the single strand AP-DNA (1) first formed a loosely secondary structure in Tris-HClO 4 (20 mM, pH = 7.4), and then transformed into a more stable hairpin-like structure when incubated in binding buffer (B-buffer). The formed stem-loop bulge provides the specific capturing sites for ACE, forming ACE/AP-DNA (1) complex, and induced the R CT (charge transfer resistance) increase between the solution-based redox probe [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3−/4− and the electrode surface. The change of Δ R CT (charge transfer resistance change, Δ R CT = R CT(after) - R CT(before) ) is positively related to the ACE level. As a result, the AP-DNA (1) biosensor showed a high sensitivity with the ACE concentration range spanning from 5 nM to 200 mM and a detection limit of 1 nM. The impedimetric AP-DNA (1) sensor also showed good selectivity to ACE over other selected pesticides and exhbited excellent performance in environmental water and orange juice samples analysis, with spiked recoveries in the range of 85.8% to 93.4% in lake water and 83.7% to 89.4% in orange juice. With good performance characteristics of practicality, sensitivity and selectivity, the AP-DNA (1) sensor holds a promising application for the on-site ACE detection."
https://openalex.org/W3117983223,"Background Most studies in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) include patients presenting with and without out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The aim was to compare OHCA and non-OHCA AMICS patients in terms of hemodynamics, management in the intensive care unit (ICU) and outcome. Methods From a cohort corresponding to two thirds of the Danish population, all patients with AMICS admitted from 2010–2017 were individually identified through patient records. Results A total of 1716 AMICS patients were identified of which 723 (42%) presented with OHCA. A total of 1532 patients survived to ICU admission. At the time of ICU arrival, there were no differences between OHCA and non-OHCA AMICS patients in variables commonly used in the AMICS definition (mean arterial pressure (MAP) (72mmHg vs 70mmHg, p = 0.12), lactate (4.3mmol/L vs 4.0mmol/L, p = 0.09) and cardiac output (CO) (4.6L/min vs 4.4L/min, p = 0.30)) were observed. However, during the initial days of ICU treatment OHCA patients had a higher MAP despite a lower need for vasoactive drugs, higher CO, SVO2 and lactate clearance compared to non-OHCA patients (p&lt;0.05 for all). In multivariable analysis outcome was similar but cause of death differed significantly with hypoxic brain injury being leading cause in OHCA and cardiac failure in non-OHCA AMICS patients. Conclusion OHCA and non-OHCA AMICS patients initially have comparable metabolic and hemodynamic profiles, but marked differences develop between the groups during the first days of ICU treatment. Thus, pooling of OHCA and non-OHCA patients as one clinical entity in studies should be done with caution."
https://openalex.org/W3118099865,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene leading to absence of functional dystrophin. Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated exon skipping is a therapeutic approach aimed at restoring the reading frame at the pre-mRNA level, allowing the production of internally truncated partly functional dystrophin proteins. AONs work in a sequence specific manner, which warrants generating humanized mouse models for preclinical tests. To address this, we previously generated the hDMDdel52/ mdx mouse model using transcription activator like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. This model contains mutated murine and human DMD genes, and therefore lacks mouse and human dystrophin resulting in a dystrophic phenotype. It allows preclinical evaluation of AONs inducing the skipping of human DMD exons 51 and 53 and resulting in restoration of dystrophin synthesis. Here, we have further characterized this model genetically and functionally. We discovered that the hDMD and hDMDdel52 transgene is present twice per locus, in a tail-to-tail-orientation. Long-read sequencing revealed a partial deletion of exon 52 (first 25 bp), and a 2.3 kb inversion in intron 51 in both copies. These new findings on the genomic make-up of the hDMD and hDMDdel52 transgene do not affect exon 51 and/or 53 skipping, but do underline the need for extensive genetic analysis of mice generated with genome editing techniques to elucidate additional genetic changes that might have occurred. The hDMDdel52/ mdx mice were also evaluated functionally using kinematic gait analysis. This revealed a clear and highly significant difference in overall gait between hDMDdel52/ mdx mice and C57BL6/J controls. The motor deficit detected in the model confirms its suitability for preclinical testing of exon skipping AONs for human DMD at both the functional and molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W3115858291,"Escherichia coli are one of the commonest bacteria causing bloodstream infection (BSI). The aim of the research was to identify the serotypes, MLST (Multi Locus Sequence Type), virulence genes, and antimicrobial resistance of E . coli isolated from bloodstream infection hospitalized patients in Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital Jakarta. We used whole genome sequencing methods rather than the conventional one, to characterized the serotypes, MLST (Multi Locus Sequence Type), virulence genes, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of E . coli . The composition of E . coli sequence types (ST) was as follows: ST131 ( n = 5), ST38 ( n = 3), ST405 ( n = 3), ST69 ( n = 3), and other STs (ST1057, ST127, ST167, ST3033, ST349, ST40, ST58, ST6630). Enteroaggregative E . coli (EAEC) and Extra-intestinal pathogenic E . coli (ExPEC) groups were found dominant in our samples. Twenty isolates carried virulence genes for host cells adherence and 15 for genes that encourage E . coli immune evasion by enhancing survival in serum. ESBL-genes were present in 17 E . coli isolates. Other AMR genes also encoded resistance against aminoglycosides, quinolones, chloramphenicol, macrolides and trimethoprim. The phylogeny analysis showed that phylogroup D is dominated and followed by phylogroup B2. The E . coli isolated from 22 patients in Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital Jakarta showed high diversity in serotypes, sequence types, virulence genes, and AMR genes. Based on this finding, routinely screening all bacterial isolates in health care facilities can improve clinical significance. By using Whole Genome Sequencing for laboratory-based surveillance can be a valuable early warning system for emerging pathogens and resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3114803710,"Objective To estimate the incubation period of Vietnamese confirmed COVID-19 cases. Methods Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. Results A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89–8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CrI 3.05–5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. Conclusion This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks."
https://openalex.org/W3115988773,"Background The glycocalyx is an extracellular layer lining the lumen of the vascular endothelium, protecting the endothelium from shear stress and atherosclerosis and contributes to coagulation, immune response and microvascular perfusion. The GlycoCheck system estimates glycocalyx’ thickness in vessels under the tongue from perfused boundary region (PBR) and microvascular perfusion (red blood cell (RBC) filling) via a camera and dedicated software. Objectives Evaluating reproducibility and influence of examination conditions on measurements with the GlycoCheck system. Methods Open, randomised, controlled study including 42 healthy smokers investigating day-to-day, side-of-tongue, inter-investigator variance, intraclass-correlation (ICC) and influence of examination conditions at intervals from 0–180 minutes on PBR and RBC filling. Results Mean (SD) age was 24.9 (6.1) years, 52% were male. There was no significant intra- or inter-investigator variation for PBR or RBC filling nor for PBR for side-of-tongue. A small day-to-day variance was found for PBR (0.012μm, p = 0.007) and RBC filling (0.003%, p = 0.005) and side-of-tongue, RBC filling (0.025%, p = 0.009). ICC was modest but highly improved by increasing measurements. Small significant influence of cigarette smoking (from 40–180 minutes), high calorie meal intake and coffee consumption was found. The latter two peaking immediately and tapering off but remained significant up to 180 minutes, highest PBR changes for the three being 0.042μm (p&lt;0.05), 0.183μm (p&lt;0.001) and 0.160μm (p&lt;0.05) respectively. Conclusions Measurements with the GlycoCheck system have a moderate reproducibility, but highly increases with multiple measurements and a small day-to-day variability. Smoking, meal and coffee intake had effects up to 180 minutes, abstinence is recommended at least 180 minutes before GlycoCheck measurements. Future studies should standardise conditions during measurements."

https://openalex.org/W3117279084,"This study evaluated the effect of green propolis extract on the adhesion and biofilm formation of Candida species in dentistry materials. Phytochemical analysis of green propolis extract was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Adhesion was quantified by counting the number of yeast cells adherent to dental material fragments in a Neubauer chamber. Biofilm formation was determined by counting colony-forming units recovered from dental material fragments. The intensity of biofilm adhesion was classified as negative, weak, moderate, strong, or very strong. Fifteen compounds, mainly flavonoids, were identified in green propolis extract. All strains adhered to and formed biofilms on the surfaces of the orthodontic materials studied. On steel and resin, yeast cell adhesion intensities were weak at all incubation times, except for those of Candida parapsilosis and C . tropicalis , which were moderate at 12 h. At 24 and 48 h, C . albicans formed biofilms on steel with moderate adhesion affinities; at 24 and 48 h, C . parapsilosis formed biofilms with very strong affinities. C . tropicalis formed biofilms with strong and very strong affinities at 24 and 48 h, respectively. On resin, all species displayed strong affinity for biofilm formation at 24 and 48 h, except for C . tropicalis , which displayed very strong affinity at only 48 h. Green propolis extract displayed antifungal activity and inhibited both adhesion and biofilm formation at 2.5 μg/mL. This study reinforces the idea that green propolis has antifungal activity and interferes with the virulence of Candida species."
https://openalex.org/W3113921407,"Risk in finance may come from (negative) asset returns whilst payment loss is a typical risk in insurance. It is often that we encounter several risks, in practice, instead of single risk. In this paper, we construct a dependence modeling for financial risks and form a portfolio risk of cryptocurrencies. The marginal risk model is assumed to follow a heteroscedastic process of GARCH(1,1) model. The dependence structure is presented through vine copula. We carry out numerical analysis of cryptocurrencies returns and compute Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecast along with its accuracy assessed through different backtesting methods. It is found that the VaR forecast of returns, by considering vine copula-based dependence among different returns, has higher forecast accuracy than that of returns under prefect dependence assumption as benchmark. In addition, through vine copula, the aggregate VaR forecast has not only lower value but also higher accuracy than the simple sum of individual VaR forecasts. This shows that vine copula-based forecasting procedure not only performs better but also provides a well-diversified portfolio."
https://openalex.org/W3115796370,"The common or weedy seadragon, Phyllopteryx taeniolatus , is an iconic and endemic fish found across temperate reefs of southern Australia. Despite its charismatic nature, few studies have been published, and the extent of population sub-structuring remains poorly resolved. Here we used 7462 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify the extent of population structure in the weedy seadragon along the temperate southeast coast of Australia. We identified four populations, with strong genetic structure ( F ST = 0.562) between them. Both Discriminant Analysis of Principle Components (DAPC) and Bayesian clustering analyses support four distinct genetic clusters (north to south: central New South Wales, southern NSW, Victoria and Tasmania). In addition to these genetic differences, geographical variation in external morphology was recorded, with individuals from New South Wales shaped differently for a few measurements to those from the Mornington Peninsula (Victoria). We posit that these genetic and morphological differences suggest that the Victorian population of P . taeniolatus was historically isolated by the Bassian Isthmus during the last glacial maximum and should now be considered at least a distinct population. We also recorded high levels of genetic structure among the other locations. Based on the genomic and to a degree morphological evidence presented in this study, we recommend that the Victorian population be managed separately from the eastern populations (New South Wales and Tasmania)."
https://openalex.org/W3116583047,"Introduction The use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to systematically quantify adverse events (AE) will assist in the improvement of medical care and the QoL of patients living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between self-reported side effects and other PROs, demographics and laboratory data, and further evaluate the Health Questionnaire (HQ) as a tool for following trends in patient-reported side effects over time in relation to trends in prescribed third agent in ART. Materials and methods The Swedish National Registry InfCareHiv includes an annual self-reported nine-item HQwhich is used in patient-centered HIV care in all Swedish HIV units. In this study, the experience of side effects was addressed. We analyzed 9,476 HQs completed by 4,186 PLWH together with details about their prescribed ART and relevant biomarkers collected during 2011–2017. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and mixed logistic regression. Results The cross-sectional analysis of the HQs showed that the frequency of reported side effects decreased from 32% (2011) to 15% (2017). During the same period, there was a shift in ART prescription from efavirenz (EFV) to dolutegravir (DTG) (positive correlation coefficient r = 0.94, p = 0.0016). Further, PLWH who reported being satisfied with their physical health (OR: 0.47, p = &lt;0.001) or psychological health (OR: 0.70, p = 0.001) were less likely to report side effects than those less satisfied. Conclusions Self-reported side effects were found to have a close relationship with the patient’s ratings of their overall health situation and demonstrated a strong correlation with the sharp decline in use of EFV and rise in use of DTG, with reported side effects being halved. This study supports the feasibility of using the HQ as a tool for longitudinal follow up of trends in PROs."
https://openalex.org/W3117168986,"Little is known about the social structure of male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) after they leave their natal units. While previous studies found no evidence for preferred associations among males, the observation of mass-strandings consisting exclusively of males, suggest that they have strong social bonds. To investigate the social associations among male sperm whales, we used half weight index of association, permutation tests and standardized lagged association rate models on a large photo-identification database collected between 2006 and 2017 in Nemuro Strait, Japan. Our results suggest that while male sperm whales are not as social as females, they do form long term associations, have preferred companionship, and forage in social proximity to each other. The best-fitting model to the standardized lagged association rate showed that associations among males last for at least 2.7 years and as most males leave the area after 2 years, associations may last for longer. Twenty dyads were observed associating over more than 2 years, for a maximum 5 years. One dyad was observed associating on 19 different days and clustered on 7 different days. Male associations may function to enhance foraging or to fend off predators. Such relationships seem to be adapted to a pelagic habitat with uncertain resource availability and predation pressure."

In our experiments, this strategy outperformed the existing augmentation strategies and achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of computer vision tasks. MeshCut is also an easy-to-implement strategy that can efficiently improve the performance of the existing convolutional neural network models by a good margin without careful hand-tuning. The performance of such a strategy can be further improved by incorporating it into other augmentation strategies, which can make MeshCut a promising baseline strategy for future data augmentation algorithms."

Validation tests using collagen V labeled murine and canine muscle tissue demonstrate that MyoSAT can determine mean muscle fiber diameter with an average accuracy of ~92.4%. The software has been tested to work on full muscle cross-sections and works well even under non-optimal staining conditions. The MyoSAT software tool has been implemented as a macro for the freely available ImageJ software platform. This new segmentation tool allows scientists to efficiently analyze large muscle cross-sections for use in research studies and diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3114826540,"The tri-spine horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus , is a threatened species that inhabits coastal areas from South to East Asia. A Conservation management system is urgently required for managing its nursery habitats, i.e., intertidal flats, especially in Japan. Habitat suitability maps are useful in drafting conservation plans; however, they have rarely been prepared for juvenile T . tridentatus . In this study, we examined the possibility of constructing robust habitat suitability models (HSMs) for juveniles based on topographical data acquired using unmanned aerial vehicles and the Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technique. The distribution data of the juveniles in the Tsuyazaki and Imazu intertidal flats from 2017 to 2019 were determined. The data were divided into a training dataset for HSM construction and three test datasets for model evaluation. High accuracy digital surface models were built for each region using the UAV-SfM technique. Normalized elevation was assessed by converting the topographical models that consider the tidal range in each region, and the slope was calculated based on these models. Using the training data, HSMs of the juveniles were constructed with normalized elevation and slope as the predictor variables. The HSMs were evaluated using the test data. The results showed that HSMs exhibited acceptable discrimination performance for each region. Habitat suitability maps were built for the juveniles in each region, and the suitable areas were estimated to be approximately 6.1 ha of the total 19.5 ha in Tuyazaki, and 3.7 ha of the total 7.9 ha area in Imazu. In conclusion, our findings support the usefulness of the UAV-SfM technique in constructing HSMs for juvenile T . tridentatus . The monitoring of suitable habitat areas for the juveniles using the UAV-SfM technique is expected to reduce survey costs, as it can be conducted with fewer investigators over vast intertidal zones within a short period of time."
https://openalex.org/W3117867070,"There are many reports demonstrating that various derivatives of carbon nanoparticles are effective inhibitors of protein aggregation. As surface structural features of nanoparticles play a key role on modulating amyloid fibrillation process, in the present in vitro study, bovine insulin and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) were selected as two model proteins to investigate the reducing effect of graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) on their assembly under amyloidogenic conditions. GOQDs were prepared through direct pyrolysis of citric acid, and the reduction step was carried out using ascorbic acid. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis, X-ray photoelectron, and FT-IR spectroscopies, transmission electron and atomic force microscopies, zeta potential measurement, and Nile red fluorescence assay. They showed the tendencies to modulate the assembly of the proteins through different mechanisms. While GOQDs appeared to have the capacity to inhibit fibrillation, the presence of reduced GOQDs (rGOQDs) was found to promote protein assembly via shortening the nucleation phase, as suggested by ThT fluorescence data. Moreover, the structures produced in the presence of GOQDs or rGOQDs were totally nontoxic. We suggest that surface properties of these particles may be part of the differences in their mechanism(s) of action."
https://openalex.org/W3113732163,"The growing importance of maturity smart cities is currently observed worldwide. The vast majority of smart city models focus on hard domains such as communication and technology infrastructure. Scientists emphasize the need to take into account social capital and the knowledge of residents. The smart cities invest in enhanced openness and transparency data. Mature smart cities use real-time evidences and information to citizens, businesses and visitors. The smart cities are characterized by bottom-down management and civil government. The paper aims to assess the urban smartness of selected European cities based on the ISO 37120 standard. Several research methods including the Multidimensional Statistical Analysis (MSA) were applied. Using the statistical analysis of European smart cities with the implemented ISO 37120 standard, the author tried to fill gaps in the knowledge and to evaluate maturity smart cities. The results of the research have shown that the smart city concept is a viable strategy which contributes to the urban sustainability. The author also found out that urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, the smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects."
https://openalex.org/W3113850563,"Mitophagy, the process that degrades mitochondria selectively through autophagy, is involved in the quality control of mitochondria in cells grown under respiratory conditions. In yeast, the presence of the Atg32 protein on the outer mitochondrial membrane allows for the recognition and targeting of superfluous or damaged mitochondria for degradation. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are crucial for the execution of mitophagy. In our study we monitor the stability of Atg32 protein in the yeast S . cerevisiae and show that Atg32 is degraded under normal growth conditions, upon starvation or rapamycin treatment. The Atg32 turnover can be prevented by inhibition of the proteasome activity, suggesting that Atg32 is also ubiquitinated. Mass spectrometry analysis of purified Atg32 protein revealed that at least lysine residue in position 282 is ubiquitinated. Interestingly, the replacement of lysine 282 with alanine impaired Atg32 degradation only partially in the course of cell growth, suggesting that additional lysine residues on Atg32 might also be ubiquitinated. Our results provide the foundation to further elucidate the physiological significance of Atg32 turnover and the interplay between mitophagy and the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W3114827077,"Cyclocephalini beetles of the genus Cyclocephala (Coleoptera: Melolonthidae: Dynastinae) use flowers of some plants as food, shelter, and mating sites. However, little is known about floral scent chemistry involved in this interaction. Here we show that a sesquiterpene alcohol mediates attraction of Cyclocephala paraguayensis Arrow, on bottle gourd flowers, Lagenaria siceraria (Cucurbitaceae). Both males and females started to aggregate on the flowers at twilight; after that, mating began and remained for the entire night. GC-FID/EAD analysis of the L . siceraria floral scent collected in the field revealed that only the major constituent of the airborne volatiles elicited electroantennographic responses on male and female antennae of C . paraguayensis . This compound was identified as ( 3 S ,6 E) -nerolidol, which was tested in two field trapping trials in Brazil. In the first bioassay, traps baited with nerolidol (mix of isomers) captured significantly more adult C . paraguayensis than control traps. In the second field trial, catches in traps baited with a mixture of isomers or enantiopure nerolidol were significantly higher than captures in control traps, but the treatments did not differ significantly. Analysis from the gut content of adult C . paraguayensis showed the presence of pollen, suggesting that they also use bottle gourd flowers for their nourishment. Taken together, these results suggest that ( 3 S ,6 E) -nerolidol plays an essential role in the reproductive behavior of C . paraguayensis by eliciting aggregation, mating, and feeding."
https://openalex.org/W3114999700,"Over the past 109 years, a Montana intermountain bunchgrass prairie annually became warmer (0.7°C) and drier (27%). The temperature and precipitation trends continued since 1978, as we studied nitrogen availability, annual aboveground primary production (ANPP), plant phenology and species composition. Given the annual increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, ANPP might be expected to decline; however, it increased by 110%, as the period of greatest production (late-May–June) became wetter and cooler, counter to the annual pattern, and this was strongest at lower elevations. Grass production increased by 251%, while dicot production declined by 65%, which increased grass relative abundance by 54%. Summer temperatures increased 12.5% which increased plant senescence by 119% and decreased fall plant regrowth by 68%. More intense summer senescence changed plant species composition in favor of more drought tolerant species. The greater ANPP and summer senescence may increase susceptibility for fire, but fire tolerance of the plant species composition did not change. Invasive plant species increased 108% over the study with annual grasses accounting for &gt;50% of this increase, which further increased summer plant senescence. Therefore, seasonal climate changes at a smaller geographical scale (local), rather than average annual climate changes over a larger geographical scale (regional), may better reflect plant community responses, and this makes ecological forecasting of climate change more difficult."
https://openalex.org/W3115629517,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are valuable tools for describing the occurrence of species and predicting suitable habitats. This study used generalized additive models (GAMs) and MaxEnt models to predict the relative densities of four cetacean species (sei whale Balaeanoptera borealis , southern right whale Eubalaena australis , Peale’s dolphin Lagenorhynchus australis , and Commerson’s dolphin Cephalorhynchus commersonii ) in neritic waters (≤100 m depth) around the Falkland Islands, using boat survey data collected over three seasons (2017–2019). The model predictor variables (PVs) included remotely sensed environmental variables (sea surface temperature, SST, and chlorophyll- a concentration) and static geographical variables (e.g. water depth, distance to shore, slope). The GAM results explained 35 to 41% of the total deviance for sei whale, combined sei whales and unidentified large baleen whales, and Commerson’s dolphins, but only 17% of the deviance for Peale’s dolphins. The MaxEnt models for all species had low to moderate discriminatory power. The relative density of sei whales increased with SST in both models, and their predicted distribution was widespread across the inner shelf which is consistent with the use of Falklands’ waters as a coastal summer feeding ground. Peale’s dolphins and Commerson’s dolphins were largely sympatric across the study area. However, the relative densities of Commerson’s dolphins were generally predicted to be higher in nearshore, semi-enclosed, waters compared with Peale’s dolphins, suggesting some habitat partitioning. The models for southern right whales performed poorly and the results were not considered meaningful, perhaps due to this species exhibiting fewer strong habitat preferences around the Falklands. The modelling results are applicable to marine spatial planning to identify where the occurrence of cetacean species and anthropogenic activities may most overlap. Additionally, the results can inform the process of delineating a potential Key Biodiversity Area for sei whales in the Falkland Islands."
https://openalex.org/W3117548437,"Background Cardiovascular comorbidity anticipates poor prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) and correlates with the systemic atherosclerotic transformation of the arterial vessels. The amount of aortic wall calcification (AWC) can be estimated on low-dose chest CT. We suggest quantification of AWC on the low-dose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID-19. Methods Seventy consecutive patients (46 in center 1, 24 in center 2) with parallel low-dose chest CT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our multi-center, multi-vendor study. The outcome was rated moderate (no hospitalization, hospitalization) and severe (ICU, tracheal intubation, death), the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment. The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendor's software. Results Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID-19. The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID-19, when compared to moderate cases (771.7 mm 3 (Q1 = 49.8 mm 3 , Q3 = 3065.5 mm 3 ) vs. 0 mm 3 (Q1 = 0 mm 3 , Q3 = 57.3 mm 3 )). Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). For AWC &gt; 3000 mm 3 , the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 0.78. If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 0.13, only. Conclusion AWC seems to be an independent biomarker for the prediction of severe progression and intensive care treatment of COVID-19 already at the time of patient admission to the hospital; verification in a larger multi-center, multi-vendor study is desired."
https://openalex.org/W3117914736,"Background The National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) was introduced in Ghana in 2003 to remove financial barriers and to promote equitable access to health care services. Post implementation has been characterized by increases in access and utilization of services among the insured. The uninsured have been less likely to utilize services due to unaffordability of health care costs. In this study, we explored the experiences of the insured members of the NHIS, the uninsured and health professionals in accessing and utilizing health care services under the NHIS in the Hohoe Municipality of Ghana. Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews were held with twenty-five NHIS insured, twenty-five uninsured, and five health care professionals, who were randomly sampled from the Hohoe Municipality to collect data for this study. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Participants identified both enablers or motivating factors and barriers to health care services of the insured and uninsured. The major factors motivating members to access and use health care services were illness severity and symptom persistence. On the other hand, barriers identified included perceived poor service quality and lack of health insurance among the insured and uninsured respectively. Other barriers participants identified included financial constraints, poor attitudes of service providers, and prolonged waiting time. However, the level of care received were reportedly about the same among the insured and uninsured with access to quality health care much dependent on ability to pay, which favors the rich and thereby creating inequity in accessing the needed quality care services. Conclusion The implication of the financial barriers to health care access identified is that the poor and uninsured still suffer from health care access challenges, which questions the efficiency and core goal of the NHIS in removing financial barrier to health care access. This has the potential of undermining Ghana’s ability to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 of universal health coverage by the year 2030."
https://openalex.org/W3118196121,"Random regression models (RRM) are a powerful tool to evaluate genotypic plasticity over time. However, to date, RRM remains unexplored for the analysis of repeated measures in Jatropha curcas breeding. Thus, the present work aimed to apply the random regression technique and study its possibilities for the analysis of repeated measures in Jatropha curcas breeding. To this end, the grain yield (GY) trait of 730 individuals of 73 half-sib families was evaluated over six years. Variance components were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, genetic values were predicted by best linear unbiased prediction and RRM were fitted through Legendre polynomials. The best RRM was selected by Bayesian information criterion. According to the likelihood ratio test, there was genetic variability among the Jatropha curcas progenies; also, the plot and permanent environmental effects were statistically significant. The variance components and heritability estimates increased over time. Non-uniform trajectories were estimated for each progeny throughout the measures, and the area under the trajectories distinguished the progenies with higher performance. High accuracies were found for GY in all harvests, which indicates the high reliability of the results. Moderate to strong genetic correlation was observed across pairs of harvests. The genetic trajectories indicated the existence of genotype × measurement interaction, once the trajectories crossed, which implies a different ranking in each year. Our results suggest that RRM can be efficiently applied for genetic selection in Jatropha curcas breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3113481410,"Background Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a pivotal role in innate immunity; however, its impact on susceptibility to opportunistic infections (OIs) has not yet been examined in a natural history cohort of people living with HIV/AIDS. Methods We used archived samples to analyze the association between MBL expression types and risk of major OIs including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), cryptococcosis, talaromycosis, toxoplasmosis, and tuberculosis in a prospective cohort in Northern Thailand conducted from 1 July 2000 to 15 October 2002 before the national antiretroviral treatment programme was launched. Results Of 632 patients, PCP was diagnosed in 96 (15.2%) patients, including 45 patients with new episodes during the follow-up period (1006.5 person-years). The total history of PCP was significantly associated with low MBL expression type: high/intermediate (81/587, 13.8%), low (10/33, 30.3%) and deficient (5/12, 41.7%) (p = 0.001), whereas the history of other OIs showed no relation with any MBL expression type. Kaplan–Meier analysis (n = 569; log-rank p = 0.011) and Cox’s proportional hazards model revealed that deficient genotype dramatically increased the risk of PCP, which is independent upon sex, age, CD4 count, HIV-1 viral load and hepatitis B and C status (adjusted hazard ratio 7.93, 95% confidence interval 2.19–28.67, p = 0.002). Conclusions Deficiency of MBL expression is a strong risk factor determining the incidence of PCP but not other major OIs."
https://openalex.org/W3114694796,"Background There is a need for empirical studies assessing the psychometric properties of self-reported alcohol use as measures of excessive chronic drinking (ECD) compared to those of objective measures, such as ethyl glucuronide (EtG). Objectives To test the quality of self-reported measures of alcohol use and of risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) to detect ECD assessed by EtG. Methods A total of 227 samples of hair from young Swiss men were used for the determination of EtG. Self-reported measures of alcohol use (previous twelve-month and previous-week alcohol use) and RSOD were assessed. Using EtG (&lt;30 pg/mg) as the gold standard of ECD assessment, the sensitivity and specificity were computed, and the AUROC were compared for alcohol use measures and RSOD. Logistic regressions were used to test the contribution of RSOD to the understanding of ECD after controlling for alcohol use. Results A total of 23.3% of participants presented with ECD. Previous twelve-month alcohol use with a cut-off of &gt;15 drinks per week (sensitivity = 75.5%, specificity = 78.7%) and weekly RSOD (sensitivity = 75.5%, specificity = 70.1%) yielded acceptable psychometric properties. No cut-off for previous-week alcohol use gave acceptable results. In the multivariate logistic regression, after controlling for the previous twelve months of alcohol use, RSOD was still significantly associated with EtG (p = .016). Conclusion Self-reported measures of the previous twelve months of alcohol use and RSOD were acceptable measures of ECD for population-based screening. Self-reported RSOD appeared to be an interesting screening measure, in addition to the previous twelve months of alcohol use, to understand ECD among young people."
https://openalex.org/W3116002426,"Rationale Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most prevalent form of irreversible blindness in the developed world. Aging, inflammation and complement dysregulation affecting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), are considered significant contributors in its pathogenesis and several evidences have linked tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and complement component 3 (C3) with AMD. Acadesine, an analog of AMP and an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator, has been shown to have cytoprotective effects in human clinical trials as well as having anti-inflammatory and anti-vascular exudative effects in animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if acadesine is able to suppress TNF-α induced C3 in RPE cells. Methods ARPE-19 and human primary RPE cells were cultured and allowed to grow to confluence. TNF-α was used for C3 induction in the presence or absence of acadesine. Small molecule inhibitors and siRNA were used to determine if acadesine exerts its effect via the extracellular or intracellular pathway and to evaluate the importance of AMPK for these effects. The expression level of C3 was determined by immunoblot analysis. Results Acadesine suppresses TNF-α induced C3 in a dose dependent manner. When we utilized the adenosine receptor inhibitor dipyridamole (DPY) along with acadesine, acadesine’s effects were abolished, indicating the necessity of acadesine to enter the cell in order to exert it’s action. However, pretreatment with 5-iodotubericidin (5-Iodo), an adenosine kinase (AK) inhibitor, didn’t prevent acadesine from decreasing TNF-α induced C3 expression suggesting that acadesine does not exert its effect through AMP conversion and subsequent activation of AMPK. Consistent with this, knockdown of AMPK α catalytic subunit did not affect the inhibitory effect of acadesine on TNF-α upregulation of C3. Conclusions Our results suggest that acadesine suppresses TNF-α induced C3, likely through an AMPK-independent pathway, and could have potential use in complement over activation diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3116467869,"Introduction Blacks are more likely to live in poverty and be uninsured, and are less likely to undergo revascularization after am acute myocardial infarction compared to whites. The objective of this study was to determine whether Medicaid expansion was associated with a reduction in revascularization disparities in patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction. Methods Retrospective analysis study using data (2010–2018) from hospitals participating in the University Health Systems Consortium, now renamed the Vizient Clinical Database. Comparative interrupted time series analysis was used to compare changes in the use of revascularization therapies (PCI and CABG) in white versus non-Hispanic black patients hospitalized with either ST-segment elevation (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) after Medicaid expansion. Results The analytic cohort included 68,610 STEMI and 127,378 NSTEMI patients. The percentage point decrease in the uninsured rate for STEMIs and NSTEMIs was greater for blacks in expansion states compared to whites in expansion states. For patients with STEMIs, differences in black versus white revascularization rates decreased by 2.09 percentage points per year (95% CI, 0.29–3.88, P = 0.023) in expansion versus non-expansion states after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics. Black patients hospitalized with STEMI in non-expansion states experienced a 7.24 percentage point increase in revascularization rate in 2014 (95% CI, 2.83–11.7, P &lt; 0.001) but did not experience significant annual percentage point increases in the rate of revascularization in subsequent years (1.52; 95% CI, -0.51–3.55, P = 0.14) compared to whites in non-expansion states. Medicaid expansion was not associated with changes in the revascularization rate for either blacks or whites hospitalized with NSTEMIs. Conclusion Medicaid expansion was associated with greater reductions in the number of uninsured blacks compared to uninsured whites. Medicaid expansion was not associated, however, with a reduction in revascularization disparities between black and white patients admitted with acute myocardial infarctions."

We conducted choice experiments in North America and performed latent class analysis of contextual and intrapsychic factors affecting consumers’ preferences for growing foods in cities. Results show that providing tools and guidance are the most important contextual factors affecting community garden participation. The preferences of proponents of growing foods are explained by their high subjective knowledge about growing foods and reasons tied to the benefits of participating in community gardening. Opponents of growing foods at community gardens are characterized by low knowledge. The findings can be used to design policies that promote sustainable food systems in urban areas."

https://openalex.org/W3116883806,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the shape of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) in normal subjects using the en-face images of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The EOM insertion and the direction of the muscle fibers were investigated. Subjects and methods A total of 97 healthy normal subjects (194 eyes) at Okayama University Hospital (age, 47.1±21.5 years; range, 8–79 years) participated in the study. A series of 256 tomographic images of the rectus EOMs were captured using the C-scan function of the AS-OCT (CASIA2, TOMEY Co., Japan), and the images were converted to en-face images in multi-TIFF format. The anterior chamber angle to EOM insertion distance (AID) and the angle of the muscle fibers from the insertion site (angle of muscles) were measured from the images. The correlations of AID and angle of muscles with age and axial length were investigated and evaluated. Results AID and angle of muscles were significantly correlated with age or axial length in some EOMs. The AIDs of medial rectus (MR) ( P = 0.000) and superior rectus (SR) ( P = 0.005) shortened with age. The AIDs of MR ( P = 0.001) and inferior rectus (IR) ( P = 0.035) elongated with axial length, whereas lateral rectus (LR) ( P = 0.013) shortened. The angles of MR ( P = 0.001) and LR ( P = 0.000) were found to have a more downward direction toward the posterior in older subjects. Conclusion En-face images can be created by AS-OCT, and the shape of the EOMs in normal subjects using these image measurements was available. With the ability to assess the EOMs, AID and angle of muscles are expected give useful information for treating and diagnosing strabismus-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3118080444,"A novel approach to recover and identify immune complexes (ICs) was developed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and affinity chromatography on immunoglobulin binding columns (HiTrap Protein G).

This approach was applied to serum with artificially created immune complexes (ICs) comprising vaccine antigen (influenza) and antibody, which led to recovery and identification of influenza peptides within the recovered ICs. This approach was compared with the established method for IC detection and recovery, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, followed by LC MS/MS. Both approaches successfully enabled capture, recovery and characterization of immunoglobulins and influenza antigen(s) in complex with the immunoglobulins. However, PEG precipitation has the advantage of simplicity and is more suited for large scale studies."
https://openalex.org/W3010316612,"Local graph clustering is an important machine learning task that aims to find a well-connected cluster near a set of seed nodes. Recent results have revealed that incorporating higher order information significantly enhances the results of graph clustering techniques. The majority of existing research in this area focuses on spectral graph theory-based techniques. However, an alternative perspective on local graph clustering arises from using max-flow and min-cut on the objectives, which offer distinctly different guarantees. For instance, a new method called capacity releasing diffusion (CRD) was recently proposed and shown to preserve local structure around the seeds better than spectral methods. The method was also the first local clustering technique that is not subject to the quadratic Cheeger inequality by assuming a good cluster near the seed nodes. In this paper, we propose a local hypergraph clustering technique called hypergraph CRD (HG-CRD) by extending the CRD process to cluster based on higher order patterns, encoded as hyperedges of a hypergraph. Moreover, we theoretically show that HG-CRD gives results about a quantity called motif conductance, rather than a biased version used in previous experiments. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real world graphs show that HG-CRD enhances the clustering quality."

https://openalex.org/W3116620530,"Aster spathulifolius Maxim. is belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is distributed only in Korea and Japan. The species is traditionally a medicinal plant and is economically valuable in the ornamental field. On the other hand, the Aster genus, among the Asteraceae family, lacks genomic resources and its molecular functions. Therefore, in our study the high-throughput RNA-sequencing transcriptome data of A . spathulifolius were obtained to identify the molecular functions and its characterization. The de novo assembly produced 98660 uniqueness with an N50 value of 1126bp. Total unigenes were procure to analyze the functional annotation against databases like non-redundant protein, Pfam, Uniprot, KEGG and Gene ontology. The overall percentage of functional annotation to the nr database (43.71%), uniprotein database (49.97%), Pfam (39.94%), KEGG (42.3%) and to GO (30.34%) were observed. Besides, 377 unigenes were found to be involved in the terpenoids pathway and 666 unigenes were actively engaged in other secondary metabolites synthesis, given that 261 unigenes were within phenylpropanoid pathway and 81 unigenes to flavonoid pathway. A further prediction of stress resistance (9,513) unigenes and transcriptional factor (3,027) unigenes in 53 types were vastly regulated in abiotic stress respectively in salt, heat, MAPK and hormone signal transduction pathway. This study discovered 29,692 SSR markers that assist the genotyping approaches and the genetic diversity perspectives. In addition, eight Asteraceae species as in-group together with one out-group were used to construct the phylogenetic relationship by employing their plastid genome and single-copy orthologs genes. Among 50 plastid protein-coding regions, A . spathulifolius is been closely related to A . annua and by 118 single copy orthologs genes, O . taihangensis is more neighboring species to A . spathulifolius . Apart from this, A . spathulifolius and O . taihangensis , genera have recently diverged from other species. Overall, this research gains new insights into transcriptome data by revealing and exposing the secondary metabolite compounds for drug development, the stress-related genes for producing resilient crops and an ortholog gene of A . spathulifolius for the robustness of phylogeny reconstruction among Asteraceae genera."

Materials and methods For reproducibility, CEUS was performed using two different US scanners by two operators in sixteen rat models of HCC. Using perfusion analysis software (VueBox ®), eleven parameters were collected, and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to analyze reproducibility. Then seventeen rat models of HCC were divided into treatment group (n = 8, 30 mg/kg/day sorafenib for five days) and control group (n = 9). CEUS was performed at baseline and 14 days after first treatment, and changes of perfusion parameters were analyzed. Results In treatment group, CEUS perfusion parameters showed a significant change. The peak enhancement (PE, 2.50 x10 3 ±1.68 x10 3 vs 5.55x10 2 ±4.65x10 2 , p = 0.010) and wash-in and wash out AUC ( WiWo AUC, 1.07x10 5 ±6.48 x10 4 vs 2.65x10 4 ±2.25x10 4 , p = 0.009) had significantly decreased two weeks after treatment. On the contrary, control group did not show a significant change, including PE (1.15 x10 3 ±7.53x10 2 vs 9.43x10 2 ± 7.81 x10 2 , p = 0.632) and WiWo AUC (5.09 x10 4 ±3.25x10 4 vs 5.92 x10 4 ±3.20x10 4 , p = 0.646). For reproducibility, the various degrees of inter-scanner reproducibility were from poor to good (ICC: &lt;0.01–0.63). However, inter-operator reproducibility of important perfusion parameters, including Wi AUC, Wo AUC, and WiWo AUC, ranged from fair to excellent (ICC: 0.59–0.93) in a different scanner. Conclusion Our results suggest that CEUS is useful for assessment of the treatment response after targeted therapy and with fair to excellent inter-operator reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3117469729,"CLC-0, a prototype Cl - channel in the CLC family, employs two gating mechanisms that control its ion-permeation pore: fast gating and slow gating. The negatively-charged sidechain of a pore glutamate residue, E166, is known to be the fast gate, and the swinging of this sidechain opens or closes the pore of CLC-0 on the millisecond time scale. The other gating mechanism, slow gating, operates with much slower kinetics in the range of seconds to tens or even hundreds of seconds, and it is thought to involve still-unknown conformational rearrangements. Here, we find that low intracellular pH (pH i ) facilitates the closure of the CLC-0’s slow gate, thus generating current inhibition. The rate of low pH i -induced current inhibition increases with intracellular H + concentration ([H + ] i )—the time constants of current inhibition by low pH i = 4.5, 5.5 and 6 are roughly 0.1, 1 and 10 sec, respectively, at room temperature. In comparison, the time constant of the slow gate closure at pH i = 7.4 at room temperature is hundreds of seconds. The inhibition by low pH i is significantly less prominent in mutants favoring the slow-gate open state (such as C212S and Y512A), further supporting the fact that intracellular H + enhances the slow-gate closure in CLC-0. A fast inhibition by low pH i causes an apparent inverted voltage-dependent activation in the wild-type CLC-0, a behavior similar to those in some channel mutants such as V490W in which only membrane hyperpolarization can open the channel. Interestingly, when V490W mutation is constructed in the background of C212S or Y512A mutation, the inverted voltage-dependent activation disappears. We propose that the slow kinetics of CLC-0’s slow-gate closure may be due to low [H + ] i rather than due to the proposed large conformational change of the channel protein. Our results also suggest that the inverted voltage-dependent opening observed in some mutant channels may result from fast closure of the slow gate by the mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3116167273,"The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of neuromuscular versus classical strength-resistance training as part of a cardiac rehabilitation programme in patients following acute coronary syndrome. The study is designed as a double-blinded, randomised, and controlled clinical trial. Thirty participants suffering from acute coronary syndrome who meet our inclusion criteria will be recruited by a private tertiary hospital. The intervention group will follow 20 sessions of a cardiac rehabilitation programme divided into two parts: aerobic training and neuromuscular strength-resistance training. The control group will complete the same aerobic training as well as a classical strength-resistance training workout programme. The primary outcome of the study will be the mean difference in change from baseline in the Incremental Shuttle Walking Test. The secondary outcomes will be the cardiorespiratory fitness of the patients (assessed by means of the Chester Step Test), lower-limb performance (assessed with the 30-Second Chair Stand Test and Single-Leg Squat Test), lower-limb strength (hip flexor handheld dynamometry), sexual dysfunction assessment (Sex Health Inventory for Men) and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). This work will provide evidence for the effectiveness of a neuromuscular versus a classic strength-training programme in terms of cardiorespiratory fitness, lower-limb performance capacities and quality of life, in cardiac patients. The data obtained could lead to more effective and functional workouts which, in turn, may enhance the speed at which these patients can return to their everyday activities of life and improve the efficiency of their movement patterns and heart responses. Furthermore, patients may find neuromuscular workout routines more motivating and engaging, thus encouraging them to adopt healthier lifestyle patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3117018757,"The programmable sequence specificity of CRISPR has found uses in gene editing and diagnostics. This manuscript describes an additional application of CRISPR through a family of novel DNA enrichment technologies. CAMP (CRISPR Associated Multiplexed PCR) and cCAMP (chimeric CRISPR Associated Multiplexed PCR) utilize the sequence specificity of the Cas9/sgRNA complex to target loci for the ligation of a universal adapter that is used for subsequent amplification. cTRACE (chimeric Targeting Rare Alleles with CRISPR-based Enrichment) also applies this method to use Cas9/sgRNA to target loci for the addition of universal adapters, however it has an additional selection for specific mutations through the use of an allele-specific primer. These three methods can produce multiplex PCR that significantly reduces the optimization required for every target. The methods are also not specific to any downstream analytical platform. We additionally will present a mutation specific enrichment technology that is non-amplification based and leaves the DNA in its native state: TRACE (Targeting Rare Alleles with CRISPR-based Enrichment). TRACE utilizes the Cas9/sgRNA complex to sterically protect the ends of targeted sequences from exonuclease activity which digests both the normal variant as well as any off-target sequences."
