https://openalex.org/W1969769253,"Ensemble recordings of 73 to 148 rat hippocampal neurons were used to predict accurately the animals' movement through their environment, which confirms that the hippocampus transmits an ensemble code for location. In a novel space, the ensemble code was initially less robust but improved rapidly with exploration. During this period, the activity of many inhibitory cells was suppressed, which suggests that new spatial information creates conditions in the hippocampal circuitry that are conducive to the synaptic modification presumed to be involved in learning. Development of a new population code for a novel environment did not substantially alter the code for a familiar one, which suggests that the interference between the two spatial representations was very small. The parallel recording methods outlined here make possible the study of the dynamics of neuronal interactions during unique behavioral events."
https://openalex.org/W2047591593,"The pericentric inversion of chromosome 16 [inv(16)(p13q22)] is a characteristic karyotypic abnormality associated with acute myeloid leukemia, most commonly of the M4Eo subtype. The 16p and 16q breakpoints were pinpointed by yeast artificial chromosome and cosmid cloning, and the two genes involved in this inversion were identified. On 16q the inversion occurred near the end of the coding region for CBF beta, also known as PEBP2 beta, a subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor regulating genes expressed in T cells; on 16p a smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) gene (MYH11) was interrupted. In six of six inv(16) patient samples tested, an in-frame fusion messenger RNA was demonstrated that connected the first 165 amino acids of CBF beta with the tail region of SMMHC. The repeated coiled coil of SMMHC may result in dimerization of the CBF beta fusion protein, which in turn would lead to alterations in transcriptional regulation and contribute to leukemic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1623300751,"Rab proteins comprise a family of small GTPases that serve a regulatory role in membrane traffic. These proteins are in part cytosolic and in part associated with the membranes of specific exocytic and endocytic organelles. Smg p25A/rab3A GDI, a cytosolic protein which inhibits the dissociation of GDP from smg p25A/rab3A, Sec4p, and rab11, has also been found to prevent association of rab3A with the membrane. In this study, we have used Madin-Darby canine kidney cells permeabilized with the bacterial toxin streptolysin O to test the general activity of rab3A GDI in modulating the membrane association of various small GTP-binding proteins. Rab3A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) removed from the membrane all rab proteins we have tested and inhibited the membrane binding of in vitro translated rab proteins. However, rab3A GDI had a limited effect on the membrane association of a mutant rab5 protein which contained a farnesylated cysteine motif. Finally, we found that, although rab3A GDI resides primarily in the cytosol, it is also associated with compartments of the exocytic and endocytic pathways. Since rab3A GDI can modulate the membrane association of various rab proteins, we propose to rename it rab GDI."
https://openalex.org/W2082350440,"Involvement of the cAMP cascade in Drosophila learning and memory is suggested by the aberrant behavioral phenotypes of the mutants dunce (cAMP phosphodiesterase) and rutabaga (adenylyl cyclase). Line DCO581, isolated via an enhancer detector screen for genes preferentially expressed in the mushroom bodies, contains a transposon in the first exon of the catalytic subunit gene (DCO) of protein kinase A (PKA). RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry show that DCO is preferentially expressed in the mushroom bodies. The DCO581 insertion and an independently isolated hypomorphic allele (DCOB10) each produce homozygous lethality and a 40% decrease in PKA activity in heterozygotes. This decrease has mild effects on learning but no effect on memory. However, the 80% reduction in activity obtained by constructing heteroallelic yet viable DCO581/DCOB10 animals results in a dramatic learning and memory deficit. These results suggest that PKA plays a crucial role in the cAMP cascade in mushroom bodies to mediate learning and memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1602750944,"The subcellular trafficking of tracer-tagged GLUT4 between the plasma membranes and low-density microsomes of rat adipose cells has been studied. Cell-surface GLUT4 have been initially tracer-tagged in the insulin-stimulated state with the [3H]bismanose photolabel 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis-(D-mannos- 4-yloxy)-2- propylamine. The half-time for internalization of tracer-tagged GLUT4 when insulin is removed by collagenase treatment is similar to that observed for the decrease in immunodetectable GLUT4 in the plasma membranes and the decrease in glucose transport activity in the intact cells. In contrast, internalization of tracer-tagged GLUT4 also occurs when cells are maintained in the continuous presence of insulin even though the plasma membrane level of immunodetectable GLUT4 and glucose transport activity in the intact cells are unaltered. These data show, for the first time, that insulin has little, if any, effect on the rate constant for GLUT4 endocytosis, but instead, primarily increases the rate constant for exocytosis. Tracer-tagged GLUT4 that is returned to the low-density microsomes can be restimulated with fresh insulin to recycle to the plasma membranes and to a steady-state distribution level that is the same as that observed in cells that are maintained in the continuous presence of insulin. These data suggest that the cells' entire complement of GLUT4 is involved in the recycling process. Following insulin stimulation of adipose cells initially in the basal state, the increase in immunodetectable GLUT4 in the plasma membranes precedes the increase in accessibility of GLUT4 to exofacial 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2- propylamine photolabeling, and this in turn precedes the increase in cellular glucose transport activity. Such time course data suggest that there may be plasma membrane intermediate states in the GLUT4 trafficking pathway. The kinetic properties of GLUT4 translocation and its recycling have been interpreted in terms of a subcellular trafficking model that identifies exocytosis, possibly involving-hypothetical docking and fusion steps, as the critical site of hormone action."

https://openalex.org/W1589947860,"A homopurine/homopyrimidine-like sequence is found 100-150 base pairs upstream of the human c-myc promoter P1. This element, termed the CT-element, has been shown to augment expression from P1, and it serves as a positive transcriptional element when coupled to a heterologous promoter in vivo and in vitro. Synthetic oligonucleotides comprising this element were used to form DNA-protein complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. By using conventional and affinity methods, 61- and 34-kDa proteins were shown to be associated with these complexes. Amino acid sequence analysis and immunological methods have identified these proteins as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) proteins K and A1. Surprisingly, hnRNP protein K binds to the pyrimidine-rich strand of the CT-element in a sequence-specific manner as well as to the double-stranded molecule. Cotransfection of vectors encoding hnRNP protein K in the sense or anti-sense orientations with reporter plasmids driven by wild-type or mutant CT-elements demonstrates that hnRNP protein K augments gene expression in a cis-element-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that hnRNP protein K may play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the human c-myc gene."
https://openalex.org/W1525772448,"Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have determined that Asn68, Asn144, and Asn410 of ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase-1 are N-glycosylated. A fourth consensus N-glycosylation sequence at Asn104 is not glycosylated. Glycosylation of PGH synthase-1 at Asn410 and at either Asn68 or Asn144 was required for expression of both the cyclooxygenase and the peroxidase activities of the enzyme. Inactive PGH synthase-1 glycosylation site mutant proteins do not appear to achieve their native conformations. However, the native enzyme, once in an active conformation, does not appear to require attached carbohydrate for cyclooxygenase or peroxidase activities. N-Glycosylation consensus sequences corresponding to the three glycosylation sites of ovine PGH synthase-1 are conserved in the deduced amino acid sequences of PGH synthases-2. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that there is an additional site of N-glycosylation in murine PGH synthase-2 located at Asn580. This site is N-glycosylated in about 50% of PGH synthase-2 molecules, resulting in two peptide bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (72 and 74 kDa). Glycosylation of PGH synthase-2 is necessary for expression of enzyme activity, but glycosylation of PGH synthase-2 at Asn580 per se does not affect activity. Assuming that the N-glycosylation sites of PGH synthase-1 are on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that the site of tryptic cleavage of ovine PGH synthase-1 (Arg277) is on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, we propose that both the NH2 and COOH termini of PGH synthase-1 are located in the lumen of the ER and that there are two transmembrane domains located between Asn144 and Arg277 and between Arg277 and Asn410, respectively. A similar orientation is predicted for PGH synthase-2."
https://openalex.org/W1654463875,"Of 20 fibroblast cell strains from patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a disease caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I procollagen, three had increased synthesis of BiP (GRP78), an hsp70-related, endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein. All three strains carry unique mutations in pro alpha 1(I) chains which impair type I procollagen chain association. Immunoprecipitation and pulse-chase experiments show that BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein) stably binds pro alpha 1(I) chains in these three cell strains after a brief lag. Ascorbate, which increases procollagen synthesis, increases BiP synthesis and content in these three strains and not in the others. In one of these three strains, BiP content is constitutively elevated prior to ascorbate treatment, and BiP is less inducible. This strain also has relatively high levels of synthesis and content of GRP94, another endoplasmic reticulum-resident stress protein. Pretreating each of the three cell strains to increase their BiP content reduces subsequent ascorbate-mediated BiP induction. BiP synthesis in the 17 other OI strains examined, which had a variety of type I procollagen mutations, was normal. These results suggest that BiP is induced by and binds procollagen with specific types of mutations: ones in the carboxyl-terminal propeptide that interfere with chain association. The recognition by BiP of such procollagen in OI cell strains shows that BiP plays a role in the physiological response to the production of some disease-producing abnormal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1517120488,"Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a recently identified potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells (SMC). To explore whether SMC can also synthesize HB-EGF, cultured fetal human vascular SMC (FHVSMC) were analyzed for the production of HB-EGF mRNA and active growth factor. It was found that in FHVSMC, HB-EGF has the characteristics of an early response gene in that (i) the addition of fresh 10% fetal calf serum to serum-starved FHVSMC led to a rapid and transient rise in HB-EGF mRNA levels with a maximal induction of 12-14-fold occurring within 2-4 h, (ii) the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also elevated HB-EGF mRNA levels rapidly and transiently with a maximal induction of 7-8-fold occurring at 2-4 h, and (iii) cyclohexamide at 40 micrograms/ml markedly increased basal, serum-, and TPA-induced HB-EGF mRNA levels. In addition, HB-EGF mRNA levels were increased 7-11-fold by addition of either HB-EGF itself, platelet-derived growth factor, or basic fibroblast growth factor, all potent SMC mitogens. Besides synthesizing HB-EGF mRNA, FHVSMC were found to release into conditioned medium a bioactive HB-EGF-like protein that cross-reacted with anti-HB-EGF antibody."

B. japonicum USDA135 (a Type I strain) produces modified chitin pentasaccharide molecules with either a terminal N-C16:0- or N-C18:1-glucosamine with and without an O-acetyl group at C-6 and with 2-O-methylfucose linked to C-6 of the reducing N-acetylglucosamine. An additional molecule has N-C16:1-glucosamine and no O-acetyl group. All of these molecules cause root hair deformation on Vicia sativa and Glycine soja. The C18:1-containing molecules were tested and found to induce meristem formation on G. soja. USDA61 (a Type II strain) produces eight additional molecules. Five have a carbamoyl group on the terminal N-acylglucosamine. Six have chitin tetrasaccharide backbones. Three have a terminal N-acyl-N-methylglucosaminosyl residue. In four molecules, the reducing-end N-acetylglucosamine is glycosidically linked to glycerol and has a branching fucosyl, rather than a 2-O-methylfucosyl, residue. One molecule has a terminal N-acylglucosamine that has both acetyl and carbamoyl groups (one each)."
https://openalex.org/W1508783810,"We have investigated the effect of nonenzymatic glycation (fructation) in vitro on the structure and stability of two proteins that are glycated in vivo as a consequence of high endogenous levels of sugar. We find that whereas fructation leads to the structural destabilization of the monomeric gamma-crystallin from the core of the eye lens, it leads to an increase in stability in the multimeric alpha-crystallin of the lens cortex. Thus, while glycated gamma-crystallin shows (a) a longer wavelength of fluorescent emission, indicating a greater exposure of its aromatic side chains to the medium; (b) a reduced secondary structural content; and (c) a more facile denaturation by thermodynamic and chemical means, alpha-crystallin displays the opposite behavior. Furthermore, alpha-crystallin shows an increased tendency toward multimeric aggregation upon fructation. We interpret these differences in the broad context of the effects of neutralization of positive charges on protein structure and stability. Fructation tends to destabilize gamma-crystallin, by effecting a significant reversal in the balance of charges in the protein, at physiological pH. alpha-Crystallin is a multimeric protein whose pI is lower than its pH of optimum stability. Fructation in this case effectively neutralizes the cationic charges and promotes conformational order. This study indicates that although glycation brings about similar changes in the covalent chemical structures of proteins, its influence on the three-dimensional structures of different proteins can be different."
https://openalex.org/W1598192081,"Axial pattern formation is sustained in the mammalian gut epithelium despite rapid and continuous renewal of its four principal cell lineages. The mouse and rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) genes (Fabpl) represent an excellent model for understanding the mechanisms that determine differentiation-dependent, cell lineage-specific, and distinct regional patterns of expression along the crypt-to-villus and duodenal-to-ileal axes of the gut, as well as within the liver acinus. We have used transgenic mice to map cis-acting elements in rat Fabpl that control these patterns of gene expression. Seven transgenes were analyzed, representing sequential deletions of the 5'-nontranscribed domain of Fabpl linked to the human growth hormone (hGH) gene beginning at its nucleotide +3 (L-FABP/hGH+3). Several pedigrees of mice containing each one of the L-FABP/hGH+3 transgenes were examined at the end of their 8th and 20th weeks of postnatal life using immunocytochemical and RNA hybridization analyses. A remarkably compact sequence spanning nucleotides -132 to +21 of Fabpl is sufficient to establish and maintain a distribution of reporter mRNA and protein in villus-associated enterocytes located along the duodenal-to-ileal axis of the gut that resembles the pattern of expression of the endogenous Fabpl gene. L-FABP-132 to +21/hGH+3 is also expressed in surface and pit mucous cells of gastric units and in enterocytes located in the colonic homologs of small intestinal villi, the surface epithelial cuffs. This pattern of transgene expression in the stomach and colon recapitulates that of the intact endogenous donor rat Fabpl but not that of mouse Fabpl, which is silent in these proximal and distal segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of mice containing L-FABP-4000 to +21/hGH+3, L-FABP-1600 to +21/hGH+3, L-FABP-596 to +21/hGH+3, L-FABP-246 to +21/hGH+3, and L-FABP-186 to +21/hGH+3 indicate that Fabpl's cephalocaudal gradient is influenced by cis-acting suppressors of cecal and colonic expression located between nucleotides -4000 and -1600 and by cis-acting activators of cecal and colonic expression located between nucleotides -597 and -351. L-FABP-132 to +21/hGH+3 is precociously activated in proliferating and nonproliferating epithelial cells located in intestinal crypts. The suppressor(s) of L-FABP accumulation in crypt epithelial cell populations are not represented between nucleotides -4000 and +21, indicating that different cis-acting sequences regulate regional and differentiation-dependent patterns of Fabpl expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1925248176,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. To determine the role of LPL in lipoprotein metabolism, we established three transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the human LPL gene; the highest expressor line, which transcribed human LPL mRNA in the heart, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue, was used in this study. The transgenic mice had 5- and 1.7-fold higher LPL activity in adipose tissue and post-heparin plasma, respectively. Plasma triglyceride levels in transgenic mice were 24.2% of that in control mice, and gel filtration chromatography showed that very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides were much reduced in transgenic mice. In the chemical analysis of plasma lipoproteins isolated by ultracentrifugation, we found that LDL particles were cholesterol-rich and HDL2 cholesterol was increased 1.4-fold in transgenic mice as compared to control mice. When we injected 125I-VLDL intravenously into transgenic mice, the clearance of 125I-VLDL and the conversion of VLDL to LDL was markedly enhanced as compared to control mice. Furthermore, the clearance of chylomicrons, estimated by both the fat loading and retinyl palmitate loading tests, was significantly enhanced in transgenic mice. After sucrose feeding, no increase in VLDL was observed in transgenic mice. When fed a high cholesterol diet, the development of hypercholesterolemia was suppressed in transgenic mice. These results suggested that LPL determined not only hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins but also lipolytic conversion, and that overexpression of LPL acted to protect against diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia as well as hypercholesterolemia."

https://openalex.org/W2069352454,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediates many allergic responses. CD23 is a 45-kilodalton type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many cell types. It is a low-affinity IgE receptor and interacts specifically with CD21, thereby modulating IgE production by B lymphocytes in vitro. In an in vivo model of an allergen-specific IgE response, administration of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to recombinant human truncated CD23 resulted in up to 90 percent inhibition of ovalbumin-specific IgE synthesis. Both Fabs and intact IgG inhibited IgE production in vitro and in vivo. Thus, CD23 participates in the regulation of IgE synthesis in vivo and so could be important in allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1498984457,"C1-inhibitor(Mo), a dysfunctional C1-inhibitor molecule produced in two kindred with type II hereditary angioedema, has a mutation at the P10 position (Ala436 to Thr). Like most serpins with hinge region mutations (P14, P12, P10), C1-inhibitor(Mo) loses its inhibitory activity. However, unlike the other hinge region mutations, this mutant is not converted to a substrate. As shown by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy, C1-inhibitor(Mo) exists in both monomeric and multimeric forms. Polymerization probably results from reactive center loop insertion into the A sheet of an adjacent molecule. Native C1-inhibitor(Mo) was shown to have a thermal stability profile intermediate to those of intact and of cleaved normal C1-inhibitor. Native C1-inhibitor(Mo) did not bind to monoclonal antibody KII, which binds only to reactive center-cleaved normal C1-inhibitor. It did, however, react with monoclonal antibody KOK12, which recognizes complexed or cleaved C1-inhibitor but not intact normal C1-inhibitor. Native C1-inhibitor(Mo), therefore, exists in a conformation similar to the complexed form of normal C1-inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1591770389,"One major substrate protein was phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]GTP in membranes of human leukemia (HL-60) cells. The phosphoprotein comigrated with beta-subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) in different gel systems. Upon solubilization of the phosphorylated membranes, the phosphoprotein could be immunoprecipitated by a G protein beta-subunit-specific antiserum. The beta-subunit phosphorylation was transient and was found to be specific for GTP and its analog, guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate. When phosphorylated membranes were incubated with various nucleotides, the bound phosphate was specifically removed by GDP, suggesting that the phosphate can be retransferred onto GDP. Divalent cations, preferentially Mg2+ and Mn2+, were required for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation was stable against treatment with NaOH but sensitive to treatment with heat, HCl, and hydroxylamine. Moreover, treatment of the membranes with the histidine-modifying agent, diethyl pyrocarbonate, resulted in a loss in phosphate incorporation. The data suggest that G protein beta-subunits are involved in a guanine nucleotide-specific enzymatic activity transferring the gamma-phosphate from GTP to GDP, presumably at G protein alpha-subunits, via a phosphohistidine intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1554184488,"The extracellular domain (ECD) of the human interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) receptor was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified to homogeneity. Scatchard analysis of 125I-IFN gamma binding to ECD preparations revealed the formation of a ligand-receptor complex which displayed a Ka of 6.4 +/- 0.9 x 10(8) M-1. Two types of complexes were identified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The stoichiometry of the major ECD-ligand complex was determined by high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. When IFN gamma was incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of ECD, a 190-kDa complex was isolated that contained 2 mol of ECD per 1 mol of IFN gamma. IFN gamma also induced dimerization of IFN gamma receptors expressed at the cell surface as detected by chemically cross-linking receptor bound ligand and analyzing cell lysates by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Finally, labeled forms of ECD bound to cells preincubated at 4 degrees C with excess amounts of IFN gamma indicating that the ligand could associate with more than one receptor molecule in the absence of chemical cross-linking agents. These results demonstrate that IFN gamma effects dimerization of its receptor under physiologic conditions and suggest that IFN gamma receptor dimerization may be an important event in inducing IFN gamma-dependent biologic responses."
https://openalex.org/W1530216928,"Transferrin receptor (TfR) follows complex pathways of transport after endocytosis from the cell surface. Most TfR is transported to endosomes and returns rapidly to the cell surface. In addition, approximately 10% of the internalized receptor recycles through the Golgi complex. To examine the role of microtubules in TfR traffic, K562 cultured human leukemia cells treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules were studied. Nocodazole caused a 50% increase in the level of surface TfR, which was due to a change in receptor dynamics. The endocytosis rate in treated cells was 20% of control, indicating that TfR endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles was slowed, whereas the recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface was unaffected. In contrast, nocodazole had little effect on the transport of TfR from the cell surface to the Golgi complex. Thus, the fragmentation and dispersal of the Golgi complex caused by microtubule depolymerization, which does not interrupt secretory traffic through this organelle, also does not block recycling through the Golgi. The decreased TfR endocytosis via coated vesicles and the increased TfR transport to the Golgi caused by nocodazole suggest that either (i) endocytosis via coated vesicles is not the rate-limiting step in transport to the Golgi or (ii) coated vesicles are not a part of this pathway. Finally, because nocodazole inhibits traffic from endosomes to lysosomes, surface-to-Golgi transport probably does not involve a lysosomal intermediate."

Oxidative stress, ionizing radiation, and other causes can induce the oxidation of thymine to thymine glycol. The presence of thymine glycol is known to have significant biological consequences, and there are repair enzymes for thymine glycol in a wide range of organisms. These studies have been carried out on the DNA duplex of d(C1G2C3A4G5Tg6C7A8G9C10C11) paired with d(G22C21G20T19C18A17G16T15C14G13G12), with Tg indicating thymine glycol. The presence of thymine glycol lowers the thermal stability of duplex DNA.

This structural information is consistent with the biological consequences of thymine glycol in DNA."

C., Valls, L. A., and Stevens, T. H. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 2490-2499; Woolford, C. A., Daniels, L. B., Park, F. J., Jones, E. W., van Arsdell, J. N., and Innis, M. A. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 2500-2510). We constructed a mutant form, lacking the propeptide. This form, still containing the signal peptide, was translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, but the mature region was subsequently completely degraded. When a plasmid encoding only the propeptide after the signal peptide was introduced into a strain producing the mature region, a subpopulation of mature region molecules was rescued from the degradation and gained activity. Increased activity was found when the mature region was co-produced with increased amounts of propeptide, whereas truncated propeptides, lacking residues at its C terminus, were less efficient in the interaction with the mature region. We propose that the mature region of proteinase A cannot fold into its stable active conformation in the absence of the propeptide and that the propeptide can promote folding of the mature region, even when the propeptide and the mature region are not covalently linked."
https://openalex.org/W1598381693,"Abstract Phorbol ester treatment of 32P-labeled retinas results in a light-dependent alteration in the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin. Previously we reported that phorbol myristate acetate causes an increase in the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin in retinas exposed to a brief flash of light, with the greatest increase in phosphorylation observed at lower (< or = 10%) bleach levels (Newton, A. C., and Williams, D. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17725-17728). Here we show that phorbol myristate acetate causes a decrease in the phosphorylation of rhodopsin after exposure to levels of illumination that result in maximal bleaching of the visual receptor. In contrast, no rhodopsin phosphorylation is detected in control or phorbol ester-treated retinas in the dark. Partial proteolysis revealed that phorbol esters alter the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is the major protein whose phosphorylation state is affected significantly by phorbol esters in situ, although a number of rod outer segment cytosolic and membrane proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro. Our data indicate that a major target of protein kinase C in rod outer segments is rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1572598885,"During early stages in their biogenesis, murine class I histocompatibility molecules interact transiently with a molecular chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum designated p88. Using a series of mutant class I heavy chains we mapped the region of the heavy chain that interacts with p88. Domain deletion mutants of the H-2Db and H-2Kb molecules revealed that most of the extracellular portion of the heavy chain and the bulk of the cytoplasmic domain were not required for the association. However, replacement of the transmembrane segment and cytoplasmic domain with a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor from Q7b resulted in a heavy chain that was incapable of interaction with p88. These results suggested that the primary site of interaction with p88 is within a region containing the transmembrane segment and several flanking amino acids of the class I heavy chain. This finding was supported by replacing the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor of the noninteracting Q7b protein with segments of the Db heavy chain containing the putative interaction site and showing that the hybrids were capable of associating with p88. The apparent lack of interaction between segments of p88 and the class I heavy chain that are present within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum was also observed when the association between p88 and the alpha chain of the T cell receptor was examined. The full-length transmembrane alpha chain formed a complex with p88, whereas a soluble variant consisting of most of the luminal portion of the alpha chain exhibited only minimal interaction. Thus, p88 is capable of associating with nascent integral membrane proteins through transmembrane interactions that are unavailable to the major soluble chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum, BiP (GRP78)."
https://openalex.org/W2761165217,"Molecular dynamics simulations on two coupled electronic surfaces are employed to investigate the geminate recombination of nitric oxide to mutants of sperm whale myoglobin. A model for the ground and the excited states is constructed based on experimental data. The crossing between the surfaces is treated using the Landau-Zener formula. The reaction probability and the recombination curves are calculated directly by histogramming the results of an ensemble of trajectories. The experimental trend is reproduced in which the picosecond recombination rate of different mutants increases in the order Phe29 > Leu29 > Val29 > Ala29. Furthermore, in accord with the experiment on significantly longer time scales an opposite trend is obtained, in which the recombination rate for Ala29 is larger than for Phe29. These results are explained by constrained diffusion of the ligand in the heme pocket. The average and the transient volume of the heme pocket is modified by the 29 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1602425018,"IRS-1, a principal substrate of the insulin receptor, is phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a variety of tissues during insulin stimulation. Casein kinase II, an insulin-sensitive serine/threonine kinase, catalyzed the in vitro incorporation of 1 to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of recombinant rat IRS-1. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of IRS-1 phosphorylated by casein kinase II in vitro and IRS-1 immunoprecipitated from intact Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrated multiple common phosphopeptides, suggesting that overexpressed IRS-1 is a substrate for casein kinase II in these cells. Moreover, the common phosphopeptides that appeared to be insulin-sensitive in intact cells comprised 22% of casein kinase II-catalyzed 32P incorporation into IRS-1 in vitro. These data suggest that casein kinase II mediates a portion of the insulin-stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of overexpressed IRS-1 in vivo. By using phosphoamino acid analysis, strong cation exchange analysis, manual Edman degradation, and automated amino acid sequencing, Thr-502 was identified as the major casein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation site in rat IRS-1. Furthermore, Ser-99, an additional site labeled at low yield, appeared to be contained in an insulin-sensitive phosphopeptide. Thus, casein kinase II-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRS-1 may be a component of the intracellular insulin signalling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1504938832,"A Golgi preparation from Spodoptera frugiperda (IPLB-SF-21AE) cells was incubated in the presence of the mannosidase II inhibitor, swainsonine, with the oligosaccharide, M(alpha 1,3)[[M(alpha 1,3)[M(alpha 1,6)]M(alpha 1,6)]] M(beta 1,4)Gn(beta 1,4)Gn (M5Gn2), the preferred substrate for the enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:alpha-3-D-mannoside beta 1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Gn-TI). This resulted in formation of the product, Gn(beta 1,2)M(alpha 1,3)[[M(alpha 1,3)[M(alpha 1,6)]M(alpha 1,6)]]- M(beta 1,4) Gn(beta 1,4)Gn (Gn(I)M5Gn2). A significantly increased (> 4-fold) rate of conversion of M5Gn2 to Gn(I)M5Gn2 occurred with insect cell-derived Golgi preparations that had been infected with a recombinant baculovirus for 66 h, a time at which significant amounts of complex-type oligosaccharides were assembled on a heterologous protein, human plasminogen, expressed in this system. Coupled with previous results (Davidson, D.J., Bretthauer, R.K., and Castellino, F.J. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 9811-9815) that demonstrated the occurrence of virally induced activation of a specific M6-mannosidase in IPLB-SF-21AE cells, it is clear that viral infection of lepidopteran insect cells makes available enzymes that provide and utilize the substrate, M5Gn2-protein. This is a key feature in the explanation of the previous original observations made by this laboratory, that lepidopteran insect cells are capable of assembly of complex-type oligosaccharides on glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1537957359,"We recently cloned human and murine cDNAs that encode CP2, a transcription factor that interacts with the murine alpha-globin promoter. In this report, we exploited our ability to express CP2 in bacteria and eukaryotic cells to further investigate factor activities in vitro and in vivo. CP2 expressed in bacteria was significantly enriched and used in a series of DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic gel shift assays. The results suggest that CP2 binds a hyphenated recognition sequence motif that spans one DNA helix turn. In addition, the enriched bacterial protein activated transcription of alpha-globin promoter templates approximately 3- to 4-fold in vitro. We then tested the effect of elevating CP2 levels 2.5- to 5.5-fold in vivo using both transient and stable transformation assays. When a reporter construct comprised of the intact murine alpha-globin promoter driving the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was introduced into these overexpressing cells, we observed a 3- to 6-fold increase in CAT activity when compared to cells expressing normal levels of CP2. These results define the CP2 factor binding site in more detail and help characterize the activities of the factor in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1519835414,"Factor VIIIa is a heterotrimer of A1,A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits which is labile due to a relatively weak affinity interaction between the A2 subunit and the Me(2+)-linked A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. Previously we speculated that the acidic region at the COOH terminus of the A1 subunit was involved with the A2 subunit retention. This region, delineated by factor VIII residues 337-372, was chemically synthesized. Both the peptide, designated FVIII337-372, and an IgG fraction prepared from rabbit anti-FVIII337-372 antiserum inhibited the reconstitution of factor VIIIa from A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus A2 subunit. A primary component of the inhibitory activity of the peptide was attributed to its acidic nature based upon similar inhibition of factor VIIIa reconstitution using a synthetic polymer of aspartic acid. Trypsin cleaved the peptide at Arg359 and the resultant two fragments were isolated. Inhibitory activity was associated with the NH2-terminal fragment which contained 10 of the 13 acidic residues present in the original peptide. The fluorescence of a dansylated FVIII337-372 was enhanced 2-fold by A2 subunit and this effect was reversed by addition of excess unmodified peptide. The inhibitory activity of FVIII337-372 was attenuated by the presence of Ca2+. Ca2+ also inhibited the reconstitution of factor VIIIa in the absence of peptide and increased the rate and extent of factor VIIIa decay, suggesting that Ca2+ effectively shielded charges important for the intersubunit interactions. The above results support a role for this acidic region in the association of A2 subunit with A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1584719926,"Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.1.12) is a hemoprotein which catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of tryptophan. The reaction is believed to proceed by addition of O2 across the 2,3-bond of the indole ring, followed by decomposition of the resultant dioxetane to give N-formylkynurenine. A primary D2O isotope effect of 4.4 on Vmax/Km was observed at the pH optimum, pH 7.0. This implies that abstraction of the indole proton is at least partially rate-determining. An inverse secondary isotope effect of 0.96 was observed for L-[2-3H]tryptophan at this pH. The secondary isotope effect signals the formation of the C-O bond at C-2. As the rate of proton abstraction increased with increasing pH, the D2O isotope effect decreased to 1.2 at pH 8.5 and the secondary isotope effect increased to 0.92. The rate-determining steps therefore change with increasing pH, and bond formation at C-2 becomes more rate-limiting. The secondary isotope effect did not change significantly with varying O2 concentration so that substrate binding is primarily ordered with O2 binding first. The specificity of the enzyme towards substituted tryptophans shows that substitution of the phenyl ring of the indole is sterically unfavorable. Steric hindrance is highest at the 4- and 7-positions, while the 5- and 6-positions are less sensitive. 6-Fluoro-L-tryptophan was more reactive than tryptophan, and the increased reactivity can be explained by an electronic effect that enhances of the rate of C-O bond formation at C-2."
https://openalex.org/W1678690790,"Hexokinases are comprised of two highly homologous approximately 50-kDa halves and are product-inhibited by glucose-6-P. Four amino acid residues, Ser603, Asp657, Glu708, and Glu742, located in the C-terminal half of the tumor mitochondrial enzyme have been shown to be essential for enzyme function (Arora, K. K., Filburn, C. R., and Pedersen, P. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5359-5362). Here we have assessed also the role of the N-terminal half of the same enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to interact with glucose in the N-terminal half, i.e. Ser155, Asp209, and Glu260, to Ala, have no effect on hexokinase activity. In addition, inhibition by hexose mono- and bisphosphates is unchanged for each of the mutant enzymes. Significantly, the overexpressed N-terminal polypeptide is devoid of catalytic activity but does have the capacity to bind ATP-agarose and be released with ATP and glucose-6-P. In contrast, the overexpressed C-terminal polypeptide is catalytically active and shows the same product inhibition pattern as the complete 100-kDa parent enzyme. These results emphasize that the N-terminal half of tumor hexokinase is essential neither for catalysis nor product modulation. Rather, the N-terminal half may play another role, perhaps in modulation of the ATP/glucose-6-P-dependent binding of the enzyme to tumor mitochondria or by acting as a spacer between the outer mitochondrial membrane and the C-terminal catalytic unit."
https://openalex.org/W1538547420,"The posttranslational modification of proteins by fatty acids has been shown to involve long chain-saturated fatty acids, predominantly palmitate. In the present study, we demonstrated by metabolic labeling of human platelets with [3H]arachidonate and [3H]eicosapentaenoate that these polyunsaturated fatty acids can also become covalently linked to proteins. The extent of binding of arachidonate to proteins was somewhat less than that of palmitate. Arachidonate binding to platelet proteins was not significantly influenced by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. This finding and the high performance liquid chromatography analysis of radiolabeled products removed from proteins by selective cleavage techniques established that arachidonate, and not its metabolic products, was the protein-linked radiolabeled moiety in [3H]arachidonate-labeled platelets. A 7.5-fold higher concentration of unlabeled palmitate competed to a small extent with [3H] arachidonate for protein labeling. Both arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate were bound to proteins almost exclusively through ester linkages. It was further demonstrated that 61 and 66% of total protein-linked arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate, respectively, were bound via thioester bonds. In contrast, 91% of the binding of palmitate to proteins occurred via thioester linkages. As demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, the patterns of palmitoylated and arachidonoylated proteins were similar but not identical, with selected proteins only palmitoylated or only arachidonoylated. [3H]Eicosapentaenoate labeled the same set of proteins as [3H]arachidonate. The fluorographic pattern of 3H-arachidonoylated proteins was not changed by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. The binding of a polyunsaturated fatty acid to a protein in place of a saturated fatty acid could significantly influence the hydrophobic interactions of the protein and, thereby, have important functional implications."
https://openalex.org/W1552106844,"Transcription of the T cell receptor beta gene is up-regulated during T cell activation. We have previously defined the elements within the TcR beta gene enhancer responsible for increased transcription in response to phorbol esters, which mimic part of the pathway for T cell activation. Using a reporter construct (beta E2 x 4) containing four copies of this inducible element, activation was achieved by the addition of phytohemagglutinin or phorbol esters. Activation was observed after 2 h of treatment, was maximal by 8 h, and could be blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Coexpression of v-Ha-Ras-, v-Raf-, and v-Src-activated beta E2 x 4, and constitutively active mutants of protein kinase C also increased transcription from this construct. Calcium ionophore generated signals which synergized with both Ras and protein kinase C. Expression of a truncated Raf protein which has been shown to act in a dominant negative manner, was able to inhibit activation of beta E2 x 4, demonstrating that Raf plays an important role in T cell signaling. A dominant negative mutant of v-Ha-Ras inhibited all methods of activation tested, including transfection with v-Raf. Thus, Ras activity appears to be necessary at more than one point in the transduction of signals from T cell receptor to nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1520881157,"Those hydrophobic residues between Ile298 and Ile315 in transmembrane segment M4 of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, not previously mutated, were mutated systematically in ways that would alter their size or polarity, and functional consequences were measured. Fourteen residues in this sequence are organized as juxtapositions of large, hydrophobic (Val, Leu, Ile) and small (Ala, Gly) residues, and these were altered so that large residues were substituted for small and vice versa. Several mutants exhibited diminished Ca2+ transport, but mutants A305V and A306V lost all Ca2+ transport function. In both cases, the mutants were phosphorylated with ATP in the presence of Ca2+ and with inorganic phosphate only in the absence of Ca2+, indicating that the Ca(2+)-binding sites were intact. Reduced Ca2+ affinity, as measured by Ca2+ dependence of phosphorylation from ATP, was observed for mutant A305V. In both mutants, the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E2P) decayed slowly relative to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the E2P to E2 conformational transition was impaired, slowing the rate of the phosphatase reaction. Double mutants which reversed the order of Val304 and Ala305 and Ala306 and Ile307, resulted in the same phenotype as the single Ala mutations. These results, combined with our previous demonstration that Glu309 is a Ca2+ binding residue, that Pro312 is involved in E1P to E2P conformational changes, and that Gly310 is involved in E2P to E2 conformational changes, support the hypothesis that transmembrane segment M4 plays a key role in the Ca2+ transport function of the Ca(2+)-ATPase through its involvement in both the binding of Ca2+ and the subsequent conformational changes which bring about the translocation of Ca2+ to the lumen of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1565684338,"The biochemical properties of the Escherichia coli UvrA tandem ATPase site mutants in nucleotide excision repair have been studied. In these and earlier studies it was found that ATP binding is required for protein-protein and nucleoprotein association reactions, whereas the dissociation reactions are driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. The self-association of UvrA to form the reactive dimeric species UvrA2 is driven by nucleotide binding, but its dissociation from DNA requires ATP hydrolysis. Similarly, ATP binding drives those allosteric changes in DNA topology during UvrA2-nucleoprotein formation (Oh, E.Y., and Grossman, L. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 8557-8571). The manifestation of the UvrB-associated cryptic ATPase requires UvrA and DNA in a helicase-catalyzed supercoiling reaction. The UvrA2B helicase activity requires ATP hydrolysis by the C-terminal ATPase site of UvrA in addition to UvrB. ATP hydrolysis by the C-terminal ATPase site of UvrA also participates in the localization of damaged sites contributing to the formation of damage-specific high affinity nucleoprotein complexes. The levels of complementation to UV survival by the ATPase site mutants of UvrA (Thiagalingam, S., and Grossman, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11395-11403) correspond to its ability to self-bind and translocate in combination with the UvrB subunit in its search for damaged sites during the preincision mode of nucleotide excision."
https://openalex.org/W1495415811,"We have isolated a glycosyl inositol phospholipid (GIP) anchor-hydrolyzing activity from peanut seeds by a series of column chromatographic steps. The activity has a pH optimum below 6.0, requires calcium, and is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. It cleaves the GIP anchors of solubilized acetylcholinesterase from bovine erythrocytes and variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei. On the other hand, it does not act on membrane-bound GIP-anchored substrate or on inositol-acylated GIP anchor of human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase. The only product released from [3H]myristate-labeled variant surface glycoprotein following treatment with the activity from peanut was 3H-labeled diacylglycerol. Together, these findings identify the activity from peanut seeds as a GIP anchor-hydrolyzing phospholipase C. The enzyme has been found to hydrolyze not only protein GIP anchors but also phosphatidylinositol, whereas it shows no activity against other phospholipids. The water-soluble products of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by peanut phospholipase C were characterized as a mixture of inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate and inositol phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1511343940,"Abstract A water-soluble antigenic polysaccharide of high M(r) associated with the lipopolysaccharide has been isolated from phenol-water extraction of cells of Campylobacter coli serotype O:30. The polysaccharide and oligosaccharide degradation products formed on O-dephosphorylation and by periodate oxidation followed by reduction have been investigated by one- and two-dimensional 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. It is concluded that the antigenic polysaccharide has a teichoic acid-like structure with a poly-Ribitol phosphate, [5-Ribitol-1-P]n, backbone with side chains at O-2 of O-(6-deoxy-beta-D-talo-heptopyranosyl)-(1-->4)-(2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-beta-D- glucopyranosyl) units. The structure is unusual in Gram-negative bacteria and is unique in possessing 6-deoxy-D-talo-heptose as a constituent sugar. Evidence for the relationship of the antigenic polysaccharide to the lipopolysaccharide of low M(r) is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1548556588,"A gel shift assay that distinguishes the aminoacylated form from the deacylated form of tRNAs was used to study the requirements for aminoacylation of Escherichia coli tRNA(Asn) in vivo. tRNA(Asn) derivatives containing single base changes in their anticodons or discriminator bases were constructed, and the extent of in vivo aminoacylation was determined directly. Substitution of U35 with C35 or U36 with C36 abolished aminoacylation of the tRNA. Substitution of G34 with C34 converted tRNA(Asn) into a lysine acceptor. Thus, each of the anticodon nucleotides are important for aminoacylation of tRNA(Asn). Substitution of discriminator base G73 with A73 affected the extent of aminoacylation in vivo indicating that the discriminator base also contributes to aminoacylation of tRNA(Asn)."
https://openalex.org/W1566186402,"The High Mobility Group (HMG) 1 box is a protein motif that mediates DNA binding in a novel family of transcription-regulating proteins. Several members of this family, including the lymphoid-specific proteins TCF-1 and LEF-1 and the mammalian sex-determining factor SRY, carry a single HMG box with affinity for the minor groove of the heptamer motif AACAAAG or variations thereof. To initiate studies on the structural characteristics of the TCF-1 HMG box, we have expressed the 87-amino acid HMG box in milligram quantities in Escherichia coli and purified the soluble peptide to > 95% homogeneity. The peptide bound DNA with the same specificity as the complete protein and was capable of inducing DNA bending. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis revealed the TCF-1 HMG box to adopt an approximately 60% alpha-helix/40% random coil conformation in solution. In the presence of an equimolar amount of double-stranded DNA containing the cognate motif, the CD spectrum changed significantly, implying the induction of a structural modification upon DNA/protein association."
https://openalex.org/W1571657518,"Rat mesangial cells can express both 130-kDa guanylyl cyclase-coupled and 66-kDa non-coupled atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors (ANPR-A and ANPR-C, respectively). Exposure of mesangial cells, grown in 20% fetal calf serum, to 0.1% serum for 24 h increased total ANP receptor density more than 2-fold (Bmax = 87 versus 37 fmol/mg of cell protein) without changing binding affinity (Kd = 94 versus 88 pM). Radioligand binding and cross-linking studies demonstrated that up-regulation of ANP binding after serum deprivation was entirely due to an increase in ANPR-C, with little or no change in ANPR-A. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide blocked up-regulation after serum deprivation. Steady-state ANPR-C mRNA level was increased 15-fold by serum deprivation, as judged by Northern blotting. There was no change in ANPR-A mRNA. Platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol myristate acetate, when added to low serum medium, blocked or reversed the effect of serum deprivation on ANPR-C. We conclude that synthesis and expression of ANPR-C but not ANPR-A is suppressed by serum, platelet-derived growth factor, and phorbol myristate acetate. Suppression of ANPR-C in vivo could contribute to mesangial cell proliferative responses to growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1569161839,"Abstract The vaccinia virus gene encoding the 87-kDa protein that comprises the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (vvR1) was cloned into a bacterial expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. Culture of Escherichia coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmid under standard induction conditions (0.4 mM isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, 37 degrees C) resulted in synthesis of a completely insoluble product. Production of soluble vvR1 was achieved by growing bacteria at low temperature (15 degrees C) during the induction period, initiating induction at low cell density, and using a low concentration (0.05 mM) of the inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, increased production of soluble vvR1 in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant vvR1 was purified from a high salt extract of the E. coli lysate in four steps, the last utilizing an affinity column consisting of the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids of the vvR2 protein linked to an insoluble resin. Using purified recombinant vvR2 to reconstitute active enzyme, we determined that maximizing the rate of CDP reduction required pH 8.0-8.8, 50 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mM ATP. Specific activity of purified vvR1 was 122 nmol/min/mg. Limited proteolysis of the vvR1 protein revealed protease-resistant fragments approximately 30 and 58 kDa in size. To our knowledge, this study represents the first expression, solubilization, and isolation of a recombinant eukaryotic form of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1545806775,"Although pyruvate carboxylase associated with both mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase, it had a higher affinity for the amino-transferase. Furthermore, the aminotransferase enhanced dissociation of malate dehydrogenase from pyruvate carboxylase. Glutamate dehydrogenase did not associate with pyruvate carboxylase alone, but it apparently associated with the pyruvate carboxylase-aminotransferase complex, and malate dehydrogenase associated with the resulting ternary complex. Citrate synthase and other proteins tested did not associate with pyruvate carboxylase. However, citrate synthase associated with the pyruvate carboxylase-malate dehydrogenase complex. Apparently as a consequence of these heteroenzyme interactions, the rate of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was slightly greater when coupled with malate dehydrogenase or both malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase than when coupled with citrate synthase alone. In addition, in the presence of both coupling enzymes, the rate of conversion of pyruvate to citrate was higher than predicted on the basis of the Michaelis-Menten relationship of the two coupling enzymes. Therefore, binding of malate dehydrogenase to pyruvate carboxylase enhances pyruvate carboxylase activity. Association of citrate synthase with the malate dehydrogenase-pyruvate carboxylase binary complex does not alter activation of pyruvate carboxylase but results in citrate synthase being more reactive than free citrate synthase with oxalacetate."

In this catalyzed reaction, the site specificity provided by intermolecular base pair interactions, the formation of chimeric intermediates, the polarity of the nucleotidyl insertion, and its reversibility all resemble such properties in previously proposed models of RNA editing in kinetoplastid mitochondria. These results suggest that RNA editing occurs by way of a concerted, two-step transesterification mechanism and that RNA splicing and RNA editing might be prebiotically related mechanisms; possibly, both evolved from a primordial demand for self-replication."
https://openalex.org/W1602442069,"An analysis of complex kinetic mechanisms is proposed that consists of two steps, (i) building of an kinetic scheme from experimental data other than steady-state kinetics and (ii) numerical simulation and analysis of the kinetics of the proposed scheme in relation to the experimental kinetics. Procedures are introduced to deal with large numbers of enzymatic states and rate constants, and numerical tools are defined to support the analysis of the scheme. The approach is explored by taking the mannitol permease of Escherichia coli as an example. This enzyme catalyzes both the transport of mannitol across the cytoplasmic membrane and the phosphorylation of mannitol. The challenge is to deduce the transport properties of this dimeric enzyme from the phosphorylation kinetics. It is concluded that (i) the steady-state kinetic behavior is largely consistent with the proposed catalytic cycle of the monomeric subunit, (ii) the kinetics provide no direct support but also do not disprove a coupled translocation of the binding sites on the two monomeric subunits. The approach reveals the need for further experimentation where the implementation of experimental results in the scheme conflict with the experimental kinetics and where specific experimental characteristics do not show up in the simulations of the proposed kinetic scheme."
https://openalex.org/W1511546573,"Abstract The steady-state distribution of translating ribosomes on the reovirus s1 and s4 mRNAs was determined using a sensitive primer extension inhibition assay and cDNA clones of the reovirus S1 and S4 genes. Positions of significant ribosome pausing included the sites of initiation and termination of translation, both in vivo in reovirus-infected mouse fibroblast L cells and in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The patterns of ribosome pausing detected in vivo and in vitro were comparable. Ribosomes were far less uniformly distributed along the polycistronic s1 mRNA than they were along the monocistronic s4 mRNA. During reovirus infection, ribosome pausing was detected at the initiation codons of the s1 mRNA sigma 1 and sigma 1ns open reading frames and the s4 mRNA sigma 3 open reading frame, direct evidence that initiation is a slow step of translation in vivo. Quantitative analysis of reovirus mRNA translation in infected and transfected cells suggested that ribosomes paused longer at an AUG initiation codon present in strong context than one present in weak context. These results suggest that the dynamics of ribosome movement during translation of the reovirus s1 and s4 mRNAs are similar in vivo and in vitro and that the relative ribosome pause at an AUG initiation codon may be affected by the flanking nucleotide context of the AUG codon."

The same preparations were also assayed for the microsomal, nonspecific carboxylesterases using o-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate. Non-specific esterase activity surviving radiation could be fit to a single exponential function, the slope of which yielded a target size of 47 +/- 5 kDa (mean +/- S.D., n = 7). Surviving CEH activity assayed at pH 5 could also be fit to a single exponential that yielded a target size of 71 +/- 14 kDa (n = 5). In contrast, the surviving CEH activity assayed at pH 7 was more complex. The data from six experiments were described as the sum of two exponentials, indicating that most of the activity is due to an entity that is three to four times larger and a minor amount to one that is half the size of the pH 5 enzyme. The results are consistent with the suggestion that the acid and neutral microsomal CEH activities are due to distinct enzymes, which are not the nonspecific carboxylesterases. Their sizes also differ from those previously determined for lysosomal acid lipase and other lipases in the liver."
