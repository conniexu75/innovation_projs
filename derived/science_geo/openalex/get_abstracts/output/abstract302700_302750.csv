The first wasp produces a strong daughter bias. The second wasp adjusts the prorportion of sons to the relative level of local mate competition, as predicted by a natural selection model. The results provide a quantitative test of sex ratio theory."
https://openalex.org/W2059504932,"The analytical approaches utilized for evaluating the acceptability of technological risk originate from analogies to financial cost-benefit risk analysis. These analogies appear generally valid for viewing risk from a societal basis, but are not applicable to individual risk assessments. Conflicts arising from these different views of risk assessment provide insights to the origins of individual, intuitive evaluations. Societal risk decisions made under conflict represent political compromises, and the resulting decision process creates substantial conflict costs. The pragmatic use of quantitative risk criteria (safety targets) may be useful in reducing these costs."

These data may thus be combined into a 17-site network. This combination of data provides a comprehensive description of the contemporary patterns of acid precipitation in the northeastern United States."
