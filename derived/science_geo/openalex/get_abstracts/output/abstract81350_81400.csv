https://openalex.org/W1528346173,"Treatment of Friend erythroleukemia cells with the antileukemic drugs 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine leads to rapid, time-dependent, and dose-dependent decrease of DNA methyltransferase activity and synthesis of markedly undermethylated DNA. Since this DNA is at least partially methylated in vivo and serves as an excellent substrate for methylation in vitro, hypomethylation of DNA in analog-treated cells appears to result from the loss of DNA methyltransferase, rather than from an inherent inability of 5-azacytosine- substituted DNA to serve as a methyl acceptor. Inhibition of DNA synthesis blocks the loss of DNA methyltransferase activity while inhibitors of RNA synthesis do not, suggesting that the analogs must be incorporated into DNA to mediate their effect on the enzyme, and that minor substitution of 5-azacytosine for cytosine in DNA (approximately 0.3%) suffices to inactivate more than 95% of the enzyme in the cell. Several lines of evidence link changes in the pattern of DNA modification with differentiation. In this regard, it is significant that 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine act as weak inducers of erythroid differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells in the same concentration range where they affect DNA methyltransferase activity. For differentiation to proceed, the cells must be washed free of the drugs. Less than 24 h later, normal levels of DNA methyltransferase activity are restored and within 48 h, DNA isolated from the cells is not detectably undermethylated. This may in part explain why 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induce differentiation in less than 15% of the population despite their initial profound effect on DNA methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2078803127,"We previously demonstrated that pseudogenes complementary to the small nuclear RNAs U1, U2 and U3 are dispersed and abundant in the human genome. Here we report that three pseudogenes (U1.101, U2.13 and U3.5) are flanked by perfect short direct repeats of 16 to 19 base pairs. In all three pseudogenes. the upstream direct repeat abuts a DNA sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the mature snRNA; in U2.13 and U3.5, the downstream direct repeat immediately follows the truncated 3' end of the snRNA sequence, whereas in U1.101, the downstream direct repeat is separated from the 3, end of the full-length snRNA sequence by a short A-rich region. We consider the direct repeats to be an indication that these three pseudogenes were created by insertion of snRNA information into a new chromosomal locus. To explain why the upstream repeat abuts a DNA sequence complementary to the 5' end of the mature snRNA, we propose a model for insertion that uses a reverse transcript of the snRNA as an intermediate. Furthermore, we note similarities between the structure of all three pseudogene loci and the Alu family of middle repetitive DNA sequences. These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III."

https://openalex.org/W1573312452,"The complete nucleotide sequence of a molecularly cloned, biologically infectious mouse sarcoma viral DNA has been determined. It is 5,833 nucleotides in length. It contains two long terminal repeats, the coding capacity for the entire gag gene, portions of the pol gene and the entire transforming gene. Synthesis of the 538 amino acid-long gag gene-encoded polyprotein Pr62gag initiates 596 nucleotides downstream from the 5â€²-cap nucleotide. The cleavage of gag polyprotein to mature core proteins, NH2-p15-p12-p30-p10-COOH, does not involve the loss of any amino acids. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cellular homolog (c-mosMo) of viral transforming gene v-mosMo has been determined. There are 25 single-base changes in an uninterrupted sequence of 1,157 nucleotides. Of these, 21 changes are in the coding region and they alter only 11 amino acids with respect to v-mosMo gene product. The homologous and nonhomologous regions between mouse sarcoma viral DNA and its progenitor, murine leukemia viral DNA, have been identified. Most deletions appear to have occurred by homologous recombination. A sequence GACC or its inverse GGTC is present in the vicinity of all substitutions and deletions. The codon usage of the gag gene is quite different from that of the c-mosMo gene."

https://openalex.org/W1998544049,"The psoralen derivative 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT) reacts with base-paired regions of RNA and forms interstrand covalent cross-links. Since psoralens permeate living cells, they can be used to probe RNA-tRNA interactions in vivo. We used AMT to investigate whether small nuclear RNAs are base-paired with high molecular weight nuclear RNA in the cell. Intact HeLa cells were treated with AMT, and high molecular weight RNA was isolated under denaturing conditions from nuclei or from subnuclear fractions. The presence of base-paired snRNAs in the high molecular weight nuclear RNA was examined by electrophoresis after photochemical reversal of the cross-links. We found snRNA U3 and 5.8S rRNA to be cross-linked to nucleolar RNA. IN contrast, snRNA U1 was crosslinked to high molecular weight RNA in ribonucleoprotein particles containing hnRNA. The U1 base-paired to hnRNA was identified by its hybridization with a cloned U1 DNA sequence after reversal of the cross-links. These results demonstrate that U1 is base-paired with hnRNA in vivo, suggesting a role in mRNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W2013690255,"Low doses of D-Pro2-D-Phe7-D-Trp9-substance P, as specific substance P antagonist, depressed the scratching and biting behaviors elicited by intrathecal injections of substance P, and cutaneous application of algesic substances. Higher antagonist doses caused hindlimb paralysis. This suggests that substance P is a neurotransmitter for primary nociceptor afferents and may also have an important function in motor control."

https://openalex.org/W1566039965,"Stopped flow experiments were carried out with purified hog thyroid peroxidase (A413 nm/A280 nm = 0.42). It reacted with H2O2 to form Compound I with a rate constant of 7.8 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. Compound I was reduced to Compound II by endogeneous donor with a half-life of 0.36 s. Compound I was reduced by tyrosine directly to the ferric enzyme with a rate constant of 7.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1. Tyrosine could also reduce Compound II to the ferric enzyme with a rate constant of 4.3 X 10(2) M-1 s-1. Methylmercaptoimidazole accelerated the conversion of Compound I to Compound II and reacted with Compound II to form an inactivated form, which was discernible spectrophotometrically. The reactions of thyroid peroxidase with methylmercaptoimidazole quite resembled those of lactoperoxidase, but occurred at higher speeds. The absorption spectra of thyroid peroxidase were similar to those of lactoperoxidase and intestinal peroxidase, but obviously different from those of metmyoglobin, horseradish peroxidase, and chloroperoxidase. Similarity and dissimilarity between thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2048625932,"Systemic treatment of newborn rats with the catecholamine neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine alters the postnatal development of the central norepinephrine neurons. The changes are permanent and consist of denervation of distant nerve terminal projections (for example, cerebral cortex) and hyperinnervation of terminal areas close to the cell bodies (for example, cerebellum). Intracisternal injection of substance P counteracted both of these alterations. The results indicate that substance P may prevent degeneration of damaged norepinephrine neurons during ontogeny or may have a regrowth stimulatory action on these cells. Substance P might prove of use in the prevention or reduction of other types of neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1571583248,"The roles of DNA polymerases alpha and beta in DNA replication and repair synthesis were studied in permeable animal cells, using different agents to induce repair synthesis. DNA polymerase inhibitors were used to investigate which polymerases were involved in repair synthesis and in replication. Polymerase alpha was responsible for replication. On the other hand, both polymerases alpha and beta were involved in DNA repair synthesis; the extent to which each polymerase participated depended primarily on the agent used to damage DNA. Polymerase beta was primarily responsible for repair synthesis induced by bleomycin or neocarzinostatin, whereas polymerase alpha played a more prominent role in repair synthesis indiced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or N-nitrosomethyl urea. More DNA damage was induced by the alkylating agents than by bleomycin or neocarzinostatin, suggesting that the extent of involvement of polymerase alpha or beta in DNA repair synthesis is related to the amount or type of DNA damage. In addition, salt concentration was found to have little or no effect on the results obtained with the DNA polymerase inhibitors. Our findings provide an explanation for conflicting reports in the literature concerning the roles of DNA polymerases alpha and beta in DNA repair."

https://openalex.org/W2054557308,"A metabolically protected analog of substance P, [pGlu5-MePhe8-MeGly9]SP(5-11) (DiMe-C7), was approximately equipotent with substance P in causing increased locomotor activity after microinfusion into the ventral tegmental area of rat brain, but the effects of DiMe-C7 on behavior were considerably prolonged. There was little metabolic degradation of tritiated DiMe-C7 for up to 1 hour after infusion, whereas tritiated substance P was completely degraded within 10 minutes."

https://openalex.org/W1516930947,"Nuclei prepared from HeLa cells by lysis with nonionic detergents or by a nonaqueous fractionation procedure were assayed for enzymatic activities which synthesize, bind, and degrade 2',5'-oligo(A). Isolated nuclei synthesized micromolar concentrations of 2',5'-oligo(A) when incubated with poly(inosinic) . poly(cytidylic) acid. The products of nuclear synthesis were identified with authentic 2',5'-oligo(A) by several criteria. The nuclei synthesized nanomolar amounts of 2',5'-oligo(A) even when incubated without added double-stranded RNA. These oligonucleotides were identified by their pattern of degradation with different nucleases and by a specific competition-binding assay. This assay revealed the presence in nuclei of an activity which binds 2',5'-oligo(A) with an affinity constant similar to that of the cytoplasmic binding activity previously identified with the 2',5'-oligo(A)-dependent endoribonuclease (Nilsen, T. W., Wood, D. L., and Baglioni, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10751-10754). The nuclei had also an activity which degraded 2',5'-oligo(A). Finally, unincubated nuclei isolated by the nonaqueous fractionation procedure contained detectable concentrations of 2',5'-oligo(A). These results show that an activator of the enzyme which synthesize 2',5'-oligo(A) is present in nuclei and that these oligonucleotides are normally formed in HeLa cells, and suggest a possible role for the 2',5'-oligo(A)-activated endoribonuclease in nuclear RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1523402726,"P2 protein is a small basic protein (Mr = 14,820) found in peripheral nerve myelin and spinal cord myelin. There is now overwhelming evidence that P2 protein is the crucial antigen involved in the induction of experimental allergic neuritis, an autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The complete amino acid sequence of rabbit P2 protein was derived by sequence analysis of cyanogen bromide peptides and peptides obtained by proteolysis using Staphylococcus aureus V8 enzyme, trypsin, or clostripain. There are 131 amino acids and an excess of the basic amino acids lysine and arginine; histidine is absent. There are 3 highly hydrophobic regions in the P2 molecule. Probability analysis of the sequence predicts a high degree of beta structure, essentially in agreement with CD data."
https://openalex.org/W1604948930,"In analogy with bleomycin, deglyco-bleomycin B2 has been found to form a stable, diamagnetic complex with Fe(II) and CO. Although the stoichiometry of this complex appeared to be the same as that formed with bleomycin, the geometry of the deglyco-bleomycin complex was fundamentally different, especially as regards orientation of the beta-aminoalanine moiety. In the presence of Fe(II) and O2, deglyco-bleomycin A2 and deglyco-bleomycin B2 were found to release [3H]thymine from radiolabeled PM-2 DNA; when employed at limiting concentrations, deglyco-bleomycin A2 and B2 gave about half as much [3H]thymine release as the respective bleomycins. In view of the spectral evidence (Burger, R. M., Horwitz, S. B., Peisach, J., and Wittenberg, J. B. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12299-12302) that Fe(II) . bleomycin . CO has the same geometry as the complex formed by initial association of bleomycin, Fe(II), and O2, the accumulated data suggest strongly that all metal complexes of bleomycin (derivatives) capable of DNA degradation need not have the same geometry."
https://openalex.org/W1604434491,"Antibodies have been made in rabbits against bovine corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan. Antisera were titered by their ability to agglutinate sheep red blood cells that had been coated with the proteoglycan. Immune antisera, but not preimmune sera, agglutinate coated cells. Uncoated cells are not agglutinated by either serum. Immune agglutination is inhibited by prior incubation of antiserum with the intact corneal proteoglycan fraction or with 2-mercaptoethanol. Immune agglutination is also sharply reduced by the glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate-I (corneal type), and keratan sulfate-II (cartilage type). Desulfated keratan sulfate-I is somewhat less effective as an inhibitor than keratan sulfate-I. In contrast, chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfates, heparin, and hyaluronic acid do not interfere with immune agglutination. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electroblot transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose paper, incubation with antisera, and reaction with 125I-protein A suggest that the proteoglycan fraction contains high molecular weight antigenic components (Mr = approximately 300,000) whose mobility is sharply decreased by incubation with keratanase to that corresponding to molecular weights of approximately 55,000 and 40,000. No antigenic component appears sensitive to reduction by 2-mercaptoethanol. Chondroitinase ABC does not affect the mobility of proteins in the proteoglycan fraction. These results suggest that antibodies against corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan may include some that react with the keratan sulfate chains, as well as those directed against the core protein. Keratan sulfate core proteins of two molecular weights may be present."

https://openalex.org/W1552083546,"Circular dichroism, absorbance temperature profiles, antigenic properties, and interferon-inducing capacity of the nine double-stranded complexes between poly(inosinic acid) and poly(cytidylic acid) [(rI)n . (rC)n] and their deoxy- and 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-analogues were studied. The complexes containing only ribose or 2'-fluororibose chains showed similar CD spectra and thermal stabilities. Anti-(rI)n . (rC)n antibodies were well recognized by the duplexes containing 2'-fluororibose in either one strand. These two duplexes were also efficient interferon inducers. Presence of fluororibose in both strands decreased the affinity of anti-(rI)n . (rC)n antibodies slightly and abolished interferon-inducing activity. All polydeoxyriboside-containing complexes showed CD spectra significantly different from the previous group; they showed also 40- to 100-times lower affinity for the anti-(rI)n . (rC)n antibodies, and did not induce interferon. It is concluded that the structure of (rI)n . (rC)n, an A-type helix, is little perturbed by substitution of one or both strands by 2'-fluororibose. Substitution by deoxyribose in either strand considerably changes the structure of the helices. The hybrids containing poly(deoxycytidylic acid) retain at least some of the structural features of the B-type helix poly(deoxyinosinic acid) . poly(deoxycytidylic acid)."
https://openalex.org/W2163102794,"Submitochondrial particles were labeled with the triplet probe eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) after pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, eosin fluorescence occurred in a single band of Mr approximately 30,000. The labeled band was identified as the ADP/ATP translocator, since EMA binding was completely inhibited by carboxyatractylate. Furthermore, the EMA-labeled polypeptide had the same molecular weight as the purified carboxyatractylate-bound translocator and the purified EMA-labeled translocator. Rotational diffusion of the translocator around the membrane normal in submitochondrial particles was measured by observing flash-induced absorption anisotropy of EMA. The translocator rotates with a time constant which varied from approximately 240 microseconds at 5 degrees C to approximately 100 microseconds at 37 degrees C. However, it is likely that only a fraction of the translocator rotates, the remainder being immobile over the measurement time of 500 microseconds. The mobile fraction of the translocator decreased with decrease in temperature. The observed fluorescence anisotropy of 0.24 indicates that EMA undergoes subnanosecond rapid wobbling in the binding site of the ADP/ATP translocator."
https://openalex.org/W1537721731,"Glycose 1-phosphate moieties are emerging as important structural units of macromolecular substances imparting special biological functions to these molecules. In the present study, beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate moieties are shown to be structural units and immunological determinants of a bacterial glycan. The glycan is a tetraheteroglycan from the cell wall of Streptococcus faecalis, strain N and is composed of glucose, galactose, rhamnose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and phosphate. Several lines of evidence have been obtained for the presence of beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate units in the glycan, including the liberation of glucose by mild acid hydrolysis, the inhibition of the precipitin reaction by beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate, and the formation of levoglucosan on treatment of the glycan with alkali. Work on the preparation of affinity adsorbents for isolating the new types of antibodies directed at the beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate moieties is in progress."

https://openalex.org/W1509276229,"The poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from a gibbon lymphosarcoma cell line, MLA144, known to release Interleukin 2 (IL2) was microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. The incubation medium from injected oocytes stimulated the DNA synthesis of an IL2-dependent cell culture and also maintained its viability. DNA-stimulating activity appeared in the oocyte incubation medium 6 h after injection and continued to accumulate for at least 96 h. Thymidine incorporation by the IL2-dependent cells is proportional to the concentration of oocyte incubation medium added and the IL2 activity produced by the oocytes is proportional to the amount of poly(A)-RNA injected. Incubation medium of oocytes injected with RNA from another T-cell line, 6G1, which does not produce IL2, did not contain DNA-stimulating activity. The same assay also showed that the IL2 mRNA sedimented at 14-16 S in a nondenaturing sucrose gradient. A series of monoclonal antibodies prepared against human IL2 neutralized the DNA-stimulating activity released by the injected oocytes to the same extent as they neutralized human IL2."
https://openalex.org/W1500699811,"Rabbit antiserum produced against rat liver cytochrome H-450 was specific for cytochrome H-450. The antiserum did not react with hemolysate, microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of liver, and tissue extracts from heart, lung skeletal muscle, and testis of rat. With the monospecific antiserum, a rocket immunoelectrophoretic assay method was developed for the quantitation of the antigen with a sensitivity of 25 ng. By using rocket immunoelectrophoresis, the total amounts of the antigen found in liver, kidney, and brain of 20 rats were 33.6, 3.6, and 1.3 mg, respectively. It appears that the antigens in liver, kidney, and brain are immunologically identical. From immunological studies with subcellular fractions of rat liver, the antigen was found only in the postmicrosomal fraction. This indicates that the antigen is not a precursor or a proteolytic product of known cytochromes in mitochondria or microsomes. Therefore, cytochrome H-450 is a unique cytosolic protein found in brain, kidney, and liver."
https://openalex.org/W3022081482,"Regulation of de novo purine biosynthesis was examined in two Chinese hamster cell lines, CHO and V79. De novo purine biosynthesis is inhibited at low concentrations of adenine. The mechanism of inhibition was studied using the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and azacytidine. Although all three inhibitors rapidly inhibited de novo purine biosynthesis in vivo, neither adenine nor the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors could be found to have an effect in vitro on either phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase or amido phosphoribosyltransferase, the first enzymes of the de novo pathway. However, in the presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and azacytidine, there was a 50% or greater reduction in PRPP concentrations. This reduction in PRPP levels is correlated with a 2-fold increase in purine nucleotides in the acid-soluble pool. It is proposed that in the presence of the metabolic inhibitors there is an increase in nucleotide pools due to degradation of RNA, with a resulting feedback inhibition on de novo purine biosynthesis. In contrast to a previous report (Martin, D. W., Jr., and Owen, N. T. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 5477-5485), we could find no evidence for a repressor type mechanism in these cells."
