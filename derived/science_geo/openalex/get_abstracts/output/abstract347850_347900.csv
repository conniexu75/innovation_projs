https://openalex.org/W2089001345,"AU-rich elements (AREs) and microRNA target sites are conserved sequences in messenger RNA (mRNA) 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) that control gene expression posttranscriptionally. Upon cell cycle arrest, the ARE in tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα) mRNA is transformed into a translation activation signal, recruiting Argonaute (AGO) and fragile X mental retardation–related protein 1 (FXR1), factors associated with micro-ribonucleoproteins (microRNPs). We show that human microRNA miR369-3 directs association of these proteins with the AREs to activate translation. Furthermore, we document that two well-studied microRNAs—Let-7 and the synthetic microRNA miRcxcr4—likewise induce translation up-regulation of target mRNAs on cell cycle arrest, yet they repress translation in proliferating cells. Thus, activation is a common function of microRNPs on cell cycle arrest. We propose that translation regulation by microRNPs oscillates between repression and activation during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2116350182,"Calorie restriction extends lifespan and produces a metabolic profile desirable for treating diseases of ageing such as type 2 diabetes. SIRT1, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, is a principal modulator of pathways downstream of calorie restriction that produce beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic SIRT1 activator, mimics the anti-ageing effects of calorie restriction in lower organisms and in mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorates insulin resistance, increases mitochondrial content, and prolongs survival. Here we describe the identification and characterization of small molecule activators of SIRT1 that are structurally unrelated to, and 1,000-fold more potent than, resveratrol. These compounds bind to the SIRT1 enzyme-peptide substrate complex at an allosteric site amino-terminal to the catalytic domain and lower the Michaelis constant for acetylated substrates. In diet-induced obese and genetically obese mice, these compounds improve insulin sensitivity, lower plasma glucose, and increase mitochondrial capacity. In Zucker fa/fa rats, hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies demonstrate that SIRT1 activators improve whole-body glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Thus, SIRT1 activation is a promising new therapeutic approach for treating diseases of ageing such as type 2 diabetes."

However, diamond covered with chemically bound hydrogen shows a pronounced conductivity when exposed to air. This conductivity arises from positive-charge carriers (holes) and is confined to a narrow near-surface region. Although several explanations have been proposed, none has received wide acceptance, and the mechanism remains controversial. Here, we report the interactions of hydrogen-terminated, macroscopic diamonds and diamond powders with aqueous solutions of controlled pH and oxygen concentration. We show that electrons transfer between the diamond and an electrochemical reduction/oxidation couple involving oxygen. This charge transfer is responsible for the surface conductivity and also influences contact angles and zeta potentials. The effect is not confined to diamond and may play a previously unrecognized role in other disparate systems."
https://openalex.org/W2083249373,"Understanding morphogen activity is one of the longest standing problems in developmental biology. Both the duration of exposure to the secreted morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the concentration of Shh are important in determining the fate of cells in the neural tube and in the limb bud. This paper clarifies the relationship between time and concentration in Shh signalling during patterning of the neural tube. Morphogens act in developing tissues to control the spatial arrangement of cellular differentiation1,2. The activity of a morphogen has generally been viewed as a concentration-dependent response to a diffusible signal, but the duration of morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses3. One such example is the morphogen sonic hedgehog (SHH). In the vertebrate central nervous system and limbs, the pattern of cellular differentiation is controlled by both the amount and the time of SHH exposure4,5,6,7. How these two parameters are interpreted at a cellular level has been unclear. Here we provide evidence that changing the concentration or duration of SHH has an equivalent effect on intracellular signalling. Chick neural cells convert different concentrations of SHH into time-limited periods of signal transduction, such that signal duration is proportional to SHH concentration. This depends on the gradual desensitization of cells to ongoing SHH exposure, mediated by the SHH-dependent upregulation of patched 1 (PTC1), a ligand-binding inhibitor of SHH signalling8. Thus, in addition to its role in shaping the SHH gradient8,9,10, PTC1 participates cell autonomously in gradient sensing. Together, the data reveal a novel strategy for morphogen interpretation, in which the temporal adaptation of cells to a morphogen integrates the concentration and duration of a signal to control differential gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2019766891,"Ca2+-triggered synchronous neurotransmitter release is well described, but asynchronous release-in fact, its very existence-remains enigmatic. Here we report a quantitative description of asynchronous neurotransmitter release in calyx-of-Held synapses. We show that deletion of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) in mice selectively abolishes synchronous release, allowing us to study pure asynchronous release in isolation. Using photolysis experiments of caged Ca2+, we demonstrate that asynchronous release displays a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 2 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 44 microM, in contrast to synchronous release, which exhibits a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 5 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 38 muM. Our results reveal that release triggered in wild-type synapses at low Ca2+ concentrations is physiologically asynchronous, and that asynchronous release completely empties the readily releasable pool of vesicles during sustained elevations of Ca2+. We propose a dual-Ca2+-sensor model of release that quantitatively describes the contributions of synchronous and asynchronous release under conditions of different presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2046151919,"Crystal structures of complexes between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain and a fragment of its feedback inhibitor MIG6 reveal an allosteric inhibition mechanism. MIG6 binds the cyclin/CDK-like asymmetric dimer interface of EGFR and blocks formation of the activating dimer. Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR/ERBB1, ERBB2/HER2, ERBB3/HER3 and ERBB4/HER4) are key targets for inhibition in cancer therapy1. Critical for activation is the formation of an asymmetric dimer by the intracellular kinase domains, in which the carboxy-terminal lobe (C lobe) of one kinase domain induces an active conformation in the other2. The cytoplasmic protein MIG6 (mitogen-induced gene 6; also known as ERRFI1) interacts with and inhibits the kinase domains of EGFR and ERBB2 (refs 3–5). Crystal structures of complexes between the EGFR kinase domain and a fragment of MIG6 show that a ∼25-residue epitope (segment 1) from MIG6 binds to the distal surface of the C lobe of the kinase domain. Biochemical and cell-based analyses confirm that this interaction contributes to EGFR inhibition by blocking the formation of the activating dimer interface. A longer MIG6 peptide that is extended C terminal to segment 1 has increased potency as an inhibitor of the activated EGFR kinase domain, while retaining a critical dependence on segment 1. We show that signalling by EGFR molecules that contain constitutively active kinase domains still requires formation of the asymmetric dimer, underscoring the importance of dimer interface blockage in MIG6-mediated inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2067675648,"Dwarf galaxies pose substantial challenges for cosmological models. In particular, current models predict a dark-matter density that is divergent at the center, which is in sharp contrast with observations that indicate a core of roughly constant density. Energy feedback, from supernova explosions and stellar winds, has been proposed as a major factor shaping the evolution of dwarf galaxies. We present detailed cosmological simulations with sufficient resolution both to model the relevant physical processes and to directly assess the impact of stellar feedback on observable properties of dwarf galaxies. We show that feedback drives large-scale, bulk motions of the interstellar gas, resulting in substantial gravitational potential fluctuations and a consequent reduction in the central matter density, bringing the theoretical predictions in agreement with observations."
https://openalex.org/W2058845341,"With the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria, it is imperative to develop new intervention strategies. Current antibiotics typically target pathogen rather than host-specific biochemical pathways. Here we have developed kinase inhibitors that prevent intracellular growth of unrelated pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An RNA interference screen of the human kinome using automated microscopy revealed several host kinases capable of inhibiting intracellular growth of S. typhimurium. The kinases identified clustered in one network around AKT1 (also known as PKB). Inhibitors of AKT1 prevent intracellular growth of various bacteria including MDR-M. tuberculosis. AKT1 is activated by the S. typhimurium effector SopB, which promotes intracellular survival by controlling actin dynamics through PAK4, and phagosome-lysosome fusion through the AS160 (also known as TBC1D4)-RAB14 pathway. AKT1 inhibitors counteract the bacterial manipulation of host signalling processes, thus controlling intracellular growth of bacteria. By using a reciprocal chemical genetics approach, we identified kinase inhibitors with antibiotic properties and their host targets, and we determined host signalling networks that are activated by intracellular bacteria for survival."

It is estimated that up to 17% of the barley yield losses in southern Australia are caused by B toxicity. We found that the expression of AtBOR4, an Arabidopsis paralog of BOR1, the first identified boron transporter gene, generates plants that are tolerant of high B levels. BOR4 is a polarly localized borate exporter that enhances B efflux from roots. The present study is a foundation for the improvement of crop productivity in soils containing excess B, which are distributed in arid areas of the world."
https://openalex.org/W2047833751,"microRNA-155 is an oncogenic microRNA that has been shown to be critical for B-cell maturation and immunoglobulin production in response to antigen. In line with its function in B-cell activation, miR-155, and its primary transcript, B-cell integration cluster (BIC), is induced by B-cell receptor (BCR) cross-linking. Using pharmacological inhibitors in the human B-cell line, Ramos, we show that activation of BIC and miR-155 expression by BCR signaling occurs through the extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways but not the p38 pathway. BCR activation results in the induction of c-Fos, FosB, and JunB, and expression of these are suppressed by ERK and JNK inhibitors. Reporter analysis established a key role for a conserved AP-1 site approximately 40 bp upstream from the site of initiation but not an upstream NF-kappaB site or a putative c-Ets located at the site of initiation. Lastly, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the recruitment of FosB and JunB to the miR-155 promoter following BCR activation. These results identify key determinants of BCR-mediated signaling that lead to the induction of BIC/miR-155."

https://openalex.org/W1531882999,"Heat and mass are injected into the shallow crust when mantle fluids are able to flow through the ductile lower crust. Minimum 3 He/ 4 He ratios in surface fluids from the northern Basin and Range Province, western North America, increase systematically from low crustal values in the east to high mantle values in the west, a regional trend that correlates with the rates of active crustal deformation. The highest ratios occur where the extension and shear strain rates are greatest. The correspondence of helium isotope ratios and active transtensional deformation indicates a deformation-enhanced permeability and that mantle fluids can penetrate the ductile lithosphere, even in regions where there is no substantial magmatism. Superimposed on the regional trend are local, high 3 He/ 4 He anomalies indicating hidden magmatic activity and/or deep fluid production with locally enhanced permeability, identifying zones with high resource potential, particularly for geothermal energy development."
https://openalex.org/W2119303308,"Venus, unlike Earth, is an extremely dry planet although both began with similar masses, distances from the Sun, and presumably water inventories. The high deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the venusian atmosphere relative to Earth's also indicates that the atmosphere has undergone significantly different evolution over the age of the Solar System. Present-day thermal escape is low for all atmospheric species. However, hydrogen can escape by means of collisions with hot atoms from ionospheric photochemistry, and although the bulk of O and O2 are gravitationally bound, heavy ions have been observed to escape through interaction with the solar wind. Nevertheless, their relative rates of escape, spatial distribution, and composition could not be determined from these previous measurements. Here we report Venus Express measurements showing that the dominant escaping ions are O+, He+ and H+. The escaping ions leave Venus through the plasma sheet (a central portion of the plasma wake) and in a boundary layer of the induced magnetosphere. The escape rate ratios are Q(H+)/Q(O+) = 1.9; Q(He+)/Q(O+) = 0.07. The first of these implies that the escape of H+ and O+, together with the estimated escape of neutral hydrogen and oxygen, currently takes place near the stoichometric ratio corresponding to water."

The nearby giant molecular cloud in Orion hosts several thousand stars of ages less than a few million years, many of which are located in or around the famous Orion Nebula, a prominent gas structure illuminated and ionized by a small group of massive stars (the Trapezium). We present x-ray observations obtained with the X-ray Multi-Mirror satellite XMM-Newton, revealing that a hot plasma with a temperature of 1.7 to 2.1 million kelvin pervades the southwest extension of the nebula. The plasma flows into the adjacent interstellar medium. This x-ray outflow phenomenon must be widespread throughout our Galaxy."

https://openalex.org/W2038950263,"Accurate segregation of chromosomes, essential for the stability of the genome, depends on 'bi-orientation'-simultaneous attachment of each individual chromosome to both poles of the mitotic spindle. On bi-oriented chromosomes, kinetochores (macromolecular complexes that attach the chromosome to the spindle) reside on the opposite sides of the chromosome's centromere. In contrast, sister kinetochores shift towards one side of the centromere on 'syntelic' chromosomes that erroneously attach to one spindle pole with both sister kinetochores. Syntelic attachments often arise during spindle assembly and must be corrected to prevent chromosome loss. It is assumed that restoration of proper centromere architecture occurs automatically owing to elastic properties of the centromere. Here we test this assumption by combining laser microsurgery and chemical biology assays in cultured mammalian cells. We find that kinetochores of syntelic chromosomes remain juxtaposed on detachment from spindle microtubules. These findings reveal that correction of syntelic attachments involves an extra step that has previously been overlooked: external forces must be applied to move sister kinetochores to the opposite sides of the centromere. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shape of the centromere is important for spindle assembly, because bipolar spindles do not form in cells lacking centrosomes when multiple chromosomes with juxtaposed kinetochores are present. Thus, proper architecture of the centromere makes an important contribution to achieving high fidelity of chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2080173793,"Fluctuations are important near phase transitions, where they can be difficult to describe quantitatively. Superconductivity in mesoscopic rings is particularly intriguing because the critical temperature is an oscillatory function of magnetic field. There is an exact theory for thermal fluctuations in one-dimensional superconducting rings, which are therefore expected to be an excellent model system. We measured the susceptibility of many rings, one ring at a time, by using a scanning superconducting quantum interference device that can isolate magnetic signals that are seven orders of magnitude smaller than applied flux. We find that the fluctuation theory describes the results and that a single parameter characterizes the ways in which the fluctuations are especially important at magnetic fields where the critical temperature is suppressed."

https://openalex.org/W1968206020,"The procoagulatory serine protease, thrombin, is known to induce invasion and metastasis in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which it promotes tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Because the 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) is a known mediator of tumor cell invasion, we sought to determine whether and how thrombin regulates MMP-9. The thrombin receptor, PAR-1, and MMP-9 are expressed in osteosarcomas, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Stimulation of U2-OS osteosarcoma cells with thrombin and a thrombin receptor-activating peptide induced pro-MMP-9 secretion as well as cell surface-associated pro-MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity. This was paralleled by an increase in MMP-9 mRNA and MMP-9 promoter activity. Thrombin-induced invasion of U2-OS cells through Matrigel was mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and could be inhibited with an MMP-9 antibody. The stimulation of MMP-9 by thrombin was paralleled by an increase in β1-integrin mRNA and β1-integrin expression on the cell surface, which was also mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and was required for invasion. Thrombin activation induced and co-localized both β1-integrin and pro-MMP-9 on the cell membrane, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a protein binding assay.

An increased activation of blood coagulation in cancer patients has been known since 1865, when the French physician Armand Trousseau first reported a higher incidence of clot formation in patients with cancer (1Trousseau A. Clinique Medicale de l′Hotel de Dieu de Paris. 1865; Google Scholar). Thrombin, a trypsin-like serine protease, is the most abundant enzyme associated with blood coagulation. It is activated from its precursor molecule, prothrombin, by the coagulation factor Xa where the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways meet. When activated during vascular injury, thrombin converts the soluble serum factor, fibrinogen, into insoluble fibrin split products, which participate in hemostasis. In addition to its role in homeostasis, thrombin also activates protease-activated receptors (PAR) 3The abbreviations used are: PARprotease-activated receptorsMMPmatrix metalloproteinasePEXhemopexin domainaaamino acid(s)uPAurokinasePI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseTRAPthrombin receptor-activating peptideRTreverse transcriptaseBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salinePEX, domainhemopexin domainMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter.-1, -3, -4, which belong to a group of seven transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. Cleavage of the amino-terminal exodomain of the PARs exposes a new NH2-end of the protein that serves as the tethered ligand for the receptor and leads to activation of the internal G-proteins G12/13, Gq, and Gi.

In the tumor microenvironment, thrombin is either produced by tumor cells or by tumor-associated platelets, which are avid producers of thrombin. PAR-1 is highly expressed in cultured cancer cell lines, in highly metastatic or de-differentiated human tumors, and in tumor metastases (3Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M.

Pretreatment of melanoma cells with low metastatic potential with thrombin increases the number of pulmonary metastasis in mice (6Wojtukiewicz M.Z. Tang D.G. Ciarelli J.J. Nelson K.K. Walz D.A.

Treatment of human and murine cancer cell lines with hirudin, a specific inhibitor of thrombin, inhibits in vivo tumor implantation, spontaneous tumor metastasis, and increases survival in mice (7Hu L.

Moreover, blocking thrombin binding using PAR-1 antibodies reduces metastasis of melanoma cells to the lung (8Shi X. Gangadharan B. Brass L. Ruf W. Mueller B. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 395-402PubMed Google Scholar). A clinical study prospectively examining patients with distal extremity osteosarcoma shows a high correlation between thrombin levels and the occurrence of metastasis. The authors reported that the thrombin concentration in bronchoalveolar fluid at the time of initial diagnosis was 100 times higher in patients who later developed lung metastasis, when compared with patients who evidenced no manifestation of metastatic disease (9Hernández-Rodríguez N.A.

The invasion of tumor cells after stimulation with thrombin requires PAR-1, and can be inhibited with transfection of an antisense thrombin receptor construct. This suggests that the specific binding of thrombin to its receptor is necessary for thrombin-induced invasion (3Even-Ram S. Uziely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Invasion is a tightly regulated process. The early steps are characterized by the attachment of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix, followed by proteolysis. Subsequently, tumor cells coordinate the expression of proteases and adhesion receptors of the integrin family to cross tissue boundaries (11Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Among other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (72- and 92-kDa type IV collagenases) are associated with the malignant phenotype of tumor cells. The most thoroughly understood function of these MMPs is their unique ability to degrade type IV collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix and the basement membrane (13Schmalfeldt B.

In addition to their role in proteolysis, recent studies show that MMPs cooperate with integrins to regulate the delicate balance between adhesion and proteolysis (12Munshi H.G. Stack M.S.

Furthermore, activation ofαvβ3-integrin in MDA-MB 435 cells, or expression of constitutive active αvβ3-integrin in primary human breast cancer cell lines, induces the secretion of active MMP-9, which is required for cellular migration (17Rolli M.

Because local and systemic thrombin production is increased in cancer patients, we were motivated to investigate the mechanism by which thrombin induces invasion. We chose osteosarcomas as our model, because human osteosarcomas are locally highly aggressive tumors, which frequently metastasize and are often associated with thromboembolic events. We show here that human osteosarcomas overexpress the PAR-1 receptor and that in a human osteosarcoma cell line thrombin induces both MMP-9 and β1-integrin expression through a PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Thrombin stimulation leads to the association of β1-integrin and pro-MMP-9, which focuses proteolytic activity on the cell surface to mediate invasion.

The control peptide had the sequence: H-Cys-Arg-Ala-Val-Arg-Ala-Leu-Trp-Arg-Cys-OH as suggested (19Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkilä P. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G.

Patients and Immunohistochemistry—Tissue blocks from 25 patients with distal extremity osteosarcoma who had undergone biopsy at the University of Chicago were selected for the study that was approved by the IRB. The slides were deparaf-finized in xylene and incubated with alcohol before being placed in 3% H2O2/methanol blocking solution, followed by antigen unmasking and incubation with a 1:100 dilution of the antibody against PAR-1 and MMP-9. The slides were stained using the Envision avidin-biotin-free detection system and counterstained with hematoxylin. Corresponding negative controls were prepared using non-immune rabbit serum. The staining intensity was evaluated employing the same scoring system (20Lengyel E. Prechtel D. Resau J.H. Gauger K. Welk A. Lindemann K. Salanti G. Richter T. Knudsen B.S. Vande Woude G.F. Harbeck N. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) that is currently in clinical use to grade Her2/neu staining: negative (-), weak (+), intermediate (++), and strongly positive (+++). Trichrome staining to differentiate connective tissue elements was conducted as described previously (21Jones L. Bancroft J.D. Gamble M. Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques. Churchill Livingstone, New York2002: 152-160Google Scholar). The staining was evaluated by a pathologist with special expertise in orthopedic pathology (A. M.). MMP Activity Measurement—Gelatinolytic zymography was performed as described (22Lengyel E. Gum R. Juarez J. Clayman G. Seiki M. Sato H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 963-967PubMed Google Scholar). Serum-starved cultured media was concentrated (Microcon YM-10, Millipore, Bedford, MA), denatured in the absence of reducing agent, and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. Gels were incubated in the presence of 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 2 h and subsequently at 37 °C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue, and proteolysis was detected as a white zone against a dark field. Cell surface-associated MMP activity was measured using quenched fluorescent gelatin (20 μg/96-well DQ gelatin fluorescein conjugate, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in reaction buffer (5 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) (23Ramos-DeSimone N. Moll U. Quigley J.P. French D.L. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test the inhibitory effect of anti-MMP-9 antibody (Calbiochem 6-6B, 4 μg/ml), recombinant human 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate-activated MMP-2 (60 ng) and/or aminophenylmercuric acetate-activated MMP-9 (80 ng) were preincubated with the MMP-9 antibody or a mouse IgG (4 μg/ml) for 1 h before measuring cleaved fluorescent gelatin over 3 h. For the cell based studies, 25,000 cells were plated in a 96-well plate in 10% fetal calf serum. 12 h before the experiment the cells were switched to serum-free medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Substrate was added and fluorescence measured at the indicated time points using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 530 nm). When thrombin, antibodies, inhibitors, or the peptide were tested, they were preincubated for 1 h before addition of the fluorogenic substrate. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001 (50 μm, Chemicon) and human recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 protein (25 μm, Chemicon) were used as inhibitors. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from both cell lines and tissues. RNA content was measured and the absence of DNA contamination confirmed by a reaction that was run without reverse transcriptase. RNA was transcribed into cDNA by using the 2-Step PCR Kit from Promega (Madison WI), the RT mixture was 4 μg of random hexamers, 40 nm dNTPs, 4 μl of 10 × Taq polymerase buffer, 50 nm MgCl2, 12 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 1 unit of RNasin and RNA to a total volume of 40 μl. 8 μl of sample cDNA and 10 pmol of primer were added to the 2× Master Mix from the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and nuclease-free H2O to a total volume of 25 μl. The MMP-9 and GAPDH mRNA was extracted from U2-OS cells and stimulated with the indicated doses of thrombin for 24 h followed by the RT step. MMP-9 and GAPDH TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to detect cycle numbers in cDNA samples. All samples were normalized to GAPDH TaqMan probes. The β1-integrin and β-actin mRNA was amplified using the SYBR Green fluorescence-based detection method with the sequence-specific primer: β1-integrin forward primer, AGGAATGTTACACGGCTGCT; reverse primer, ACCAAGTTTCCCATCTCCAG. Reactions were run in duplicates on a Stratagene Sequence Detection System (Stratagene Mx-3005) using the following PCR conditions: one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min followed by a 10-min activation of the polymerase at 95 °C. Subsequently 40 cycles were performed at 95 °C for 15 s and 54 °C for 60 s. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated with the Stratagene MX-3005 software. Data were analyzed according to the comparative Ct method (24Pfaffl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). The median Ct value was determined and data expressed as -fold change of relative mRNA expression. To detect the human thrombin receptor, PAR-1, in human osteosarcoma tumor tissue the following primers were used: forward primer, CCCTGCTCGAAGGCTACTAT and reverse primer, CTACATGCTGAACGTATGGACG. After amplification the PCR product was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were starved in serum-free medium before stimulation with thrombin (4 units/ml) for 45 min. After lysis using ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma at a 1:100 dilution), 250 μg of protein was added to 50 μl of anti-mouse IgG beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). After centrifugation the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg/100 μl of primary antibody against β1-integrin (P5D2), MMP-9 (6-6B), or as control normal mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 1 h, and then rotated with 50 μl of anti-mouse IgG beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 3 times with RIPA lysis buffer and protein was eluted with 50 μl of 2 × sample buffer (0.5 m Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 12% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and treated with Enhancer solution (eBiosience, San Diego, CA). Blocking was done for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk and 1% BSA, followed by incubation with the primary antibody overnight and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Flow Cytometry—Cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS were incubated with the indicated primary monoclonal antibodies (1:250) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with phosphatidylethanolamine-labeled secondary antibody. After washing, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 1% BSA/PBS. Isotypic mouse IgG was used as a negative control. Surface expression was measured with FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and CellQuest software. Transfections—U2-OS cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (25Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23007-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs fused to the wild type or deleted fragments of the human MMP-9 promoter (26Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To correct for transfection efficiencies all transient transfections were performed in the presence of a β-galactosidase expression vector. After normalization, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured by incubating cell lysates at 37 °C with 4 μm [14C]chloramphenicol and 1 mg/ml acetyl coenzyme A. The mixture was separated by extraction with ethyl acetate and acetylated products separated on thin layer chromatography plates using chloroform/methanol as the mobile phase. Reactions were visualized by autoradiography and radioactivity quantified using a PhosphorImager. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides coated with type I collagen (BD Biosciences), allowed to attach for 6 h, and then cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h. After incubation, cells were stimulated with 2 units/ml thrombin for 30 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and stained with rabbit anti-human MMP-9 (Calbiochem, polyclonal, 1:50) and mouse anti-human β1-integrin (P5D2, 1:50) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 555-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, 1:1000) and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The samples were observed using a Leica SP2 A OBS Laser Scanning Confocal microscope (Leica, Exton, PA). Expression and Purification of the MMP-9 Hemopexin (PEX) Domain—The coding sequence for the hemopexin domain (amino acids 514-707 of human full-length MMP-9) was amplified using PfuTurbo polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and cloned into the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen, San Diego, CA) via NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. Origami (DE3) cells from Novagen were transformed with the PEX construct, grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The His-tagged protein was expressed overnight at 22 °C. Cells were lysed using an Emulsiflex-C5 from Avestin (Ontario, Canada) and the soluble protein was purified from the crude cell extract using Talon resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and subsequent size exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75 from GE Healthcare). Protein purity was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, Western blot with Penta-His antibody from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), and MALDI-TOF. Purified Protein Binding Assay—Nunc Maxisorp Immunoplates (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with 10 μm MMP-9 PEX protein or BSA as reference in PBS at pH 7 at 4 °C overnight (27Wei Y. Czekay R.P. Robillard L. Kugler M. Zhang F. Kim K. Xiong J. Humphries M. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After blocking for 1 h with 1% BSA at room temperature the plate was incubated with serial dilutions of α5β1-integrin-Fc fusion protein in PBS. After washing 3 times with 300 μl of PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 bound fusion protein was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-A (Amersham Biosciences) and 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA from Pierce. Absorption from wells coated with BSA was subtracted and the average of the measurements was plotted against the subjected protein concentration. Each measurement was performed in triplicates. In Vitro Invasion Assay—Cell invasion was assayed by determining the ability of cells to invade through a synthetic basement membrane (Matrigel, BD Biosciences). Briefly, polycarbonate filters (8 μm pore size, 24-well insert) were coated with 100 μl of Matrigel (0.25 μg/μl) diluted with cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed in a modified Boyden chamber (28Sawada K. Radjabi A.R. Shinomiya N. Kistner E. Kenny H.A. Becker A.R. Turkyilmaz M.A. Salgia R. Yamada S.D. Vande Woude G.F. Tretiakova M.S. Lengyel E. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1670-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). U2-OS cells (5 × 104/well) were plated in the top chamber with serum-free media and incubated with serum containing media in the bottom chamber. For the functional inhibition, anti-MMP-9 (6-6B, 2 μg/ml) and anti-β1 (P5D2, 1 and 10 μg/ml) antibodies were used. To inhibit in vitro invasion, antibodies against uPA (394, American Diagnostica, 10 μg/ml), against the hemopexin domain of MMP-9 (2C3, Abcam, 2 μg/ml), and against integrin-αvβ5 (P1F6, Chemicon, 1 and 10 μg/ml) were used. All antibodies were added in the top chamber. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and allowed to invade through the Matrigel barrier for 24 h. After incubation, filters were fixed and stained with Giemsa solution. Non-invading cells were removed using a cotton swab and invading cells on the underside of the filter were enumerated using an inverted microscope. Experiments were performed in triplicates with a minimum of 10 grids (40× magnification) per filter counted. Human Osteosarcomas Express the PAR-1 Receptor—As a first step to understanding the role PAR-1 plays in the invasion of human osteosarcomas, thrombin receptor expression was characterized immunohistochemically in biopsies from 25 different patients (median age 30) with distal extremity osteosarcomas. In general, the osteosarcoma cells grew in two different patterns (Fig. 1A), either as solid nests (open arrow) or as single malignant tumor cells within a cartilaginous matrix (black closed arrow). As seen in Fig. 1A, all the tumor cells show uniform reactivity with the PAR-1 antibody, whereas incubation of a serial section of the same tumor with an isotypic control IgG shows no reaction (Fig. 1B). Trichrome staining to differentiate connective tissue elements results in blue staining of the chondroid matrix (Fig. 1C, red arrow) and red staining of the collagenous matrix in which tumor cells are embedded (Fig. 1C, yellow arrow). Twenty-four of the 25 osteosarcomas expressed PAR-1, with 14 tumors showing high expression of the receptor (++ or +++ staining) (Fig. 1D). Total RNA was extracted from fresh tissue snap frozen at biopsy from two patients. Both tumors expressed PAR-1 mRNA, as did the human osteosarcoma cell line, U2-OS (Fig. 1E). Thrombin Stimulation of MMP-9 Expression and Invasion—To determine whether thrombin induces type IV collagenases, which were previously shown to be expressed in osteosarcomas (29Ferrari C. Benassi M.S. Ponticelli F. Gamberi G. Ragazzini P. Pazzaglia L. Balladelli A. Bertoni F. Picci P. Acta Orthop. Scand. 2004; 75: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), U2-OS cells, which secrete only a small amount of MMP-9 and MMP-2, were stimulated with increasing amounts of thrombin and zymography was performed. A dose-dependent increase in a gelatinolytic band identical in size to pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) was evident in conditioned media from U2-OS cells treated with thrombin. No active MMP-9 was detected (88 kDa). In contrast, the activity of a metalloproteinase, whose size is identical to the 72-kDa MMP-2 (30Huhtala P. Chow L. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was only detected as a faint band and was therefore considered to be unaffected by thrombin stimulation (Fig. 2A, left panel). This increase in MMP-9 was not due to an increased growth rate, because w"
https://openalex.org/W2083148444,"Immature thymic T cells receive signals through the T cell receptor which determine whether they undergo positive or negative selection. Calcineurin/NFAT signalling in preselection thymocytes produces a temporal window with enhanced signalling sensitivity paving the way for positive selection. At critical times in development, cells are able to convert graded signals into discrete developmental outcomes; however, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. During thymocyte development, cell fate is determined by signals originating from the αβ T-cell receptor. Low-affinity/avidity interactions between the T-cell receptor and peptide–MHC complexes direct differentiation to the single-positive stage (positive selection), whereas high-affinity/avidity interactions induce death by apoptosis (negative selection)1,2. Here we show that mice deficient in both calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c2/c3 lack a population of preselection thymocytes with enhanced ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (Raf–MEK–ERK) pathway, and fail to undergo positive selection. This defect can be partially rescued with constitutively active Raf, indicating that calcineurin controls MAPK signalling. Analysis of mice deficient in both Bim (which is required for negative selection) and calcineurin revealed that calcineurin-induced ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) sensitization is required for differentiation in response to ‘weak’ positive selecting signals but not in response to ‘strong’ negative selecting signals (which normally induce apoptosis). These results indicate that early calcineurin/NFAT signalling produces a developmental period of ERK hypersensitivity, allowing very weak signals to induce positive selection. This mechanism might be generally useful in the discrimination of graded signals that induce different cell fates."

The major structural difference between insulin and the IGFs is that the IGFs are single chain polypeptides containing A-, B-, C-, and D-domains, whereas the insulin molecule contains separate A- and B-chains. The C-domain of IGF-I is critical for high affinity binding to the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, and lack of a C-domain largely explains the low affinity of insulin for the insulin-like growth factor I receptor. It is less clear why the IGFs have lower affinity for the insulin receptor. In this study, 24 insulin analogues and four IGF analogues were expressed and analyzed to explore the role of amino acid differences in the A- and B-domains between insulin and the IGFs in binding affinity for the insulin receptor. Using the information obtained from single substituted analogues, four multiple substituted analogues were produced. A “quadruple insulin” analogue ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrB5, GlnB16]Ins) showed affinity as IGF-I for the insulin receptor, and a “sextuple insulin” analogue ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrA18, ThrB5, ThrB14, GlnB16]Ins) showed an affinity close to that of IGF-II for the insulin receptor, whereas a “quadruple IGF-I” analogue ([His4, Tyr15, Thr49, Ile51]IGF-I) and a “sextuple IGF-II” analogue ([His7, Ala16, Tyr18, Thr48, Ile50, Asn58]IGF-II) showed affinities similar to that of insulin for the insulin receptor.

The biologically active insulin molecule is composed of two polypeptide chains: the A- and B-chain (Fig. 1), which are generated by cleavage from a single chain proinsulin. The A-chain consists of 21 amino acids arranged in two antiparallel α-helices (A1–A8 and A13–A20); the B-chain is composed of 30 amino acids arranged in a central α-helix (B9–B19) with both N and C termini extensions. The two chains are connected by two disulfide bridges (A7-B7 and A20-B19). An additional disulfide bridge is located between residues A6 and A11 in the A-chain (4Baker E.N. Blundell T.L.

The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase family consists of the insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and the orphan insulin receptor-related receptor. The members of the insulin receptor family are composed of two receptor halves, each comprising an extracellular α-subunit and a transmembrane β-subunit, linked by a disulfide bridge. The receptors exist as α2β2 covalent disulfide-linked dimers even when no ligand is bound. The IR and the IGF-IR have sequence similarities varying from 41 to 84%, depending on which regions are being compared (9Adams T.E. Epa V.C. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Cell Mol.

Exon 11 of the IR gene is alternatively spliced, resulting in two different transcripts in which 36 additional nucleotides encoding 12 amino acids at the C terminus of the receptor α-subunit are either excluded (IR-A) or included (IR-B) from the mature mRNA (12Moller D.E.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) showed that the C-domain and, to a lesser extent, the D-domain contribute to the higher affinity of IGF-II than IGF-I for the IR-A and suggested that either domain length or charge differences could be responsible. However, Kristensen et al. (24Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) made a single chain insulin hybrid containing the C-peptide of IGF-I and showed that the presence of the IGF-I C-peptide had no effect on IR-A binding, whereas increasing the affinity for the IGF-IR to a level close to that of IGF-I. In this paper, we have explored the possibility that sequence differences in the A- and B-domains between insulin and the IGFs are involved in the lower affinity of the IGFs for the IR-A and whether they also contribute to the higher affinity of IGF-II than IGF-I for the IR-A. By analyzing numerous single substituted insulin analogues, single substituted IGF-I analogues and multiple substituted insulin and IGF analogues, we clearly show that a small number of amino acid differences in the A- and B-chain of insulin and the IGFs are sufficient to explain why the IGFs bind with lower affinity than insulin for the IR-A. Our results also show that there is room for the C-domain of IGF-I and IGF-II in the binding pocket of the IR-A. Materials—Molecular biology procedures, including agarose gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, bacterial transformation, and DNA sequencing were performed by standard methods. Oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark) or Geneworks Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Restriction enzymes and ligase were from New England BioLabs (Hitchin, UK). Recombinant human insulin, A14-125I-insulin, and Achromobacter lyticus protease were from Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Recombinant Long™R3IGF-I, IGF-I, and IGF-II were purchased from GroPep Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). IM9 cells were purchased from ATCC (Middlesex, UK). The L6 rat muscle myoblast cell line (stably transfected with IR-A) was kindly provided by B. F. Hansen (Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). Seven of the single substituted insulin analogues were a kind gift from S. Havelund (Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). Vector Construction and Yeast Expression of Insulin Analogues—Single substitutions were introduced in the sequence encoding the insulin precursor by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Resultant constructs were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pJB146 (kind gift from Jakob Brandt, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). The yeast expression procedure has been described previously (25Kjeldsen T. Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Egel-Mitani M. Hach M. Pettersson A.F. Vad K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, an insulin precursor was coupled to a synthetic prepropeptide sequence consisting of a prepropeptide, a KR Kex2 cleavage site, and a removable spacer peptide E(EA)3EPK, and the insulin precursor was (B1–B29)-AAK-(A1–A21). The single chain insulin precursor was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MT663. Yeast cells were transformed and selected on yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose plates. Yeast cultures were grown in yeast/peptone medium with 2% glucose and 50 mm CaCl2 for 72 h at 30 °C (24Kristensen C. Andersen A.S. Hach M. Wiberg F.C. Schäffer L. Kjeldsen T. Biochem.

Maturation and Purification of the Insulin Precursor—The single chain insulin precursors were converted to des-B30-insulin using a lysine-specific endoprotease (A. lyticus) that removes the spacer peptide and the AAK bridge (27Tsunasawa S. Masaki T. Hirose M. Soejima M. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the cell-free yeast culture medium with the insulin precursor was adjusted to pH >8.5 with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9) and applied to a column with A. lyticus protease immobilized on Sepharose. The column was incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature before the cleaved precursor was eluted from the column with 50 mm Tris-HCl. The insulin analogues were analyzed by mass spectroscopy and were shown to have correct masses. Quantification was performed by LC-MS using human insulin as a standard. In order to achieve higher concentration, the quadruple and sextuple substituted insulin analogues were concentrated using a 6 foot2 Millipore Prep/Scale TFF Cartridge, purified using gel filtration and a HiTrap Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare Ltd.), and finally desalted using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Vector Construction and Escherichia coli Expression of Human IGF Analogues—The IGF expression vectors were developed by King et al. (28King R. Wells J.R. Krieg P. Snoswell M. Brazier J. Bagley C.J. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. Ross M. Francis G.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding IGF-I and IGF-II was introduced into the vector as previously described (29Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to incorporate the mutations into IGF-I and IGF-II. The resultant constructs were transformed into E. coli JM101 (lac Iq) for expression. IGF mutants were expressed as fusion proteins with the first 11 amino acids of porcine growth hormone ([Met1]pGH-(1–11)) after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase induction. Inclusion bodies were isolated as previously described (28King R. Wells J.R. Krieg P. Snoswell M. Brazier J. Bagley C.J. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. Ross M. Francis G.L. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Briefly, inclusion bodies from 0.5-liter fermentations were solubilized in 8 m urea containing 40 mm glycine, 0.1 m Tris, and 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH 9.1 in the case of IGF-I and pH 2.0 for IGF-II. Inclusion bodies were immediately desalted on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm (Amersham Biosciences) in two 2-ml batches) using the same buffer but with 1.6 mm DTT. Fractions containing the IGF fusion proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and reverse phase chromatography and pooled prior to folding. IGF-I folding was performed by dilution in 2 m urea, 10 mm glycine, 0.1 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm DTT, 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, pH 9.1, to less than 0.1 mg/ml. IGF-II folding was performed by dilution in 2.5 m urea, 12.5 mm glycine, 0.7 m Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm DTT, 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, pH 9.1, to less than 0.1 mg/ml. Cleavage of the fusion partner and a final reverse phase HPLC cleanup were achieved as previously described (30Lien S. Milner S.J. Graham L.D. Wallace J.C. Francis G.L. Biotechnol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purified IGF analogues were analyzed by mass spectroscopy (Dr. Chris Bagley and Chris Cursaro, Adelaide Proteomics Facility) and were shown to have the correct masses. Quantification of analogues was performed by comparing analytical C4 high pressure liquid chromatography profiles with profiles of standard Long™R3IGF-I preparations (32Milner S.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. Magee B.A. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—Whole cell receptor binding assays were performed as previously described (15De Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin III, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) using IM9 cells, which show high expression of the IR-A (∼20,000 binding sites/cell). For competition assays, 2.5 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with 125I-insulin (20,000 cpm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the analogue in a final volume of 500 μl for 2.5 h at 15 °C in Hepes binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose, 15 mm sodium acetate, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.6). Afterward, 2× 200 μl were transferred to centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was counted in a Wallac WIZARD γ counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The assays were done at least three times in duplicate for each analogue. Binding data were corrected for nonspecific binding and analyzed by computer fitting to a one-site model, using an Excel program developed in our laboratory by A. V. Groth and R. M. Shymko, to obtain the dissociation constant (Kd). For dose-response curves for negative cooperativity (accelerated dissociation) (15De Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin III, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), 5 × 107cells/ml were incubated with 125I-insulin (150,000 cpm/ml of cells) for 2 h at 15 °C. Afterward, the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant (unbound ligand) was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended to the same concentration in Hepes binding buffer, and 25 μl of cells were transferred to tubes containing increasing concentrations of cold analogue in 1 ml of Hepes binding buffer at 15 °C. The dissociation of prebound ligand was stopped after 30 min by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was counted in the γ counter. Each concentration was measured in duplicate, and assays were repeated at least three times. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis was quantified as [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation into genomic DNA according to an optimized method by C. Bonnesen and M. B. Oleksiewicz. 3C. Bonnesen, and M. B. Oleksiewicz, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, L6 rat skeletal myoblasts stably overexpressing human IR-A were starved in medium containing 0.1% serum and stimulated for 19 h in medium containing 0.1% serum supplemented with increasing concentrations of ligand. The cells were pulsed with 0.125 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 2 hours and harvested onto glass fiber filters using a MICRO 96TM Skatron harvester (Molecular Devices). The filters were counted in a Wallac MicroBeta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Production, Quantification, and Binding of the Single Substituted Insulin Analogues—Twenty-four insulin analogues were produced, each containing a single substitution found in either IGF-I or IGF-II or in both IGF-I and IGF-II (Fig. 1). GluB13, GluB21, and GluA4 were not changed, since there is an Asp in the equivalent position in IGF-I and IGF-II, which is considered a conservative substitution. All of the analogues were expressed successfully in S. cerevisiae and had the correct molecular weights as determined by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Heterologous competition assays were performed to determine any changes in affinity of the analogues compared with human insulin. The average Kd value for each analogue ± S.D. is shown in Table 1 together with five analogues tested in previous studies. Not surprisingly, since the overall structures of the three molecules are so similar, the majority of the analogues had affinities similar or very close to that of human insulin. Of the 51 insulin residues, there are 28 that are different from the corresponding positions in IGF-I and IGF-II (Fig. 1). When combining our new data with the five mutations tested previously ([AlaA14]Ins, [ThrA18]Ins, [AlaA21]Ins, [AlaB9]Ins, and [GluB10]Ins; see Table 1), we now have an almost complete picture of the contributions of each amino acid difference between insulin and the IGFs when comparing the A- and B-domains of the molecules (Table 1).TABLE 1Competitive binding for the IR-A of increasing concentrations of single substituted insulin analogues and a fixed concentration of 125I-insulinResidue inKd ± S.D.nRel KdInsulinIGF-IIGF-IInm Insulin0.29 ± 0.06221 GluA5GlnGluGlu0.27 ± 0.00330.94 PheA8ThrPhePhe0.58 ± 0.1362.00 ArgA9SerArgArg0.27 ± 0.0330.94 SerA10IleSerSer1.42 ± 0.3494.90 AspA12SerAspAsp0.16 ± 0.0530.54 ArgA14TyrArg0.42 ± 0.0131.45 AlaA14 aData from Ref. 55.TyrAla0.88 ArgA15GlnArg0.18 ± 0.0430.63 LeuA15GlnLeu0.36 ± 0.0231.23 MetA18AsnMet0.19 ± 0.0430.64 ThrA18 bData from Ref. 56.AsnThr0.43 AlaA21 aData from Ref. 55.AsnAlaAla1.59 GlyB2ValGly0.51 ± 0.0631.76 ProB2ValPro0.39 ± 0.0531.34 ProB3AsnPro0.54 ± 0.0431.86 SerB3AsnSer0.30 ± 0.0331.04 GluB4GlnGluGlu0.21 ± 0.0130.72 ThrB5HisThrThr1.23 ± 0.2974.24 AlaB9 aData from Ref. 55.SerAla1.39 GlyB9SerGly0.30 ± 0.0731.03 GluB10 cData from Ref. 35.HisGluGlu0.25 ThrB14AlaThr0.14 ± 0.0230.47 GlnB16TyrGlnGln2.87 ± 0.4869.90 PheB17LeuPhePhe0.32 ± 0.0231.10 TyrB25PheTyrTyr0.18 ± 0.0630.63 PheB26TyrPhePhe0.61 ± 0.0332.10 AsnB27ThrAsn0.32 ± 0.0431.11 SerB27ThrSer0.18 ± 0.0130.63 ArgB28ProArg0.22 ± 0.0230.76a Data from Ref. 55Jensen A-M.

Open table in a new tab Only five analogues, [PheA8]Ins, [SerA10]Ins, [ThrB5]Ins, [GlnB16]Ins, and [PheB26]Ins, showed a more than 2-fold decrease in affinity (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The reason for using a 2-fold change as a cut-off is based on alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies, which have demonstrated that any meaningful change in affinity, produced by a single substitution, ranges from 2- to 100-fold (33Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 34Whittaker J. Groth A.V. Mynarcik D.C. Pluzek L. Gadsboll V.L. Whittaker L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43980-43986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The analogue that showed the lowest affinity was [GlnB16]Ins. Replacing tyrosine with glutamine had a large impact on binding, leading to an almost 10-fold decrease in affinity. Introducing serine instead of isoleucine in position A10 and threonine instead of histidine in position B5 resulted in a 4–5-fold reduction in affinity, and finally introduction of phenylalanine instead of threonine in position A8 and instead of tyrosine in position B26 resulted in a 2-fold reduction in affinity. All five substitutions were amino acids present in both IGF-I and IGF-II; therefore, no IGF-I- or IGF-II-specific substitutions resulted in a decrease in affinity. Three substitutions resulted in an increase in affinity compared with that seen of human insulin (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Those were the already known [GluB10]Ins (35Drejer K. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1992; 8: 259-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and two novel analogues: [ThrA18]Ins and [ThrB14]Ins. Interestingly, these two residues differ only in IGF-II. When analyzing the location of the residues that have an effect on binding (Fig. 2), it becomes clear that ThrA8, IleA10, and HisB5 constitute a small connected area on the surface of the insulin molecule and could combine to play a role in achieving high affinity binding of insulin to the IR. Production, Quantification, and Binding of the Multiple Substituted Insulin Analogues—Having established that only five substitutions resulted in a considerable decrease in affinity, seven new insulin analogues combining three or four of these substitutions were produced with the aim to generate an insulin molecule with a binding affinity equivalent to IGF-I. Since [PheA8]Ins and [PheB26]Ins only showed a borderline 2-fold reduction in affinity compared with human insulin, these two could have been excluded in further analysis. However, since ThrA8 is located next to the IleA10 and HisB5 on the surface of the insulin molecule, the PheA8 substitution was included in the new analogues. Heterologous competition assays were again performed on the IR-A to determine any changes in affinity of the analogues with multiple substitutions compared with human insulin. As illustrated in Table 2, all analogues showed a clear reduction in affinity compared with human insulin. Including GlnB16 in the triple mutated insulin analogues ([PheA8, SerA10, GlnB16]Ins and [SerA10, ThrB5, GlnB16]Ins) resulted in a marked decrease in affinity compared with the triple mutation without GlnB16 ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrB5]Ins). Combining all four substitutions into a quadruple substituted insulin analogue ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrB5, GlnB16]Ins) resulted in a 150-fold decrease in affinity (this analogue will for simplicity be called “quadruple insulin”). Interestingly, this affinity was almost identical to that seen of IGF-I when competing with 125I-insulin for the IR-A on the IM9 cells (Fig. 3A). Therefore, introducing four substitutions into insulin results in an affinity similar to that of IGF-I.TABLE 2Competitive binding for the IR-A of increasing concentrations of multiple substituted insulin analogues and a fixed concentration of 125I-insulinKd ± S.D.nRel Kd Insulin0.3 ± 0.1221 [PheA8,SerA10,ThrB5]Ins5.0 ± 0.3317.3 [PheA8,SerA10,GlnB16]Ins22.1 ± 1.5376.2 [SerA10,ThrB5,GlnB16]Ins20.9 ± 1.9372.1 [PheA8,SerA10,ThrB5,GlnB16]Ins quadruple insulin43.3 ± 4.53149.3 [PheA8,SerA10,ThrA18,ThrB5,GlnB16]Ins30.9 ± 2.63106.6 [PheA8,SerA10,ThrB5,ThrB14,GlnB16]Ins15.1 ± 0.4352.1 [PheA8,SerA10,ThrA18,ThrB5,ThrB14,GlnB16]Ins sextuple insulin10.6 ± 1.0336.6 IGF-I49.7 ± 7.23171.4 IGF-II6.1 ± 0.4321.0 Open table in a new tab Next we aimed to produce an insulin molecule with an IR-A binding affinity equal to IGF-II. We made two quintuple substituted insulins ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrA18, ThrB5, GlnB16]Ins and [PheA8, SerA10, ThrB5, ThrB14, GlnB16]Ins) and a sextuple substituted insulin ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrA18, ThrB5, ThrB14, GlnB16]Ins) that incorporated the two substitutions that were in residues differing only between insulin and IGF-II ([ThrA18]Ins and [ThrB14]Ins). Comparing the binding affinities of the two insulin analogues with five substitutions ([PheA8, SerA10, ThrA18, ThrB5, GlnB16]Ins and [PheA8, SerA10, ThrB5, ThrB14, GlnB16]Ins) confirmed that especially threonine in position B14 plays a positive role in binding to the IR-A, leading to a higher affinity (Table 2). The [PheA8, SerA10, ThrA18, ThrB5, ThrB14, GlnB16]Ins (for simplicity called “sextuple insulin”) resulted in a higher affinity than IGF-I, very similar to that seen of IGF-II when competing with 125I-insulin for the IR-A on the IM9 cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, combining all six substitutions, four substitutions that show a decrease in affinity and two IGF-II specific substitutions that show an increase in affinity, resulted in an affinity similar to the affinity of IGF-II. Production, Quantification, and Binding of Single and Multiple Substituted IGF Analogues—We used a similar approach to determine whether we could make IGF-I or IGF-II analogues that behave like insulin.

https://openalex.org/W2006650212,"Many fundamental questions in crystal-growth behavior remain unanswered because of the difficulties encountered in simultaneously observing phases and determining elemental concentrations and redistributions while crystals nucleate and grow at the nanoscale. We show that these obstacles can be overcome by performing energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy on partially molten Al-Si-Cu-Mg alloy particles during in situ heating in a transmission electron microscope. Using this technique, we were able to (i) determine that the aluminum and silicon concentrations change in a complementary and symmetric manner about the solid-liquid interface as a function of temperature; (ii) directly measure the solid- and liquid-phase compositions at equilibrium and in highly undercooled conditions for quantitative comparison with thermodynamic calculations of the liquidus and solidus phase boundaries; and (iii) provide direct evidence for homogeneous nucleation of the aluminum-rich solid."

HAI-1 inhibits serine proteases that have potent pro-hepatocyte growth factor-converting activity, such as the membrane-type serine protease, matriptase. HAI-1 comprises an N-terminal domain, followed by an internal domain, first protease inhibitory domain (Kunitz domain I), low-density lipoprotein receptor A module (LDLRA) domain, and a second Kunitz domain (Kunitz domain II) in the extracellular region. Our aim was to assess the roles of these domains in the inhibition of matriptase. Soluble forms of recombinant rat HAI-1 mutants made up with various combinations of domains were produced, and their inhibitory activities toward the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate were analyzed using a soluble recombinant rat matriptase. Kunitz domain I exhibited inhibitory activity against matriptase, but Kunitz domain II did not. The N-terminal domain and Kunitz domain II decreased the association rate between Kunitz domain I and matriptase, whereas the internal domain increased this rate. The LDLRA domain suppressed the dissociation of the Kunitz domain I-matriptase complex. Surprisingly, an HAI-1 mutant lacking the N-terminal domain and Kunitz domain II showed an inhibitor constant of 1.6 pm, and the inhibitory activity was 400 times higher in this HAI-1 mutant than in the mutant with all domains. These findings, together with the known occurrence of an HAI-1 species lacking the N-terminal domain and Kunitz domain II in vivo, suggest that the domain structure of HAI-1 is organized in a way that allows HAI-1 to flexibly control matriptase activity.

The primary translation product of HAI-1 predicted from the cDNA sequence comprises 513 amino acid residues, including a putative N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a hydrophobic region at the C-terminal region (Fig. 1A). This suggests that HAI-1 is produced first as a type I membrane protein (1Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Indeed, the transmembrane form of HAI-1, which has a molecular mass of 66 kDa, was detected in extracts of MKN45 cells (5Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J.

The 58-kDa species (58-kDa HAI-1) has all of the HAI-1 extracellular region and comprises the N-terminal domain with eight cysteine residues, followed by the internal domain rich in acidic amino acid residues, the first Kunitz domain (Kunitz domain I), the low-density lipoprotein receptor A module (LDLRA)-like domain (LDLRA domain), and the second Kunitz domain (Kunitz domain II) (Fig. 1A). The 40-kDa species (40-kDa HAI-1) lacks Kunitz domain II (5Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem.

Soluble HAI-1 species with molecular masses of 40 and 25 kDa are found as complexes with matriptase (also known as membrane-type serine protease 1 or MT-SP1) in biological fluids such as human milk (8Lin C.Y.

The cellular sites of matriptase production are consistent with those of HAI-1 (2Kataoka H. Suganuma T. Shimomura T. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Nabeshima K. Koono M. J. Histochem.

Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HAI-1 functions as a physiological inhibitor of matriptase. The biological importance of the inhibition is supported by evidence showing that the ratio of matriptase to HAI-1 increases with increasing malignancy in cancers such as ovarian cancer (18Oberst M.D. Johnson M.D. Dickson R.B.

Pedersen E.D. Vogel U. Kure E.H. BMC Cancer. 2006; 4: 176Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This might be explained by overproduction of active HGF, two-chain uPA, and active matrix metalloproteinases, which are characteristic of malignant tissues (20Mazzone M. Comoglio P.M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Nozaki S. Endo Y. Nakahara H. Yoshizawa K. Ohara T. Yamamoto E.

Furthermore, matriptase zymogen occurs in a single-chain form, and one zymogen molecule is converted into an active two-chain form by another zymogen molecule in an activation mechanism known as transactivation. This may allow matriptase to act as an initiator protease for cancer invasion and metastasis (25Oberst M.D. Williams C.A. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26773-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of matriptase activity by exogenous HAI-1 could be one strategy to retard cancer progression. Little is known about the mechanism by which HAI-1 inhibits matriptase. Kirchhofer et al. (14Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) previously reported the existence of an alternative splicing variant of HAI-1 which contains an extra 16-amino acid sequence adjacent to the C terminus of Kunitz domain I and designated it as HAI-1B. Using soluble HAI-1B mutants that comprise all extracellular region, they showed that Kunitz domain I but not Kunitz domain II is responsible for the inhibition of matriptase and HGF activator (14Kirchhofer D. Peek M. Li W. Stamos J. Eigenbrot C. Kadkhodayan S. Elliott J.M. Corpuz R.T. Lazarus R.A. Moran P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36341-36349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, there is a possibility that the availability of Kunitz domain II in HAI-1B for enzymatic inhibition is impaired because of the additional amino acid residues. Indeed, Kunitz domain II in 58-kDa HAI-1 inhibits HGF activator (7Denda K. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14053-14059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of Kunitz domain II to inhibit matriptase is not understood fully. In addition, the occurrence of 25-kDa HAI-1 lacking the N-terminal domain in complex with matriptase in human milk suggests that the structural domains can also affect the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against matriptase. Our goal is to elucidate the roles of the functional and structural domains of HAI-1 in the inhibition of matriptase. For this, we prepared soluble recombinant rat HAI-1 mutants made of various combinations of domains, and we characterized their inhibitory activities against a soluble recombinant species of rat matriptase. We showed that Kunitz domain I is responsible for the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against matriptase, but that Kunitz domain II is not. We also showed that both the N-terminal domain and Kunitz domain II attenuate the inhibitory activity of Kunitz domain I, whereas the internal domain and LDLRA domain enhance the inhibitory activity. We suggest possible roles of the structural domains and Kunitz domain II in inhibition of matriptase by HAI-1. Our results might lead to the development of HAI-1 derivatives that may prove useful for cancer therapy. Materials—A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). All synthetic deoxyribonucleotides, pSecTag2/Hygro vector, and mouse anti-Myc epitope antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). PT7blue-2 vector, recombinant bovine enterokinase, immobilized S-protein, S-protein conjugated with HRP, and Perfect Protein Marker™ were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was from Dako Japan (Tokyo). Prestained protein markers (broad range) and restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). KOD-plus- DNA polymerase used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), T4 polynucleotide kinase, and a DNA ligation kit were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). Various peptidyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Spectrozyme tPA® (Sp-tPA, methylsulfonyl-d-cyclohexyltyrosyl-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroaniline acetate) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Stanford, CT), and bovine trypsin (type III) was from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids for the production of soluble recombinant rat HAI-1 mutants were created by a PCR-based technique with an expression plasmid containing the sequence of rat HAI-1 (Pro41–Leu513) with an S-tag at the N terminus in pSecTag2/Hygro B (designated as pSecHAI-1) as the template (the amino acid numbering of HAI-1 starts from the putative N terminus of the protein) (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid (pSecNIK1LK2) for the production of a recombinant HAI-1 mutant designated HAI-1 NIK1LK2 (Pro41–Ser441) was constructed as follows. In the designation of the HAI-1 mutants, the abbreviations of the domains were placed according to their order in the mutants from the N terminus to C terminus (refer to Fig. 1A). A DNA fragment amplified with 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACC-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTTCCCTCCGAAGA-3′ as a reverse primer was digested with KpnI and XbaI; and the resulting fragment was ligated into pSecHAI-1 in which the KpnI and XbaI fragment had been removed. Expression plasmids for the HAI-1 NIK1L (Pro41–Ser370) and NIK1 (Pro41–Ser307) mutants were made using the same method except that 5′-GCTCTAGAGAGGAAGTGGATACTCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGATTCCTTTTACATCCTTGCA-3′, respectively, were used as reverse primers. Plasmids for the HAI-1 IK1LK2 (Thr154–Ser441), IK1L (Thr154–Ser370), IK1 (Thr154–Ser307), K1LK2 (Gln245–Ser441), K1L (Gln245–Ser370), K1 (Gln245–Ser307), and K2 (Ser370–Ser441) mutants were made as follows. DNA fragments were amplified with appropriate forward primers phosphorylated at their 5′-ends, including 5′-AACTCGAGGCTTTGGAGGTTCC-3′, 5′-GCAGACGGAAGATTATTGC-3′, and 5′-CAGTGACAAAGGGTACTGT-3′, and with the appropriate reverse primers as described above. The PCR products were digested with XbaI, and the resulting fragments were ligated once into the PT7blue-2 vector predigested with SmaI and XbaI; fragments of these plasmids digested with KpnI and XbaI were ligated into pSecHAI-1 as described above. Plasmids for the HAI-1 NK1LK2 (Leu152–Ala243-truncated NIK1LK2) and NIK1K2 (Pro308–Ser370-truncated NIK1LK2) mutants were created with pSecNIK1LK2 as the template. To create pSecNK1LK2, forward primers used to create pSecK1LK2 and 5′-TCGCGGTAGGAGTTGTAAG-3′ were used as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. For pSecNIK1K2, forward primers for pSecK2 and 5′-ATTCCTTTTACATCCTTGCAGG-3′ were used as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified DNA fragments were self-ligated. Plasmids for the HAI-1 R260A, D349Y, and K385A mutants were made as follows. A restriction fragment of pSecNIK1LK2 produced by XhoI and XbaI was ligated into pBluescriptSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that had been predigested with the same sets of enzymes. Using this plasmid as the template, DNA fragments of about 3.8 kbp were amplified with the following sequences (the nucleotides underlined indicate the introduced mutations): 5′-CGGGCTCCTTCCCACCG-3′ and 5′-CGCAGCGGCCCACCTT-3′, 5′-ATGAGGCCACTTGTGAAAAATATAG-3′ and 5′-AGGAGCCATCAGGGCA-3′, and 5′-CGGAGAACATCCCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGCAAAATCCAGTGTCTGGCAG-3′ to introduce appropriate mutations. These PCR products were phosphorylated with T4 nucleotide kinase and then self-ligated. The plasmids were digested with XhoI and XbaI, and the resulting fragments were ligated into pSecNIK1LK2 from which the XhoI and XbaI fragment had been removed. Establishment of Stable Clones for the Production of Soluble Recombinant Rat Matriptase and Its Purification and Activation—CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. An expression plasmid, designated as pSec-ekMT-SP1s, for the production of soluble recombinant rat pro-matriptase (Fig. 2A) (17Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was transfected into the cell line as described previously (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Clones resistant to Ham's F12 medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B were obtained, and the expression level in the conditioned media by each clone was determined by Western blotting using S-protein conjugated with HRP as the probe. T3245, a clone with the highest expression of soluble recombinant promatriptase, was propagated and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Aliquots of the frozen cells were thawed and cultured in 75-cm2 flasks until reaching confluence. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 136 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and 10 ml of serum-free Ham's F12 was added to each flask. After 48 h, the conditioned medium was collected, and fresh serum-free medium was added. This was repeated until half of the cells were peeled off. The collected media were centrifuged immediately at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were stored at –70 °C until use. The procedures for purification using immobilized S-protein and activation of recombinant pro-matriptase by recombinant enterokinase were the same as described previously (17Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) except that Amicon® Ultra-15 (50,000 MWCO, Millipore, Cork, Ireland) was used to concentrate the conditioned media and that a lower concentration (3.4 units/ml) of recombinant enterokinase was used (17Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The concentration of the activated form of recombinant matriptase was determined as described previously (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, a part of the activated recombinant matriptase was incubated with 500 μm of t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)–l-Gln–l-Ala–l-Arg–MCA in 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 145 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 (hereinafter, called HEPES buffer), for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 80 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 350 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 100 mm monochloroacetic acid, and the absorbance at 370 nm was measured. The hydrolysis of other peptidyl-MCA substrates by recombinant matriptase was measured as described above. Production of HAI-1 Mutants Using CHO-K1 Cells—CHO-K1 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for the production of the HAI-1 K2 and R260 mutants were cultured in Ham's F12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. The cells resistant to the antibiotic were pooled, propagated, and stored. The procedures for harvest of conditioned media (serum-free media), concentrating the media, and gel filtration in HEPES buffer were the same as used in the production of recombinant matriptase. Production of HAI-1 Mutants in COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were maintained as described previously (11Satomi S. Yamasaki Y. Tsuzuki S. Hitomi Y. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The procedures for transient expression in COS-1 cells, harvest of conditioned media (serum-free media), and gel filtration in HEPES buffer were described previously (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Preparation of HAI-1 Mutants and Determination of Their Concentrations—Preparation of HAI-1 mutants from gel filtrates was performed using Ni2+-charged resin (HisLink™ resin, Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because of possible occurrence of cleavage between Kunitz domain I and Kunitz domain II during production in COS-1 cells (17Yamasaki Y. Satomi S. Murai N. Tsuzuki S. Fushiki T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2003; 49: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), HAI-1 NIK1LK2 was subsequently treated with an immobilized S-protein. The HAI-1 mutant bound to the immobilized S-protein was eluted with 0.2 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 2.0, and the eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 m Tris solution. All HAI-1 mutants were subjected finally to gel filtration in HEPES buffer. Various amounts of HAI-1 mutants and Perfect Protein Marker™ protein size marker, in which each protein is fused to an S-tag and the concentration of each marker was known, were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Western transfer. The blots were probed with S-protein conjugated with HRP. The x-ray films were scanned digitally, and the signal intensities of protein bands were analyzed by densitometry as described previously (6Tsuzuki S. Murai N. Miyake Y. Inouye K. Hirayasu H. Iwanaga T. Fushiki T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the HAI-1 NIK1LK2, NIK1L, IK1LK2, NK1LK2, NIK1K2, R260A, D349Y, and K385A mutants were calculated by comparing the signal density of the bands of interest with the 50-kDa protein contained in the protein marker. The HAI-1 NIK1, IK1L, and K1LK2 mutants were compared with the 35-kDa protein, the HAI-1 IK1 and K1L mutants with the 25-kDa protein, and the HAI-1 K1 and K2 mutants with the 15-kDa protein (see Fig. 1B). Kinetic Studies with the Chromogenic Substrate, Sp-tPA—All enzyme and inhibitor assays using Sp-tPA were carried out in HEPES buffer at 25 °C in a final volume of 100 μl in 96-well plates. Sp-tPA was dissolved in the same buffer just before each experiment. In steady-state kinetic studies, various concentrations of HAI-1 mutants were preincubated for 2 h in the assay mixture (90 μl) containing 0.12 nm recombinant matriptase. After the preincubation, hydrolysis was initiated by adding 10 μl of 5 mm Sp-tPA (500 μm) to the assay solution. The hydrolysis was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm resulting from the liberation of the product p-nitroaniline at 30-s intervals for 20 min with a plate reader (Powerscan HT, Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The initial rate of hydrolysis was determined using the molar absorption coefficient ϵ405 of 9650 m–1 cm–1 for p-nitroaniline. Inhibition of trypsin (0.05 nm) by HAI-1 NIK1LK2, K2, and R260A mutants was analyzed under the same conditions. In pre-steady-state kinetic studies, various concentr"

Native IKr channels are composed of two α subunits, hERG 1a and 1b. In heterologous expression systems, hERG 1b subunits efficiently produce current only in heteromeric combination with hERG 1a. We used Western blot analysis and electrophysiological recordings in HEK-293 cells and Xenopus oocytes to monitor hERG 1b maturation in the secretory pathway and to determine the factors regulating surface expression of hERG 1b subunits. We found that 1b subunits expressed alone were largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus accounting for the poor functional expression of homomeric 1b currents. Association with hERG 1a facilitated 1b ER export and surface expression. We show that hERG 1b subunits fail to mature because of an “RXR” ER retention signal specific to the 1b N terminus of the human sequence and not conserved in other species. Mutating the RXR facilitated maturation and functional expression of homomeric hERG 1b channels in a charge-dependent manner. Co-expression of the 1b RXR mutants with hERG 1a did not further enhance 1b maturation, suggesting that hERG 1a promotes 1b trafficking by overcoming the RXR-mediated retention. Thus, selective trafficking mechanisms regulate subunit composition of surface hERG channels. Defects in the trafficking of subunits encoded by the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG1) can lead to catastrophic arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death due to a reduction in IKr-mediated repolarization. Native IKr channels are composed of two α subunits, hERG 1a and 1b. In heterologous expression systems, hERG 1b subunits efficiently produce current only in heteromeric combination with hERG 1a. We used Western blot analysis and electrophysiological recordings in HEK-293 cells and Xenopus oocytes to monitor hERG 1b maturation in the secretory pathway and to determine the factors regulating surface expression of hERG 1b subunits. We found that 1b subunits expressed alone were largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus accounting for the poor functional expression of homomeric 1b currents.

Why hERG 1b functional expression is inefficient, or how hERG 1a promotes 1b surface expression, is unknown. In this study we found that hERG 1b protein efficiently exited the ER only in the presence of hERG 1a. We tested the hypothesis that hERG 1b subunits possess ER retention/retrieval signals that are inactivated upon association with the 1a subunit, thus favoring surface expression of the heteromeric channel. Of two RXR motifs (two arginines separated by any single residue) in the 1b N terminus, surprisingly only the one motif specific to the human sequence and not conserved in other organisms subserved ER retention. Moreover, mutations within this signal promoted surface expression in a charge-dependent manner. Co-expression of the 1b RXR mutant with 1a revealed that heteromerization with hERG 1a facilitates hERG 1b maturation by preventing RXR-mediated ER retention/retrieval. Reagents and Antibodies–HEK-293 cell culture, transfection, lysis, co-immunoprecipitation procedures, and analyses of Western blots have been described previously (7Phartiyal P. Jones E.M. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9874-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whole-cell Patch Clamp–Wild-type hERG 1b and the mutant cDNAs (1.5 μg) were transiently expressed along with the enhanced green fluorescent protein, and cells with fluorescence were chosen for electrical recordings. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The bath solution contained (in mm) 137 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 5 tetraethylammonium, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Tetraethylammonium (5 mm) was included in the bath solution to block endogenous voltage-gated potassium channels. Whole-cell currents were recorded with a fire-polished pipette tip of ∼1–2 μm with a resistance of 2–4 megohms. Internal pipette solution contained (in mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). Currents were digitized at 2 kHz unfiltered. Series resistance compensation was typically 60–70%, such that voltage errors were less than 5 mV. Leak subtraction was not used. Current recordings were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp–For electrophysiological recordings in oocytes, cRNA preparation and injection were carried out as described previously (8Wang J. Trudeau M.C. Zappia A.M. Robertson G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, hERG 1b and mutant DNA were cloned into pGH19 expression vector. cRNA transcripts were purified through a G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences), and 30 ng of cRNA was injected into oocytes. Currents were recorded 2–3 days after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Oocytes were held at a potential of –80 mV. Currents were evoked by 480-ms pulses ranging from –80 to +40 mV in increments of +20 mV followed by a repolarizing step to –105 mV for 480 ms. Statistical Analysis–X-ray films of Western blots were quantified by measuring optical density using LabWorks image and acquisition analysis software (Upland, CA). We ensured signals were within a linear range of detection for the ECL reagent and the x-ray film by probing increasing amounts of lysate with the relevant antibody. Data were analyzed using PRISM 2.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). All Western blotting and electrophysiology data from the RXR mutants were compared with wild-type 1b using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test. A p value of 0.01 was used to assess significance. In Figs. 1 and 3, 4 5, 6, a single asterisk denotes p < 0.01, and double asterisks denote p < 0.001. A post-test for linear trend was used to assess whether charge-dependent improvement in 1b maturation and function was significant.FIGURE 3The nonconserved R15XR motif in the hERG 1b N terminus controls its trafficking.

Right panel, Western blot analysis of 5 μg of lysate from cells co-expressing hERG 1b with the 1a N-terminal deletions. 5 μg of lysate from cells co-expressing 1b with 1a is shown as a positive control.

The mature/total 1b ratio failed to improve when 1b was co-expressed with the trafficking-impaired 1a N-terminal deletion constructs. Co-expression of 1b with the only trafficking-competent N-terminal deletion, 1aΔ200, improved 1b maturation significantly (n = 5; p < 0.01). The protein for 1aΔ250 migrated at the same size as mature 1b protein; expression studies were used to assess maturation in this case (see B and C).

Like other glycoproteins (10Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar), both hERG 1a and 1b subunits are detected as two protein bands on a Western blot: a core-glycosylated, immature form and a complexly glycosylated, mature form (4Jones E.M. Roti Roti E.C. Wang J. Delfosse S.A. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44690-44694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The mature glycoform represents the fraction of core-glycosylated protein that has exited the ER and has been further processed in the Golgi. When expressed alone, 1b exhibited low levels of maturation, consistent with minimal functional expression reported previously (5London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1a, 1b maturation was enhanced ∼3-fold (Fig. 1). Thus, hERG 1a facilitates ER exit and Golgi maturation of 1b subunits. Conserved R22XR Motif Does Not Contribute to Retention of 1b Homomers–We tested the hypothesis that exposed ER retention signals in the divergent 1b N terminus prevent Golgi maturation and trafficking to the cell surface. We identified two RXR motifs in the hERG 1b N terminus: the first, beginning at residue 15, is present only in the human ERG 1b sequence; the second, beginning at residue 22, is conserved across species (Fig. 2A). We mutated the positively charged arginines of the conserved R22XR motif to neutral asparagines (N22XN) to assess its role in preventing maturation of hERG 1b. Western blot analysis of transfected HEK-293 cells revealed no significant improvement in trafficking of N22XN over wild-type 1b (n = 5; p > 0.05) (Fig. 2, B and C). Complementary whole-cell patch clamp recordings in HEK-293 cells also failed to exhibit significant functional rescue of 1bN22XN mutants over the typically low wild-type expression levels (Fig. 2, D and E). R15XR Causes hERG 1b Retention–We next mutated the arginines of the R15XR motif to neutral asparagine residues (N15XN). Because this RXR motif is not conserved among other species, we were surprised to find the mutation dramatically rescued maturation of hERG 1b (Fig. 3, A, lanes 1 and 2, and B). A double mutation of both RXR motifs in the 1b N terminus (1bN15XN/N22XN) did not further improve maturation of 1b over that of the single N15XN mutation (Fig. 3, A, lane 3, and B). Surface expression and function of N15XN and the double mutant, as assessed by whole-cell patch clamp recordings in HEK-293 cells, paralleled the corresponding biochemical profiles, with an ∼3-fold increase in current density attributable to N15XN (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, mutations in the nonconserved R15XR signal enhance 1b maturation and functional surface expression. These findings identify R15XR as a key regulator of 1b trafficking. They also provide the important information that 1b subunits effectively oligomerize and can produce potassium currents in the absence of hERG 1a or heterologously expressed accessory subunits as long as they can traffic to the cell surface. Regulation of 1b Trafficking by R15XR Is Determined by Its Charge–To gain additional insights into the mechanism by which R15XR regulates 1b trafficking, we systematically mutated the positively charged arginine residues to lysine (K15XK, conserved charge), asparagine (N15XN, neutral), and aspartate (D15XD, reversed, negative charge). Compared with wild type, 1bK15XK did not improve maturation significantly, whereas 1bN15XN and 1bD15XD mutations progressively enhanced 1b trafficking up to ∼5-fold (Fig. 4, A and B). The increase in maturation of these R15XR mutants was charge-dependent, as evaluated by an analysis of variance post-test for linear trend (see “Experimental Procedures”). We next assessed whether improved maturation in 1b charge mutants translated into greater functional expression at the cell surface. For this we recorded currents using a two-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes, where the amount of injected cRNA for each construct could be stringently controlled (Fig. 4D). Oocytes expressing mutant 1b produced currents up to ∼4-fold higher than wild-type 1b in a charge-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and E), consistent with their biochemical maturation profiles in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4B). No differences were apparent in the kinetics or voltage dependence of currents produced by the four 1b constructs, supporting the conclusion that larger currents are due to increased channel number at the cell surface and not to altered gating properties. hERG 1a Rescues 1b Function by Overcoming RXR-mediated Retention–We next asked whether the enhanced maturation of 1b by mutation of R15XR was related to the mechanism by which 1a promotes 1b maturation. An additive effect on maturation of R15XR mutant 1b by co-expression with 1a would reflect regulation by more than one trafficking mechanism. Western blot analysis showed the ∼3-fold increase in 1bN15XN maturation was not further enhanced in the presence of 1a (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the mechanism by which 1a and RXR mutations promote 1b trafficking from the ER is the same. The lack of an additive effect on 1bN15XN maturation is not due to a failure of 1a and 1bN15XN to associate, as they can be co-immunoprecipitated using hERG 1a-specific antibody from lysate (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that association with 1a effectively masks the 1b N-terminal RXR retention signal to promote forward trafficking. We attempted to uncover a region in the 1a N terminus responsible for masking the 1b RXR using deletion analysis (Fig. 6). We generated a series of five constructs deleted progressively by increments of 50 residues. Of these, only the 1aΔ200 protein exhibited a mature protein band comparable with wild-type 1a as assayed via Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A, left panel, lanes 1 and 5). The 1aΔ200 construct was likewise the only construct to express measurable currents (n = 7; p < 0.001) (Fig. 6, B and C). When co-expressed with hERG 1b, the 1aΔ200 construct effectively promoted 1b maturation (n = 5; p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A, right panel, lanes 1 and 5). Because 1aΔ200 exhibited maturation and promoted 1b maturation, whereas 1aΔ250 did not (Fig. 6, A–C), we sought to further delineate the masking region between residues 200–250 in the 1a N terminus. Unfortunately, an internal deletion in this region was trafficking-incompetent and therefore also did not improve maturation of 1b (Fig. 6D). We conclude that the masking region in the 1a N terminus lies downstream of residue 200; future experiments using alternative approaches will be required to pinpoint its precise location. In this study we discovered a mechanism by which heteromeric association of subunits overcomes an N-terminal ER retention motif to regulate subunit composition of hERG surface channels. We ascribe ER retention of hERG 1b subunits to a single N-terminal RXR motif, R15XR. The efficacy of R15XR-mediated retention is dictated by its charge, as demonstrated by progressive improvements in 1b maturation and surface expression as the charge is respectively neutralized and reversed. Because a simple point mutation of the RXR motif in hERG 1b promotes trafficking and functional surface expression, it seems unlikely that gross misfolding of the 1b subunits contributes to its ER retention. Instead, fully formed homomeric 1b channels are prevented from trafficking. Heteromerization with 1a overcomes the RXR-mediated ER retention and promotes 1b maturation. Thus, a mechanism for promoting surface expression of hERG 1a/1b heteromers is encoded in the limited part of the N terminus that uniquely characterizes hERG 1b. We propose that the 1a N terminus masks the 1b ER retention signal or otherwise causes a conformational change that protects it from the ER retrieval machinery. Such a masking effect could result from a direct interaction, consistent with our previous finding that the 1a and 1b N termini interact in a direct, dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by in vitro binding of purified N-terminal polypeptides (7Phartiyal P. Jones E.M. Robertson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9874-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Arginine-based ER retention signals have also been identified in KATP channels and γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, where subunit heteromultimerization masks ER retention/retrieval signals exposed in homomeric proteins (12Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 13Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that hERG 1a subunits missing the first 200 residues are able to traffic and promote 1b maturation. Attempts to further map a masking region in the hERG 1a N terminus were hindered by the failure of downstream 1a deletion mutants to traffic. Perhaps the 1a N-terminal masking domain also acts homotypically, such that in its absence both 1a and 1b RXR signals are exposed and the subunits are retained/retrieved to the ER. Although the 1b N terminus contains two RXR motifs, only one is conserved across species, but the other, nonconserved R15XR mediates ER retention. In other species, R15XR is replaced by QXR (Fig. 2A). Given that mouse ERG 1b subunits are similarly inefficient at producing current (5London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P. Beyer A.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Satler C.A. Robertson G.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 870-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to predict its QXR acts like the human RXR to retain the 1b subunit in the ER. Indeed, a similar motif in SUR2 subunits, RKQ, serves as an ER retention signal (15Konstas A.A. Dabrowski M. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21346-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nonconserved R15XR in hERG 1b is preceded by a leucine residue predicted, based on previous studies in KATP channels, to strengthen the retention capability of an RXR signal (12Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The observation that the effects on 1b maturation by R15XR mutations and co-expression with 1a are not additive suggests that heteromerization with 1a overcomes ER retention of 1b. It could be argued that association of 1bN15XN with 1a produces channels in numbers that fully occupy the Golgi glycosylation machinery, obscuring a potential additive effect contributed by the 1a subunits. However, observations on the charge dependence of maturation suggest that the 1bN15XN mutant has not reached its full maturation potential (D15XD exhibits more maturation), yet it does not further mature when associated with 1a. Interestingly, our D15XD mutation closely resembles an ER export signal, DXE (16Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); we speculate that although both the NXN mutation and the presence of 1a overcome the retention checkpoint in 1b, the mutation to DXD might serve an additional function as a forward trafficking motif. More than 290 LQTS mutations have been mapped to the hERG 1a sequence. These represent almost half of all the LQTS mutations identified to date in known target genes (Gene Connection for the Heart database). Most of the hERG1 mutations examined thus far fail to mature (17Anderson C.L. Delisle B.P. Anson B.D. Kilby J.A. Will M.L. Tester D.J. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Ackerman M.J. January C.T.

Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown in most cases, some mutations lead to protein misfolding and trigger the ER quality control system (20Gong Q. Jones M.A. Zhou Z. J. Biol.

In one LQTS mutant, truncation of the C terminus by a nonsense mutation exposes an otherwise hidden C-terminal RXR motif, providing a molecular mechanism of ER retention for LQTS pathogenesis (22Kupershmidt S.

However, in contrast to hERG 1b, wild-type 1a subunits readily form functional homomeric channels, and therefore it is likely that 1a RXR motifs are either inactive or serve as reporters of 1a subunit misfolding during normal biogenesis. To what extent exposure of ER retention motifs accounts for other LQTS disease phenotypes remains to be determined. The role of hERG 1b in normal function and disease has not been fully explored. A specific knock-out of mouse 1b, which spares 1a, evokes cardiac arrhythmia (23Lees-Miller J.P. Guo J. Somers J.R. Roach D.E. Sheldon R.S. Rancourt D.E. Duff H.J. Mol. Cell.

Heteromeric 1a/1b currents exhibit less rectification and correspondingly larger currents in response to a voltage clamp command that mimics the ventricular action potential, suggesting the loss of 1b in native tissues is likely to result in reduced IKr amplitude. 3H. Sale, J. Wang, and G. A. Robertson, unpublished observation. It will therefore be important to search for disease mutations in the hERG 1b-specific exon and to study phenotypes of hERG 1a-specific mutations in the presence of hERG 1b. We do not know yet the stoichiometry of the hERG 1a and 1b subunits in channels expressed in heterologous systems or native tissues. As an alternate transcript (5London B. Trudeau M.C. Newton K.P.

https://openalex.org/W2069051794,"Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is a potent inducer of apoptosis of leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanisms that mediate such effects are not well understood. We provide evidence that the Akt kinase is phosphorylated/activated during treatment of leukemia cells with As(2)O(3), to regulate downstream engagement of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effectors. Using cells with targeted disruption of both the Akt1 and Akt2 genes, we found that induction of arsenic trioxide-dependent apoptosis is strongly enhanced in the absence of these kinases, suggesting that Akt1/Akt2 are activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner, to control generation of As(2)O(3) responses. Consistent with this, As(2)O(3)-dependent pro-apoptotic effects are enhanced in double knock-out cells for both isoforms of the p70 S6 kinase (S6k1/S6k2), a downstream effector of Akt and mTOR. On the other hand, As(2)O(3)-dependent induction of apoptosis is diminished in cells with targeted disruption of TSC2, a negative upstream effector of mTOR. In studies using primary hematopoietic progenitors from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, we found that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR enhances the suppressive effects of arsenic trioxide on leukemic progenitor colony formation. Moreover, short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of expression of the negative downstream effector, translational repressor 4E-BP1, partially reverses the effects of As(2)O(3). Altogether, these data provide evidence for a key regulatory role of the Akt/mTOR pathway in the generation of the effects of As(2)O(3), and suggest that targeting this signaling cascade may provide a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-leukemic properties of As(2)O(3)."
https://openalex.org/W1992528187,"The alpha(1a)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1a)AR) occupies intracellular and plasma membranes in both native and heterologous expression systems. Based on multiple independent lines of evidence, we demonstrate the alpha(1a)AR at the cell surface occupies membrane rafts but exits from rafts following stimulation. In non-detergent raft preparations, basal alpha(1a)AR is present in low density membrane rafts and colocalizes with its G protein effectors on density gradients. Raft disruption by cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin eliminates these light rafts. To confirm the presence of the alpha(1a)AR in plasma membrane rafts, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements were used to demonstrate colocalization of surface receptor and the raft marker, cholera toxin B. This colocalization was largely lost following alpha(1a)AR stimulation with phenylephrine. Similarly, receptor stimulation causes exit of the alpha(1a)AR from light rafts within 3-10 min in contrast to the G proteins, which largely remain in light rafts. Importantly, this delayed exit of the alpha(1a)AR suggests acute receptor signaling and desensitization occur entirely within rafts. Interestingly, both confocal analysis and measurement of surface alpha(1a)AR levels indicate modest receptor internalization during the 10 min following stimulation, suggesting most of the receptor has entered non-raft plasma membrane. Nevertheless, activation does increase the rate of receptor internalization as does disruption of rafts with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, suggesting raft exit enables internalization. Confocal analysis of surface-labeled hemagglutinin-alpha(1a)AR reveals that basal and stimulated receptor occupies clathrin pits in fixed cells consistent with previous indirect evidence. The evidence presented here strongly suggests the alpha(1a)AR is a lipid raft protein under basal conditions and implies agonist-mediated signaling occurs from rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2057260314,"Despite over a decade of research, only recently have the mechanisms governing transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) channel function begun to emerge, with an essential role for accessory proteins in this process. We previously identified a tyrosine phosphorylation event as critical in the plasma membrane translocation and activation of hTRPC4 channels following epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activation. To further characterize the signaling events underlying this process, a yeast-two hybrid screen was performed on the C terminus of hTRPC4. The intracellular C-terminal region from proline 686 to leucine 977 was used to screen a human brain cDNA library. Two members of the spectrin family, αII- and βV-spectrin, were identified as binding partners. The interaction of hTRPC4 with αII-spectrin and βV-spectrin was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Deletion analysis identified amino acids 730-758 of hTRPC4 as critical for the interaction with this region located within a coiled-coil domain, juxtaposing the Ca2+/calmodulin- and IP3R-binding region (CIRB domain). This region is deleted in the proposed δhTRPC4 splice variant form, which failed to undergo both EGF-induced membrane insertion and activation, providing a genetic mechanism for regulating channel activity. We also demonstrate that the exocytotic insertion and activation of hTRPC4 following EGF application is accompanied by dissociation from αII-spectrin. Furthermore, depletion of αII-spectrin by small interference RNA reduces the basal surface expression of αhTRPC4 and prevents the enhanced membrane insertion in response to EGF application. Importantly, depletion of αII-spectrin did not affect the expression of the δ variant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a direct interaction between hTRPC4 and the spectrin cytoskeleton is involved in the regulation of hTRPC4 surface expression and activation.

They can be broadly classified into two subgroups based on homology and activation mechanisms. The TRPC3/6/7 subgroup responds to the generation of diacylglycerol following receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C, whereas members of the TRPC1/4/5 subgroup demonstrate both store-operated and receptor-mediated properties. The store-operated phenotype is typified by the reduction in thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry in endothelial cells derived from the TRPC4 null mouse (1Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U.

An involvement in receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry was also demonstrated in the TRPC4 null mouse as well as in HEK293 cells treated with TRPC4 antisense oligonucleotides, which exhibited impaired carbachol-mediated oscillations (1Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nat.

TRPC4 has also recently been identified as an essential component of EGF receptor-stimulated Ca2+ influx (4Yang H. Mergler S. Sun X. Wang Z. Lu L. Bonanno J.A. Pleyer U. Reinach P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32230-32237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); however, the precise nature of the signaling pathway regulating activation of Ca2+ entry following receptor stimulation and store-depletion remains unclear. The organization of TRPC channels into signaling complexes is proposed as critical in regulating the activation of TRPC channels and controlling their physiological functions (5Ambudkar I.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 25-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Through interactions with various protein and lipid molecules, some of which remain unknown, TRPC channels are assembled into functional signaling microdomains (6Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Muallem S. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2007; 179: 559-574Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Definitive identification and characterization of the microdomains involved in TRPC-regulated Ca2+ entry are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms of store- and receptor-operated Ca2+ entry. Recent efforts have identified several potential components of the signaling machinery involved in TRPC4-mediated Ca2+ entry. These include the Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF), various IP3R subtypes, Ca2+-calmodulin, immunophilins, protein 4.1, Homer and stromal interacting protein 1 (7Sinkins W.G. Goel M.

Most proteins have been found to bind to discrete domains within TRPC4, such as the C-terminal CIRB domain for which Ca2+-calmodulin and IP3Rs compete (12Zhu M.X. Tang J. Novartis Found Symp. 2004; 258 (discussion 58-62, 98-102, 263-106): 44-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Removal of the CIRB domain from the βTRPC4 splice variant was reported to enhance carbachol-mediated Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells, and led to the suggestion of the less plentiful β variant being the active form of the channel (14Schaefer M.

Additionally, the role of NHERF in controlling the surface expression and localization of TRPC4 is also well documented (17Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J.

Spectrins are ∼200-400 kDa proteins that form extended, flexible protein dimers of ∼200-260 nm in length and 3-6 nm across and contain actin-binding domains at each end. Spectrin dimers are composed of α- and β-subunits, which associate laterally to form anti-parallel heterodimers. These heterodimers then assemble head-to-head to form heterotetramers, which are organized in a polygonal network of 5-7 extended spectrin molecules linked to short actin filaments (21Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). This spectrin-actin network is coupled to the plasma membrane primarily by association with ankyrin, which in turn is bound to dimers of the Na+/H+ exchanger (22Hryniewicz-Jankowska A. Czogalla A. Bok E. Sikorsk A.F. Folia Histochem. Cytobiol. 2002; 40: 239-249PubMed Google Scholar). Additional connections are formed between band 4.2, protein 4.1, the MAGUK p55, and glycophorin C, which associate at the spectrin-actin junction (21Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Spectrin is now recognized as a ubiquitous scaffolding protein that acts in conjunction with a variety of adaptor proteins to organize membrane microdomains on both the plasma membrane and on intracellular organelles (23Wechsler A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Bloch R.J. Bezakova G. Ursitti J.A. Zhou D. Pumplin D.W. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 177-195PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bennett V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Spectrin appears to organize and control the localization and function of integral membrane proteins by creating meshworks with other proteins (21Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). A role for TRPC4 in mediating the interaction between the spectrin cytoskeleton and Ca2+ entry was recently proposed, with disruption of the protein 4.1-binding site on TRPC4 preventing activation of the endothelial ISOC channel (10Cioffi D.L. Wu S. Alexeyev M. Goodman S.R. Zhu M.X. Stevens T. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Cioffi D.L. Wu S. Stevens T. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a direct coupling between αII-spectrin and hTRPC4. This is dependent on a coiled-coil domain located near the proline-rich, protein 4.1-binding motif of hTRPC4 and is mediated by the C-terminal spectrin repeats of αII-spectrin. Previous experiments demonstrated enhanced insertion of hTRPC4 into the plasma membrane following activation of the EGF receptor (27Odell A.F. Scott J.L. Van Helden D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37974-37987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we report that this insertion is accompanied by the dissociation of spectrin-hTRPC4 interaction. Channels lacking the spectrin-binding site failed to undergo membrane insertion and were unable to be activated by EGF. This suggests that a direct association with the spectrin cytoskeleton may influence the signaling events involved in controlling the level of active hTRPC4 channels expressed at the cell surface. Molecular Biology–The C terminus of hTRPC4 (CT, aa 686-977) and various truncations (CT1, aa 686-784; CT2, aa 686-859; CT3, aa 759-859; CT4, aa 759-977; and CT5, aa 846-977) were amplified by PCR from pCMVSport-hTRPC4 (kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Putney (28McKay R.R. Szymeczek-Seay C.L. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Zitt C. Jungling E. Luckhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem.

A full list of primers can be found insupplemental Table S1. Truncations of hTRPC4 were co-transformed with pACT2-αII-spectrin into L40 yeast and assessed for reporter gene activation. For GST fusion protein construction, the C-terminal fragments of hTRPC4 (CT and CT1-CT5) were restriction-digested from pBTM116 with EcoR1 and Sal1 and subcloned into the corresponding sites in pGEX-4T-1. The C terminus of αII-spectrin (aa 1998-2474) was amplified by PCR using the primers outlined insupplemental Table S1 and the insert ligated into the Sal1 restriction site of pBTM116. The C terminus of αII-spectrin was amplified by PCR from clone 18 and ligated into the EcoR1 and Sal1 restriction sites of pAS2.1. The C-terminal fragments of βV-spectrin and αII-spectrin were amplified by PCR from clones 52 and 18, respectively, using the primers outlined insupplemental Table S1 and the PCR fragments cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector for expression of GST fusion proteins. For the generation of the αII-spectrin GST fusion protein truncations, various fragments were amplified by PCR from pBluescript-αII-spectrin (kindly supplied by Dr. J. S. Morrow). Seesupplemental Table S1 for primers where, shown in brackets, are the corresponding beginning and final αII-spectrin amino acids of the truncations. PCR inserts were digested with the relevant restriction enzymes, cloned into pGEX-4T-1 and constructs assessed by DNA sequencing and the induction of protein synthesis. The further αII-spectrin truncation, αII-(951-2472), was generated by PCR from pBluescript-αII-spectrin. PCR products were ligated into Sal1 and Not1 restriction sites of pGEX-4T-1. To generate the bacterial constructs of full-length αII-spectrin for GST-tagged protein generation, a 1000-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of the αII-spectrin was amplified and ligated into pBluescript digested with Kpn1 and Xba1 restriction sites using the following primer pair; For, ACGGGTACCAGTCGACATGGACCCAAGTGGGGTCAAAGTGCTG and Rev, TGCTCTAGAGCAGCAAGATCTCTCTCGAGACCCTC. For the generation of full-length untagged αII-spectrin GST fusion protein, an Sal1 site was used after the 5′ Kpn1 restriction site. This produced pBluescript constructs containing the 5′ end of αII-spectrin with either Kpn1 or Sal1 restriction sites. The pBluescript-αII-spectrin construct also contained a Not1 restriction site at the 3′ end. Full-length αII-spectrin was subsequently subcloned from pBluescriptII-αII-spectrin with Sal1 and Not1 and ligated into pGEX-4T-1. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and assessed for full-length protein expression by Western blotting. The β and δ splice variants of hTRPC4 as well as the M1 (MUT1), M2 (MUT2), and M3 (MUT3)-hTRPC4 deletion mutants were generated using a modified linker-scanning mutation approach. Briefly, primers were designed flanking the regions to be excised and two PCR fragments generated encompassing the 5′ and 3′ segments on either side of the proposed deletion. These two PCR products were combined and utilized as the template for a second round of PCR amplification with the forward (containing the FLAG epitope), and reverse primers were utilized in the first PCR round covering the start and stop codons of hTRPC4. The primers are outlined insupplemental Table S1. The resultant products were assessed for the absence of intended C-terminal regions by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. Correct expression of the protein product was assessed by transient transfection and Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Yeast Media and Manipulation–The L40, Y187, and Y190 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains were grown at 30 °C on YPD media (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, 0.1 g/liter adenine, 2% dextrose) or synthetic minimal media with the appropriate supplements. Synthetic minimal media consisted of Dropout base powder (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 20 g/liter dextrose, 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, BIO 101, Vista, CA) supplemented with the appropriate synthetic media formulation (CSM, BIO 101). The synthetic (YC) complete media was then autoclaved at 121 °C for 15-20 min with or without agar (25 g/liter) and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Tryptophan was removed to select the bait vectors, pBTM116, pFBL23, and pAS2.1, and leucine was omitted to select for the cDNA library pACT2 vector. Lysine and uracil were omitted from all YC synthetic media to maintain selection of the integrated HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes, respectively, in L40 and Y190 yeast. Histidine was removed when selecting for interacting bait and prey proteins. In all yeast YC media, lysine and uracil are absent. All the initial characterizations of bait constructs and library screens were performed in the L40 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (29Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Two bait vectors were utilized to investigate hTRPC4 binding partners: the LexA-based bait vector, pBTM116, and the GAL4-based pAS2.1 vector (Clontech). The prey vector used was the pACT2 GAL4-based DNA-activation domain vector (Clontech). The human brain cDNA library was purchased already cloned into the GAL4 DNA-activation domain of pACT2 prey plasmid and titered according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies–Anti-M2 FLAG antibody and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-PY20 antibody was supplied by BD Transduction Laboratories, and the 4G10 and anti-β1-integrin antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-TRPC4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Alomone Laboratories (Israel). The anti-TRPC4 (C20) goat and anti-FYN (FYN3) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-EGFR mouse monoclonal antibody was kindly supplied by Dr. M. Hibbs. Anti-HA monoclonal, rabbit polyclonal anti-αII-spectrin, and rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibodies were from Cell Signal Technologies. The rabbit polyclonal anti-NHERF antibody was from Abcam Laboratories. All secondary antibodies, anti-GST antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase were from Amersham Biosciences, GE, except anti-goat AlexaFluor488, which was from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy–Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-hTRPC4 constructs were maintained in the above media containing 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). COS-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, and 35-60% transfection efficiency was routinely achieved. siRNA depletion of αII-spectrin was performed by reverse transfection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). Control and αII-spectrin (sc-36549) siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunofluorescence detection, transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-TRPC4 C20 antibody followed by anti-goat AlexaFluor488 secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Cells were mounted with Anti-Fade (DakoCytomation) and observed under 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope and analyzed with Zeiss LSM510. In Vitro Binding Assays, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting–GST fusion proteins were generated as outlined in a previous study (27Odell A.F. Scott J.L. Van Helden D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37974-37987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For GST-pulldown assays equal volumes of immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated with mammalian cell lysates containing 1-3 mg of protein at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting on nitrocellulose as indicated. For preparation of lysates of COS-7, HEK293, and A431 cells, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with RIPA buffer, and equal amounts of protein subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose (GE, Amersham Biosciences) as outlined previously (27Odell A.F.

For immunoprecipitation from rat brain membranes, lysates were pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose followed by centrifugation. Immune complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and resolved, along with lysates by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked and probed with indicated antibodies for 2 h or overnight and visualized with ECL Plus reagent on Typhoon Imaging System (GE, Amersham Biosciences). For quantification, the protein bands were analyzed with ImageQuaNT software. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins–Following treatment, indicated cells were biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfyl-NHS-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology) as outlined previously (27Odell A.F. Scott J.L. Van Helden D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37974-37987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lysates were then prepared by addition of modified RIPA buffer, and equal quantities of protein were either incubated with 50% NeutrAvidin-agarose slurry (Pierce Biotechnology) or immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Purification of Rat Brain Microsomes–Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were killed by decapitation according to Institutional Animal Ethics, and cortex tissues were dissected and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet (P2) was resuspended in RIPA buffer, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. 1 mg of soluble rat brain protein was used for immunoprecipitation with 4 μg of the indicated antibodies, and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Washed immunocomplexes were analyzed as above. Ca2+ Imaging–Ca2+ imaging was performed as outlined previously (27Odell A.F. Scott J.L. Van Helden D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37974-37987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured on glass coverslips and loaded with 2-4 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 30 min and incubated in HEPES-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) for 30 min prior to stimulation. In experiments performed in Ca2+-free medium, cells were placed in HEPES-buffered saline without CaCl2 containing 200 μm EGTA. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored as 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio, and single cell imaging was performed on transfected HEK293 cells illuminated with Lambda DG-4 lamp, captured with an Orca ER camera, and analyzed with MetaFluor program (Universal Imaging Devices) under 40× objective lens. All statistics were performed using Prism, one-way analysis of variance, and the Tukey post test. The C Terminus of hTRPC4 Binds to αII-Spectrin and βV-Spectrin–A yeast two-hybrid screen in L40 yeast of a human brain cDNA library generated in pACT2 was performed using a LexA fusion protein of the C terminus of hTRPC4 (hTRPC4-CT, aa 686-977) to identify intracellular proteins that interact with hTRPC4 and regulate its activation. A number of potential binding partners were identified, including the previously isolated hTRPC4-interacting protein, Na+/H+-exchanger regulatory factor or NHERF (1 out of 128 positive clones). A novel putative interaction was also identified between the cytoskeletal proteins, αII-spectrin (2 out of 128 positive clones) and βV-spectrin (10 out of 128 positive clones) and the C terminus of hTRPC4. The interactions between hTRPC4 and both αII-spectrin and βV-spectrin were confirmed by re-introduction of the constructs into L40 yeast in combination with control vectors (Table 1). Isolation and sequence analysis of the interacting spectrin clones revealed that hTRPC4-CT was binding to the C termini of both molecules; aa 1998-2472 of αII-spectrin and aa 3232-3674 of βV-spectrin. The interacting amino acids corresponded to spectrin repeats 19-21 and the C-terminal EF-hand domains of αII-spectrin and spectrin repeats 28-30 and PH domain of βV-spectrin.TABLE 1Summary of confirmatory transformations between hTRPC4 and either αII-spectrin or βV-spectrinBaitPreyHIS3lacZpBTM116pACT2−−pBTM116-FospACT2-Jun+++pBTM116-LaminCpACT2−−pBTM116-CTpACT2−−pBTM116-CT-(686-977)pACT2-αII-(1998-2472)+++pBTM116-LaminCpACT2-αII-(1998-2472)−−pBTM116-CT-(686-977)pACT2-βV-(3232-3674)++pBTM116-LaminCpACT2-βV-(3232-3674)−− Open table in a new tab The interactions between hTRPC4-CT and αII-spectrin and βV-spectrin were confirmed by co-transformation of the interacting cDNAs into L40 yeast expressing the C terminus of hTRPC4 (pBTM116-CT). Neither clone isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen interacted with the control LexA-LaminC protein when co-expressed with pBTM116-LaminC; however, both αII-spectrin and βV-spectrin activated expression of the lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes in L40 yeast, thereby confirming the specificity of their interaction with hTRPC4 (Table 1). Also shown in Table 1 are the negative (any assay with an empty vector) and positive control (pBTM116-Fos and pACT2-Jun) reactions. To further confirm the interaction between hTRPC4 and the spectrin molecules, the C terminus of hTRPC4 was cloned into an alternative bait vector, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain-based vector, pAS2.1 (pAS2.1-CT), and co-expressed with the pACT2-spectrin plasmids in Y187 yeast. Under these conditions, both αII-spectrin (Fig. 1A) and βV-spectrin (data not shown) induced activation of the lacZ reporter gene. There was no lacZ expression when either prey construct was co-expressed with empty pAS2.1 vector (Fig. 1A). Similarly, pAS2.1-CT failed to activate the reporter gene in the absence of spectrin fusion proteins (data not shown). Negative control transformations did not activate lacZ reporter gene expression (Fig. 1A). In addition, a domain exchange assay was performed between hTRPC4-CT transferred to pACT2 and αII-spectrin bait generated in pAS2.1. Upon co-transformation into Y187 yeast strain, only pAS2.1-αII-spectrin and pACT2-hTRPC4-CT bait-prey combinations induced reporter gene activation as assessed by colony-lift filter assay (Fig. 1A). No other control transformations induced lacZ gene activation (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained upon co-transformation of pBTM116-αII-spectrin and pACT2-CT in L40 yeast (data not shown). Taken together, these results confirm that the C terminus of hTRPC4 interacts specifically with αII-spectrin and βV-spectrin regardless of bait-prey combination and yeast strain utilized.

https://openalex.org/W2063177247,"Vascular ATP-sensitive K(+) channels are inhibited by multiple vasoconstricting hormones via the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. However, the molecular substrates for PKC phosphorylation remain unknown. To identify the PKC sites, Kir6.1/SUR2B and Kir6.2/SUR2B were expressed in HEK293 cells. Following channel activation by pinacidil, the catalytic fragment of PKC inhibited the Kir6.1/SUR2B currents but not the Kir6.2/SUR2B currents. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a PKC activator) had similar effects. Using Kir6.1-Kir6.2 chimeras, two critical protein domains for the PKC-dependent channel inhibition were identified. The proximal N terminus of Kir6.1 was necessary for channel inhibition. Because there was no PKC phosphorylation site in the N-terminal region, our results suggest its potential involvement in channel gating. The distal C terminus of Kir6.1 was crucial where there are several consensus PKC sites. Mutation of Ser-354, Ser-379, Ser-385, Ser-391, or Ser-397 to nonphosphorylatable alanine reduced PKC inhibition moderately but significantly. Combined mutations of these residues had greater effects. The channel inhibition was almost completely abolished when 5 of them were jointly mutated. In vitro phosphorylation assay showed that 4 of the serine residues were necessary for the PKC-dependent (32)P incorporation into the distal C-terminal peptides. Thus, a motif containing four phosphorylation repeats is identified in the Kir6.1 subunit underlying the PKC-dependent inhibition of the Kir6.1/SUR2B channel. The presence of the phosphorylation motif in Kir6.1, but not in its close relative Kir6.2, suggests that the vascular K(ATP) channel may have undergone evolutionary optimization, allowing it to be regulated by a variety of vasoconstricting hormones and neurotransmitters."
https://openalex.org/W1981377160,"P2X receptors are a family of seven ligand-gated ion channels (P2X1-P2X7) that open in the presence of ATP. We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis and patch clamp photometry to study the role of the first transmembrane domain of the rat P2X2 receptor in cation permeability and flux. Three alanine-substituted mutants did not respond to ATP, and 19 of the 22 functional receptors resembled the wild-type receptor with regard to the fraction of the total ATP-gated current carried by calcium or the permeability of calcium relative to cesium. The remaining three mutants showed modest changes in calcium dynamics. Two of these occurred at sites (Gly30 and Phe44) that are unlikely to interact with permeating cations in a meaningful way. The third was a conserved tyrosine (Tyr43) that may form an inter-pore binding site for calcium. The data suggest that, with the possible exception of Tyr43, the first transmembrane domain contributes little to the permeation properties of the P2X2 receptor.

The data suggest that, with the possible exception of Tyr43, the first transmembrane domain contributes little to the permeation properties of the P2X2 receptor. The notoriety of ATP-gated P2X receptors continues to grow. In large part, this reflects the discovery of an increasing number of physiological roles that can be ascribed to these ligand-gated ion channels, including such fundamental tasks as osmoregulation in amoeba (1Fountain S.J. Parkinson K. Young M.T. Cao L. Thompson C.R. North R.A. Nature. 2007; 448: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and sensation in mammals (2Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). By contrast, a reliable description of the biophysics of the channel is less forthcoming, due largely to the fact that the structure is unsolved. Each P2X receptor is a complex of three subunits arranged around an intrinsic ion channel permeable to Na+, K+, Ca2+, and, in some cases, Cl- (3Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A.

Li Z. Egan T.M. Arias H. Biophysical Aspects of Ligand-gated Ion Channel Receptor Superfamilies. Research Signpost, New York2006: 419-443Google Scholar).In this study, we consider the role of TM1 in the cation permeability and flux of the P2X2 receptor. Our study is based on the assumption that both transmembrane segments form the wall of the pore. There is general agreement that TM2 contributes, because published data show that some of its side chains form a water-accessible surface (6Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), permeability (9Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and flux (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The suggestion that TM1 lines the pore is controversial (11North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that removing the fixed negative charge of a glutamate at the extracellular end of TM1 decreases the Ca2+ flux of the highly Ca2+-permeable P2X1 and P2X4 receptors (12Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), thus providing a precedence for the involvement of TM1 in ion permeation. The TM1 of the P2X2 receptor lacks this glutamate but still has a Ca2+ flux that is higher than expected for the molar ratios of Ca2+ and Na+ in the extracellular solution (4Egan T.M. Samways D.S. Li Z. Pfluegers Arch. 2006; 452: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we use a combination of whole-cell voltage clamp technology, site-directed mutagenesis, and fluorescence microscopy to study the role of TM1 in Ca2+ permeability and flux. We measured the fraction of the total current carried by Ca2+, called the Pf% (fractional Ca2+ current) (13Schneggenburger R. Zhou Z. Konnerth A. Neher E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 133-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and the permeability of Ca2+ relative to Cs+, called the PCa/PCs, of wild-type P2X2 receptors and mutants with altered TM1s. With one possible exception, we found that systematic mutagenesis produced no easily explainable changes in either Pf% or PCa/PCs, suggesting that TM1 plays a limited role in controlling cation permeability and flux through the P2X2 pore.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology and Cell Culture–We used rat P2X2 receptors with the FLAG-epitope (DYKDDDDK) fused to their C terminus. Addition of epitope had no effect on the pharmacology of the receptor (14Li Z. Migita K. Samways D.S. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by automated DNA sequencing (Retrogen). All constructs were co-expressed with a fluorescent reporter protein in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) using Effectene (Qiagen). Transfected cells were maintained in a standard culture medium and incubated for 24-48 h at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. They were subsequently replated at low density onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass Gold Seal® coverslips (BD Biosciences) the night before the experiment.Fractional Calcium Current–The fractional calcium current (Pf%) was measured using patch clamp photometry as described previously (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hardware included a Nikon TE3000 epifluorescence microscope, HMC 40X ELWD Plan Fluor objective (Modulation Optics), a model 714 photomultiplier detection system (Photo Technology International), and an Axoclamp 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Briefly, HEK-293 cells were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2 (Invitrogen), by passive diffusion through the tip of low resistance (1-3 megohms) recording electrodes containing (in mm) the following: 140 CsCl, 10 tetraethylammonium Cl, 10 HEPES, 2 K5-fura-2, adjusted to pH 7.4 by addition of 4 CsOH. ATP (3-10 μm) was then applied for 0.5 s once every 2-3 min using triple-barreled θ glass and a Perfusion Fast-Step System SF-77 (Warner Instruments), whereas membrane current and fura-2 fluorescence (excitation 380 nm; emission 510 nm) were simultaneously measured. Pf% was calculated as shown in Equation 1, Pf&x0025;=QCaQT×100(Eq. 1) QT is the total charge, and equal to the integral of the leak-subtracted ATP-gated transmembrane current. QCa is the part of QT carried by Ca2+ and is equal to ΔF380 (ΔF380, the change in fura-2 fluorescence) divided by an experimentally derived calibration factor, Fmax (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Day-to-day variation in the sensitivity of the fluorescence recordings was controlled by normalizing the fura-2 signal to a “bead unit” equal to the average fluorescence of seven carboxyl bright blue 4.6-μm microspheres (Polysciences) measured one at a time on the morning of that day's experiment (13Schneggenburger R.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 797-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular bath solution was (in mm) as follows: 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 by addition of 4 NaOH. ATP had no effect on the fura-2 fluorescence of mock-transfected cells using the methods described above, as reported previously (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Relative Permeability Measurements–We recorded membrane current using indifferent electrodes suspended in 3 m KCl agar bridges in contact with the bath solution, and the broken patch configuration of the whole-cell voltage clamp technique. The solution in the recording pipette was (in mm) as follows: 150 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 4 CsOH, pH 7.4. The bath solution was first changed to one that contained predominantly CsCl (in mm: 150 CsCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 4 mm CsOH, pH 7.4), followed by one that contained either another monovalent cation (in mm: 150 XCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, brought to pH 7.4 using 4 mm XOH, where X is the monovalent cation) or Ca2+ (in mm: 110 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 2 CaOH, and 10 HEPES, at pH 7.4). We included 0.1 mm Ca2+ in the monovalent solutions to retard progression to the larger I2 state, because this process causes a time-dependent change in cation permeability that might alter PCa/PCs (17Chaumont S. Khakh B.S. Arias H. Biophysical Aspects of Ligand-gated Ion Channel Receptor Superfamilies. Research Signpost, New York2006: 445-460Google Scholar, 18Khakh B.S. Bao X.R. Labarca C. Lester H.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the absence of pore dilation, addition of 0.1 mm Ca2+ has a negligible effect on the reversal potential of ATP-gated current when [Cs+]o and [Cs+]i both equal 154 mm (19Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1949; 108: 37-77Crossref Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). We changed the membrane voltage of cells bathed in each solution from -80 to 60 mV at a constant rate (1.4 V/s) before and during applications of ATP, and we measured the zero current level (Erev) from the leak-subtracted currents. We calculated the relative permeability of the monovalent cation to Cs+ (PX/PCs) from the bi-ionic potential (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3 Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2004: 441-470Google Scholar). We calculated the permeability of Ca2+ relative to Cs+ (PCa/PCs) as shown in Equation 2, (aCs×[Cs]i)×exp(ΔErev×F/RT)×(1+exp(ΔErev×F/RT))4×aCa×[Ca]o(Eq. 2) where aCs and aCa are the activity coefficients of Cs+ (0.75) and Ca2+ (0.25), respectively, and ΔErev is Erev,Ca - Erev,Cs (21Wollmuth L.P. Sakmann B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). F, R, and T are universal constants.Data Analysis–All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. for the number of experiments stated in the text. Each experiment was repeated at least six times using separate cells, unless noted otherwise. Significant differences among groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance using InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego) and Tukey's post hoc test. Significance was measured at the p < 0.01 level.RESULTSAlanine-scanning Mutagenesis–Activation of wild-type P2X2 receptors with 3 μm ATP evoked a Pf% of 6.6 ± 0.2% (n = 22; Fig. 1A), a value in keeping with published results (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 12Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To identify individual residues within TM1 that regulate Ca2+ flux, we first investigated the effect of systematically substituting each residue from Gly30 to Ser54 with an alanine (Fig. 1B). Alanine is generally well tolerated at solvent-accessible surfaces (22Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), and we used it to eliminate the side chain beyond the β-carbon of residues in TM1 without altering the main chain conformation of the protein (23Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Twenty of the 25 mutants formed functional receptors with measurable Pf% values when expressed in HEK-293 cells. Three mutants (P2X2-V45A, P2X2-Y47A, and P2X2-V51A) did not respond to ATP (1 mm). These three residues are not positioned on a water-accessible surface (24Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Migita K. Torres G.E. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and are buried in the protein (14Li Z. Migita K. Samways D.S. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Silberberg S.D. Chang T.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); thus, they are unlikely to contribute to the pore wall and were not investigated further. Two other mutants, P2X2-Y43A and P2X2-F44A, were constitutively active in the absence of ATP, as reported previously (14Li Z. Migita K. Samways D.S. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7378-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although they respond to ATP with measurable currents, we were unable to determine Pf% because the Ca2+ that entered the cell through the ATP-independent standing current saturated the intracellular fura-2 before our measurement commenced. Nonetheless, as described below, the standing current did not preclude measurement of PCa/PCs, and we used this parameter to determine the effect of swapping alanine for Tyr43 and Phe44 on the Ca2+ dynamics of the P2X2 receptor.Of the 20 mutants tested using the Pf% method, only the P2X2-G30A receptor exhibited a Ca2+ flux that was different from the wild-type receptor, having a modestly increased Pf% of 9.1 ± 0.6% (n = 8; Fig. 1, C and D). The effect on Pf% of swapping the hydrogen of Gly30 with the methyl group of alanine is surprising. Gly30 is fully conserved in all P2X receptors and therefore may play a role in receptor function. However, our data imply that this role is not the regulation of cation flux through the pore. Replacing Gly30 with alanine produced a gain-of-function measured as an increase in Pf%, suggesting that the native Gly30 is unlikely to underlie the already high Ca2+ flux of the wild-type P2X2 receptor. Glycine adopts a wide range of torsion angles in peptides because it lacks a side chain (27Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Protein Structure and Function. New Science Press Ltd., London2004: 1-47Google Scholar). For this reason, we cannot rule out the possibility that the carbonyl oxygen of P2X2-G30A faces the permeation pathway and facilitates Ca2+ transport by providing a favorable electrostatic environment. However, empirical data suggest that the this oxygen faces away from the pore (28Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Spelta V. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it therefore seems more likely that the small increase in Pf% is secondary to a positional change in another part of the protein involved in regulating Ca2+ flux. Definitive crystallographic analyses of the structures of wild-type and P2X2-G30A channels are needed to determine whether this hypothesis is correct.Do the Side Chains of Hydrophilic Residues in TM1 Face the Pore?–The fact that alanine substitutions of the hydrophilic residues, His33 and Arg34, had no effect on Pf% also came as a surprise, because cysteine-scanning mutagenesis suggest they line the pore (24Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Migita K. Torres G.E. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast to the large effects on Pf% of mutagenesis of the pore-lining hydrophilic residues of TM2 (Asn333, Thr336, Thr339, and Ser340) (9Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M.

The current results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis suggest the following: (i) either the side chains of His33 and Arg34 in fact do not face the permeation pathway, or (ii) these residues face the pore but do not interact with Ca2+. To provide an additional test of the hypothesis that they line the pore, we mutated three hydrophilic residues of TM1 to glutamate, one at a time (P2X2-H33E, P2X2-R34E, and P2X2-Q37E). We included Gln37 because its amide group is polar, and because P2X2-Q37C reacts to a thiol-reactive compound with a change in the size of the ATP-gated current (28Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Spelta V. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Glutamate is generally found on the surface of proteins (22Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) where, in the case of an ion channel, it supports cation flux by providing a negative electrostatic milieu in the pore (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3 Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2004: 441-470Google Scholar). For example, replacing the pore-lining Thr339 of TM2 with glutamate produces a mutant P2X2-T339E receptor that displays a significant elevation in PCa/PCs and Pf% (9Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our results with TM1 were mixed (Table 1). First, we found that P2X2-R34E receptors were functional but responded to ATP with currents that were too small (6.6 ± 2.6 pA/pF, n = 4) to derive meaningful Pf% values. This mutant was not studied further. Second, substitution of Gln37 with glutamate produced a channel with significant ATP-gated current but had no effect on the Pf% (7.1 ± 0.8%, n = 4) relative to the wild-type P2X2 receptor. This experiment supports the conclusion that Gln37 does not line the permeation pathway, as originally suggested by Jiang et al. (28Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Spelta V. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Third, the ATP-gated current through the P2X2-H33E receptor was large (Table 1), and the Pf% was significantly increased to 8.9 ± 0.6% (n = 5). The rise in Pf% was accompanied by a significant increase in PCa/PCs from 3.2 ± 0.2 (n = 17) for the wild-type P2X2 receptor to 4.5 ± 0.1 (n = 5) for the P2X2-H33E mutant, measured using a conventional bi-ionic approach (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3 Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2004: 441-470Google Scholar). The simplest case that explains this result places the side chain in the pore where it is properly aligned to influence ionic currents, thus confirming the original hypothesis that His33 lines the channel (24Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Migita K. Torres G.E. Egan T.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5885-5892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar effect is seen when glutamate is substituted for Gln52 of the P2X2 receptor, as reported previously (12Samways D.S. Egan T.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although this may be so, the fact that the P2X2-H33A and P2X2-Q52A receptors have normal Pf% values suggests that the native side chain of His33 and Gln52 play little or no role in regulating the Ca2+ flux of the wild-type P2X2 receptor. Taken together, these data suggest that the putative pore-lining, hydrophilic residues of TM1 do not interact with Ca2+ in a meaningful way.TABLE 1The effect of fixed charge in TM1nI−ATP (pA/pF)I+ATPPf%PCa/PCsWT−2.6 ± 1.1−301 ± 396.6 ± 0.2 (22Chothia C.

To determine the effect of mutagenesis on these receptors, we instead measured relative Ca2+ permeability (i.e. PCa/PCs) by subtracting the smaller standing currents (∼20 pA/pF) seen in the absence of ATP from the much larger currents (∼200 pA/pF) measured in its presence (Table 2). Because both currents flow through the same receptor population, subtraction reduced the slope of the I-V curve but did not affect its reversal potential (Fig. 2A). The PCa/PCs values of P2X2-Y43A and P2X2-F44A measured in this way were 1.6 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.2, respectively. Both values are significantly smaller than that of the wild-type P2X2 receptor (Fig. 2B).TABLE 2Mutating Tyr43 affects Ca2+ currentI−ATP (pA/pF)I+ATPPf%PCa/PCsWT−2.6 ± 1.1−301 ± 396.6 ± 0.2 (22)3.2 ± 0.3 (10)Y43A−20.8 ± 3.6−196 ± 85ND1.6 ± 0.1 (6)Y43F−10.4 ± 3.4−453 ± 1213.7 ± 0.5 (7)1.2 ± 0.1 (5)Y43S−11.1 ± 1.7−190 ± 766.3 ± 0.6 (6)2.1 ± 0.2 (7)Y43W−10.4 ± 2.7−283 ± 633.5 ± 0.6 (6)1.1 ± 0.3 (6)Y43C-YFP−54 ± 13−65.6 ± 18NDNDF44A18.4 ± 4.5153 ± 45ND1.0 ± 0.2 (5) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Permeability and flux are changed by mutating Tyr43.

Although Phe44 is a large hydrophobic residue, it could conceivably influence PCa/PCs through an electrostatic attraction between the π electrons of its aromatic ring and Ca2+. Likewise, the side chain of Tyr43 contains a hydroxyl group that could facilitate Ca2+ flux by acting as a surrogate water molecule in a narrow part of the pore.Mutation of Tyr43 Attenuates Ca2+ Permeability and Flux–Tyr43 is fully conserved in all P2X receptors. We chose to pursue the study of Tyr43 because of the following: (i) conservation implies function; and (ii) it may serve the same function as the hydroxyl-bearing amino acids in TM2 that regulate the Ca2+ permeability (9Migita K. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. Egan T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30934-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and flux (10Egan T.M. Khakh B.S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) of the P2X2 receptor. To broaden our characterization of Tyr43, we used additional site-directed mutagenesis to alter the size of the side chain alone (P2X2-Y43S) or both size and hydrophobicity (P2X2-Y43F, P2X2-Y43W). 4We also made the P2X2-Y43E mutant, but this showed no ATP-gated current. All three mutants displayed large inward currents in response to ATP and had reduced Ca2+ permeabilities ranging from 1.1 to 2.1 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we were able to measure Pf% because the ATP-independent standing currents of these three mutants were smaller than those of the P2X2-Y43A receptor (Table 2). We found that P2X2-Y43F and P2X2-Y43W receptors had decreased Pf% values of 3.7 ± 0.5 and 3.5 ± 0.6%, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, the Pf% of the P2X2-Y43S receptor (6.3 ± 0.6%) was not significantly different from the wild-type receptor, despite the lower PCa/PCs value measured for this mutant. The side chain of serine is smaller than that of tyrosine, although both contain a hydroxyl group. Our results suggest that the presence of a hydroxyl is required to maintain Ca2+ flux through the channel and that the size of the side chain influences relative permeability. This could be explained if Tyr43 forms a weak binding site for Ca2+ in the channel pore.Collectively, these data suggest the following: (i) either the Tyr43 of TM1 regulates Ca2+ current, perhaps by acting in concert with the Thr336, Thr339, and Ser340 of TM2 to partially dehydrate cations in a narrow part of the pore, or (ii) mutating Tyr43 leads to a nonspecific change in channel structure that indirectly affects Ca2+ current.Does the Side Chain of Tyr43 Face into the Channel Pore?–As a next step in our investigation of Tyr43, we took advantage of an unexpected consequence of tagging P2X2-Y43C with YFP. Previously, we and others used sulfhydryl-reactive reagents and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in an attempt to identify pore-lining residues in both TM1 and TM2 (5Samways D.S. Li Z. Egan T.M. Arias H. Biophysical Aspects of Ligand-gated Ion Channel Receptor Superfamilies. Research Signpost, New York2006: 419-443Google Scholar). Tyr43 presented a problem because the cysteine-substituted mutant (P2X2-Y43C) was nonfunctional, despite being targeted to the cell membrane (28Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Spelta V. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We attached YFP to the C terminus of the P2X2-Y43C receptor to further examine its cellular distribution. We were surprised to find that cells expressing P2X2-Y43C-YFP displayed larger than normal standing currents in the absence of ATP, a characteristic they share with cells expressing other Tyr43 mutants, and had small but measurable transmembrane currents when challenged with ATP (Table 2). We do not know why addition of the YFP tag to the C terminus permits expression of a functional channel. 5The three nonfunctional mutants, P2X2-V45A, P2X2-Y47A, and P2X2-V51A, also displayed ATP-gated currents when tagged with YFP. We assume that it reflects an increase in the stability of the fusion protein in the membrane and not a change in the properties of the channel because addition of YFP or GFP to wild-type P2X receptors has no effect on the properties of ATP-gated current (29Dutton J.L. Poronnik P. Li G.H. Holding C.A. Worthington R.A. Vandenberg R.J. Cook D.I. Barden J.A. Bennett M.R. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2054-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Khakh B.S.

With a functional cysteine-substituted receptor in hand, we were able to revisit the issue of whether this position is accessible to thiol-modifying methanethiosulfonate reagents (Fig. 3). We measured the size of the currents through the P2X2-Y43C-YFP receptor before and during application of 1 mm MTSET. The peak amplitude of the ATP-gated current measured after 9 min in MTSET was 89.6 ± 19.6% (n = 5) of that measured before MTSET. This small change was n"

Interestingly, Spry2 also prevents the c-Cbl-induced degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared human fibroblasts malignantly transformed by overexpression of H-RasV12 oncogene to their nontransformed parental cells and found that the malignant cells express a high level of Spry2. These cells also exhibited an increase in the level of EGFR compared with their precursor cells. We found that intact EGFR was required if H-Ras-transformed cells were to grow in the absence of exogenous growth factors or form large colonies in agarose. When we decreased expression of Spry2, using a Spry2-specific shRNA, the H-RasV12-transformed fibroblasts could no longer form large colonies in agarose, grow in reduced levels of serum, or form tumors in athymic mice. The level of active H-Ras in these cells remained unaltered. A similar, but less pronounced, effect in tumor formation was observed when Spry2 was down-regulated in human patient-derived fibrosarcoma cell lines. In H-Ras-transformed cells Spry2 sustained the level and the downstream signaling activity of EGFR. In the parental, non-H-Ras-transformed fibroblasts, expression of Spry2 resulted in the inhibition of H-Ras and ERK activation, suggesting that the positive effect of Spry2 in tumor formation is specific to H-Ras transformation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies with H-Ras-transformed cells revealed that Spry2 and H-Ras interact and that H-Ras interacts with Spry2-binding partners, c-Cbl and CIN85, in a Spry2-dependent manner. These data show that Spry2 plays a critical role in the ability of H-Ras-transformed cells to form tumors in athymic mice.

Carcinogenesis is a multistep process by which normal cells acquire the characteristics of malignant cells through a series of genetic and/or epigenetic changes. To study this process, McCormick and Maher (1McCormick J.J. Maher V.M. Risk Anal. 1994; 14: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) developed a model system that mimics the pattern by which normal human fibroblasts become malignant. In those experiments, foreskin-derived human skin fibroblasts from a normal neonate, designated LG1, were transfected with a v-Myc oncogene, giving rise to the MSU1.0 cell strain, which has a normal diploid karyotype (2Morgan T.L. Yang D.J. Fry D.G. Hurlin P.J. Kohler S.K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As the MSU1.0 cells were being propagated, one of the cells spontaneously underwent two chromosomal translocations, giving rise to a cell strain, designated MSU1.1, that is chromosomally stable, nearly diploid, and partially growth factor-independent (2Morgan T.L. Yang D.J. Fry D.G. Hurlin P.J. Kohler S.K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that in contrast to MSU1.0, its parental strain, MSU1.1 cell strain, can be transformed into malignant cells by various means, e.g. by transfection of a Ras oncogene engineered to be expressed at a high level, followed by assaying for cells with the ability to form distinct foci (3Fry D.G.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5587-5593PubMed Google Scholar), are injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, they form fibrosarcomas at the site of injection with a short latency. For the present study, we used PH3MT cells, i.e. a cell strain derived from a malignant tumor that formed in an athymic mouse following injection of MSU1.1 cells that had been transformed by H-RasV12 oncogene overexpression (4Hurlin P.J. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The PH3MT cells are growth factor-independent, form large-sized colonies in agarose, (i.e. exhibit anchorage-independent growth), and form fibrosarcomas in athymic mice at the site of injection with a very short latency (4Hurlin P.J. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cell strains derived from the MSU1 lineage contain genes that are significantly overexpressed or underexpressed, compared with their precursor cell strains, we carried out a genome-wide comparison of mRNA expression profiles of MSU1.0, MSU1.1, and PH3MT cells. The array data indicated that expression of Spry2 was increased in MSU1.1 cells compared with their parental MSU1.0 cells and that its level of expression in the tumor-derived PH3MT cells was increased at an even higher level. 2J. J. McCormick, unpublished results. This discovery of very high levels of Spry2 mRNA in the tumor-derived H-RasV12 oncogene-transformed PH3MT fibroblasts led us to examine whether Spry2 plays a role in malignant transformation of human fibroblasts by H-RasV12.

The present study was designed to investigate the role of Spry2 in tumor formation by malignant human fibroblasts of the MSU1 lineage that express the H-RasV12 oncoprotein. To do so, we stably down-regulated expression of Spry2 in PH3MT cells using shRNA and found that expression of Spry2 was necessary for tumor formation in this context. A similar effect was observed when Spry2 was down-regulated in patient-derived fibrosarcoma cell lines. H-Ras transformation was associated with an elevation of EGFR levels, a property that was also dependent on Spry2 expression. Enhanced expression of Spry2 in the parental cell strain MSU1.1 resulted in an inhibition of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, suggesting that the ability of Spry2 to sustain EGFR signaling and tumor formation in this system requires expression of the H-Ras oncogene. We further determined that in PH3MT cells, Spry2 interacted with H-Ras and enabled H-Ras to interact with Cbl and CIN85. Together, these data indicate that Spry2 is necessary for tumor formation by H-Ras-transformed human fibroblasts. Cells and Cell Culture—The derivation of the cells of the MSU1 lineage has been described (2Morgan T.L. Yang D.J. Fry D.G. Hurlin P.J. Kohler S.K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Exp.

Cell lines SHAC, HT1080, VIP:FT, and NCI are derived from patient fibrosarcomas (33Qing J. Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The microarray data were obtained from studies by Nielsen et al. (34Nielsen T.O. West R.B. Linn S.C. Alter O. Knowling M.A. O'Connell J.X. Zhu S. Fero M. Sherlock G. Pollack J.R. Brown P.O.

Walker R.L. Chen Y. Glatfelter A.A. Duray P.H. Meltzer P.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9226-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The cells were routinely cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium, supplemented with l-aspartic acid (0.2 mm), l-serine (0.2 mm), pyruvate (1 mm), and 10% supplemented calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were included. The cells were grown in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared as described (36Lou Z. O'Reilly S. Liang H. Maher V.M. Sleight S.D. McCormick J.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The protein content was quantified with Coomassie protein reagent from Pierce. Whole cell lysate (50 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerca, MA), and immunoblotting was carried out using standard techniques. Ku80 protein was used as a loading control. The signal was detected with the Super Signal reagent (Pierce). Antibodies for EGFR, ERK, pERK, c-Cbl, and H-Ras were purchased form Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); Spry2 was from Calbiochem; Pan-Ras was from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO); and Ku80 was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Preparation of Spry2-shRNA Constructs—The down-regulation of Spry2 in PH3MT cells was carried out with the pSuper. retro system by Oligoengine (Seattle, WA). The shRNA constructs were designed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the coding region of Spry2 was analyzed with the RNA interference design tool from Oligoengine, and two 19-nucleotide long regions, centered on positions 399 and 492 of the Spry2 coding region, were selected as target sites. For each of these target sites, a 65-base pair, double-stranded oligonucleotide was synthesized, which encodes the sense and antisense orientations of the Spry2 target site, separated by a hairpin sequence of nine base pairs. These double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized to contain BgIII and HindIII overhangs. The sequences of the oligonucleotides targeting positions 399 and 492 on the Spry2 coding region are: 5′-GATCCCCGAGACTGCTAGGATCATCCTTCAAGAGAGGAGTGATCCTAGCAGCTCTTTTTGGAAA and 5′-GATCCCCGCCACTGAGCAAGGAAGATTTCAAGAGAATCTTCCTTGCTCAGTGGCTTTTTGGAAA, respectively. In addition to the two Spry2-specific oligonucleotides, we synthesized a nonspecific oligonucleotide in which the sense and antisense sequences were scrambled. Following synthesis, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated into the pSuper.retro vector. Stable Infection—The pSuper.retro vectors encoding the Spry2-specifc or the nonspecific shRNA constructs and the gene coding for neomycin resistance were transiently transfected into the Phoenix packaging cell line, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. In each case, we used 5 μg of DNA and a 1:4 DNA to Lipofectamine ratio. After 48 h, the medium on the cells was collected and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the retrovirus was collected. One ml of medium containing retrovirus was added to PH3MT cells that had been plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish, 24 h previously. The retrovirus-containing medium was removed from the cells after 18 h, and the cells were allowed to recover for 30 h. Then the cells were passaged into 100-mm-diameter dishes at a 1:10 dilution, and 24 h later, the infected cells were selected for resistance to puromycin (20 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation Reactions—Whole cell lysates (250 μg) were precleared with an appropriate IgG antibody for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with an antibody specific for H-Ras, followed by incubation at 4 °C with protein-G for 1–8 h. When an H-Ras-agarose conjugate was used (Ras-cCbl/CIN85), the lysates were incubated with the agarose conjugate for 3 or more hours. The immunoprecipitated fraction was washed several times with lysis buffer and assayed by Western blotting. The immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated three times for the Ras-Spry2 and Ras-c-Cbl interactions and twice for the Ras-CIN85 interaction. Anchorage Independence Assay—The cells were assayed for their ability to form colonies in agarose as described (36Lou Z. O'Reilly S. Liang H. Maher V.M. Sleight S.D. McCormick J.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The colony number and size was determined by using the National Institutes of Health Image software. Only colonies greater than 120 μm in size are shown in the graphs. Tumorigenicity Assay—The derivatives of PH3MT cells were assayed for their ability to form tumors in athymic mice as described (36Lou Z. O'Reilly S. Liang H. Maher V.M. Sleight S.D. McCormick J.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cell lines immediately derived from MSU1.1 cells were injected into an absorbable gelatin sponge (1 cm3) (GE Healthcare) that had been implanted subcutaneously into athymic mice 1 week earlier. Ras Activation Assay—Whole cell lysates (2 mg) were pulled down with Raf-Ras-binding domain-conjugated beads from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pulled down fractions were immunoblotted with an H-Ras-specific antibody. Statistics—The anchorage independence assays for each of the two control cell strains and the three cells strains with down-regulated Spry2 were repeated at least twice. Growth curves were repeated at least twice. Statistical significance was determined by using a two-tailed nonpaired Student's t test. Determination of the Level of Expression of Spry2 in H-RasV12-transformed Human Cell Line PH3MT—To determine whether H-RasV12 transformation altered the level of expression of Spry2, we compared the cells of the MSU1 lineage using Northern and Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B). Compared with the parental MSU1.0 cell stain, the nontransformed, cell strain derived from it, MSU1.1, exhibited only a modest increase in Spry2 expression. In contrast, the malignant cell line PH3MT, exhibited a significant increase in Spry2 expression. An independent H-RasV12-transformed cell strain (PH2MT) also had high expression of Spry2 (Fig. 1B). These results are expected if H-Ras oncogene is responsible for the high level of Spry2 protein found in PH3MT cells. To determine whether expression of oncogenic N-RasV12 causes the same effect, we compared the levels of expression of Spry2 protein in two independent, tumor-derived, MSU1.1-derivative cell lines malignantly transformed by transfection of the N-RasV12 oncogene, i.e. cell strains N-Ras-2T and N-Ras-3T (5Wilson D.M. Yang D.J. Dillberger J.E. Dietrich S.E. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5587-5593PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, these N-RasV12-transformed malignant cell lines also expressed Spry2 at a high level, similar to the level seen in H-RasV12-transformed cell lines PH2MT and PH3MT. To determine whether cells from patient-derived fibrosarcomas also express high levels of Spry2, we examined cell lines established from four patient-derived fibrosarcomas. Compared with the levels of Spry2 seen in normal, healthy, fibroblasts derived from the foreskin of two normal human newborns, i.e. SL68 and SL89, all four fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines were found to express high levels of Spry2 (Fig. 1D). In addition, we examined the expression of Spry2 mRNA by mining existing microarray data from a panel of soft tissue sarcomas (34Nielsen T.O. West R.B. Linn S.C. Alter O. Knowling M.A. O'Connell J.X.

This panel included cell lines derived form synovial sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and liposarcoma. The relative change in the expression of Spry2 and Spry1 in the sarcomas as compared with a mixture of 11 cell lines is shown in Fig. 1E. In another study, Baird et al. (35Baird K. Davis S. Antonescu C.R. Harper U.L. Walker R.L. Chen Y. Glatfelter A.A. Duray P.H. Meltzer P.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9226-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) profiled a wider group of sarcomas, including a number of fibrosarcomas and dermatofibrosarcomas. In this study, Spry2 was elevated in 2/7 fibrosarcomas and in 4/5 dermatofibrosarcomas (35Baird K. Davis S. Antonescu C.R. Harper U.L. Walker R.L. Chen Y. Glatfelter A.A. Duray P.H. Meltzer P.S.

Effect of H-Ras Transformation on the Level of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein—Several studies demonstrate that Ras regulates the signaling activity and endocytosis effect of EGFR through Ras effector proteins (37Casanova M.L.

Wagner E.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we found that transformation of the parental MSU1.1 cells with H-RasV12 was associated with an increase in the levels of EGFR, upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 2A). The stimulation of MSU1.1 cells with EGF resulted in a decrease in the level of EGFR protein. Although a similar effect was observed in PH3MT cells (H-Ras-transformed), these cells exhibited increased and sustained levels of EGFR upon EGF stimulation compared with their parental cells (Fig. 2A). In addition to exhibiting a change in the level of Spry2, PH3MT cells also exhibited a decrease in the level of c-Cbl (Fig. 2A), an E3 ubiquitin ligase shown to target EGFR for degradation. To determine whether EGFR is necessary for the ability of H-Ras-transformed cells to replicate in the absence of exogenous growth factors, we measured the ability of PH3MT cells to grow in the presence of AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (42Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, inhibition of EGFR activity by AG1478 resulted in a significant decrease in the ability of the PH3MT cells to grow in medium with 0.1% serum. What is more, this decrease in PH3MT cells was significantly greater than that observed in its parental MSU1.1 cell strain (Fig. 2B), which is partially growth factor-independent (2Morgan T.L. Yang D.J. Fry D.G. Hurlin P.J. Kohler S.K. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we examined the ability of H-Ras-transformed cells to form colonies in agarose, we found that the addition of AG1478 decreased the number of colonies greater than 120 μm (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, this effect was diminished at higher doses of inhibitor, but even at its highest dose (4 μm), AG1478 caused a statistically significant decrease in the number of colonies. Inhibition of MAPK signaling by PD98059 reduced the number of large colonies to near zero (Fig. 2C), perhaps because signals downstream of oncogenic H-Ras are more important compared with upstream signaling, at least with respect to growth in agarose. These results support the notion that EGFR activity contributes to the phenotype of H-RasV12-transformed cells consistent with similar findings by Hamilton and Wolfman (39Hamilton M. Wolfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28155-28162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Effect of Spry2 on Tumor Formation by H-Ras-transformed Cells—To study the role of Spry2 in H-RasV12 transformation, we down-regulated its expression in the malignant PH3MT cells using shRNA molecules, designed to target either position 399 or 492 of the Spry2 coding region. Cell strains expressing a vector without a shRNA molecule (PH3MT-VC) or a vector encoding the scrambled shRNA molecule (PH3MT-SC) were used as controls. The two cell strains expressing the Spry2-specific shRNA molecule that targets position 399 (PH3MT-2A3 and -2B9), as well as a cell strain expressing the Spry2-specific shRNA molecule that targets position 492 (PH3MT-5A3), expressed lower levels of the Spry2 protein, compared"

Protein kinase D (PKD) family members (PKD1, 2, and 3) have been identified as important regulators of secretory transport at the trans-Golgi network. Previously, we showed that PKD1 contributes to stimulated NT secretion; however, the mechanisms are not entirely clear. Here, we show that Kidins220, which is a substrate of PKD proteins in neuroendocrine cells, is localized in the ends of the processes of BON cells, similar to the expression pattern of NT vesicles, and translocates to the membrane and large vesicle-like structures formed in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. The short hairpin RNA targeting Kidins220 inhibits NT secretion in parental BON cells or BON cells stably expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor treated with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or bombesin, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endogenous PKD1, PKD2, and Kidins220 co-exist with NT-containing vesicles. Overexpression of the kinase-dead PKD1 abrogates Kidins220 expression and NT vesicle formation. Our data establish a physiological link between the PKD/Kidins220 pathway and NT-containing vesicles and suggest the role of this pathway in the regulation of hormone secretion. Because NT is an important gut hormone that affects secretion, inflammation, and both normal and tumor cell growth, our findings identify a novel signaling pathway that may be amenable to drug targeting for clinical applications.

Focusing on the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate NT release from BON cells, we found that protein kinase C, especially the isoforms α and δ and the protein kinase C substrate MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate), contributes to stimulated NT secretion (8Li J.

Similar to PKD1, PKD2 can be activated by phorbol esters, phospholipids, and the cholecystokinin B/gastrin receptor (16Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PKD2 and PKD3 also affect the TGN-to-plasma membrane trafficking in non-polarized HeLa cells that only express endogenous PKD2 and 3, but not PKD1 (11Yeaman C. Ayala M.I. Wright J.R. Bard F. Bossard C. Ang A. Maeda Y. Seufferlein T. Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Malhotra V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using a polarized model of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that express all three PKD isoforms, it was found that PKD1 and 2, but not 3, participate in the trafficking from TGN to the basolateral membrane (11Yeaman C. Ayala M.I. Wright J.R. Bard F. Bossard C. Ang A. Maeda Y. Seufferlein T. Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Malhotra V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In recent studies, downstream substrates of PKD have been identified. Kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220) was first identified as a PKD physiological substrate in PC12 cells (17Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Kidins220 is an integral plasma membrane protein predominantly expressed in brain and neurons. PKD1 and PKD2, but not PKD3, specifically regulate the surface localization of Kidins220 in PC12 cells. In this study, we extended our findings regarding the important roles of PKD proteins and determined the mechanisms by which PKD proteins regulate NT secretion. Here, we demonstrate that PKD2 and the PKD protein substrate Kidins220 regulate stimulated NT secretion. PKD1, PKD2, and Kidins220 display the same localization pattern as NT vesicles at the ends of the processes of BON cells and co-exist with NT vesicles. The findings in our current study provide the first evidence to suggest the regulation of NT hormone secretion through the PKD/Kidins220 signaling pathway.

The concentrated protein assay dye reagent was from Bio-Rad. Tissue culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stable Cell Lines—The BON cell line was derived from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor and characterized in our laboratory (6Evers B.M. Townsend Jr., C.M. Upp J.R.

BON cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and nutrient mixture, F12K, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Stable cell lines BON/GFP-NT, BON/GFP-PKD1 (wild type and kinase dead), and BON/GFP-GRPR were established by cell sorting and maintained in medium with G418 (500 μg/ml). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen. Cell Treatments and NT Enzyme Immunoassay—All experiments were performed as described previously (18Li J. O'Connor K.L. Cheng X. Mei F.C. Uchida T. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24–48 h after seeding or transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 5 h. For NT release experiments, cells were treated with PMA (10 nm) for 30 min or BBS (10 nm) for 1 h. Medium was collected and stored at –80 °C until NT enzyme immunoassay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. NT peptide released in the medium was normalized by protein concentration from the same cell lysates. Protein Preparation and Western Blotting—Protein preparation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (9Li J. O'Connor K.L. Greeley Jr., G.H. Blackshear P.J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8351-8357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes; the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were developed using the ECL detection system. One-step Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from BON cells and real-time RT-PCR performed using Applied Biosystems assays-on-demand 20× assay mix of primers and Taq-Man MGB probes (FAM™ dye-labeled) for target genes PRKD1 (ID Hs00177037_m1), PRKD2 (ID Hs00212828_m1), and PRKD3 (Hs00178657_m1) and predeveloped 18 S rRNA(VIC™ dye-labeled probe) TaqMan® assay reagent (P/N 4319413E) for endogenous control. Separate tubes (singleplex) one-step RT-PCR was performed with 80 ng of RNA for both target gene and endogenous control. The reagent was TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagent kit (P/N 4309169). The cycling parameters for one-step RT-PCR were: reverse transcription 48 °C for 30 min, AmpliTaq activation 95 °C for 10 min, denaturation 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension 60 °C for 1 min (repeat 40 times) on ABI7000. Duplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2–ΔΔCT) was obtained by normalizing to the endogenous reference (18 S) and relative to a calibrator (one of the experimental samples). All reactions were performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescent Staining and Confocal Microscopy—BON cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. 2 or 3 days after seeding or transfection, cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or PMA (100 nm) for 30 min. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated with the primary antibody diluted with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody diluted by 1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The fluorescence staining was observed under an LSM 510 META confocal system configured with an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were acquired using a plan-apochromat ×63, 1.4-NA oil immersion objectives, and the 488- or 568-nm line of an argon-ion laser for excitation. The image acquisition and processing were carried out using the Zeiss LSM510 work station (version 3.0) and the Zeiss Image Browser (version 3.1) software. Generation of Kidins220 Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Vectors—The BLOCK-iT Inducible H1 RNAi Entry Vector kit was purchased from Invitrogen. The single-stranded DNA oligos were designed using Invitrogen's RNAi Designer on-line. Two target sequences were selected to knock down Kidins220: Sh1-top, caccgccagagagcagatcagtattcgaaaatactgatctgctctctggc; Sh1-bottom, aaaagccagagagcagatcagtattttcgaatactgatctgctctctggc; Sh2-top, caccggatgaatctggcacagaagacgaatcttctgtgccagattcatcc; Sh2-bottom, aaaaggatgaatctggcacagaagattcgtcttctgtgccagattcatcc. Double-Stranded oligos were generated and cloned into the pENTR/H1/TO vector following the manufacturer's instructions. The LacZ 2.1 control vector was generated using the LacZ2.1 double-stranded oligos from the kit. The positive clones for both Kidins220 and LacZ were screened by sequencing to confirm the sequence of the double-stranded oligo insert. Statistical Analysis—Because of heterogeneous variability among treatment groups, data were transformed using logarithm to the base 10 for data analysis. The log-transformed data were analyzed using analysis of variance for a two-factor experiment (Fig. 1, B and D, and Fig. 6, B and C) or a onefactor experiment (Fig. 1C). The two factors were vector and treatment. The one factor was BBS dose (0, 1, 10, and 100 nm) or PMA. Main effects and interactions were assessed at the 0.05 level of significance. Multiple comparisons were conducted using a t statistic with the standard error computed from the residual mean square in the analysis of variance and the comparisonwise error rate with Bonferroni adjustment for the number of comparisons. Statistical computations were carried out using PROC GLM in SAS®, Release9.1 (19Cary N. SAS/STAT® 9.1 User's Guide.

Because PKD2 and PKD3 are known to play more important roles in protein transport from Golgi to the cell surface, we determined whether BON cells express these two PKD isoforms. Using realtime RT-PCR, we found that PKD1 and PKD2 are abundantly expressed; PKD3 mRNA was detectable but at very low levels in BON cells (Fig. 1A). Based on the abundant expression of PKD2 in BON cells, we further determined whether PKD2 plays a role in stimulated NT secretion. We performed transient transfections of BON cells with the kinase-dead PKD2 (PKD2KD) and PKD1 (PKD1KD) as a control. Overexpression of PKD2KD, as well as the PKD1KD, significantly decreased PMA-stimulated NT secretion (Fig. 1B, top panel). Western blot was performed using anti-GST antibody to monitor the overexpression of PKD1KD and PKD2KD (bottom panel). To rule out the possibility that overexpression of the kinase-dead PKD1 and PKD2 produces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in BON cells, Western blotting was performed using anti-CHOP antibody, which is an indicator of ER stress (20Yang G. Yang W. Wu L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16567-16576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As a positive control, BON cells were treated with thapsigargin, an inducer of ER stress (21Renna M. Caporaso M.G. Bonatti S. Kaufman R.J. Remondelli P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22499-22512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), for 16 or 24 h. Cell lysates were loaded onto gels together with the lysates from cells overexpressing the kinase-dead PKD1 and PKD2. ER stress occurred in cells treated with thapsigargin at both 16 and 24 h. In contrast, ER stress was not detected in cells overexpressing the kinase-dead PKD1 and PKD2 either in the presence or absence of PMA (data not shown). To determine whether PKD2 also regulates NT secretion mediated by physiologic stimulation, we established BON stable cell lines overexpressing GRP receptor (BON/GFP-GRPR) and treated with BBS, a hormone that stimulates NT release (10Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). BBS treatment induced NT secretion in a concentration-dependent fashion in BON/GFP-GRPR cells (Fig. 1C, left panel); NT release was not altered in parental BON cells with BBS treatment (right panel). We then performed transient transfections of kinase-dead PKD1 or PKD2 in BON/GFP-GRPR cells and treated the cells with BBS. NT secretion was significantly decreased in BON/GFP-GRPR cells overexpressing the kinase-dead PKD1 and PKD2 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, we demonstrate that PKD2, similar to PKD1, plays a role in both PMA- and BBS-stimulated NT secretion, further confirming the important roles of PKD proteins in the regulation of hormone release. PKD1 and PKD2 Exist in the Ends of the Processes of BON Cells—PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 are distributed primarily in the cytosol, Golgi, or nucleus; activated PKD proteins can shuttle between different compartments (12Van Lint J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms for the PKD1 and PKD2 regulation of PMA-stimulated NT secretion in BON cells, we next analyzed the intracellular localization of endogenous PKD1 and PKD2 in resting or activated BON cells by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Previously, we have shown that PKD1 was expressed in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus and translocated from the cytosol to the membrane upon PMA stimulation (10Li J. O'Connor K.L. Hellmich M.R. Greeley Jr., G.H. Townsend Jr., C.M. Evers B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28466-28474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In our current study, we found that the endogenous PKD1 (Fig. 2, left panel, top) and PKD2 (middle panel, top) also localized to the ends of the processes of unstimulated BON cells. This expression pattern is very similar to the location of NT-containing vesicles in BON cells (right panel, top). Discrete membrane-localized PKD1 (left panel, bottom) and PKD2 (middle panel, bottom) was noted upon PMA treatment. NT staining displayed a pattern similar to PKD1 and PKD2 in the presence of PMA (right panel, bottom). In addition, punctate structures were noted in the cytosol with all PKD1, PKD2, and NT staining. Taken together, the localization of endogenous PKD1 and PKD2 at the ends of the processes where NT vesicles are localized demonstrates the close relationship between PKD1 and PKD2 with NT vesicle release. PKD1 and PKD2 may participate in the formation of vesicles from the TGN and, therefore, regulate NT secretion. PKD1 and PKD 2 Preferentially Colocalize with NT Vesicles but Not TGN or ER—The immunostaining pattern of PKD1 and PKD2 in the ends of the processes of BON cells suggested the possibility that PKD1 and PKD2 might colocalize with NT vesicles. We next performed double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopic analysis using anti-PKD1 or -PKD2 antibodies and anti-NT antibody to detect the colocalization of endogenous PKD1 or PKD2 with endogenous NT vesicles. Both PKD1 (Fig. 3A) and PKD2 (Fig. 3B) partially colocalized with the NT-containing vesicles. To further confirm this expression pattern, we established BON cell lines expressing GFP-tagged NT (BON/GFP-NT), and immunostaining with anti-PKD1 antibody was performed. Images taken by confocal microscopy further demonstrate the colocalization of PKD1 and NT vesicles (Fig. 3C). It has been reported that PKD is partially localized with the Golgi compartments in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and in human antral gastrin-secreting cells (13Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Moore E.D. Ring M. Scriven D.R. Smith V.C. Meloche R.M. Buchan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22493-22501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To test whether this occurs in BON cells, we utilized the TGN46 antibody as a marker of TGN to perform double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopic analysis. The localization of both PKD1 and PKD2 in TGN was not noted in either untreated or PMA-treated cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the vesicles do not contain Golgi components. To determine whether PKD1 or PKD2 colocalizes with ER, we performed immunostaining using anti-calnexin or protein disulfide isomerase antibodies as ER markers. PKD1 and PKD2 did not colocalize with ER in either the presence or absence of PMA (data not shown). Taken together, our data show that both PKD1 and PKD2 are preferentially colocalized with the NT vesicles, but not with the TGN or ER, suggesting PKD1 and PKD2 may regulate NT vesicle formation and are transported along with NT vesicles to the ends of the processes. Kidins220 Is Expressed in BON Cells and Partially Colocalizes with NT Vesicles—Kidins220 was first found to be a substrate for PKD proteins (17Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Kidins220 is an integral membrane protein selectively expressed in brain and neuroendocrine cells such as PC12 cells (17Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). BON is an endocrine cell line; therefore we were interested to determine whether Kidins220 is expressed in BON cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, Kidins220 exists in the ends of the processes in untreated BON cells, which is similar to the PKD1, PKD2 and NT expression patterns (Fig. 4A, panel a). Upon PMA treatment, the expression of Kidins220 at the ends of the processes disappeared (panel b), and instead, expression on the plasma membrane was noted. Surprisingly, PMA treatment caused formation of vesicle-like structures that are Kidins220-positive and very similar to the expression pattern of PKD1 and PKD2 upon PMA treatment (panel b). Forskolin (FSK) (panel c) and PGE2 (panel d), both of which stimulate NT secretion via the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway (18Li J. O'Connor K.L. Cheng X. Mei F.C. Uchida T. Townsend Jr., C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2014288352,"Cysteinyl-leukotrienes are involved in inflammation and act on at least two G-protein-coupled receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2. However, the role of the CysLT2 receptor as well as its signaling remain poorly understood. Here we show that leukotriene (LT)C4 induced the production of the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 in endothelial cells. To further study the signaling cascade involved, HEK293 cells were stably transfected with CysLT2 and used to study the transcriptional regulation of the IL-8 promoter. Stimulation of the cells with increasing concentrations of LTC4 resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent induction of IL-8 transcription and protein synthesis. Use of IL-8 promoter mutants with substitutions in their NF-κB, AP-1, or NF-IL-6 binding elements revealed an almost total requirement for NF-κB and AP-1 elements, and a lesser requirement for the NF-IL-6 element. Overexpression of dominant-negative IκBα prevented the IL-8 transactivation induced by LTC4. LTC4 stimulation induced NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding, which involved the formation of a p50/p65 and a c-JUN·c-FOS complex, respectively. Transfection of the cells with a dominant negative (dn) form of PKCϵ prevented p65 phosphorylation, whereas dnPKCδ prevented AP-1 binding. Moreover, dnPKCδ, dnPKCϵ, and dnPKCζ prevented LTC4-induced IL-8 transcription in response to LTC4. Our data show for the first time that LTC4 can act via the CysLT2 receptor to transcriptionally activate chemokine production through induction of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. These findings suggest the potential implication of CysLT2 in the inflammatory response through the modulation of chemokine gene transcription."

The Sln1p sensor kinase has three activity states. Under normal growth conditions the activity of the Sln1p kinase is modest. Modest activity is required for viability, because loss of Sln1p kinase activity (as in the null mutant) leads to inappropriate and lethal activation of the HOG pathway (8Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Proc.

As Sln1p and other members of the SLN1 phospho-relay accumulate in the dephosphorylated form, the HOG pathway becomes activated, ultimately increasing expression of the osmotic response genes that are required for survival during osmotic stress (3Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In addition to inactivation by hyper-osmotic conditions, the Sln1p kinase can also be stimulated. An increase in kinase activity leads to shutdown of the HOG pathway and activation of the Skn7p transcription factor (9Fassler J.S. Gray W.M. Malone C.L. Tao W. Lin H. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13365-13371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sln1p kinase activation is apparent by the increase in expression of SLN1-SKN7 response genes such as OCH1 (10Li S. Dean S. Li Z. Horecka J. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and NCA3. The role of the SLN1-SKN7 pathway is not well understood. Although the sensitivity of skn7Δ mutants to oxidative stress reflecting a separate SLN1-independent role for this transcription factor in the oxidative stress-response has been reported (11Krems B. Charizanis C. Entian K.D. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), cells lacking SKN7 are neither sensitive to hyper- nor hypo-osmotic conditions. A role for the SLN1-SKN7 pathway in cell wall integrity was suggested by the original isolation of skn7 mutants on the basis of their resistance to killer factor (kre, for killer resistance) (12Brown J.L. North S. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A large body of data link Skn7p to the PKC cell wall integrity pathway (10Li S. Dean S. Li Z. Horecka J. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that the SLN1-SKN7 and the PKC pathways may function in parallel to protect cells from lysis because of the build up of turgor pressure. The role of turgor pressure in Sln1p kinase regulation was first suggested by the increased Sln1p kinase activity in mutants lacking the major glycerol efflux channel, Fps1p (1Tao W. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The absence of the glycerol channel leads to osmotic imbalance because of the accumulation of intracellular glycerol and the subsequent uptake of water (1Tao W. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 360-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Luyten K. Albertyn J. Skibbe W.F. Prior B.A. Ramos J. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S.

Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Also consistent with a mechanical signal involving the presence or absence of pressure against the wall is the observation that reduced turgor caused by treatment of cells with reagents such as nystatin, which increases membrane permeability and causes cell shrinkage, caused a reduction in Sln1p kinase activity and a consequent increase in Hog1p activity in the absence of an osmotic stimulus (2Reiser V. Raitt D.C. Saito H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In a recent screen of the yeast deletion collection for mutants with increased SLN1-SKN7 pathway activity, we identified a specific component of the cell wall that affects the activity of the SLN1-SKN7 pathway. Although genes involved in cell wall integrity had previously been identified as targets of the pathway (10Li S. Dean S. Li Z. Horecka J. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the role of specific wall components in osmotic stress sensing and signaling has not received much attention. Here we find that the relative abundance in the wall of the abundant GPI-anchored wall mannoprotein, Ccw12p, affects SLN1-SKN7 pathway activity. A working model in which the Ccw12 protein plays a special role in maintaining the Sln1 kinase in the repressed state is proposed. Conditions leading to reductions or loss of the Ccw12 protein from the cell wall are predicted to cause activation of the SLN1-SKN7 pathway. Strains—Strains were constructed for these experiments or are from the Fassler laboratory collection (Table 1). Disruption of CCW12, SED1, and YLR111W and PPZ1 and PPZ2 in the S288C background (JF1565) was accomplished by PCR-mediated one-step gene disruption with a kanamycin (CCW12 and YLR111W) or HIS3 (SED1) cassette flanked by homologous tails. CCW12-F–300 (5′-ATAGGATCCCCATTTCGCGGCCAC-3′) and CCW12-R+1000 (5′-CGGATATCAGACACCACACACATCAAGTTTG-3′) primers were used to amplify a CCW12-KanR PCR fragment; YLR111W-F (5′-AGCGGATCCAGTGTAAGAGGTGACAGAGTG-3′) and YLR111W-R (5′-GATGAGCTCAACTGTAAACAGGTACAATGC-3′) primers were used to amplify a YLR111W-KanR PCR fragment; PPZ1-F–242 (5′-AAGCACAATACAATAGCTTCCA-3′) and PPZ1-R+2291 (5′-GTATAGAGCGAATGAGCATTCA-3′) primers were used to amplify a PPZ1-KanR PCR fragment; and PPZ2-F–202 (5′-TGCGTAAGAAATACACATATAGT-3′) and PPZ2-R+2231 (5′-CTATAACGACAACTTTATCGGCGA-3′) primers were used to amplify a PPZ2-KanR PCR fragment. Templates were genomic DNA prepared from the appropriate deletions from the Research Genetics disruption collection in strain BY4742 (19Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S.

Disruptions were confirmed by genomic PCR. The ppz1 and ppz2 disruption strains were crossed to generate the double mutant.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyGenotypeDerivationJF1565MATα canR cyhR his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 ura3-52 trp1Δ63 lys2Δ202Ref. 1Tao W.

Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHJ1497 and pHJ1498 are subclones of pHJ1470 in pRS313. A 1.6-kb NcoI fragment encompassing the open reading frames of CCW12 and the adjacent hypothetical open reading frame YLR111W was cloned into Litmus28 (New England Biolabs) to generate plasmid pJF1558. The 1.6-kb fragment was isolated by XhoI and StuI digestion and introduced into XhoI-SmaI cut pRS313 vector to generate pSS1559. pSS1560 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the start codon of YLR111W in pSS1558 using primers YLR111W-12F (5′-GGTGGCCGCGATATCGGGAATTCCAAAAACAAACGG-3′) and YLR111W-12R (5′-CCGTTTGTTTTTGGAATTCCCGATATCGCGGCCACC-3′). The mutagenized 1.6-kb fragment was then cloned into pRS313 to generate pSS1560. pCLM1774 is a derivative of pCLM994 (21Tao W. Malone C.L. Ault A.D. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in which amino acids 76–305 were deleted using a two-step PCR protocol. The product was cloned into pCLM994 using EcoRI and StuI sites. Primer sequences for the two-step PCR are available on request.TABLE 2Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidDescriptionRef.pSL1156CEN URA3 plasmid with OCH1 promoter fragment -154 to +26 (minimal promoter) cloned upstream of the lacZ gene10Li S.

Dean S. Li Z. Horecka J. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using an adaptation of the micro-scale protocol of the Frozen-EZ yeast transformation kit (Zymo Research Corp.). Briefly, cells of each deletion strain were made competent following growth in a microtiter dish by pelleting the cells, discarding the supernatant, washing the pellet in EZ1 solution, and resuspending the cells in EZ2 + EZ3 + DNA. Following incubation at 30 °C for 45–90 min, cells were spread over one-quarter of an SC-Ura plate. After working out the procedure manually, all but the spreading was accomplished robotically. Transformants were replica-plated to 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates, and those exhibiting an elevated blue color were further tested for the specificity of the response using pJF1156 (POCH1-lacZ, a lacZ reporter regulated by the basal OCH1 promoter) and activities determined in liquid assays. High Copy Suppressor Screen—The ccw12 deletion strain was transformed with the YEp13 high copy library. Transformants were replica-plated for resistance to hygromycin B. Hygromycin B-resistant suppressors were also isolated by direct selection on hygromycin B plates. Candidate high copy suppressor plasmids were isolated from yeast, amplified in Escherichia coli, and reintroduced into the mutant. Plasmids that improved the hygromycin B phenotype of the ccw12 mutant upon retransformation were sequenced, and suppressor genes were identified by comparison of the sequence with the yeast genome data base. Tests of SLN1-SKN7 Activation by Hypotonic Conditions and by Zymolyase Treatment—For hypotonic conditions, log phase cultures grown at 30 °C in YPD were diluted 1:1 with water. Aliquots removed at various times following dilution were subjected to filtration and the filters immediately frozen at –70 °C. Cells from frozen filters were resuspended in water and collected by low speed centrifugation for RNA or protein extraction. For zymolyase treatment, 1 unit/ml zymolyase was directly added to log phase cultures growing in YPD after adjusting the pH of the culture with Na2HPO4 to a final concentration of 20 mm (2Reiser V. Raitt D.C. Saito H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Zymolyase negative controls were also adjusted to 20 mm Na2HPO4. Reducing agents were not added. Following incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until needed. Where plasmid retention was an issue, cultures were grown in selective media overnight and then subcultured in YPD for approximately two generations prior to harvesting at log phase. HOG Pathway Activation—Cultures were grown selectively overnight and subcultured in YPD. At a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml, 4 m NaCl in YPD was added to a final concentration of 0.4 m. Ten-ml aliquots were taken at 0, 2, 4, and 10 min. Aliquots were filtered and the filters immediately placed on dry ice. Cells were washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pelleted, and disrupted in 16% trichloroacetic acid plus glass beads. Following centrifugation of the lysate, the pellet was resuspended in loading buffer (150 mm Tris base, 10 mm EDTA, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol), boiled 10 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Intracellular Glycerol Measurements—Intracellular glycerol was assayed enzymatically with a commercial glycerol determination kit (Roche Applied Science). Glycerol levels were normalized to cell dry weight. Extracts were prepared from log phase cultures grown in selective media. Pelleted cells were washed once with chilled selective media and once with 2 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 2 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. 500 μl of the cell suspension was heated at 100 °C for 10 min and pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was used to determine glycerol levels as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cell dry weight was determined by filtering 1.5 ml of the cell suspension through pre-weighed 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Whatman). After drying at 70 °C for 2 h, filters were weighed, and the difference in weight was used to calculate cell dry weight. Intracellular glycerol levels were expressed as the average of six different assays using at least three different colonies per strain. Plate Assays—Log phase cultures (∼107 cells/ml) were diluted in YPD, and 100, 10–1, 10–2, and 10–3 dilutions were spotted on plates containing YPD or YPD plus hygromycin B (15–50 μg/ml), Calcofluor White (30 μg/ml), or Congo Red (30 μg/ml). Survival following hypo-osmotic stress was performed using log phase cells grown in YPD plus 1 m sorbitol. Cultures were diluted in the same medium and spotted on YPD with (iso-osmotic) or without sorbitol (hypo-osmotic) and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cultures were grown selectively at 30 °C and harvested at 107 cells/ml. Yeast protein extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis and extracts cleared by centrifugation. Activities were calculated in Miller units (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 354Google Scholar), normalized to protein levels, and expressed as the average of four to six assays using at least three independent colonies or transformants. Northern (RNA) Hybridization Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using the hot acidic phenol method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.E. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar) from cultures grown to ∼107 cells/ml in suitable medium. 20 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane of a 1% formaldehyde, 1× MOPS, 1% agarose gel and electrophoresis carried out at 75 V for 4 h. Hybridization was performed with PerfectHyb hybridization buffer (Sigma) as directed by the manufacturer. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by using random primers with Prime-It random priming labeling kit (Stratagene) and the PCR fragments listed. Signals were detected and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Western Analysis—Extracts were prepared from frozen cell pellets by glass bead breakage in protein extraction buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). 20 μg of cleared (13,000 rpm, 5 min) extract was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel electrophoresis (10% running gel and 4% stacking gel). Separated proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose filter paper (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was stained with Ponceau S, washed, and scanned. Following destaining, the blot was blocked with 5% skim milk, incubated with the appropriate antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin, washed, incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma), and exposed to film. Antibodies included phospho-p38 antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling); yC-20 anti-Hog1 antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (1:1000, Roche Applied Science); antiphospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling); and anti-Myc antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling). Blots were developed using the SuperSignal bioluminescence kit (Pierce). Dithiothreitol Extraction of Ccw12-HA from Intact Cells—The cells pellet from a 10-ml culture at ∼107 cells/ml was washed with 1:5 volume 0.25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 1:10 volume of the same buffer. 1 m DTT was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 mm and incubated at 4 °C with shaking for 2 h. Cells were collected by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed. Cell pellets from DTT-extracted cells were used in preparing the “post-DTT” cell extract. Fluorescence Microscopy—Log phase cultures expressing GFP fusions were pelleted and resuspended in residual culture medium. Cells were observed with a Leica DM RBE microscope and a Leica ×100 PL Fluotar 1.3 NA objective lens. Fluorescence images were captured using a Photonic Science digital charge-coupled device camera system. Images were processed and edited using Adobe Photoshop. CCW12 Involvement in SLN1-SKN7 Signaling—A screen of the yeast deletion collection (Research Genetics) based on increased expression of a lacZ reporter driven by the promoter of the SLN1-SKN7 target gene, OCH1 (POCH-lacZ) (10Li S. Dean S. Li Z. Horecka J. Deschenes R.J. Fassler J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), led to the identification of the YLR111W open reading frame and the CCW12 gene (YLR110C) as potential regulators of SLN1-SKN7 pathway activity. 3Z. Li and J. S. Fassler, unpublished data. The short distance (330 bp) between ATGs of the two divergently transcribed open reading frames suggested that one deletion might eliminate the regulatory region required for expression of the other. To determine the open reading frame responsible for normal SLN1-SKN7 pathway activity, subclones were tested for complementation (Fig. 1). A subclone containing CCW12 and associated upstream regulatory sequence partially complemented the elevated reporter gene expression seen in the ccw12 and ylr111w mutants (vector); however, the same was not true of YLR111W. Because full complementation of the phenotype required both the CCW12 and YLR111W open reading frames, the pertinence of the YLR111W open reading frame was more directly tested by introducing a mutation into its predicted start codon (Fig. 1). The ATG mutant (pSS1560) complemented the ccw12 deletion phenotype to the same extent as the equivalent construct lacking the mutation (pSS1559), confirming that activation of SLN1-SKN7 signaling in the YLR111W deletion mutant was indirect.

The selective addition of GalNAc to these glycoproteins requires that the β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (βGT) recognize both the oligosaccharide acceptor and a peptide recognition determinant on the substrate glycoprotein. We report here that two recently cloned βGTs, βGT3 and βGT4, that are able to transfer GalNAc to GlcNAc in β1,4-linkage display the necessary glycoprotein specificity in vivo. Both βGTs transfer GalNAc to N-linked oligosaccharides on the luteinizing hormone α subunit and CA6 but not to those on transferrin (Trf). A single peptide recognition determinant encoded in the carboxyl-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of bovine CA6 mediates transfer of GalNAc to each of its two N-linked oligosaccharides. The addition of this 19-amino acid sequence to the carboxyl terminus of Trf confers full acceptor activity onto Trf for both βGT3 and βGT4 in vivo. The complete 19-amino acid sequence is required for optimal GalNAc addition in vivo, indicating that the peptide sequence is both necessary and sufficient for recognition by βGT3 and βGT4.

However, understanding the molecular basis for recognition ultimately requires that a recognition determinant that does not itself comprise the site of modification can be added to a structurally unrelated glycoprotein and confer selective modification of this unrelated glycoprotein.

By expressing these chimeric glycoproteins in cells that express either βGT3 or βGT4, we were able to quantitatively compare their extent of modification with β1,4-linked GalNAc in vivo. Using this approach we show that βGT3 and βGT4 are indeed protein-specific, recognizing a peptide determinant in the protein substrate to allow efficient and protein-selective transfer of GalNAc to their oligosaccharides. We have identified a 19-amino acid sequence that is both necessary and sufficient to mediate protein-specific GalNAc addition by βGT3 and βGT4. The addition of this sequence to a glycoprotein that is not recognized by either βGT3 or βGT4 converts the glycoprotein into one that is selectively modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc in vivo.

Each expression plasmid was made from pcDNA3.1 with a cytomegalovirus promoter to drive expression (Invitrogen). The chimeric glycoproteins α-RLuc and Trf-RLuc consist of the glycoprotein hormone α subunit or Trf followed by RLuc epitope-tagged at its carboxyl terminus with V5His. RLuc-CA6 and RLuc-α were constructed using the pSec-Tag expression plasmid (Invitrogen) and consist of the IgK leader sequence followed by RLuc and CA6 or α epitope-tagged at their carboxyl termini with MycHis. pCMV-GLuc was obtained from New England Biolabs. The GLuc constructs in each case consist of GLuc followed by α, Trf, or CA6 and the epitope MycHis. Because GLuc is a secreted protein, no additional leader is required, and the leader sequences of α, Trf, and CA6 were omitted from the constructs. All of the cDNAs were amplified using Klentaq Long and Accurate DNA polymerase (KTLA polymerase) (36Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A schematic of the key luciferase chimeras generated including the locations of the glycosylation sites and the amino acid sequences that constitute the recognition sequences is shown in Fig. 1. Cell Lines—HEK 293T cells were maintained in Pro293ACDM medium (Lonza). Individual clones of Flp-In™ CHO (Invitrogen) cells expressing βGT3 (βGT3/CHO) or βGT4 (βGT4/CHO) under control of the EF-1α promoter were prepared and characterized as described elsewhere. 6N. M. J. Blake, Y. Mi, E. L. Oates, M. Beranek, and J. U. Baenziger, submitted for publication. βGT3/CHO and βGT4/CHO were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 600 μg/ml hygromycin. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen). Biotinylated Wisteria Floribundia Agglutinin (WFA)—WFA (1 mg) (Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m NA2CO3 at 4 °C. Six hundred μg of aminohexanoyl-biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide dissolved in 120 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the dialyzed WFA. The reaction was dialyzed against 0.1 m Na2CO3 4 °C overnight and then against PBS. The biotinylated WFA was stored in aliquots at –20 °C until use. Assay for GalNAc Addition to Luciferase Chimeras—Microlite-2 96-well plates were coated with Streptavidin (Roche Applied Science) by adding 100 μl of 25 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 μg of streptavidin and incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. The plates were then washed six times with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) using a Bio-Rad Immunowasher. Biotinylated WFA (0.25 μgin100 μl of PBS/well) was incubated with the immobilized streptavidin overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed six times with 300 μl of cold PBS, 0.1% BSA and then blocked by incubating for 30 min at 25 °C with 300 μl of PBS, 5% BSA. After washing six times with PBS, 0.1% BSA, aliquots of luciferase chimeras containing 50,000 light units (LU) of luciferase activity in 100 μl of PBS, 0.1% BSA were incubated with the biotinylated WFA-coated wells for 4 h at 4°C in the presence or absence of 50 mm GalNAc. The wells were washed six times with PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 20 μl of PBS was added to each well. The amount of bound luciferase activity was measured using a Wallac Victor2 luminometer by injecting 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer containing freshly diluted coelenterazine (New England Biolabs) into each individual well and determining the LU produced over a period of 10 s. The GalNAc-specific LU bound were calculated by subtracting the LU bound in presence of 50 mm GalNAc from the LU bound in the absence of GalNAc. The background in each case was less than 250 LU and was subtracted from the analyses shown. Protein-selective Addition of GalNAc to CA6—Bovine CA6, a secreted form of carbonic anhydrase, bears N-linked oligosaccharides that are modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc when it is expressed by salivary or lachrymal glands (16Hooper L.V.

When native CA6(Wt) epitope-tagged with V5His at its carboxyl terminus is expressed in HEK 293T cells, at least 51% of the secreted CA6(Wt) is bound by immobilized WFA, a lectin that binds oligosaccharides bearing terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc (42Mengeling B.J. Smith P.L. Stults N.L. Smith D.F. Baenziger J.U. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Torres B.R. McCrumb D.K. Smith D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Even though the β1,4-linked GalNAc added to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins expressed by HEK 293T cells can be further modified with either SO4 or α2,6-linked sialic acid, little CA6(Wt) remains in the unbound fraction. The major fraction of bound CA6(Wt) is selectively eluted with GalNAc (Fig. 2, lanes E1–E4). The CA6(Wt) eluted by warming in SDS-PAGE loading buffer reflects the inefficiency of elution with GalNAc because CA6(Wt) expressed in CHO cells does not contain any GalNAc and is not retained by immobilized WFA (not shown). Thus, the N-linked oligosaccharides on CA6(Wt) expressed in HEK 293T cells are modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc, suggesting that, like the glycoprotein hormone α subunit, CA6(Wt) has a recognition determinant that results in its selective modification with GalNAc when expressed by HEK 293T cells. The 19-amino acid sequence located at the carboxyl terminus of bovine CA6 contains 8 basic amino acids (see CA6(Wt) in Fig. 1). Modeling programs such as that of Chou and Fasman (44Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar) predict that this sequence is likely to form an α helix. This region of CA6 may therefore resemble the PLRSKK sequence of the glycoprotein hormone α subunit that forms an α helix in the dimeric form of the hormone (45Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 46Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E.

Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sequence KRKKEK was therefore deleted from the carboxyl-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of CA6 (see CA6(Mu1) in Fig. 1). In contrast to CA6(Wt), less than 13% of the CA6(Mu1) produced by HEK 293T cells is bound by immobilized WFA and eluted from the WFA by GalNAc. Furthermore, little CA6(Mu1) is subsequently eluted by SDS-PAGE loading buffer (see Fig. 2). CA6 therefore contains a recognition determinant that is utilized by the βGT(s) expressed by HEK 293T cells, and the KRKKEK sequence is a critical element of this recognition sequence. Luciferase Chimeras Replicate the Properties of Native Glycoproteins in Vivo—Western blot analysis for quantitation of the amount of a glycoprotein that is modified with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc when expressed in different cells is cumbersome. We therefore prepared chimeric glycoproteins that consist of either RLuc or GLuc and the glycoprotein of interest (Fig. 1). The RLuc chimeras consist of the glycoprotein followed by RLuc at the carboxyl terminus followed by the V5His epitope. α-RLuc, Trf-RLuc, and CA6-RLuc are efficiently secreted into the culture medium following transfection of cultured HEK 293T and CHO/Flp-In cells (not shown). The extent of GalNAc addition to each of these luciferase chimeras can be compared by immobilizing biotinylated WFA onto streptavidin coated 96-well plates, capturing GalNAc-containing chimeras onto the immobilized WFA, removing unbound chimera, and quantitating the amount of luciferase activity that has been bound using coelenterazine. α-RLuc and Trf-RLuc Were Transfected into CHO/Flp—In cells expressing a single copy of either βGT3 (Fig. 3A) or βGT4 (Fig. 3B), the amount of luciferase activity bound, expressed as LU bound per 50,000 LU of input, was 6-fold greater for α-RLuc than Trf-RLuc for both βGT3/CHO and βGT4/CHO cells. Mutation of the glycosylation site (NVT to QVT) immediately adjacent to the PLRSKK sequence that we previously determined is essential for recognition using in vitro assays (26Mengeling B.J. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) completely abolishes GalNAc addition to α(QVT)-RLuc. In contrast, mutation of the glycosylation site more distant from the PLRSKK sequence (NHT to QHT) reduces but does not abolish GalNAc addition to α(QHT)-RLuc. Thus, α-RLuc is efficiently modified by both βGT3 and βGT4 in vivo, whereas Trf-RLuc is not efficiently modified by either βGT. The properties of α-RLuc and Trf-RLuc agree with our in vitro studies showing the free α subunit contains a peptide sequence that is recognized by βGT and as a result is modified with a catalytic efficiency that is 500-fold greater than for glycoproteins that do not contain a recognition determinant for the βGT (23Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Science. 1988; 242: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the oligosaccharide added to NVT appears to be the predominant target for GalNAc addition in the α-RLuc chimera. The CA6-RLuc chimera expressed by either HEK 293T cells, βGT3/CHO cells, or βGT4/CHO cells is not bound by immobilized WFA, indicating GalNAc is not added to this construct (not shown). Because the KRKKEK sequence that is essential for efficient GalNAc addition to CA6(Wt) is located at the carboxyl terminus, we prepared chimeras in which the RLuc preceded the α and CA6 sequences. RLuc-α, like α-RLuc, is secreted into the medium and is modified with GalNAc when expressed in either βGT3/CHO or βGT4/CHO cells, indicating the location of the RLuc is not critical for recognition of the α subunit by either βGT3 or βGT4 (compare Fig. 3, A and B, with Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, RLuc-CA6(Wt), unlike CA6(Wt)-RLuc, is efficiently modified with GalNAc when it is expressed in either βGT3/CHO or βGT4/CHO cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the presence of the MycHis epitope at the carboxyl terminus of CA6(Wt) does not interfere with recognition by either βGT3 or βGT4, whereas the presence of the much larger luciferase sequence at the carboxyl terminus of CA6 is sufficient to prevent recognition. As was seen with CA6(Wt), deletion of the KRKKEK sequence from RLuc-CA6(Wt) to generate RLuc-CA6(Mu1) markedly reduces GalNAc addition by βGT3 (Fig. 4A) and by βGT4 (Fig. 4B). Mutation of each individual Asn glycosylation site alone reduces but does not abolish GalNAc addition to either RLuc-CA6(QLT) or RLuc-CA6(QET). Mutation of both sites completely abolishes GalNAc addition to RLuc-CA6(QLT/QET). The results obtained with RLuc-CA6 indicate that βGT3 and βGT4 utilize the same recognition determinant in vivo and are able to transfer GalNAc to Asn-linked oligosaccharides at two different glycosylation sites on CA6. Recognition by βGT3 and βGT4 Can Be Conferred onto Transferrin by Adding Sequences from CA6—GLuc is a naturally secreted form of luciferase that is significantly more stable than RLuc following secretion into the medium of cultured cells (34Verhaegent M. Christopoulos T.K. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4378-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 35Tannous B.A. Kim D.E. Fernandez J.L. Weissleder R. Breake-field X.O. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In each case >95% of the chimeric glycoprotein is secreted into the medium following transfection. Levels of expression were similar for each of these constructs with 1–10 × 106 light units of luciferase activity present per 5 μl of medium. The constructs shown in Fig. 1 were prepared and compared with RLuc chimeras (Fig. 5). As was seen with the RLuc chimeras, Gluc-α is modified with GalNAc when it is expressed in either βGT3/CHO or βGT4/CHO cells, whereas GLuc-Trf is not efficiently modified with GalNAc. Mutation of the key basic residues in α from PLRSKK to PLESEE (Fig. 1) reduces GalNAc addition to GLuc-α(PLESEE) by either βGT3 or βGT4 to the level seen for GLuc-Trf (Fig. 5, A and B). Adding the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids from CA6 to GLuc-Trf yields a form of Trf, GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19) that is modified to a greater extent than GLuc-α with GalNAc by both βGT3 and βGT4 (Fig. 5, A and B). The amount of GalNAc added to GLuc-Trf by βGT3 and βGT4 is increased 8-fold and 18-fold, respectively, in the presence of the carboxyl-terminal 19-amino acid sequence from CA6. The addition of only the carboxyl-terminal 9 amino acids that contain the KRKKEK sequence, GLuc-Trf-CA6(11–19) in Fig. 5, only increases GalNAc addition to GLuc-Trf by βGT3 and βGT4 2.0- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Thus, the KRKKEK sequence does not have all the information required for recognition by either βGT3 or βGT4. Because the first 10 amino acids within the 19-amino acid sequence added to GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19) also contain basic residues, we prepared GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–10) that does not contain the final 9 amino acids including the KRKKEK sequence. Like GLuc-Trf-CA6(11–19), GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–10) is modified with GalNAc when expressed in βGT3/CHO and βGT4/CHO cells (Fig. 6, A and B) but not to the same extent as GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19). Furthermore a construct containing the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of CA6, GLuc-Trf-CA6(6–19) was also examined (Fig. 6, C and D). Like GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–10) and GLuc-Trf-CA6(11–19), GLuc-Trf-CA6(6–19) is modified to greater extent than GLuc-Trf but not to the same extent as GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19) (Fig. 6, C and D). Thus, the full 19-amino acid sequence from the carboxyl terminus of CA6 is needed to for optimal modification of N-linked oligosaccharides on Trf chimeras by βGT3 and βGT4 in vivo. Our studies using RLuc and GLuc glycoprotein chimeras establish that βGT3 and βGT4 are protein-selective glycosyltransferases in vivo. Both βGTs selectively transfer GalNAc to N-linked oligosaccharides on the pituitary glycoprotein hormone α subunit and on CA6 but not to the identical oligosaccharide acceptors on glycoproteins such as Trf. Adding the 19-amino acid sequence from the carboxyl terminus of CA6 to the carboxyl terminus of Trf converts GLuc-Trf into a glycoprotein that is selectively modified by βGT3 and by βGT4. This outcome is particularly remarkable because Trf has no structural relationship to either the α subunit or to CA6. The crystal structure of human serum transferrin has recently been solved (47Wally J. Halbrooks P.J. Vonrhein C. Rould M.A. Everse S.J. Mason A.B. Buchanan S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24934-24944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn413 and Asn611 are located on adjacent loops of peptide and are both in close proximity to the carboxyl terminus of Trf. The addition of the recognition sequence to Trf may serve to mediate transfer of GalNAc to both N-linked oligosaccharides as it does in CA6. Because this 19-amino acid sequence is sufficient to confer recognition onto RLuc-Trf in vivo by both βGT3 and βGT4, it is likely that the same key residues serve to mediate recognition by both βGTs. Furthermore, because peptide recognition and GalNAc transfer to terminal GlcNAc represent distinct interactions, the addition of this sequence to virtually any glycoprotein will likely confer recognition by βGT3 and βGT4 and selective modification of accessible N-linked oligosaccharides with β1,4-linked GalNAc in vivo. The N-linked oligosaccharide acceptor that is modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc on glycoproteins such as the glycoprotein hormone LH and CA6 is identical in structure to the N-linked oligosaccharide acceptors on glycoproteins that are not modified with GalNAc but are instead modified with β1,4-linked Gal. This led us to hypothesize the existence of a peptide recognition determinant located on glycoproteins that could be selectively modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc-containing structures. We confirmed this by comparing glycoproteins that do and do not contain a recognition determinant as acceptors for GalNAc addition in in vitro assays using solubilized enzymes. Now we have definitively demonstrated that in vivo the same recognition determinant is utilized by cells expressing βGTs endogenously and that the presence of the recognition determinant is necessary for efficient modification with β1,4-linked GalNAc. Using in vitro analyses, we identified the basic amino acids in the sequence PLRSKK that is found in the α subunit as being essential for recognition by the βGT activity present in the pituitary. The lack of GalNAc transfer to Gluc-α(PLESEE) by either βGT3 or βGT4 now provides the in vivo demonstration that the basic amino acids in the PLRSKK sequence are indeed critical elements of the recognition determinant. Similarly, the marked reduction in GalNAc transfer by βGT3 and βGT4 to GLuc-CA6(Mu1) that has had the KRKKEK sequence deleted indicates that basic amino acids are critical elements of the recognition determinant in CA6. The results obtained with Gluc-α(PLESEE) and GLuc-CA6(Mu1) show that the basic amino acids within these sequences are necessary for recognition in vivo. The conversion of Trf, a glycoprotein that has no structural relationship to glycoproteins known to be modified with β1,4-linked GalNAc, into a substrate for GalNAc addition by βGT in vivo allows us for the first time to describe a sequence that is sufficient to mediate recognition. The addition of the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids of CA6, LRRFIEQKITKRKKEKYWP, to the carboxyl terminus of Trf results in a glycoprotein GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19) that becomes modified with GalNAc by both βGT3 and βGT4 to the same or a greater extent than GLuc-α in vivo. The 19-amino acid sequence is therefore sufficient to confer recognition by βGT3 and βGT4 in vivo. GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–10), GLuc-Trf-CA6(11–19), and GLuc-Trf-CA6(6–19) are also modified withβ1,4-linked GalNAc in vivo but not to the same extent as GLuc-Trf-CA6(1–19). Thus, the first 10, the last 9, and even the last 14 amino acids of this 19-amino acid sequence are individually able to confer some recognition by βGT3 and βGT4 in vivo; however, the full 19-amino acid sequence is significantly more effective. This 19-amino acid sequence is therefore sufficient for recognition in vivo by both βGT3 and βGT4, and the entire sequence is necessary to obtain maximal transfer of GalNAc in vivo. The inability of CA6(11–19) to confer as much transfer of GalNAc to GLuc-Trf as CA6(1–19) indicates that a cluster of basic residues alone is not sufficient to mediate recognition.

Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar), and each of the secondary prediction algorithms available at www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk indicate that this sequence forms an α helix. Thus, it is possible that the requirement for the entire 19-amino acid sequence reflects the need to attain a specific secondary structure that places specific basic residues in the correct spatial relationship to interact with βGT3 and βGT4. The ability to confer recognition by both βGT3 and βGT4 onto GLuc-Trf by adding the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids from CA6 indicates that the key elements of this sequence that are recognized by these closely related transferases are similar if not identical. The fact that a single recognition determinant can serve to mediate GalNAc addition to two distinct N-linked oligosaccharides on CA6 and can confer recognition onto an unrelated glycoprotein, i.e. Trf, indicates that the peptide recognition determinant does not interact directly with the oligosaccharide acceptor. Rather the peptide recognition determinant and the oligosaccharide acceptor interact with βGT3 and βGT4 independently. βGT3 and βGT4 are large glycosyltransferases consisting of 987 and 1035 amino acids, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal regions of βGT3 and βGT4, consisting of 226 and 231 amino acids, respectively, are 68% identical and contain sequences that are characteristic of β1,4-glycosyltransferases (28Sato T.

This region is presumed to encode the actual catalytic activity; however, neither the region that mediates peptide recognition nor the function of the other regions of these transferases is known. Because the 19-amino acid sequence from the carboxyl terminus of CA6 is sufficient to mediate recognition in vivo and in vitro, it is now possible to devise strategies that will allow us to identify the key features of this determinant that are required for optimal recognition. It should also be possible to locate the regions of βGT3 and βGT4 that bind the recognition determinant. The synthesis of glycoproteins bearing N-linked structures containing β1,4-linked GalNAc is a highly regulated process in vivo, requiring the expression of both the appropriate transferases and glycoproteins that have a recognition determinant. In the case of the glycoprotein hormone LH, the structure of the N-linked sugars plays a critical role in determining in vivo clearance rates and potency (14Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11 (abstr. 45)Google Scholar). The highly regulated and selective addition of GalNAc generates unique structures that may play a number of different roles in vivo. Defining the key features of this 19-amino acid recognition determinant will allow us to identify additional glycoproteins that may also bear this unique modification. The addition of β1,4-linked GalNAc is among the best characterized forms of protein-selective carbohydrate modification. Understanding how the selective addition of GalNAc is determined will provide a useful paradigm for understanding how regulation of the synthesis of specific carbohydrate structures contributes to biologic function in vivo."

Internalization of a fluoresceinated Fl-G11-scFv-Int(+) construct was observed in intact human cultured cells with confocal microscopy. After 5 h of incubation in medium containing 1 microM Fl-G11-scFv-Int(+) or Fl-G11-scFv-Int(-), fluorescence intensity was determined in individual cells, both for cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments: concentration levels of Fl-G11-scFv-Int(+), relative to the extracellular culture medium concentration, were 4-5 times higher in the cytoplasm, 7-8 times higher in the nucleus, and 10 times higher in the nucleoli. In the same experimental conditions, the Fl-G11-scFv-Int(-) construct was 3-4 times more concentrated outside of the cells than inside. Cell membranes kept their integrity after 5 h of incubation. The antiproliferative activity of our miniantibody was studied on HCT116 cells.

Unlike the Raf-1/ERK pathway, which responds to mitogens, Tpl2 signaling is activated by TLR or proinflammatory cytokine stimulation (26Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D.

In an interesting convergence of regulation, Tpl2 is bound by NFκB in unstimulated cells, which prevents Tpl2 phosphorylation of MEK1 (29Cho J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2350-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tpl2–/– mice exhibit a reduction in TNF-α nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport (26Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D.

The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of TNF-α mRNA shifts from 20% nuclear and 80% cytoplasmic in Tpl2+/+ animals to about 60% nuclear and 40% cytoplasmic in Tpl2–/– animals. We examined the effect of combined MAP kinase pathway inhibition on TNF-α posttranscriptional expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage cell line widely used to study TNF-α production. Although these studies confirmed previous findings regarding the importance of the p38 pathway and TNF-α posttranscriptional regulation, our results using a TNF-α 3′-UTR reporter failed to recapitulate the previously reported effect of ERK inhibition on TNF-α nuclear export. The TNF-α gene contains three introns and intron splicing results in deposition of exon junction complex (EJC) proteins on the message (30Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim V.N. Velazquez F. Perkinson R.A.

Following splicing, proteins of the EJC recruit proteins that regulate mRNA nuclear export (33Custodio N. Carvalho C. Condado I. Antoniou M. Blencowe B.J. Carmo-Fonseca M. RNA. 2004; 10: 622-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that EJC recruitment was required for the ERK regulation of TNF-α mRNA nuclear export. To test this hypothesis, we generated constructs containing different TNF-α introns as well as artificial introns. These data demonstrate that ERK inhibition did not alter the nuclear cytoplasmic distribution of intronless or ARE–/– TNF-α 3′-UTR message constructs. In contrast, TNF-α constructs containing both an ARE and an intron were retained in the nucleus to the same degree as endogenous TNF-α message in macrophages treated with PD98059 (26Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Further work demonstrated that the effect of ERK inhibition is mediated specifically by ERK1, as dominant negative ERK2 did not reduce TNF-α 3′-UTR-mediated luciferase expression from intron-containing constructs. We tested two known TNF-α ARE binding proteins, tristetraprolin (TTP) and HuR, to determine if either was necessary for ERK-regulated TNF-α mRNA nuclear export. Using a TTP-negative cell line and HuR RNAi, these data demonstrate that neither TTP nor HuR is required for ERK-regulated TNF-α nuclear export. In order to examine which EJC proteins are involved, we performed tethering assays, in which EJC proteins are bound to target RNAs via a heterologous RNA-binding domain. TAP, NxT1, Aly, and UAP56 were fused to the bacteriophage P22 N-peptide and used with constructs containing the B-box nucleotide sequence. The N-peptide specifically binds to the B-box sequence in the mRNA, tethering the EJC protein to the message in the absence of an intron. These studies demonstrate that the interaction of the TAP-NxT1 complex, but not Aly or UAP56, was required for ERK1-regulated nuclear export. Together, these data establish a link between proteins bound to the ARE and proteins of the ECJ in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. MaterialsLPS (Escherichia coli 026:B6), and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 (2.5 μm), ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm), and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) were purchased from Calbiochem. VectorsTNF-α luciferase constructs were generated from genomic DNA and mRNA using either the pGL3 control vector or pRL-CMV Renilla vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The same primer pairs were used to generate constructs from both genomic and message sources. Constructs made from mRNA were as follows: pGL3-TNF 3′-UTR-complete human TNF-α 3′-UTR, nucleotides 855–1643; pGL3 TNF No Intron 3, nucleotides 396–1643; TNF Renilla, nucleotides 855–1643 in the pRL-CMV vector. Genomic constructs were as follows: pGL3 TNF Intron 3, nucleotides 1833–3381; TNF Intron 3 ΔARE, nucleotides 1833–2909 and 3131–3381 generated by cutting pGL3 TNF Intron 3 with PstI and BaeI. pGL3 TNF Intron 2 was made by amplifying the second intron using the primers CTAGTGCCCTCTGGCCCAGGCAGT (sense) and ACTAGTAGGCTTGTCACTCGGGGTTCG (antisense) and cloning this fragment into an engineered SpeI site of the TNF 3′-UTR constructs. The SpeI site is 5 nucleotides downstream from the luciferase stop codon. Finally, we cloned four repeats of the B-box binding site into the SfiI site in the 5′-UTR of the luciferase gene in pGL3, both control and TNF-α 3′-UTR, as described by Wiegand et al.

For RNAi experiments, RAW264.7 cells were plated on day 1, transfected with RNAi oligonucleotides on day 2, and transfected with RNAi oligonucleotides and luciferase reporter on day 3, and luciferase values were read on day 4. For each experiment, TNF luciferase values were normalized to luciferase expression from the pGL3 control vector. TNF luciferase values were then expressed as a percentage of the luciferase expression with no treatment (luciferase value for treatment X/luciferase value no treatment). Northern BlottingCytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were generated as previously described (37Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F.

Northern blots were performed using the standard MOPS/formaldehyde method and capillary transfer. Random primed probes against luciferase and H2AX were generated by the random prime method using biotinylated dCTP. Blots were hybridized using UltraHyb (Ambion, Foster City, CA) hybridization buffer, and blots were developed using the BrightStar BioDetect nonisotopic detection kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA). Western BlottingCytoplasmic lysates were generated as previously described (37Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F.

Briefly, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by gentle resuspension in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, HALT protease inhibitor mixture), and incubated for 5 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Cytoplasmic lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies: anti-actin (catalog number 4968; Cell Signaling) or anti-HuR (catalog number sc-5261; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). StatisticsAn analysis of variance was performed on the total data set for the transfections, followed by individual t tests. Stated p values are for t tests.

For these studies, we utilized the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, which is widely employed to study the regulation of TNF-α production, as well as an established transfection system using luciferase reporters (Table 1) (37Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Rigby W.F. J.

The use of TNF-α 3′-UTR luciferase reporters allows for the specific analysis of posttranscriptional events by eliminating the effects of MAP kinase inhibition on the TNF-α promoter from the analysis. Use of the pGL3 control vector allows for control of the transcriptional and other vector effect of LPS stimulation and MAP kinase inhibition. RAW cells were transfected with either pGL3 control or TNF-α 3′-UTR luciferase reporters. Two hours after the addition of serum to the transfections, the p38 inhibitor SB202190 (2.5 μm), ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20 μm), and/or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (20 μm) were added. The next day, cells were treated with or without LPS (10 ng/ml, 2 h), following which luciferase values were quantified as outlined under “Materials and Methods.”TABLE 1Vectors employedVectorDescriptionDN ERK1Dominant negative ERK1DN ERK2Dominant negative ERK2DN MEK1Dominant negative MEK1pGL3 controlControl luciferase reporterpGL3 control B-boxControl luciferase reporter with 4× B-box binding sitesTNF-α mRNA (accession number X01394)TNF 3′UTRNucleotides 855-1643TNF No Intron 3Nucleotides 396-1643TNF No Intron 2Nucleotides 364-1643TNF RenillaNucleotides 855-1643 in the pRL-CMV vectorTNF 3′-UTR B-boxTNF 3′-UTR construct with 4× B-box binding siteTNF-α gene (accession number X02910)TNF Intron 3Nucleotides 1833-3381TNF Intron 3 ΔARENucleotides 1833-2909 and 3131-3381TNF Intron 2Nucleotides 1614-1851 and 2592-3381 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 demonstrates the effect of inhibiting the MAP Kinase pathways, individually and in combination, on TNF-α posttranscriptional expression in unstimulated and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. As we have previously demonstrated, LPS stimulation results in a significant increase in TNF-α 3′UTR luciferase expression (p < 0.001) (37Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Rigby W.F. J.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 7883-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, p38 inhibition significantly inhibited TNF-α 3′-UTR expression in all combinations in both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated RAW cells (p < 0.001) (for a review, see Refs. 51Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 959-963Crossref Google Scholar and 52Saklatvala J. Dean J. Clark A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; 70: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). JNK inhibition had a differential effect on TNF-α posttranscriptional expression, depending on the activation state of the cells. JNK inhibition resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in TNF-α 3′-UTR-mediated luciferase expression in unstimulated cells, consistent with the low level of JNK activation in unstimulated RAW264.7 cells (53Deleault K.M. Skinner S.J. Brooks S.A. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, inhibiting JNK followed by LPS stimulation significantly inhibited TNF-α 3′-UTR-mediated luciferase expression (p < 0.01), consistent with JNK involvement in the translational derepression of the TNF-α message in response to activation (20Kontoyiannis D.

Finally, ERK inhibition with PD98059 resulted in a slight increase in TNF-α 3′-UTR-mediated luciferase expression. This finding was particularly surprising, given the role of the Tpl2/ERK axis in the regulation of TNF-α mRNA nuclear export (26Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K.

Med. 2002; 196: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); we anticipated that ERK inhibition would reduce TNF-α 3′-UTR luciferase expression rather than increasing it. Similar results were obtained when the ERK pathway was inhibited using dominant negative (DN) MEK1, ERK1, or ERK2 (data not shown). Previous work has established that the loss of Tpl2 results in nuclear retention of about 60% of the TNF-α message, and a similar effect is seen if ERK activation is pharmacologically inhibited in Tpl2 intact macrophages (26Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). It is well established that the presence of the EJC proteins TAP or Aly bound to a message increase the efficiency mRNA nuclear export (for a review, see Refs 54Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar and 55Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Given the link between EJC proteins and nuclear export and the nuclear retention of the TNF-α mRNA in Tpl2–/– animals, we tested the hypothesis that ERK control of TNF-α export requires the deposition of EJC proteins on the mRNA. To do this, we generated a number of TNF-α pGL3 luciferase vector constructs containing introns (Table 1). The TNF-α gene contains three introns and four exons (Fig. 2A). We generated luciferase constructs containing either the second or third TNF-α introns by amplifying genomic DNA (Fig. 2B). Utilizing the same primer pair and amplifying from mRNA allowed the generation of the constructs containing the same exonic sequence as the genomic constructs but lacking introns. Normally, messages with introns downstream of the stop codon are rapidly targeted for nonsense-mediated decay. The exception is introns located within the first 40–50 nucleotides of the stop codon (for a review, see Ref. 56Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to take advantage of this (Fig. 2C), allowing the insertion of an intron downstream of the luciferase stop codon. We compared the effect of inhibiting either ERK1 or ERK2 on intron containing TNF-α 3′-UTR luciferase vector (Fig. 3). Luciferase expression from the TNF Intron 3 constructs, which contain the third TNF-α intron and the TNF-α 3′-UTR, was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) by the DN ERK1 vector but not by the DN ERK2 vector (Fig. 3A).

Initially, it attracted attention due to its involvement in the autoimmune response associated to diabetes. Later it was found that upon exocytosis, the cytoplasmic domain of IA-2 is cleaved and relocated to the nucleus, where it enhances the transcription of the insulin gene. A concerted functioning of the whole receptor is to be expected. However, very little is known about the structure and function of the transmembrane and extracellular domains of IA-2. To address this issue, we solved the x-ray structure of the mature ectodomain of IA-2 (meIA-2) to 1.30Å resolution. The fold of meIA-2 is related to the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin)) domains of mucins, suggesting its participation in adhesive contacts to the extracellular matrix and providing clues on how this kind of molecule may associate and form homo- and heterodimers. Moreover, we discovered that meIA-2 is self-proteolyzed in vitro by reactive oxygen species, suggesting the possibility of a new shedding mechanism that might be significant in normal function or pathological processes. Knowledge of meIA-2 structure should facilitate the search of its possible ligands and molecular interactions.

Two paralog RPTPs, IA-2 (insulinoma-associated protein 2, also termed PTP35 or ICA512) and IA-2 β (PTPR2, also known as phogrin or IAR), were identified as major autoantigens in type-1 diabetes mellitus (3Lan M.S. Wasserfall C. Maclaren N.K. Notkins A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6367-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). They have a signal peptide, an ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane region, and a single intracellular PTP domain. IA-2 and IA-2 β are prominent in the secretory granules (SG) of brain, pituitary, pancreatic islet, and adrenal endocrine cells (4Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Hermel J.M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although the physiological ligands for these receptors are unknown and their function is poorly understood, they are involved in hormone and neuropeptide secretion. Indeed, single- and double-knock-out mice lacking IA-2 suffer from glucose intolerance, impaired insulin secretion, and abnormal secretion of pituitary hormones and female infertility (5Kubosaki A. Nakamura S. Notkins A.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: S46-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Kubosaki A. Nakamura S. Clark A. Morris J.F. Notkins A.L. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Processing of pro IA-2 by furin-like hormone convertases produces mature IA-2 (7Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which lacks the signal peptide and an adjacent fragment (residues 1–448). Mature IA-2 reaches the plasma membrane during exocytosis and comprises extracellular (449–575), transmembrane (576–600), and cytoplasmic domains (601–979). High glucose levels up-regulate IA-2 (8Knoch K.P. Bergert H. Borgonovo B. Saeger H.D. Altkruger A. Verkade P. Solimena M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and insulin exocytosis triggers a Ca2+-dependent and μ-calpain-mediated cleavage of the IA-2 cytoplasmic domain, which, then, is targeted to the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of insulin and other SG genes (7Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An IA-2/β2-syntrophin/utrophin complex may anchor the SG to actin (7Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ca2+, besides activating μ-calpain, promotes the dephosphorylation of β2-syntrophin, which then dissociates from IA-2, allowing targeting the SG to the plasma membrane, cleavage by μ-calpain, and sorting of the cleaved cytoplasmic domain to the nucleus to stimulate insulin synthesis. Most RPTPs have two cytoplasmic catalytic domains: D1 and D2. D2 is enzymically deficient due to mutations affecting the active site, the reversing of which restores catalysis (9Magistrelli G. Toma S. Isacchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Oxidation of one of the cysteine residues of D2 to a sulfenyl amide by reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces a conformational change coupled to the formation of disulfide linked D2 (10van der Wijk T. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44355-44361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and dimerization would lead to an inactivating interaction between cognate D1 (11Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conformational change of D2 is coupled to conformational changes in the ectodomain (12van der Wijk T. Blanchetot C. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13968-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this connection, the transmembrane regions have been found to posses dimerization potential per se (13Chin C.N. Sachs J.N. Engelman D.M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3855-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and conceivably, as part of signaling processes, the whole receptor may undergo coupled conformational changes during association or binding to yet unknown ligands (7Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both forms of IA-2 have only the inactive D2 domain and homo- and heterodimerize (14Gross S. Blanchetot C. Schepens J. Albet S. Lammers R. den Hertog J. Hendriks W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48139-48145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since co-expression of IA-2 and IA-2 β together with other active RPTPs reduces the enzymic activity, heterodimerization has been proposed as a regulatory mechanism (14Gross S. Blanchetot C. Schepens J. Albet S. Lammers R. den Hertog J. Hendriks W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48139-48145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also been noted that the absence of known adhesive modules in the ectodomain of IA-2 and IA-2 β would make them odd among RPTPs. In fact, with the exception of the subtypes R7 (PCPT1) and R8 (IA-2 and I-A2 β), all RPTPs have a large variety of extracellular modules apt for the interaction with the extracellular matrix and cell-cell contact (1Andersen J.N. Jansen P.G. Echwald S.M. Mortensen O.H. Fukada T. Del Vecchio R. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 8-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To shed some light on the organization and function of the mature ectodomain of IA-2 (hereafter meIA-2), we report its x-ray structure at 1.30 Å resolution. It was found that meIA-2 possesses a widespread, ferredoxin-like fold. This fact went unnoticed in previous works because meIA-2 lacks sequential homology to known proteins. Knowledge of meIA-2 structure allowed us to perform a more sensitive search of sequential homology and uncover the meIA-2 relationship to the SEA (sea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, agrin)) family of proteins (16Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which are specialized domains for oligomerization and interaction with the extracellular matrix. Thus, IA-2 possesses a typical adhesive ectodomain that would allow its interaction with a plethora of different molecules and structures. This finding may be important in the development of a comprehensive model of SG trafficking and regulation of the insulin secretion. It also opens the opportunity of exploring the role of the adhesive ectodomain in normal and pathological processes. Miscellaneous–Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were from Sigma. The broad protease inhibitor mixture was Set III (AEBSF, aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, and pepstatin A; Calbiochem). Metals were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Changes in the solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) upon dimerization were calculated as ΔASAAB = ASAA+ASAB – ASAAB. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at 20 °C using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system and a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. For the detection of contaminant proteases (17Laskowski M. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 26-36Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar), meIA-2 (∼15 nmol) was incubated 3 weeks at 20 °C or 3 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 mg/ml α-casein, pH 7.4. At different times, 60-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding 60 μl of 1.8 m trichloroacetic acid. After a 30-min incubation at 0 °C, the precipitate was removed, and the absorbance at 280 nm measured to assess the extent of proteolysis. Sequence Analysis–Alignments were performed using Clustal (18Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35485) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Hidden Markov models (HMM) analyses and searches were carried out with HMMER (19Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar). The 65 SEA seed sequences in Pfam and 24 additional sequences identified by PSI-Blast of meIA-2, MUC1, and MUC16 were compiled, and the latter three sequences were structurally aligned by examination of the corresponding superimposed structures. The remaining 86 sequences were aligned to the structural alignment using ClustalX in the “profile alignment mode.” Previously, the SEA sequence termini were slightly extended to ensure proper register with the structural alignment. The 89 sequences so aligned (supplemental data file 1) were trimmed to the first and last non-gapped columns and used to build a new HHM profile (supplemental data file 2). Computational Chemistry–Molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) were carried out using GROMACS 3.3 (20Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11376) Google Scholar) and GROMOS 53a6 force field (21Oostenbrink C. Villa A. Mark A.E. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1656-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). The initial structures were the crystallographic dimers (see Fig. 1, a and b) embedded in a ∼200-nm3, dodecahedral periodic cell and solvated with ∼5900 water molecules (22Berendsen H.J.C. Grigera J.R. Straatsma T.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 6269-6271Crossref Scopus (10402) Google Scholar). Conditioning, cut-off schemes, temperature and pressure coupling, boundary conditions, and long range electrostatics were as described (23Santos J. Risso V.A. Sica M.P. Ermácora M.R. Biophys. J. 2007; 11: 11Google Scholar). The system was an isobaricisothermal ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar, with weak temperature and pressure coupling (0.1 and 1.0 ps–1, respectively). All hydrogen atoms were considered explicitly, and protein covalent bonds were constrained using LINCS (24Feenstra K.A. Hess B. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 786-798Crossref Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Cluster analysis (25Daura X. Gademann K. Jaun B. Seebach D. van Gunsteren W.F. Mark A.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 236-240Crossref Google Scholar) was carried out with a cut-off value of 0.2 nm. Oxygen-mediated Cleavage–MeIA-2 (30 μm) in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was supplemented, singly or in combination, with the following additives: (a) sodium ascorbate (20 mm), (b) H2O2 (3 or 30 mm), and (c) metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+; 1 mm). After 2 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (26Ermácora M.R. Delfino J.M. Cuenoud B. Schepartz A. Fox R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6383-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification–MeIA-2 corresponds to residues 449–576 of human IA-2 (Uniprot entry: PTPRN_ HUMAN) numbered 1–128 for simplicity. Soluble Escherichia coli proteins were subjected to ionic exchange chromatography on a 1.5 × 5.0-cm column Mono Q (GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 20 °C with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted with a salt gradient (20 ml, 0–0.2 m NaCl in equilibration buffer). Further purification to >95% was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography on Superose12 (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was concentrated using Centricon (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The product identity and integrity were verified by mass analysis, which yielded the value expected from the sequence within 1 Da. Crystallization–Crystals of meIA-2, in the form of flattened spindles of about 150 × 50 × 50-μm3, were obtained after 2 months at 19 °C with the hanging drop method. The reservoir solution (300 μl) was 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m CaCl2, pH 8.5. The drop (2 μl) was a 1:1 blend of reservoir and protein solution (∼10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Data Collection and Processing–X-ray diffraction data were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source on beamline X6A, at 100 K, using an ADSC Q210 detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). Before data collection, crystals were soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400 and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Two data sets were collected on a single crystal: one at low energy (7.8 keV, 1.589 Å) for phasing purposes and one at high energy (12.6 keV, 0.979 Å) for refinement. A single crystal was used for the collection of all diffraction data. Indexing, integration, scaling, and reduction were performed with the HKL2000 suite of programs (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Five percent of the measured reflections in the high energy data set was flagged for cross-validation.

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution, Model Building, and Refinement–The structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Phases were calculated relying on the anomalous signal in the data recorded at low energy. SHELX (28Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar) was used to determine the position of anomalous scatterers, ultimately attributed to calcium ions, and to calculate initial phases. Statistics from SHELXD at 2.00 Å were: CC (all/weak) = 45/28 and PATFOM = 38. SHELXE processing yielded: PSEUDO CC = 66, Connectivity = 89, and FOM = 0.63 at 1.65 Å. Further improvement was achieved by density modification with DM (29Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 31. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994: 34-38Google Scholar) (FOM = 0.81; 82/82 residues per monomer; and 76 assigned water molecules). Automated model building was performed with ARP/wARP (30Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and allowed 90% of the model to be traced. The initial model was manually completed and refined with the high energy data using COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23370) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13868) Google Scholar), respectively. This procedure also allowed the identification of three calcium ions and 176 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. A few residues presented weak or missing side-chain electron density and were modeled as alanine. The final 2Fo – Fc Fourier map is of excellent quality and in concordance with the high resolution of the structure, and 94.9 and 5.1% of the residues were found in the most favored and additionally allowed regions, respectively, of the Ramachandran plot. The coordinates and structure factors of meIA-2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry 2qt7). Molecular graphics were displayed with MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) and PyMOL. Crystal Structure–MeIA-2 crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, and the structure was refined to 1.30 Å (see Table 1 and “Experimental Procedures” for the details). The asymmetric unit contains a protein dimer (Fig. 1) whose monomers superimpose with a Cα root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.57 Å. The monomer main axes are 18.5, 14.4, and 11.6 Å in length. The corresponding values for the dimer are 30.5, 21.5, and 18.3 Å. There was no electron density for residues 1–19 and 111–128, which cannot be the result of local disorder for the presence of the missing residues would lead to unrealistic crystal density. It will be shown below that the absence is due to proteolysis during crystallization. The monomer possesses a ferredoxin-like or (βαβ)×2 fold (34Hubbard T.J. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). The antiparallel, four-stranded β sheet is characteristically twisted. The hydrogen bond ladder and strand pairing is regular, except for the presence of a β bulge at the beginning of β2 and a distortion involving the last and first residues of β1 and β4, respectively. In the interface of the asymmetric unit dimer (Fig. 1a), despite involving equivalent protein surfaces, some of the side chains adopt non-equivalent rotamers to maximize the contacts. The total buried surface is ∼1000 Å2 (more than 10% of the dimer surface), corresponding to β4-β4 and α2-α2 pairing, with numerous van der Waals interactions, six backbone, and six side-chain intermolecular hydrogen bonds. A second dimerization mode can be observed in the crystal due to the antiparallel zippering β2-β2 (Fig. 1b). As in the asymmetric unit, an extended, eight-stranded antiparallel β sheet is so formed, which allows continuous growing of extended chains with antiparallel, two-fold screw axes along the c cell dimension. In this case, the interface buries 1100 Å2 and involves, in addition, antiparallel pairing α1-α1, 10 hydrogen bonds, and numerous van der Waals contacts. Layers of the above chains are further stabilized by two additional contacts per monomer mediated by calcium ions, which bury ∼350 Å2 each (supplemental Fig. 1). Metal binding causes the non-equivalence of the monomers: the asymmetric metal binding site 1 involves atoms from two A monomers, the asymmetric site 2 bridges one monomer A to one monomer B (of a different asymmetric unit), and site 3 is built with atoms from a single A monomer. Most carboxylates are grouped on the exposed faces of the α helices, whereas positive charges concentrate on a small region close to the C terminus of β3 (not shown). There is a patch of hydrophobic residues in the exposed face of the β sheet. This non-polar surface is close to the C terminus and might be covered by the 17 residues that precede the transmembrane segment and become proteolyzed during crystallization (see below). On the other hand, the internal faces of the helices and β sheet are tightly filled with aliphatic and aromatic side chains, forming a classical hydrophobic core. A search for structural similarity to meIA-2 using DALI (35Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1998; 33: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) retrieved over 200 matches. A large variety of proteins, with diverse origin, shape, and functions, contains modules with this versatile fold. However, the angles between strands and helices vary among them, as well as the length and complexity of the connecting loops. Like some of the proteins with this fold, meIA-2 has a characteristic kink in α2 (Fig. 1). Although the examples of similar architecture are many, one particularly interesting one is that of SEA: eukaryotic extracellular domains that are located in heavily glycosylated environments, contain linked carbohydrates, and might regulate or assist binding to extracellular moieties (16Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The least-square superimposition of meIA-2 and two SEA members with known three-dimensional structure (36Macao B. Johansson D.G. Hansson G.C. Hard T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 37Maeda T. Inoue M. Koshiba S. Yabuki T. Aoki M. Nunokawa E. Seki E. Matsuda T. Motoda Y. Kobayashi A. Hiroyasu F. Shirouzu M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13174-13182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) results in r.m.s. deviation of 2.5 Å (MUC1; 65% of meIA-2 backbone atoms) and 2.3 Å (MUC16; 56% of meIA-2 backbone atoms). Although the structural similarity between meIA-2 and the above SEA domains is high, a distinct segment between β1 and α1 is absent in meIA-2. This segment is called the YT turn because it contains threonine and tyrosine residues well conserved among mucins (37Maeda T. Inoue M. Koshiba S. Yabuki T. Aoki M. Nunokawa E. Seki E. Matsuda T. Motoda Y. Kobayashi A. Hiroyasu F. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Hayami N. Ishizuka Y. Shinya N. Tatsuguchi A. Yoshida M. Hirota H. Matsuo Y. Tani K. Arakawa T. Carninci P. Kawai J. Hayashizaki Y. Kigawa T. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13174-13182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Homology to SEA–No sequence relationship between meIA-2 and other protein domains was previously reported (38Primo M.E. Sica M.P. Risso V.A. Poskus E. Ermácora M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and neither meIA-2 sequence corresponds to a protein family in Pfam (39Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Birney E. Bateman A. Durbin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the HMM profile (19Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar) for SEA in Pfam (entry PF01390) does not take into account explicit conformational information. Since the x-ray structure of meIA-2 adds to that of two bona fide SEA members recently solved (36Macao B. Johansson D.G. Hansson G.C. Hard T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 37Maeda T. Inoue M. Koshiba S. Yabuki T. Aoki M. Nunokawa E. Seki E. Matsuda T. Motoda Y. Kobayashi A. Hiroyasu F. Shirouzu M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13174-13182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it was natural to ask whether a new HMM profile incorporating structural information would be able to identify both SEA and meIA-2 domains. To that end, the 65 SEA seed sequences in Pfam and 24 additional sequences identified by PSI-Blast of meIA-2, MUC1, and MUC16 were compiled and aligned, combining sequential and structural information. The aligned sequences were used to build a new HHM profile (supplemental data file 2). The HMM search using the new HMM profile retrieves all known SEA members and also the extracellular juxtamembrane domains of IA-2 and IA-2 β from different species; it does so without including false positives and with sensitivity as good as that the currently used HMM for detection of SEA domains (not shown). Incidentally, an HMM profile built from a conventional Clustal alignment of the above 89 sequences is only slightly less sensitive (not shown), indicating that structural considerations are not crucial for relating the sequences of meIA-2 and SEA domains. When unaligned sequences of IA-2, IA-2 β, and crystallized SEA domains are individually aligned to the new HMM profile, highly significant matches are found (Fig. 3), the alignment is consistent with the secondary structure of the characterized domains, and a set of common conserved residues is revealed. In the alignment shown, the similarity between SEA and meIA-2 is particularly evident for the C-terminal helix and strands. These findings, along with the structural and topological correspondence, lend support to the hypothesis that SEA and meIA-2 may have diverged from a common ancestor. Significance of meIA-2 Dimers–Analytical size exclusion chromatography indicated the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium at 0.1–10 μm concentrations. Rs values were 21.0 and 24.0 Å for monomer and dimer, respectively, which is compatible with the size and shape of meIA-2.

https://openalex.org/W2079478580,"In vivo analyses of the VWF promoter previously demonstrated that a fragment spanning sequences -487 to +247 targets promoter activation to brain vascular endothelial cells, whereas a longer fragment including 2182 bp of the 5′-flanking sequences, the first exon, and the first intron activated expression in endothelial cells of the heart and muscles as well as the brain of transgenic mice. These results suggested that additional VWF gene sequences were required for expression in other vascular endothelial cells in vivo. We have now identified a region within intron 51 of the VWF gene that is DNase I-hypersensitive (HSS) specifically in nonendothelial cells and interacts with endothelial and nonendothelial specific complexes that contain YY1. We demonstrate that β-actin is associated with YY1 specifically in the nucleus of nonendothelial cells and is a component of the nuclear protein complexes that interact with the DNase I-hypersensitive region. In vitro transfection analyses demonstrated that HSS sequences containing this YY1-binding site do not significantly affect VWF promoter activity.

Additional sequences of the VWF gene that extended the 5′ region of the promoter to -2182 and the 3′ end of the promoter to the end of the first intron were shown to activate transcription in endothelial cells of the heart and muscles as well as the brain of transgenic mice (12Aird W.C.

To identify additional cis-acting elements within the VWF gene that may participate in transcriptional regulation, we explored the possibility that such sequences may be located in VWF chromatin regions that show hypersensitivity to DNase I. Many transcriptional regulatory elements are located within chromatin regions hypersensitive to DNase I and other nucleases. These hypersensitive regions usually contain binding sites for one or more transcription factors that can be either common or tissue-specific (13Boyes J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using this approach we identified a region within intron 51 of the VWF gene that interacts with YY1-containing nuclear protein complexes and targets VWF promoter activation to a subset of lung vascular endothelial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cell culture of HeLa and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were carried out as previously described (5Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human primary fibroblasts (HUMFIB) were maintained as described for HeLa cells. Sheep pulmonary artery endothelial cells were prepared as previously described (14Hoyt D.G. Mannix R.J. Rusnak J.M. Pitt B.R. Lazo J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L171-L177PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus system as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Preparation of Nuclei, DNase I Digestion, and Southern Blot Analyses—Nuclei were prepared using a modification of a previously described procedure (15Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Aliquots of nuclei containing 2 A260 units were treated with 0-15 units/ml RQ1 DNase I (Promega) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were quenched by addition of an equal volume of 25 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and subjected to 200 μg/ml proteinase K digestion followed by RNase treatment. Isolated DNA was digested to completion with EcoRI and subjected to Southern blot analyses as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The probe for Southern blot analyses was synthesized using polymerase chain reaction with plasmid 2.3λ containing EcoRI fragment 38 of the VWF gene (2Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A.

Nuclear Extract Preparation, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analyses—Nuclear extracts preparation, gel mobility, and supershift assays were carried out as previously described (4Jahroudi N. Ardekani A.M. Greenberger J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21413-21421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (17Peng Y. Stewart D. Li W. Hawkins M. Kulak S. Ballermann B. Jahroudi N. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 7576-7583Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma) and rabbit polyclonal anti-YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology H-414). Mass spectrometry analyses were performed on the Coomassie Blue-stained polypeptide sliced from the gel using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses by University of Alberta Peptide Institute as previously described (10Wang X. Peng Y. Ma Y. Jahroudi N. Blood. 2004; 104: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were directly used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant protein data base with use of the mascot search program (Matrix Science, London, UK). Generation and Analyses of Transgenic Mice—DNA fragments containing HSS sequences, VWF-LacZ, and poly(A) were isolated and purified from the plasmids HSS-VWF-LacZ and VWF-LacZ-HSS (described in plasmids generation in supplementary material) by digestion with ASP718 (for plasmid HSS-VWF-LacZ) or SalI (for plasmid VWF-LacZ-HSS). Fragments were used for microinjection to generate C57BL/6 transgenic mice by Ozgene (Bentley, Australia) and University of Alberta transgenic mice facility, respectively. In addition DNA fragment containing VWF-LacZ transgene was used to generate transgenic mice containing VWF-LacZ gene in C57BL/6 mice by Ozgene. All animal housing and experimentation were approved by the Health Sciences Animal Policy and Welfare Committee at the University of Alberta. Two independent lines of HSS-VWF-LacZ and VWF-LacZ, as well as three independent lines of VWF-LacZ-HSS containing the transgenes (determined by PCR) were analyzed. These included one founder line of each HSS-VWF-LacZ and VWF-LacZ-HSS that did not produce progenies and F1 generation of the other lines. Organs, (lung, liver, kidney, brain, heart, stomach, duodenum, cecum, ear, and colon) of founders and F1 lines were harvested and fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution overnight followed by dehydration through graded alcohol, cleared, and tissue-banked as described (18Duta F. Ulanova M. Seidel D. Puttagunta L. Musat-Marcu S. Harrod K.S. Schreiber A.D. Steinhoff U. Befus A.D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 126: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tissue macroarrays were prepared by Histobest inc. (Edmonton, Canada). Sectioning was performed at 5 microns, and arrays were subjected to immunohistochemistry using primary anti-LacZ antibody (Abcam ab116-100) at a dilution of 1:500, and secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dako Cytomation Carpinteria, CA) at a dilution of 1:2000 dilution. Normal Rabbit IgG antibody was used as negative control. The reaction products were detected with Envision+/horse-radish peroxidase (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Immunostained sections were counterstained with methyl green. In the mouse from one founder line of VWF-LacZ-HSS, the lungs were inflated with 2% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, 5-micron cryosections were cut, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.2% v/v in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Tissue was incubated with rabbit anti-β-galactosidase (U. S. Biological) and rat anti-mouse cd31 (PECAM; clone 390; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and labeled with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) along with goat anti-rat cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The slides were mounted in Gelvatol (Monsanto) and visualized using an Olympus 500 confocal microscope. The images were collected with a ×60 oil immersion objective at a 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution. The images were superimposed on differential interference contrast image for aid in structural resolution. β-Galactosidase and Luciferase Detection in Transfected Cells—Quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase and luciferase expression in transfected cells were performed using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System and Luciferase Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to qualitatively detect β-galactosidase expression in transfected freshly isolated mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. For this analysis mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells grown in Lab-Tek II chambered slides (Nunc) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeablized with 0.1%Triton X-100. The cells were stained with an Alexa 555-labeled rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody to β-galactosidase (U. S. Biologicals) and Alexa 647-labeled IB4-isolectin (Molecular Probes). The images were collected using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. Identification of a DNase I-hypersensitive Site within Intron 51 of the VWF Gene—Analysis of the VWF gene promoter and its 5′ proximal region in vivo demonstrated that additional regulatory DNA sequences are required for transcriptional activation of the VWF gene in endothelial cells of all organs. Although cis-acting regulatory elements may be present anywhere within the VWF gene, we chose to investigate whether the 3′ region of the VWF gene contained potential regulatory sequences. The rationale for choosing the 3′ region for this analysis was based on previous reports demonstrating that next to 5′ regions, regulatory elements are most commonly identified at the 3′ end of genes (19Mautner J. Joos S. Werner T. Eick D. Bornkamm G.W. Polack A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Radomska H.S. Satterthwaite A.B. Burn T.C. Oliff I.A. Huettner C.S. Tenen D.G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Roque M.C. Smith P.A. Blasquez V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3138-3155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We employed the technique of DNase I-hypersensitive site identification commonly used to locate potential DNA regulatory sequences within large genomic regions. Nuclei were prepared from HUVECs that express VWF and two nonendothelial cell types, HeLa and HUMFIB, that do not express VWF. Isolated nuclei were either untreated or subjected to increasing concentrations of DNase I prior to digestion with EcoRI restriction enzyme and DNA isolation. DNA was then subjected to Southern blot analysis using a radioactively labeled 233-bp DNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 38/3 to 38/235 of the VWF gene (2Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.G. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including regions of intron 50, exon, and intron 51 (Fig. 1A). Based on the previously reported sequence of the VWF gene (2Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.G. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we expected to detect a 2.4-kb EcoRI DNA fragment following hybridization of the sample that was not treated with DNase I. In both the HUVEC and HUMFIB samples, a 2.4-kb fragment was observed (Fig. 1B, 2.4 kb PB). However, in HUMFIB DNA, an additional fragment of ∼300 bp was also detected (Fig. 1B, 0.3 kb DNB). The 300-bp fragment was observed even without addition of DNase I, suggesting that this site is sensitive to endogenous nucleases. Similar results were obtained when HeLa chromatin was analyzed (data not shown). For HUVEC, although increasing the concentration of DNase I treatment resulted in a decrease in intensity of the 2.4-kb fragment, the level of decrease was significantly lower than that for HUMFIB nuclear DNA, and the 300-bp fragment was not detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 5-9). These results demonstrated the presence of a strong, DNase I-hypersensitive site within intron 51 of the VWF gene in two human, nonendothelial cell types (HeLa and fibroblasts) that was absent in HUVEC. Identification of Specific Protein-DNA Binding Sequences within the 3′ Fragment—Based on detection of the VWF intron 51-hypersensitive site in nonendothelial cells and its absence in endothelial cells, we hypothesized that the DNase 1 hypersensitivity may have arisen as a result of DNA-nuclear protein interactions that may function as repressors in nonendothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether specific protein-DNA complex formation occurs at the intron 51-hypersensitive site (I51-HSS) in nonendothelial cells. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) utilizing nuclear extracts from human fibroblast cells and a 205-bp probe encompassing the DNase I-hypersensitive site. The probe corresponded to sequences 38/231 to 38/435 of the VWF gene (2Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.G. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2, C1-C3) formed with this fragment that were abolished or significantly reduced in the presence of specific competitor, whereas a nonspecific DNA competitor did not effect these complex formations (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3). To localize the binding sequences of the nuclear protein(s) in this 205-bp DNA sequence, smaller DNA fragments corresponding to various regions within this DNA fragment were used as competitors in EMSA. Specific protein-DNA interactions sites (specifically complexes C2 and C3) were localized to nucleotides 38/380 to 38/409 (Fig. 2, lane 9), and another protein-DNA interaction site (complex C1) appeared to be present in nucleotides 38/281 to 38/380 (Fig. 2, lane 5). The complex C1 was not consistently observed in repeated assays. Thus based on consistency and the prominence of the specific protein-DNA interactions that occurs with nucleotides 380-409, we first chose to pursue characterization of this protein complex. Protein Complexes That Include YY1 Transcription Factor Interact with DNA Sequences in the Intron 51 DNase I-hypersensitive Region—Based on observations that I51-HSS was specifically detected in nonendothelial cells and the hypothesis that the proteins interacting with I51-HSS sequences may function as a repressor, we proceeded to determine whether there are differences in the presence/absence or the pattern of the observed specific protein-DNA complexes that formed with nucleotides 380-409 in nonendothelial compared with endothelial cells. We carried out gel mobility experiments using a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 38/380-38/409 as a probe and nuclear extracts from HUVECs and HUMFIB and HeLa cells. The results demonstrated that nuclear proteins from both cell types form a complex that migrates to a similar position in an acrylamide gel (referred to as common complex (CC)). In addition to this, cell type-specific complexes were formed with HUVEC and HUMFIB nuclear extracts (referred to as HUVEC complex (HVC) and HUMFIB complex (HFC), respectively (Fig. 3A)). HeLa cells nuclear extracts also demonstrated a pattern of complex formation similar to that observed for HUMFIB cells (Fig. 3A, lane 8). To identify the nucleotides within the 380-409 DNA fragment necessary for the formation of various complexes, we generated additional sets of oligonucleotides containing different four nucleotide substitutions (Fig. 3C). The only mutant oligonucleotide that did not significantly compete with the wild type probe and hence was unable to abolish complex formations was the m2 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, a core DNA sequence, AATG, was identified as necessary for formation of specific protein-DNA complexes. These results also demonstrated that the same core sequence was necessary for the formation of all three (CC, HVC, and HFC) complexes. Using a data base containing transcription factor binding consensus sites, we determined that the sequence AATGG and the surrounding nucleotides (AA AATG G) were homologous to the core consensus binding site of the transcription factor YY1 (Yin Yang 1). To determine whether YY1 was interacting with this core sequence, we carried out competition and supershift experiments using sequences 380-409 as probe, oligonucleotides containing the consensus YY1 binding sequence (corresponding to that of murine immunoglobulin heavy-chain intronic enhancer (μE1)) as competitor, and anti-YY1 antibody. The results demonstrated that all three complexes were abolished in the presence of the YY1-specific competitor (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 5) and were supershifted in presence of the anti-YY1 antibody (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that YY1 interacts with the intron 51 sequence AATGG, and both the common and cell specific complexes formed with HUVEC and human fibroblast nuclear extracts contain YY1. Intron 51 HSS Sequences Target the Activation of the VWF Promoter in a Subset of Lung Endothelial Cells in Vivo—VWF promoter sequences -487 to +247 activate transcription only in endothelial cells of the brain but not other organs. To determine whether the 380-bp DNA region (referred to as I51-HSS) that encompasses the DNase I-hypersensitive and YY1-binding site participates in regulation of VWF transcription in vivo, we generated transgenic mice harboring a LacZ transgene driven by the VWF promoter (sequences -487 to +247) and the I51-HSS sequences (spanning nucleotides 38/231 to 38/613 (2Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.G. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) positioned either upstream of the VWF promoter or downstream of the LacZ gene (transgenes HSS-VWF-LacZ and VWF-LacZ-HSS; Fig. 5A). We analyzed two and three independent lines of each transgenic mouse, respectively, using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to detect LacZ gene products in various organs. We analyzed one founder line and F1 generation of other lines, for each transgene. Organs from transgenic and nontransgenic litter mates were harvested and fixed in paraformaldehyde or cryopreserved in 30% sucrose (one founder line for VWF-LacZ-HSS). Tissue arrays were prepared from paraformaldehyde-treated organs and subjected to immunohistochemistry with anti-β-galactosidase-specific antibody. The use of tissue arrays in which sections of various organs were placed on a single slide allows for samples to be simultaneously processed under a similar condition, thus minimizing interexperimental staining variability. Positive immunoperoxidase staining for β-galactosidase was shown almost exclusively in the vasculatures of lung and brain (Figs. 5 and 6) for both HSS-VWF-LacZ and VWF-LacZ-HSS. In the lung, vessels of the alveolar walls, especially in the parenchyma near the pleura, were most commonly positive. Specific staining of the endothelial cells of lung and brain tissues of the transgenic lines with control IgG antibody and nontransgenic littermates with the anti-β-galactosidase antibody was not observed (Fig. 6, D and E). Also consistent with our previous report, there was no LacZ detection in the lung of transgenic mice (VWF-LacZ) that contained VWF promoter (-487 to +247) in the absence of the I-51HSS sequences, whereas expression was observed in the brain vasculature of these animals (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6Hypersensitive region of the VWF gene intron 51 when placed downstream of the VWF promoter also targets the promoter activity to the lung vasculature in transgenic mice. Sections from lung and brain of the transgenic mice (F1 generations) HSS-VWF-LacZ (A), VWF-LacZ-HSS (B), VWF-LacZ (C), and a nontransgenic littermate (E) were immunostained with an antibody specific to LacZ. The lung and brain sections of HSS-VWF-LacZ transgenic mouse were also immunostained with an isotype-matched IgG antibody used as negative control (D). The arrows show representative vessels expressing LacZ (magnification, 600×). F, confocal microscopy analysis of LacZ (4Jahroudi N. Ardekani A.M. Greenberger J.S. J. Biol.

Similar to other lines, expression was not detected in vasculature of other organs in this line as well (data not shown). WT, wild type; β-gal, β-galactosidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the cellular origin of the LacZ expression in the lung vasculature, immunofluorescent analysis was performed on OCT frozen organs harvested from one line of VWF-LacZ-HSS using specific antibodies to detect LacZ gene product (shown as green) and PECAM (shown as red, a marker for endothelial cells), and slides were subjected to confocal fluorescence microscopy. Overlapping windows (yellow) demonstrated colocalization of both PECAM and β-galactosidase in brain and lung endothelial cells (Fig. 6F). Similarly LacZ expression was not detected in endothelial cells of other organs tested (data not shown). Some β-galactosidase staining was observed in the colon (nonendothelial cells) of one line of HSS-VWF-LacZ and the kidney (nonendothelial cells) of one line of VWF-LacZ-HSS. These were attributed to ectopic expression, possibly caused by transgene integration site, because these were not observed in more than one transgenic line each. There was no other detection of β-galactosidase in endothelial or nonendothelial cells of other organs tested. Also there was no expression detected in the megakaryocytes (data not shown). The results demonstrated that LacZ transgene was expressed only in the brain and lung vasculatures of these mice and that the expression was restricted to endothelial cells of these organs. Because the VWF promoter sequence -487 to +247 was previously shown to target activation in brain vascular endothelial cells, these results demonstrate that the lung-endothelial specific activation of the chimeric promoter, containing I51-HSS sequences and sequences -487 to +247, is due to the regulatory function of the I51-HSS sequences. The Effect of the Intron 51 HSS Sequences on Gene Expression Driven from Homologous and Heterologous Promoters in Endothelial and Nonendothelial Cells in Vitro—To determine whether I51-HSS sequences have a differential and potentially cell type-specific function in regulating VWF promoter in endothelial and nonendothelial cell types, we determined the transcriptional activity of the homologous VWF promoter (sequences -487 to +247) and a heterologous SV40 early promoter in the absence and presence of I51-HSS sequences, in HUVEC and sheep pulmonary endothelial cells as well as HeLa cells. Because VWF promoter fragment (-487 to +247) is not activated in nonendothelial cells, to test the hypothesis that I51-HSS may function as a repressor in nonendothelial cells, we chose to determine its effect on the activity of a heterologous SV40 promoter.

We have validated the first eukaryotic encoded cap 1 2 ′-O-ribose methyltransferase, TbMTr1, a member of a conserved family that modifies the first transcribed nucleotide of spliced leader and U1 small nuclear RNAs in the kinetoplastid protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. In addition to cap 0 (m7GpppNp-RNA), mRNA in these parasites has ribose methylations on the first four nucleotides with base methylations on the first and fourth (m7Gpppm6,6AmpAmpCmpm3Ump-SL RNA) conveyed via trans-splicing of a universal spliced leader. The function of this cap 4 is unclear. Spliced leader is the majority RNA polymerase II transcript; the RNA polymerase III-transcribed U1 small nuclear RNA has the same first four nucleotides as spliced leader, but it receives an m2,2,7G cap with hypermethylation at position one only (m2,2,7Gpppm6,6AmpApCpUp-U1 snRNA). Here we examine the biochemical properties of recombinant TbMTr1. Active over a pH range of 6.0 to 9.5, TbMTr1 is sensitive to Mg2+. Positions Lys95-Asp204-Lys259-Glu285 constitute the conserved catalytic core. A guanosine cap on RNA independent of its N7 methylation status is required for substrate recognition, but an m2,2,7G-cap is not recognized. TbMTr1 favors the spliced leader 5′ sequence, as reflected by a preference for A at position 1 and modulation of activity for substrates with base changes at positions 2 and 3. With similarities to human cap 1 methyltransferase activity, TbMTr1 is an excellent model for higher eukaryotic cap 1 methyltransferases and the consequences of cap 1 modification.

Most mature eukaryotic and viral mRNAs possess a 5′ cap that consists of an inverted guanosine methylated at position N7 linked to the first transcribed RNA nucleotide by a unique 5′-5′ triphosphate bond (m7GpppN). This cap 0 is necessary for mRNA stability and increased translational efficiency (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in the capping reaction are conserved. The three enzymatic activities catalyzing the three-step capping process, RNA triphosphatase, RNA guanylyltransferase, and RNA methyltransferase (MTase), 2The abbreviations used are: MTasemethyltransferaseAcNPVAutographa californica nucleopolyhedrosis virusAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteineAdoMetS-adenosyl-L-methioninerTbMTr1recombinant TbMTr1SLspliced leadersnRNAsmall nuclear RNATAPtobacco acid pyrophosphataseTMGtrimethylguanosineWNVWest Nile flavivirusaaamino acid. 2The abbreviations used are: MTasemethyltransferaseAcNPVAutographa californica nucleopolyhedrosis virusAdoHcyS-adenosylhomocysteineAdoMetS-adenosyl-L-methioninerTbMTr1recombinant TbMTr1SLspliced leadersnRNAsmall nuclear RNATAPtobacco acid pyrophosphataseTMGtrimethylguanosineWNVWest Nile flavivirusaaamino acid. have been identified and characterized in detail. Further modification of the cap is found in higher eukaryotes including mRNAs from insects, vertebrates, and associated animal viruses with additional ribose 2′-O-ribose methylations of the first (cap 1) and second (cap 2) transcribed nucleosides (2Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their widespread presence, little is known about the functional significance of mRNA cap 2′-O-ribose methylations in the eukaryotes, including their mechanism of formation, beyond the partial purification of two separate cap 1 and cap 2 2′-O-ribose MTase activities from HeLa cell extracts (3Langberg S.R.

In addition to the standard cap 0, it has seven methylations collectively referred to as cap 4. The SL RNA cap 4 is composed of 2′-O-ribose methylations on the first four transcribed nucleosides with additional base methylations at the first and fourth positions (m7Gpppm6,6AmpAmpCmpm3Ump-SL RNA) (6Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biogenesis of mRNA in kinetoplastid parasites involves posttranscriptional processing of long polycistronic precursors into individual protein-coding mRNAs by the two physically coupled events of 5′ trans-splicing and 3′ polyadenylation (7LeBowitz J.H. Smith H.Q. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). trans-Splicing also serves as a trans-capping reaction by attaching the 39-nucleotide SL with 5′-cap 4 to all mature mRNA.The role(s) of the kinetoplastid cap 4 has yet to be determined. Studies using methylation inhibitors suggested that complete cap 4 was necessary for efficient use of the SL RNA in pre-mRNA trans-splicing (9Ullu E. Tschudi C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10074-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20365-20369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, mutated and undermethylated SL are trans-spliced in vivo (11Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Zeiner G.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35210-35218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An alternate role for mature cap 4 could be in controlling translational efficiency, as mRNA bearing exon-mutated undermethylated cap 4 structures show decreased polysomal association (12Zeiner G.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38269-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Three genes encoding proteins responsible for ribose 2′-O-ribose methylations at positions 1 (TbMTr1), 2 (TbMTr2), 3, and possibly 4 (TbMTr3) of the SL RNA have been identified (14Zamudio J.R.

Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNA interference-mediated knockdown or allelic knock-out of the individual genes, as well as simultaneous knockdown of TbMTr2 and TbMTr3, resulted in undermethylated SL competent for trans-splicing with no significant effect on cell growth. The rationale for maintenance of this elaborate 5′ structure is still unclear, although the widespread conservation of the cap 4 throughout the family indicates a selected benefit. Likewise, SL sequence conservation is implicated primarily in the process of cap 4 acquisition and interaction with the translation machinery.Cap 1-specific 2′-O-ribose MTases have been studied extensively in viral systems. Vaccinia virus VP39, the best characterized among this group, serves dual functions of an S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent cap 1 MTase and a non-catalytic processivity subunit of poly(A) polymerase (19Hodel A.E. Gershon P.D. Shi X. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 247-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structures, mechanisms of action have been proposed for cap 1 MTase activities residing in domain I of Reovirus protein λ2 (20Feder M. Pas J. Wyrwicz L.S. Bujnicki J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 302: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal portion of flavivirus NS5 proteins (21Egloff M-P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.-L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The orf 69 gene in the baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) also encodes a cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase (22Wu X. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3430-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent characterization of the NS5 protein from West Nile flavivirus (WNV) demonstrated its ability to perform both guanosine N7 and ribose 2′-O-ribose methylations that complete the 5′ cap (23Ray D. Shah A. Tilgner M. Guo Y. Zhao Y. Dong H. Deas T.S. Zhou Y. Li H. Shi P.Y. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8362-8370Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Region VI of L protein in vesicular somatitis virus shows similar dual MTase activities with a single AdoMet binding pocket in the protein (24Li J. Fontaine-Rodriguez E.C. Whelan S.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13373-13384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Li J. Wang J.T. Whelan S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8493-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both TbMTr1 and TbMTr2 are AdoMet-dependent enzymes (17Hall M.P. Ho C.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5594-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Zamudio J.R. Mittra B. Foldynová-Trantírková S. Zeiner G.M. Lukes J. Bujnicki J.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Phylogenetic analyses of the T. brucei cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase TbMTr1 indicate that it belongs to an unexplored family with baculoviral and higher eukaryotic members, including human, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans homologs (20Feder M. Pas J. Wyrwicz L.S. Bujnicki J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 302: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Genetic knock-out resulted in undermethylated substrate SL with a predominantly cap 0 phenotype (18Zamudio J.R. Mittra B. Foldynová-Trantírková S. Zeiner G.M. Lukes J. Bujnicki J.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A significant increase in the cap 0 form of the U1 snRNA was also observed in the TbMTr1 null cells, implying that TbMTr1 is involved in U1 snRNA modification. The link between SL and the U1 snRNA as TbMTr1 substrates is the sequence they share at their 5′ ends, which are common for six of the first seven nucleotides. However, in contrast to the m7G cap 0 of SL, mature U1 snRNA carries a trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap (26Schnare M.N. Gray M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23691-23694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further understand the biochemistry of cap 1 formation, we expressed and purified a recombinant form of TbMTr1. We report the biochemical characterization of the kinetoplastid cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase TbMTr1, its substrate specificity, and identification of the vital K-D-K-E tetrad critical for AdoMet-dependent MTases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotidesThe oligonucleotides used in this study are shown insupplemental Table 1.Cloning and Overexpression of TbMTr1Genomic DNA extracted from T. brucei YTAT strain was used as template to amplify the TbMTr1 gene (Tb10.6k15.2610) with Pfu polymerase, using TbMTr1-Fd and TbMTr1-Rv primers. Both primers contain restriction enzyme sites (underlined), such that the forward primer inserted an NdeI site at the ATG start codon and the reverse primer inserted an XhoI site immediately after the stop codon. The 1.2-kb PCR fragment was cloned in the NdeI-XhoI sites of the pET28a expression vector (Novagen) to direct synthesis of the TbMTr1 protein fused to a His6 tag at the N terminus (rTbMTr1).For overexpression of rTbMTr1, the plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Overnight cultures from single colonies were used to inoculate 100 ml of LB media supplemented with 2% ethanol. After growing the cells at 37 °C to a density of 0.6–0.8 OD, the cells were quick-chilled on ice for 5 min and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.2 mm final concentration. The cells were further allowed to grow overnight at 22 °C, harvested, and stored at –80 °C until further use.Purification of rTbMTr1Cells harvested from 100-ml cultures were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. All steps in the purification procedure were carried out at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the cleared supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml His-Trap FF column (GE Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 20 ml of buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, the His-tagged proteins were eluted from the column with 15 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 300 mm imidazole, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with three changes every 2 h. The dialyzed sample was further loaded onto a 2-ml phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl. rTbMTr1 protein was finally eluted from the column with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 350 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Fractions containing purified rTbMTr1 protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C with three changes at 2-h intervals, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. All purified proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA kit with bovine serum albumin as standard.Preparation of Capped RNA SubstratesTo generate RNA transcripts representing the T. brucei SL RNA sequence, the 150-nucleotide gene was amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase using AgCU-SL:FD and SL:RV as forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table 1). Because the SL RNA starts with an adenine, the forward primer was designed to include a T7 bacteriophage class II ϕ2.5 promoter (27Coleman T.M. Wang G. Huang F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is efficient in initiating transcription with an adenosine residue (bold). DNA templates for transcribing mutated SL RNAs with substitutions in the first three nucleotides (lowercase) were prepared similarly by PCR amplification using mutation specific forward primer and SL:RV as reverse primer. The PCR products were gel purified and then used as template for transcription reactions performed with T7 Megashortscript Kit (Ambion).Capping of the transcripts was carried out using [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Science) and vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase enzyme (Ambion) using the manufacturer's recommendations. For generating 32P-labeled G-capped transcripts (G*pppApGp-SL; * = 32P), AdoMet (New England Biolabs) was left out of the reaction mixture, but was included at 1 mm final concentrations for N7-methyl G-capped transcripts (m7G*pppApGp-SL). Following the reaction the 32P-G cap-labeled RNA transcripts were extracted with phenol/chloroform and passed three times through Sephadex G-25 spin columns to remove any free radionucleotides.MTase AssayMTase assays were usually performed in a 20-μl volume by incubating 10 pmol of purified rTbMTr1 protein with 330 fmol of 32P-G cap-labeled m7G*pppApGp-SL RNA as substrate in the reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm AdoMet, and 2 units of SUPERase-IN (Ambion). Unless mentioned otherwise, incubations were carried out at 28 °C for 60 min, following which RNA was extracted from the reactions by phenol/chloroform treatment, and precipitated with 0.5 μg of yeast tRNA as carrier in ethanol. RNA samples were resuspended in 8 μl of water, and sodium acetate, pH 5.2, was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. Five microliters of the RNA samples were then digested with either 2 μg of nuclease P1 (Sigma) for 2 h or 0.2 units of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) for 3 h at 37 °C to liberate the cap structures. Digested samples (1 μl) were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EMD Chemicals), and developed with 0.3 m ammonium sulfate for nuclease P1 digests and 0.45 m ammonium sulfate for TAP digests, respectively. Methylated and unmethylated G caps were spotted along with the samples as markers and their positions were determined by UV shadowing. All MTase assays were performed a minimum of three times. Migration of released cap structures were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis of the TLC plate (GE Healthcare), and identified by comparing with relative positions of the markers. The radiolabeled spots were then quantitated to estimate the extent of cap 1 methylation (m7G*pppAm/[m7G*pppAp + m7G*pppAm]). For RNase T2 digestion, the radiolabeled RNA was digested in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, and 2 mm EDTA with 40 units/ml RNase T2 at 37 °C for 12 h. Digestion products were resolved on 25% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels and visualized by PhosphorImager (14Zamudio J.R. Mittra B. Zeiner G.M. Feder M. Bujnicki J.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Bioinformatic Analyses of TbMTr1Data base searches were carried out with PSI-BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar). Cap 1 MTase sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE alignment program (29Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29349) Google Scholar). The alignment between the cap 1 family and RrmJ was done using the GeneSilico metaserver (30Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Mutated rTbMTr1Alanine substitution mutations targeting Lys95, Asp207, Lys248, and Glu285 were introduced in the plasmid TbMTr1-pET28a using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting plasmids were sequenced to confirm the desired mutations and to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations. Plasmids encoding mutated rTbMTr1 proteins were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. All mutated proteins were expressed using the same induction conditions as described for wild-type rTbMTr1, except for the Lys248 mutant that was induced overnight at 16 °C. Purification of the soluble mutated proteins was carried out exactly as described for the wild-type rTbMTr1 protein.Dinucleotide Competition AssayDinucleotide cap analogs were included in the MTase reaction at various mentioned concentrations. GTP, GpppG, m7GpppG, and m7GppppGm7 were obtained from Epicenter; m7GpppA, and m2,2,7GpppG were synthesized (by J. S. and E. D.) at the Institute of Experimental Physics, Warsaw.RESULTSPurification and Activity of rTbMTr1TbMTr1-null T. brucei show an absence of cap 1 modification on SL RNA and U1 snRNA (18Zamudio J.R. Mittra B. Foldynová-Trantírková S. Zeiner G.M. Lukes J. Bujnicki J.M. Sturm N.R. Campbell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). rTbMTr1 was produced in bacteria to facilitate detailed studies on the enzyme biochemistry, structure, and function. Due to the 5′-sequence identity of the SL RNA and U1 snRNA substrates, we used as substrate an artificial transcript approximating the SL RNA. Position 2 was modified from adenine to a guanine to facilitate efficient in vitro transcription. A guanine residue at position 2 was utilized efficiently as substrate by TbMTr2 in in vitro studies (17Hall M.P. Ho C.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5594-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and minimal effects on rTbMTr1 activity are demonstrated below.We cloned TbMTr1 in the E. coli expression vector pET28a and expressed it as a fusion protein with a His6 tag at the N terminus. Following cell lysis, ∼80% of the expressed rTbMTr1 was obtained in the soluble fraction. Initial purification was performed on a nickel column and yielded ∼90% pure rTbMTr1. Final purification was achieved by ion-exchange column chromatography on a phosphocellulose P11 column that yielded purified rTbMTr1 apparently free from any contaminating proteins, as verified by SDS-PAGE analysis showing a single polypeptide migrating at 39 kDa (supplemental Fig. 1).To test MTase activity of the purified protein a 150-nucleotide synthetic RNA with a methylated G-cap (m7G*pppApGp-SL) was used as substrate. Substrate RNA was incubated in a reaction mixture containing AdoMet in the presence and absence of rTbMTr1, following which RNA samples were extracted from the reactions. The 32P-labeled RNA caps were liberated by digestion with nuclease P1, which cleaves capped RNAs into 3′-OH terminated dinucleotide cap structures and 5′-pN-OHs, and separated on a TLC plate (Fig. 1A). Incubation of m7G-capped RNA with rTbMTr1 resulted in the appearance of a faster-migrating species as compared with the m7G*pppA marker, indicating that rTbMTr1 can methylate the substrate. Methylation of the base introduces a positive ionic charge so that the mobility of a methylated base is faster compared with the methylated ribose, which alters the mass only and results in a lesser mobility effect. The migration of the m7G-capped rTbMTr1-treated RNA sample indicates a 2′-O-ribose methylation event. The cap structure from mock-treated reactions with m7G*pppApGp-SL RNA co-migrated with the m7GpppA marker.2′-O-Ribose methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide was further confirmed by RNase T2 digestion. RNase T2 is unable to digest pyrophosphate bonds or 5′ bonds adjacent to 2′-O-ribose-modified nucleotides. RNA samples from rTbMTr1 methylation assays using m7G*pppApGp-SL RNA as substrate were digested with RNase T2, and the products separated on a 25% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel (Fig. 1B). For the rTbMTr1 (AdoMet+)-treated sample, 90% of the RNase T2 band migrated slower than the m7G*pppA band, indicative of a m7G*pppAmG structure resulting from 2′-O-ribose methylation of the first nucleotide. Digestion of RNA sample from the mock-treated reaction performed in the absence of the co-factor AdoMet liberated an RNase T2-resistant cap structure m7G*pppA.The protein identified by our in vivo studies as a cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase was expressed and purified successfully, maintaining the anticipated enzymatic activity. We next sought to determine the biochemical profile of the enzyme to optimize further in vitro analyses.Activity Parameters of rTbMTr1rTbMTr1 activity was active over a wide range of pH, with continuous increase in activity from pH 6 through 9.5 (Fig. 2A); a pH of 8.0 was adopted for our standard rTbMTr1 activity assay. Testing of divalent ion dependence revealed that, although Mg2+ is not required for activity, the presence of Mg2+ at concentrations above 12.5 mm was found to be inhibitory, but Mn2+ ion did not have any effect even at 25 mm concentrations (Fig. 2B). As shown previously, AdoMet is required as co-factor for functionality. For the assay conditions used, AdoMet dependence was linear between 0.5 and 5 μm and then plateaued (Fig. 2C). The Km for AdoMet was calculated to be 0.8 μm. The activity was inhibited by the presence of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), with about 50% inhibition observed with 250 μm AdoHcy in reactions containing 10 μm AdoMet (Fig. 2D) indicating that the enzyme has a higher affinity for AdoMet. rTbMTr1 activity was unaffected by NaCl concentrations up to 60 mm as well as by the absence of salt supplemented beyond that included in the storage buffer, functionally as low as 0.5 mm NaCl. However, the activity was sensitive to higher salt concentrations with total inhibition at 150 mm (data not shown).FIGURE 2Activity parameters for rTbMTr1. A, pH dependence. Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Tris-acetate, pH 4.5 and 5.5, or Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 7.5, 8.0, 8.8, 9.2, and 9.5, and m7G*pppApGp-SL RNA as substrate. The extent of 2′-O-ribose methylation is plotted as a function of pH. B, effect of divalent cations. Reaction mixtures were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of MgCl2 or MnCl2 as indicated.

Mg2+-mediated inhibition has been shown for several N7-MTase activities, including that of the dual-function WNV NS5 protein. The 2′-O-ribose MTase activity requires 5–10 mm MgCl2, but is inhibited above 12.5 mm, whereas the 5′-cap activity is inhibited by any MgCl2 (31Zhou Y. Ray D. Zhao Y. Dong H. Ren S. Li Z. Guo Y.

With the basic properties of rTbMTr1 established, we queried the activity for critical features of the protein and RNA substrate.rTbMTr1 Does Not Methylate the Guanosine CapThe NS5 protein from WNV performs both the cap 0 guanosine N7 and cap 1 ribose 2′-O-ribose methylations to complete the 5′ cap (23Ray D.

Region VI of the L protein in vesicular somatitis virus has similar dual MTase activities (24Li J. Fontaine-Rodriguez E.C. Whelan S.P. J.

The AcNPV MTase 1 protein and HeLa cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase utilize both methylated and unmethylated guanosine-capped RNA as substrates. The other trypanosome cap 4 MTases TbMTr2 and TbMTr3 are related to the vaccinia virus VP39 cap 1 2′-O-ribose MTase, and TbMTr2 requires N7 methylation of the guanosine cap for activity. To investigate the relationship between TbMTr1 and these other cap 1 MTases, we tested its ability to methylate at the N7 position of the guanosine cap. These features are compared in Table 1.TABLE 1Properties of cap 1 2′-O-methyltransferasesEukaryotes and baculovirusPoxvirus, AcNPV orf69FlavivirusMononegaviralesT. brucei TbMTr1Human MTase 1Vaccinia VP39WNV NS5Dengue NS5VSV L2′-O-MTase+++++++N-7-MTase----+++5′ cap preferenceG & m7GG & m7GNDaND, not determined.m7GG & m7GG & m7GG & m7GN1 preferredbN1 preferred, base preference at position 1.A > GA = G = CGcOnly G tested.A = GANDNDN2 preferreddN2 preferred, base preference at position 2.A = GNDNDNDGNDNDpH optimum≥9≥9∼7ND10NDNDLocalizationNucleusNucleusNucleusCytosolCytosolNucleusCytosolCrystal structureNoNoNoYesYesYesNoReferencesThis study32240, 4123, 31, 42, 5321, 5325a ND, not determined.b N1 preferred, base preference at pos"
