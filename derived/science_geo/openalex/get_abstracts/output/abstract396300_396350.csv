https://openalex.org/W2077359452,"The modified DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), sometimes called the sixth base, is present in the mammalian genome where it is generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC; the fifth base) by enzymes of the Tet family. Four papers in this issue, from the Helin, Zhang, Rao and Reik laboratories, respectively, report on the genome-wide distribution of Tet1 and/or 5hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells using the ChIP-seq technique. Links between Tet1 and transcription regulation — both activation and repression — are revealed. Anjana Rao and colleagues also describe two alternative methods with increased sensitivity for mapping single 5hmC bases. In the associated News & Views, Nathalie Véron and Antoine H. F. M. Peters discuss what these and other recent papers reveal about the role of Tet proteins in regulating DNA methylation and gene expression. Epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome by DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) has a profound impact on chromatin structure, gene expression and maintenance of cellular identity1. The recent demonstration that members of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine raised the possibility that Tet proteins are capable of establishing a distinct epigenetic state2,3. We have recently demonstrated that Tet1 is specifically expressed in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and is required for ES cell maintenance2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing, here we show in mouse ES cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Despite an increase in levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1-binding sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1 targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation is required for maintaining the expression of a group of transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of PRC2 to CpG-rich gene promoters. Thus, our study not only establishes a role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2084642506,"Sensory information is transmitted to the brain where it must be processed to translate stimulus features into appropriate behavioural output. In the olfactory system, distributed neural activity in the nose is converted into a segregated map in the olfactory bulb. Here we investigate how this ordered representation is transformed in higher olfactory centres in mice. We have developed a tracing strategy to define the neural circuits that convey information from individual glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex and the cortical amygdala. The spatial order in the bulb is discarded in the piriform cortex; axons from individual glomeruli project diffusely to the piriform without apparent spatial preference. In the cortical amygdala, we observe broad patches of projections that are spatially stereotyped for individual glomeruli. These projections to the amygdala are overlapping and afford the opportunity for spatially localized integration of information from multiple glomeruli. The identification of a distributive pattern of projections to the piriform and stereotyped projections to the amygdala provides an anatomical context for the generation of learned and innate behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2083099355,"Background Depression is associated with an unusually high rate of aging-related illnesses and early mortality. One aspect of “accelerated aging” in depression may be shortened leukocyte telomeres. When telomeres critically shorten, as often occurs with repeated mitoses or in response to oxidation and inflammation, cells may die. Indeed, leukocyte telomere shortening predicts early mortality and medical illnesses in non-depressed populations. We sought to determine if leukocyte telomeres are shortened in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), whether this is a function of lifetime depression exposure and whether this is related to putative mediators, oxidation and inflammation. Methodology Leukocyte telomere length was compared between 18 unmedicated MDD subjects and 17 controls and was correlated with lifetime depression chronicity and peripheral markers of oxidation (F2-isoprostane/Vitamin C ratio) and inflammation (IL-6). Analyses were controlled for age and sex. Principal Findings The depressed group, as a whole, did not differ from the controls in telomere length. However, telomere length was significantly inversely correlated with lifetime depression exposure, even after controlling for age (p<0.05). Average telomere length in the depressed subjects who were above the median of lifetime depression exposure (≥9.2 years' cumulative duration) was 281 base pairs shorter than that in controls (p<0.05), corresponding to approximately seven years of “accelerated cell aging.” Telomere length was inversely correlated with oxidative stress in the depressed subjects (p<0.01) and in the controls (p<0.05) and with inflammation in the depressed subjects (p<0.05). Conclusions These preliminary data indicate that accelerated aging at the level of leukocyte telomeres is proportional to lifetime exposure to MDD. This might be related to cumulative exposure to oxidative stress and inflammation in MDD. This suggest that telomere shortening does not antedate depression and is not an intrinsic feature. Rather, telomere shortening may progress in proportion to lifetime depression exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2032208441,"Genetic studies indicate that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to metazoan longevity. Collapse of protein homeostasis results in protein misfolding cascades and the accumulation of insoluble protein fibrils and aggregates, such as amyloids. A group of small molecules, traditionally used in histopathology to stain amyloid in tissues, bind protein fibrils and slow aggregation in vitro and in cell culture. We proposed that treating animals with such compounds would promote protein homeostasis in vivo and increase longevity. Here we show that exposure of adult Caenorhabditis elegans to the amyloid-binding dye Thioflavin T (ThT) resulted in a profoundly extended lifespan and slowed ageing. ThT also suppressed pathological features of mutant metastable proteins and human β-amyloid-associated toxicity. These beneficial effects of ThT depend on the protein homeostasis network regulator heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the stress resistance and longevity transcription factor SKN-1, molecular chaperones, autophagy and proteosomal functions. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological maintenance of the protein homeostatic network has a profound impact on ageing rates, prompting the development of novel therapeutic interventions against ageing and age-related diseases."

Using a randomized controlled trial of open access publishing, involving 36 participating journals in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, we report on the effects of free access on article downloads and citations. Articles placed in the open access condition (n=712) received significantly more downloads and reached a broader audience within the first year, yet were cited no more frequently, nor earlier, than subscription-access control articles (n=2533) within 3 yr. These results may be explained by social stratification, a process that concentrates scientific authors at a small number of elite research universities with excellent access to the scientific literature. The real beneficiaries of open access publishing may not be the research community but communities of practice that consume, but rarely contribute to, the corpus of literature.—Davis, P. M.

https://openalex.org/W2001315384,"The success of skeletal muscle reconstruction depends on finding the most effective, clinically suitable strategy to engineer myogenic cells and biocompatible scaffolds. Satellite cells (SCs), freshly isolated or transplanted within their niche, are presently considered the best source for muscle regeneration. Here, we designed and developed the delivery of either SCs or muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) via an in situ photo-cross-linkable hyaluronan-based hydrogel, hyaluronic acid-photoinitiator (HA-PI) complex. Partially ablated tibialis anterior (TA) of C57BL/6J mice engrafted with freshly isolated satellite cells embedded in hydrogel showed a major improvement in muscle structure and number of new myofibers, compared to muscles receiving hydrogel + MPCs or hydrogel alone. Notably, SCs embedded in HA-PI also promoted functional recovery, as assessed by contractile force measurements. Tissue reconstruction was associated with the formation of both neural and vascular networks and the reconstitution of a functional SC niche. This innovative approach could overcome previous limitations in skeletal muscle tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1969909371,"Human sperm samples are very heterogeneous and include a low amount of truly functional gametes. Distinct strategies have been developed to characterize and isolate this specific subpopulation. In this study we have used fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to determine if mitochondrial function, as assessed using mitochondrial-sensitive probes, could be employed as a criterion to obtain more functional sperm from a given ejaculate. We first determined that mitochondrial activity correlated with the quality of distinct human samples, from healthy donors to patients with decreased semen quality. Furthermore, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to separate sperm with active and inactive mitochondria we found that this was also true within samples. Indeed, sperm with active mitochondria defined a more functional subpopulation, which contained more capacitated and acrosome intact cells, sperm with lower chromatin damage, and, crucially, sperm more able to decondense and participate in early development using both chemical induction and injection into mature bovine oocytes. Furthermore, cell sorting using mitochondrial activity produced a more functional sperm subpopulation than classic swim-up, both in terms of improvement in a variety of functional sperm parameters and in statistical significance. In conclusion, whatever the true biological role of sperm mitochondria in fertilization, mitochondrial activity is a clear hallmark of human sperm functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2144226194,"We investigated whether polycystin-1 is a bone mechanosensor. We conditionally deleted Pkd1 in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes by crossing Dmp1-Cre with Pkd1(flox/m1Bei) mice, in which the m1Bei allele is nonfunctional. We assessed in wild-type and Pkd1-deficient mice the response to mechanical loading in vivo by ulna loading and ex vivo by measuring the response of isolated osteoblasts to fluid shear stress. We found that conditional Pkd1 heterozygotes (Dmp1-Cre;Pkd1(flox/+)) and null mice (Pkd1(Dmp1-cKO)) exhibited a ∼ 40 and ∼ 90% decrease, respectively, in functional Pkd1 transcripts in bone. Femoral bone mineral density (12 vs. 27%), trabecular bone volume (32 vs. 48%), and cortical thickness (6 vs. 17%) were reduced proportionate to the reduction of Pkd1 gene dose, as were mineral apposition rate (MAR) and expression of Runx2-II, Osteocalcin, Dmp1, and Phex. Anabolic load-induced periosteal lamellar MAR (0.58 ± 0.14; Pkd1(Dmp1-cKO) vs. 1.68 ± 0.34 μm/d; control) and increases in Cox-2, c-Jun, Wnt10b, Axin2, and Runx2-II gene expression were significantly attenuated in Pkd1(Dmp1-cKO) mice compared with controls. Application of fluid shear stress to immortalized osteoblasts from Pkd1(null/null) and Pkd1(m1Bei/m1Bei)-derived osteoblasts failed to elicit the increments in cytosolic calcium observed in wild-type controls. These data indicate that polycystin-1 is essential for the anabolic response to skeletal loading in osteoblasts/osteocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2056297389,"The annexins, a family of Ca(2+)- and lipid-binding proteins, are involved in a range of intracellular processes. Recent findings have implicated annexin A1 in the resealing of plasmalemmal injuries. Here, we demonstrate that another member of the annexin protein family, annexin A6, is also involved in the repair of plasmalemmal lesions induced by a bacterial pore-forming toxin, streptolysin O. An injury-induced elevation in the intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) triggers plasmalemmal repair. The highly Ca(2+)-sensitive annexin A6 responds faster than annexin A1 to [Ca(2+)](i) elevation. Correspondingly, a limited plasmalemmal injury can be promptly countered by annexin A6 even without the participation of annexin A1. However, its high Ca(2+) sensitivity makes annexin A6 highly amenable to an unproductive binding to the uninjured plasmalemma; during an extensive injury accompanied by a massive elevation in [Ca(2+)](i), its active pool is severely depleted. In contrast, annexin A1 with a much lower Ca(2+) sensitivity is ineffective at the early stages of injury; however, it remains available for the repair even at high [Ca(2+)](i). Our findings highlight the role of the annexins in the process of plasmalemmal repair; a number of annexins with different Ca(2+)-sensitivities provide a cell with the means to react promptly to a limited injury in its early stages and, at the same time, to withstand a sustained injury accompanied by the continuous formation of plasmalemmal lesions."

It is involved in essential immunological processes, such as leukocyte extravasation and phagocytosis. In addition, Mac-1 has been described to negatively regulate immune cell signaling. Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism conferring an amino acid change in the Mac-1 integrin extracellular domain, R77H, was shown to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, we demonstrate that the R77H-substituted Mac-1 can be expressed on the cell surface in transfected cells and can undergo conformational changes in response to integrin activation. The affinity of the integrin for ICAMs is only partially reduced, but cell adhesion to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 is severely compromised, and Jβ2.7 cells expressing R77H substituted integrins are deficient in adhesion to ICAM-1 under shear flow conditions. Importantly, cell adhesion to the complement factor iC3b is also diminished, and COS cells expressing R77H-substituted integrins display reduced iC3b-dependent phagocytosis. In addition, U937 cells expressing R77H-CD11b display increased IL-6 production as compared with WT-CD11b-expressing cells. These results suggest that the R77H substitution results in the deficiency of the mutated integrin to mediate cell adhesion to ligands such as ICAMs and iC3b.

https://openalex.org/W2002561597,"The gastric-derived orexigenic peptide ghrelin affects brain circuits involved in energy balance as well as in reward. Indeed, ghrelin activates an important reward circuit involved in natural- as well as drug-induced reward, the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward link. It has been hypothesized that there is a common reward mechanism for alcohol and sweet substances in both animals and humans. Alcohol dependent individuals have higher craving for sweets than do healthy controls and the hedonic response to sweet taste may, at least in part, depend on genetic factors. Rat selectively bred for high sucrose intake have higher alcohol consumption than non-sucrose preferring rats and vice versa. In the present study a group of alcohol-consuming individuals selected from a population cohort was investigated for genetic variants of the ghrelin signalling system in relation to both their alcohol and sucrose consumption. Moreover, the effects of GHS-R1A antagonism on voluntary sucrose- intake and operant self-administration, as well as saccharin intake were investigated in preclinical studies using rodents. The effects of peripheral grelin administration on sucrose intake were also examined. Here we found associations with the ghrelin gene haplotypes and increased sucrose consumption, and a trend for the same association was seen in the high alcohol consumers. The preclinical data show that a GHS-R1A antagonist reduces the intake and self-administration of sucrose in rats as well as saccharin intake in mice. Further, ghrelin increases the intake of sucrose in rats. Collectively, our data provide a clear indication that the GHS-R1A antagonists reduces and ghrelin increases the intake of rewarding substances and hence, the central ghrelin signalling system provides a novel target for the development of drug strategies to treat addictive behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2134762380,"Macrophages contribute to tissue homeostasis in the developing as well as the adult organism. They promote tissue regeneration and remodeling after injury, which requires efficient neoangiogenesis. Signaling pathways activating an angiogenic program in macrophages are still poorly defined. We report that apoptotic cells (ACs), which originate from stressed or damaged tissues, can induce angiogenic properties in primary human macrophages. The signal originating from ACs is the lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which activates S1P1/3 on macrophages to upregulate cyclooxygenase-2. The formation and liberation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) then stimulates migration of endothelial cells. This is demonstrated by using PGE2 receptor antagonists or a neutralizing PGE2 antibody in vitro, thereby attenuating endothelial cell migration using a Boyden chamber assay. In vivo, neutralization of PGE2 from proangiogenic macrophage supernatants blocked vessel formation into Matrigel plugs. In particular, apoptotic cancer cells shifted prostanoid formation in macrophages selectively toward PGE2 by up-regulating cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES1), while down-regulating the PGE2-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) or prostaglandin-D synthase (PGDS). Angiogenic programming of macrophages by ACs, therefore, may control responses to tissue stress such as in tumors, where macrophages support cancer progression.—Brecht, K., Weigert, A., Hu, J., Popp, R., Fisslthaler, B., Korff, T., Fleming, I., Geisslinger, G., Brüne, B.

https://openalex.org/W2042947978,"During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. This intrinsic cleavage activity is strong for Pol I and Pol III but very weak for Pol II. The reason for this difference is unclear because the active centers of the polymerases are virtually identical. Here we show that Pol II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is immobilized on the enzyme surface.

Rpb9 resides on the enzyme surface, where its N-terminal zinc ribbon (N-ribbon) forms part of the Rpb1/9 jaw, and its C-terminal zinc ribbon (C-ribbon) binds between the Rpb1 funnel domain and the Rpb2 domains lobe and external-1 (Fig. 1). The very weak cleavage activity of Pol II is greatly stimulated by TFIIS, which contains a Pol II-binding domain that is located at the Rpb1/9 jaw and a C-ribbon (5Kettenberger H. Armache K.J.

Although A12.2 and C11 contain these three hairpin residues, Rpb9 lacks the residue corresponding to Glu-291. It remains unclear how the ribbon domains are related evolutionarily and mechanistically and how this may result in different cleavage activities. Here we used a combination of mutagenesis, cleavage assays, and x-ray crystallography to unravel the molecular basis for differential intrinsic RNA cleavage activities of Pol II and Pol III and suggest how the C-ribbon domains are related evolutionarily and how different cleavage activities arose during evolution.DISCUSSIONOur results unravel the molecular basis for the difference in RNA cleavage activities of Pol II and Pol III. We show that replacement of the Rpb9 C-ribbon by the C11 C-ribbon confers strong intrinsic cleavage to Pol II. This unexpected gain of function stems from a switch in the cleavage mechanism, as suggested by x-ray crystallography and mutagenesis. Although the Rpb9 C-ribbon acts allosterically from the polymerase surface, the C11 C-ribbon acts directly by binding the pore and complementing the active center with its catalytic hairpin. Thus two modes exist for polymerase-intrinsic RNA cleavage, an allosteric, weak mode used by Rpb9, and a direct, strong mode used by C11 and TFIIS.Our results also suggest a model for how polymerase cleavage activities evolved (Fig. 1B). Pol I and Pol III have strong intrinsic cleavage activities because they contain homologues of archaeal TFS (A12.2 and C11, respectively) that contain C-ribbons with catalytic hairpins that can enter the pore to directly stimulate cleavage. In the Pol II system, the two domains are, however, part of two different polypeptides. Although the N-ribbon is part of Rpb9, the C-ribbon is part of TFIIS. During evolution, the C-ribbon likely duplicated and was altered in Rpb9 to attach the domain to the surface and to allow only for weak, allosteric cleavage induction.Our results are consistent with published data. First, mutation of the C11 hairpin residues is lethal (10Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, the C11 C-ribbon is not observed on the surface in a recent electron microscopic structure of Pol III, consistent with transient binding to the pore (29Fernández-Tornero C. Böttcher B. Rashid U.J. Steuerwald U. Flörchinger B. Devos D.P. Lindner D. Müller C.W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3762-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, C11 and A12.2 are required for transcription termination by Pol I and Pol III (10Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Prescott E.M. Osheim Y.N. Jones H.S. Alen C.M. Roan J.G. Reeder R.H. Beyer A.L. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microbiol. 2008; 67: 958-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but is different in Pol II.

Here we used a combination of mutagenesis, cleavage assays, and x-ray crystallography to unravel the molecular basis for differential intrinsic RNA cleavage activities of Pol II and Pol III and suggest how the C-ribbon domains are related evolutionarily and how different cleavage activities arose during evolution. DISCUSSIONOur results unravel the molecular basis for the difference in RNA cleavage activities of Pol II and Pol III. We show that replacement of the Rpb9 C-ribbon by the C11 C-ribbon confers strong intrinsic cleavage to Pol II. This unexpected gain of function stems from a switch in the cleavage mechanism, as suggested by x-ray crystallography and mutagenesis. Although the Rpb9 C-ribbon acts allosterically from the polymerase surface, the C11 C-ribbon acts directly by binding the pore and complementing the active center with its catalytic hairpin. Thus two modes exist for polymerase-intrinsic RNA cleavage, an allosteric, weak mode used by Rpb9, and a direct, strong mode used by C11 and TFIIS.Our results also suggest a model for how polymerase cleavage activities evolved (Fig. 1B). Pol I and Pol III have strong intrinsic cleavage activities because they contain homologues of archaeal TFS (A12.2 and C11, respectively) that contain C-ribbons with catalytic hairpins that can enter the pore to directly stimulate cleavage. In the Pol II system, the two domains are, however, part of two different polypeptides. Although the N-ribbon is part of Rpb9, the C-ribbon is part of TFIIS. During evolution, the C-ribbon likely duplicated and was altered in Rpb9 to attach the domain to the surface and to allow only for weak, allosteric cleavage induction.Our results are consistent with published data. First, mutation of the C11 hairpin residues is lethal (10Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, the C11 C-ribbon is not observed on the surface in a recent electron microscopic structure of Pol III, consistent with transient binding to the pore (29Fernández-Tornero C. Böttcher B. Rashid U.J. Steuerwald U. Flörchinger B. Devos D.P. Lindner D. Müller C.W. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 3762-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, C11 and A12.2 are required for transcription termination by Pol I and Pol III (10Chédin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C.

One of These Things Is Not Like the Others… Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 286Issue 21PreviewThe eukaryotic RNA polymerases Pol I, II, and III share a highly conserved active center that catalyzes DNA-dependent RNA synthesis during gene transcription. The same active center also catalyzes cleavage of the nascent transcript during proofreading and recovery from transcription arrest. Despite the similarity in their active centers, Pol I and III have very strong intrinsic cleavage activity whereas Pol II has only weak cleavage activity. In this Paper of the Week, Wenjie Ruan and colleagues use a clever combination of mutagenesis and cleavage assays along with x-ray crystallography to unravel the molecular basis of this difference in cleavage activities and suggest how these activities arose during evolution.

Among the least understood of these complex processes are the molecular mechanisms that underlie sperm guidance by environmental chemical cues. A “hard-wired” Ca2+ signaling strategy that orchestrates specific motility patterns according to given functional requirements is an emerging concept for regulation of sperm swimming behavior. The molecular players involved, the spatiotemporal characteristics of such motility-associated Ca2+ dynamics, and the relation between a distinct Ca2+ signaling pattern and a behavioral sperm phenotype, however, remain largely unclear. Here, we report the functional characterization of two human sperm chemoreceptors. Using complementary molecular, physiological, and behavioral approaches, we comparatively describe sperm Ca2+ responses to specific agonists of these novel receptors and bourgeonal, a known sperm chemoattractant. We further show that individual receptor activation induces specific Ca2+ signaling patterns with unique spatiotemporal dynamics. These distinct Ca2+ dynamics are correlated to a set of stimulus-specific stereotyped behavioral responses that could play vital roles during various stages of prefusion sperm-egg chemical communication.

We further show that individual receptor activation induces specific Ca2+ signaling patterns with unique spatiotemporal dynamics. These distinct Ca2+ dynamics are correlated to a set of stimulus-specific stereotyped behavioral responses that could play vital roles during various stages of prefusion sperm-egg chemical communication."
https://openalex.org/W2023510842,"Background Cerebral microbleeds, visible on gradient-recalled echo (GRE) T2* MRI, have generated increasing interest as an imaging marker of small vessel diseases, with relevance for intracerebral bleeding risk or brain dysfunction. Methodology/Principal Findings Manual rating methods have limited reliability and are time-consuming. We developed a new method for microbleed detection using automated segmentation (MIDAS) and compared it with a validated visual rating system. In thirty consecutive stroke service patients, standard GRE T2* images were acquired and manually rated for microbleeds by a trained observer. After spatially normalizing each patient's GRE T2* images into a standard stereotaxic space, the automated microbleed detection algorithm (MIDAS) identified cerebral microbleeds by explicitly incorporating an “extra” tissue class for abnormal voxels within a unified segmentation-normalization model. The agreement between manual and automated methods was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa statistic. We found that MIDAS had generally moderate to good agreement with the manual reference method for the presence of lobar microbleeds (Kappa = 0.43, improved to 0.65 after manual exclusion of obvious artefacts). Agreement for the number of microbleeds was very good for lobar regions: (ICC = 0.71, improved to ICC = 0.87). MIDAS successfully detected all patients with multiple (≥2) lobar microbleeds. Conclusions/Significance MIDAS can identify microbleeds on standard MR datasets, and with an additional rapid editing step shows good agreement with a validated visual rating system. MIDAS may be useful in screening for multiple lobar microbleeds."
https://openalex.org/W2103908877,"TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a nuclear factor functioning in RNA processing. It is also a major deposited protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin (FTLD-U). To understand the mechanism underlying the inclusion body formation and possible functional alteration, we studied some TDP-43 fragments and their effects on RNA processing in cell models. The results show that the 35-kDa fragment of TDP-43 (namely TDP-35, residues 90-414), but not TDP-25A (184-414), is capable of forming cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and altering pre-mRNA splicing. The inclusions formed by TDP-35 can also recruit full-length TDP-43 to cytoplasmic deposition from functionally nuclear localization. The in vitro studies demonstrate that TDP-35, rather than TDP-43 and TDP-25A, is prone to aggregation, and it further serves as a seed to facilitate aggregation of full-length TDP-43. This suggests that fragmentation of TDP-43 leads to cellular redistribution, inclusion body formation, and altered RNA processing, which are implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of ALS and FTLD."
https://openalex.org/W1965791697,"The multimodular guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) of the Dbl family mostly share a tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain organization. The function of these and other domains in the DH-mediated regulation of the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the Rho proteins is the subject of intensive investigations. This comparative study presents detailed kinetic data on specificity, activity, and regulation of the catalytic DH domains of four GEFs, namely p115, p190, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). We demonstrate that (i) these GEFs are specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho isoforms (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) and inactive toward other members of the Rho family, including Rac1, Cdc42, and TC10. (ii) The DH domain of LARG exhibits the highest catalytic activity reported for a Dbl protein till now with a maximal acceleration of the nucleotide exchange by 10<sup>7</sup>-fold, which is at least as efficient as reported for GEFs specific for Ran or the bacterial toxin SopE. (iii) A novel regulatory region at the N terminus of the DH domain is involved in its association with GDP-bound RhoA monitored by a fluorescently labeled RhoA. (iv) The tandem PH domains of p115 and PRG efficiently contribute to the DH-mediated nucleotide exchange reaction. (v) In contrast to the isolated DH or DH-PH domains, a p115 fragment encompassing both the regulator of G-protein signaling and the DH domains revealed a significantly reduced GEF activity, supporting the proposed models of an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism for p115-like RhoGEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2118600419,"Paracingulin is a 160-kDa protein localized in the cytoplasmic region of epithelial tight and adherens junctions, where it regulates RhoA and Rac1 activities by interacting with guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the recruitment of paracingulin to cell-cell junctions. We show that paracingulin forms a complex with the tight junction protein ZO-1, and the globular head domain of paracingulin interacts directly with ZO-1 through an N-terminal region containing a conserved ZIM (ZO-1-Interaction-Motif) sequence. Recruitment of paracingulin to cadherin-based cell-cell junctions in Rat1 fibroblasts requires the ZIM-containing region, whereas in epithelial cells removal of this region decreases the junctional localization of paracingulin at tight junctions but not at adherens junctions. Depletion of ZO-1, but not ZO-2, reduces paracingulin accumulation at tight junctions. A yeast two-hybrid screen identifies both ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein PLEKHA7 as paracingulin-binding proteins. Paracingulin forms a complex with PLEKHA7 and its interacting partner p120ctn, and the globular head domain of paracingulin interacts directly with a central region of PLEKHA7. Depletion of PLEKHA7 from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells results in the loss of junctional localization of paracingulin and a decrease in its expression. In summary, we characterize ZO-1 and PLEKHA7 as paracingulin-interacting proteins that are involved in its recruitment to epithelial tight and adherens junctions, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2010919598,"MDM2 regulates p53 predominantly by promoting p53 ubiquitination. However, ubiquitination-independent mechanisms of MDM2 have also been implicated. Here we show that MDM2 inhibits p53 DNA binding activity in vitro and in vivo. MDM2 binding promotes p53 to adopt a mutant-like conformation, losing reactivity to antibody Pab1620, while exposing the Pab240 epitope. The acidic domain of MDM2 is required to induce p53 conformational change and inhibit p53 DNA binding. Alternate reading frame binding to the MDM2 acidic domain restores p53 wild type conformation and rescues DNA binding activity. Furthermore, histone methyl transferase SUV39H1 binding to the MDM2 acidic domain also restores p53 wild type conformation and allows p53-MDM2-SUV39H1 complex to bind DNA. These results provide further evidence for an ubiquitination-independent mechanism of p53 regulation by MDM2 and reveal how MDM2-interacting repressors gain access to p53 target promoters and repress transcription. Furthermore, we show that the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin cooperates with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib by stimulating p53 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, providing a rationale for combination therapy using proteasome and MDM2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2063482892,"Arp2/3 complex is a key actin filament nucleator that assembles branched actin networks in response to cellular signals. The activity of Arp2/3 complex is regulated by both activating and inhibitory proteins. Coronins make up a large class of actin-binding proteins previously shown to inhibit Arp2/3 complex. Although coronins are known to play a role in controlling actin dynamics in diverse processes, including endocytosis and cell motility, the precise mechanism by which they regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. We conducted a detailed biochemical analysis of budding yeast coronin, Crn1, and found that it not only inhibits Arp2/3 complex but also activates it. We mapped regions required for activation and found that Crn1 contains a sequence called CA, which is conserved in WASp/Scar proteins, the prototypical activators of Arp2/3 complex. Point mutations in CA abolished activation of Arp2/3 complex by Crn1 in vitro. Confocal microscopy and quantitative actin patch tracking showed that these mutants had defective endocytic actin patch dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, indicating that activation of Arp2/3 complex by coronin is required for normal actin dynamics in vivo. The switch between the dual modes of regulation by Crn1 is controlled by concentration, and low concentrations of Crn1 enhance filament binding by Arp2/3 complex, whereas high concentrations block binding. Our data support a direct tethering recruitment model for activation of Arp2/3 complex by Crn1 and suggest that Crn1 indirectly inhibits Arp2/3 complex by blocking it from binding actin filaments."

The onset of HD symptoms, including motor dysfunction and cognitive decline, occurs when the length of CAG exceeds 36 repeats (2Hendricks A.E. Latourelle J.C. Lunetta K.L. Cupples L.A. Wheeler V.

CAG triplets are translated into a series of uninterrupted glutamine residues (polyQ) at the N terminus of HTT, a ubiquitously expressed protein of ∼350 kDa. HTT is found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm where it associates with a variety of organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria (3Hilditch-Maguire P.

This widespread subcellular localization, associated with the ability to interact with a large number of proteins, implicates HTT in diverse cellular activities ranging from transcription and energy metabolism to vesicle trafficking (6Zuccato C.

Huntington disease huntingtin polyglutamine amino-terminal fragment of huntingtin TNF receptor-associated factor 6 Parkinson disease deleted of the N terminus. The elongation of the polyQ sequence in HTT protein induces HD pathogenesis largely through a gain-of-function mechanism. One hallmark of HD is the presence of neuronal aggregates that contain N-terminal fragments of polyQ HTT (N-HTT). Aggregates or inclusions are found primarily in the striatum and in the cortex of HD patients and are located mainly in nuclear, perinuclear, and cytoplasmic regions of affected neurons (7DiFiglia M.

Although it is still unclear whether inclusions are protective or detrimental for cell viability, their formation seems to be strikingly connected to the propensity of polyQ N-HTT to misfold. In addition to mutant N-HTT, inclusions are enriched for components of the protein quality control machinery, such as ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, and chaperones (7DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O.

All of these are localized in the aggregates of HD post-mortem brains and are able to decrease aggregate formation in vitro. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues, and it is assumed that all of these can be involved in the formation of polyubiquitin chains on target proteins. Canonical Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitination has been related respectively to proteasome degradation of the substrate and to cell signaling or aggresome formation (14Chen Z.J. Sun L.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The role of nonconventional chains via Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, and Lys33 is much less clear (15Ikeda F.

Similarly, nondegradative functions have been associated with Lys27 and Lys29 chains, which have been shown to control subcellular localization and activity of targeted proteins (19Al-Hakim A.K.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes Lys63-specific chain assembly in the signal transduction pathway that leads ultimately to NFκB activation (22Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In the brain, TRAF6 activity has been associated with the transduction cascade of the neurotrophin receptors p75 and TrkA (23Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRAF6 localizes to Tau inclusions and Lewy bodies in brains of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease (PD) patients, respectively (25Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3759-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that E3 ligases tend to accumulate at the site of protein inclusions. Furthermore, TRAF6 was found to promote atypical Lys6-, Lys27-, and Lys29-mediated poly-ubiquitination of mutant DJ-1 and α-synuclein, proteins relevant for PD pathogenesis. Atypical ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 was shown to induce mutant DJ-1 aggregation (26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3759-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the current study, we provide evidence that TRAF6 interacts with and ubiquitinates WT and mutant HTT. In analogy to PD targets, TRAF6 promotes an atypical mode of polyubiquitin chain formation onto N-HTT proteins with selective choice of Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 linkages. We also show that both overexpressed and endogenous TRAF6 is recruited at the site of mutant N-HTT aggregates. Furthermore, TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination stimulates the formation of mutant N-HTT inclusions. Only when atypical Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 ubiquitins are expressed, N-HTT aggregates are strongly positive for ubiquitin. Finally, in post-mortem brains of HD patients, TRAF6 expression is induced, and the protein preferentially accumulates in the insoluble fraction. Altogether, our data imply a novel role for TRAF6 and atypical ubiquitination in HD pathogenesis. N-HTT-GFP Gln21 and Gln150 constructs were described previously (27Persichetti F. Trettel F.

N-HTT-GFP Gln60 was a serendipitous construct obtained during Gln150 plasmid preparation. It was sequence-verified and controlled during each preparation. FLAG-TRAF6 (WT and DN) and HA-ubiquitin (WT and mutants) were described elsewhere (26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol.

Transfections were performed with the standard calcium phosphate method or with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as required. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in TRAF6 buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with anti-protease mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide.

Parietal cortex from HD patients was used for co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in the human brain sample. Lysates were prepared homogenizing tissue in modified TRAF6 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) supplemented with anti-protease mixture. Total protein content was measured, and an equivalent amount was used for co-immunoprecipitation. After washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (1:2000; Sigma), anti-GFP (1:1000; Invitrogen), anti-HA (1:1000; from hybridoma supernatant, kindly provided by Dr. Licio Collavin), anti-HTT (Chemicon, catalog no. MAB 2166), anti-TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-7221), and anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma). For detection, anti-mouse-HRP and anti-rabbit-HRP (Dako) or protein A-HRP (Upstate) in combination with ECL (GE Healthcare) were used. For total protein extracts, cells were lysed directly in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. For cell-based ubiquitination assays, HEK cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, FLAG-TRAF6 (WT or DN), and N-HTT-GFP constructs. After transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS), and samples were briefly sonicated. After centrifugation, clear lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP or anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitin conjugates. For development, protein A-HRP was used. Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out following standard methods (29Zucchelli S. Vilotti S. Calligaris R. Lavina Z.S. Biagioli M. Foti R. De Maso L.

Anti-FLAG (1:1000; SIGMA), anti-ubiquitin (1:50; Dako) and anti-TRAF6 (1:100; catalog no. sc-8409, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used. For detection, Alexa Fluor 405 (blue) or 594 (red) (Invitrogen) labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were used. All images were collected using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2). The analysis of aggregates was performed on high resolution images using ImageJ software. At least 200 cells from two independent experiments were counted and scored for percentage of cells with aggregates. For the analysis of aggregate size, only cells (n = 200) with comparable levels of TRAF6 expression, as determined by fluorescence intensity normalized to cell area, were used. N-HTT cytoplasmic staining was quantified on the same cells on a randomly selected area. Background fluorescence was quantified from an area placed outside the cells and was subtracted to each signal. Control and HD post-mortem brain tissues used in this study were collected by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and described previously (30Fossale E. Wheeler V.C. Vrbanac V. Lebel L.A. Teed A. Mysore J.S. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Persichetti F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HD brains were assigned Vonsattel grade 3 pathology (31Vonsattel J.P. Myers R.H. Stevens T.J. Ferrante R.J. Bird E.D. Richardson Jr., E.P. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Total proteins were extracted from parietal cortex in 10% SDS. Fractionation in soluble and insoluble protein extracts was performed from the cortex as follows; soluble fractions were extracted in 150 mm sucrose, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was removed, and the insoluble fractions were extracted from pellets in 10% SDS. For Western blot analysis, anti-TRAF6 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-7221) and monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-8409) antibodies were used. Total RNA from cortex of pathologically confirmed HD and control subjects was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of purified RNA using the iSCRIPTTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystem). Expression of TRAF6 was analyzed as already described (26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3759-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated in duplicate or more. Confocal images were analyzed with ImageJ software. Western blot scans were quantified with Adobe Photoshop CS3. Data represent the mean with standard deviation. When necessary, each group was compared individually with reference to the control group using Student's t test (Microsoft Excel software). To evaluate whether TRAF6 might have a role in HD, we studied its ability to bind huntingtin amino-terminal fragments (residues 1–171) fused to green fluorescent protein (N-HTT-GFP), with either a physiological (Gln21), or short (Gln60) or long (Gln150) pathological polyQ stretch. N-HTT-GFP constructs were transfected in HEK 293 cells with FLAG-TRAF6 or FLAG-empty vector, as control. Immunoprecipitation of transfected cell lysates revealed a specific binding between TRAF6 and N-HTT with no evident selectivity for polyQ length (Fig. 1a). Reverse co-immunoprecipitation of transfected proteins confirmed that TRAF6 physically associated with N-HTT with a physiological and pathological polyQ stretch (Fig. 1b). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK 293 cells on endogenous proteins proving TRAF6 interaction with full-length WT HTT in vitro (Fig. 1c). The cortex from control WT and HdhQ111 knock-in mice were also analyzed, showing that TRAF6 specifically binds full-length HTT in vivo with no preference for WT or expanded polyQ-containing protein (Fig. 1d). This interaction was confirmed in vivo in the parietal cortex from HD post-mortem brains (Fig. 1e). We then analyzed TRAF6 localization in cells that express WT or mutant N-HTT. WT N-HTT was located both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with a diffused staining throughout the cell. TRAF6 was mainly present in the cytoplasm and partially in the nucleus, where it co-localized with WT N-HTT (Fig. 1, f and g). Similar data were obtained with overexpressed and endogenous TRAF6. Overexpression of WT N-HTT did not alter TRAF6 cellular localization (data not shown). When transfected in cells, mutant N-HTT-GFP (Gln60 and Gln150) developed fluorescent aggregates, as expected, located in the cytoplasm and concentrated in perinuclear regions. The presence of mutant N-HTT aggregates induced the recruitment of TRAF6 at the site of N-HTT inclusions, with a more prominent accumulation at the border (Fig. 1, f and g). Altogether, these results demonstrate that TRAF6 binds huntingtin in vitro and in vivo in a polyQ length-independent manner. Furthermore, mutant protein can sequester TRAF6 into cellular aggregates. The interaction between TRAF6 and N-HTT and their co-localization in polyglutamine aggregates raised the possibility that N-HTT might be target of TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. To test this hypothesis, we performed ubiquitination assay in HEK 293 cells. Cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, N-HTT-GFP with 21, 60, or 150 polyQ segment and with or without FLAG-TRAF6. A TRAF6 mutant deleted of the N-terminal E3 ligase domain (DN) also was included as control. We found that overexpression of WT TRAF6, but not of DN mutant, facilitated the formation of high molecular weight polyubiquitinated forms of N-HTT (Fig. 2). TRAF6 activity was evident toward N-HTT with physiological length of polyQ stretch (Gln21) and for pathological mutants (Gln60 and Gln150). Therefore, TRAF6 ubiquitin-ligase activity did not seem to be polyQ-dependent, as already seen for its binding capability. Because we have shown recently that TRAF6 can promote unconventional ubiquitin linkages on target proteins (26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3759-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we investigated the mode of polyubiquitination mediated by TRAF6 onto N-HTT. We thus took advantage of a set of ubiquitin mutants that we have generated with only one lysine available for chain formation (remaining lysine residues were substituted with arginine). An ubiquitin mutant with all lysines substituted with arginine was also included as negative control (Lys0). Cell-based ubiquitination assay was performed with all N-HTT constructs with or without TRAF6 and in combination with ubiquitin mutants. TRAF6 promoted a robust polyubiquitination of WT N-HTT in the presence of Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 mutants. Background signals were observed with Lys0 mutant (Fig. 3a). Similar results were obtained with mutant N-HTT with short (Gln60) or long (Gln150) polyQ stretch (Fig. 3, b and c). Therefore, we conclude that TRAF6 promotes an atypical polyubiquitination of WT and mutant N-HTT that is independent from polyQ length. Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 are the preferred lysine residues for linkage formation. When expressed in cells, Gln60 and Gln150 mutant, but not Gln21 N-HTT, generated aggregates, with an average size and number that correlate with polyQ length. We examined the influence of TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination on mutant N-HTT aggregation by transient transfection in HEK 293 cells. We included WT N-HTT as an internal reference in all our experiments. Only cells with comparable levels of TRAF6 expression (WT and DN), as determined by fluorescence intensity normalized to cell area, were used for analysis of aggregate number and size. The residual diffuse cytoplasmic staining was also quantified as additional indication of protein segregation into aggregates. TRAF6 overexpression had no influence on WT N-HTT cellular localization, with a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining as expected (Fig. 4a). Mutant N-HTT formed cytoplasmic and perinuclear aggregates, whose number and size correlated with polyQ length (Fig. 4a). Overexpression of TRAF6 increased the percentage of cells with aggregates and promoted the formation of inclusions with an average larger size (Fig. 4, b and c). This is likely due to a redistribution of the mutant protein to inclusions, as total protein levels were not affected by TRAF6 (supplemental Fig. S1) (compatible with a nondegradative role of atypical ubiquitination) and diffuse cytoplasmic staining decreased when aggregate number and size increased (Fig. 4d). The expression of TRAF6 DN mutant had no effect on percentage, size, and distribution of N-HTT aggregates, thus indicating that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity is required for its function on mutant N-HTT inclusion formation. Because TRAF6 is recruited at the site of N-HTT aggregates and affects inclusion formation, we asked whether mutant protein might affect TRAF6 E3 ligase activity. To do so, we followed TRAF6 autoubiquitination by immunoprecipitation assay. We included WT N-HTT as an internal control. We found no differences in the levels of ubiquitinated TRAF6 when Gln21, Gln60, or Gln150 N-HTT was expressed (supplemental Fig. S2). Altogether, these data suggest a scenario in which TRA6-mediated ubiquitination may control N-HTT recruitment into aggregate structures without affecting its steady-state levels. To functionally link TRAF6-mediated atypical ubiquitination with mutant N-HTT aggregates, HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin, FLAG-TRAF6, and N-HTT-GFP Gln150. Aggregates were analyzed by double immunofluorescence coupled with GFP autofluorescence. First, we set the system using WT ubiquitin (Fig. 5a). Overexpression of ubiquitin per se enhanced N-HTT inclusion formation, as expected for the well established role of the UPS in mutant N-HTT aggregation. Nonetheless, under these conditions, ubiquitin staining was diffuse throughout the cell and did not accumulate at the site of N-HTT inclusions (Fig. 5a, upper panels). When TRAF6 was added to the system, all of the components coalesced into the aggregates, which appeared strongly stained with both ubiquitin and TRAF6 (Fig. 5a, lower panels). To prove that TRAF6 action on mutant N-HTT aggregates involved atypical ubiquitination, we carried out analogous experiments with ubiquitin mutants that were shown to be involved in N-HTT ubiquitination (Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29). As control, we used a Lys11 mutant that mediates polychain formation but is not used by TRAF6. Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 were able to recapitulate the phenotype observed with WT ubiquitin (Fig. 5b). On the contrary, the Lys11 mutant did not accumulate into N-HTT inclusions. Together, these data provide evidence that TRAF6-mediated atypical activity is involved in controlling the composition of mutant N-HTT aggregates. To obtain further evidence supporting the role of TRAF6 in HD pathogenesis, we assessed the expression of TRAF6 in human post-mortem brains from patients and age-matched healthy controls. First, TRAF6 mRNA expression was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR in RNA extracted from parietal cortex of controls and HD (Vonsattel grade 3 neuropathology) brains. TRAF6 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in HD compared with controls, with an average increase of 1.6-fold (Fig. 6a). We then tested whether TRAF6 up-regulation also was present at the protein level. Samples dissected from the parietal cortex of HD and control patients were used to prepare total protein extracts. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. To avoid artifacts due to unspecific signals, experiments were carried out using two different, commercially available anti-TRAF6 antibodies. Endogenous TRAF6 protein was slightly up-regulated in HD versus control samples (Fig. 6b). Quantification of TRAF6 signal demonstrated that the increase was statistically significant (Fig. 6c). Because we found that mutant N-HTT promotes TRAF6 accumulation at the aggregates in cell culture system, TRAF6 distribution was studied in soluble and insoluble protein fractions prepared from human brain samples. Loading was normalized for total protein quantity in each of the two fractions. In HD and controls, TRAF6 was present mainly in the insoluble fraction. In this compartment, there was a statistically significant accumulation of TRAF6 in HD versus controls. Altogether, these data suggest an effect of mutant huntingtin on TRAF6 expression and solubility. The ubiquitin proteasome system is under intense scrutiny in the study of neurodegenerative diseases. Different E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases have been shown to ubiquitinate aggregate-prone mutant proteins via Lys48 and Lys63 moieties. In the present study, we have found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 interacts with WT and mutant N-HTT in vitro as well as with endogenous full-length proteins in vivo and ubiquitinates both WT and mutant N-HTT through conjugation of atypical ubiquitin chains linked at Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29. Unconventional ubiquitination recently has provided new moieties to regulate cell signaling, intracellular trafficking, and biochemical activities (15Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). A variety of cellular functions have been associated to atypical ubiquitination with Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 linkages that include protein degradation, regulation of proteasome activity as well as control of target protein localization and function. The E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, found mutated in genetic cases of PD, is an HTT interactor that has been shown to act with atypical Lys27 linkage on mitochondrial target VDAC1 to control mitophagy (32Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of androgen receptor, another polyQ containing protein, is regulated by Lys6 and Lys27 ubiquitination through modulation of cofactor recruitment to a subset of androgen receptor target genes (21Xu K. Shimelis H. Linn D.E. Jiang R. Yang X. Sun F. Guo Z. Chen H. Li W. Chen H. Kong X. Melamed J. Fang S. Xiao Z. Veenstra T.D. Qiu Y. Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 270-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In both cases, atypical ubiquitination regulates protein function without affecting its degradation rate. Interestingly, we found that both WT and mutant N-HTT are ubiquitinated with no evident selectivity for polyQ length. It is conceivable to hypothesize that atypical ubiquitination of N-HTT might exert diverse functions when associated to WT or mutant polyQ stretch even if the mode of ubiquitination is maintained. Although the ubiquitination of mutant N-HTT by TRAF6 was found to induce aggregate formation, the role of this post-translational modification in WT N-HTT is unclear and deserves further investigation. Recent data have proven the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins with unconventional ubiquitin linkages in the brain of HD mouse models (9Bennett E.J. Shaler T.A. Woodman B. Ryu K.Y. Zaitseva T.S. Becker C.H. Bates G.P. Schulman H. Kopito R.R. Nature. 2007; 448: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In HD, it is well established that neuronal inclusions that contain mutant HTT in human post-mortem brains and in mouse models are stained heavily for ubiquitin (7DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar, 33Sieradzan K.A. Mechan A.O. Jones L. Wanker E.E. Nukina N. Mann D.M. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In vitro, our data demonstrated that atypical ubiquitin, N-HTT, and TRAF6 were all localized to the aggregates. Differently from all of the ubiquitin ligases studied so far in HD, TRAF6 promoted aggregate formation and segregated ubiquitin at the site of N-HTT inclusion. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that TRAF6 elicited aggresome formation of the PD-associated mutant DJ-1 L166P (26Zucchelli S. Codrich M. Marcuzzi F. Pinto M. Vilotti S. Biagioli M. Ferrer I. Gustincich S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3759-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An important debate is ongoing on the effects of aggregate formation on cell viability in vivo. Among the various functional consequences, it has been hypothesized that inclusions can act as a sink for prosurvival proteins, thus depleting the neuronal cell of soluble, active molecules. In HD postmortem brains, we found that TRAF6 was up-regulated and accumulated in the insoluble protein fraction. For the majority of the ubiquitin ligases found trapped in cellular inclusions, a concomitant increase in expression has been measured in post-mortem brains, suggesting a homeostasis response aimed to preserve a physiological concentration of the molecule. Under this model, we speculate that TRAF6 sequestration in vivo may deplete soluble TRAF6 in neurons impairing some of its physiological functions. In vitro TRAF6 was able to increase both the number and size of intracellular aggregates via an atypical mode of ubiquitination. In general, larger aggregates tend to be disposed by the autophagy/lysosomal pathway. TRAF6 recently has been shown to be involved in autophagy via its Lys63-specific activity on Beclin-1 in the context of innate immunity (34Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra42Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAF6 was able to bind p62/SQSTM1 (25Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which anchors aggregated structures to LC3 and autophagosomes. Importantly, p62 is a component of the ubiquitinated proteins found in the inclusions of exon 1 mice and in cells overexpressing the N-terminal fragment of mutant HTT (35Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 36Nagaoka U. Kim K. Jana N.R. Doi H. Maruyama M. Mitsui K. Oyama F. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because Lys27 ubiquitination of Jun and Lys29 of Deltex have been recently involved in their recruitment to autophagic and/or storage vesicles (20Ikeda H. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 4588-4601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to study whether TRAF6 atypical ubiquitin ligase activity has an impact on autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders. It recently has been demonstrated that, similarly to Lys63, Lys27-linked ubiquitin chains are recognized by p62/SQSTM1 to label target proteins for autophagy (32Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar). Our preliminary results (data not shown) indicate that TRAF6 is able to bind LC3 in transfected cells, further supporting our hypothesis that TRAF6 and atypical ubiquitination may favor alternative fates of misfolded aggregated proteins. In the future, the generation of reagents to discriminate among Lys6, Lys27, and Lys29 ubiquitin chains and the improvement of proteomic techniques to be used on small amount of human autoptic samples will definitely help the study of atypical ubiquitination in various cellular processes in vivo and from diseased brains.

https://openalex.org/W2156510247,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of ligands signals along two intracellular pathways, Smad2/3-mediated TGF-β/activin pathway and Smad1/5/8-mediated bone morphogenetic protein pathway. The C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the degradation of Smad proteins and many other signaling proteins. However, the molecular mechanism for CHIP-mediated down-regulation of TGF-β signaling remains unclear. Here we show that the extreme C-terminal sequence of Smad1 plays an indispensable role in its direct association with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of CHIP. Interestingly, Smad1 undergoes CHIP-mediated polyubiquitination in the absence of molecular chaperones, and phosphorylation of the C-terminal SXS motif of Smad1 enhances the interaction and ubiquitination. We also found that CHIP preferentially binds to Smad1/5 and specifically disrupts the core signaling complex of Smad1/5 and Smad4. We determined the crystal structures of CHIP-TPR in complex with the phosphorylated/pseudophosphorylated Smad1 peptides and with an Hsp70/Hsc70 C-terminal peptide. Structural analyses and subsequent biochemical studies revealed that the distinct CHIP binding affinities of Smad1/5 or Smad2/3 result from the nonconservative hydrophobic residues at R-Smad C termini. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal peptides from Smad1 and Hsp70/Hsc70 bind in the same groove of CHIP-TPR, and heat shock proteins compete with Smad1/5 for CHIP interaction and concomitantly suppress, rather than facilitate, CHIP-mediated Smad ubiquitination. Thus, we conclude that CHIP inhibits the signaling activities of Smad1/5 by recruiting Smad1/5 from the functional R-/Co-Smad complex and further promoting the ubiquitination/degradation of Smad1/5 in a chaperone-independent manner."

The catalytic constant of the MKP3 reaction for p38α is comparable with that for ERK2. Remarkably, MKP3, ERK2, and phosphorylated p38α can form a stable ternary complex in solution, and the phosphatase activity of MKP3 toward p38α substrate is allosterically regulated by ERK2-MKP3 interaction.

MAPK pathways convert different extracellular stimuli into specific cellular responses and mediate various physiological processes, including cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and stress responses. There are three major mammalian MAPK subfamilies: ERK, JNK and p38 (1Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C.

Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). The ERKs are typically activated by growth factors and phorbol ester, whereas JNK and p38 MAPKs are primarily activated by cytokines and environmental stress. MAPK activity is tightly controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Full activation of the MAPKs requires phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif by their specific upstream dual specificity kinases (MAPK kinases). After activation, each MAPK phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which include key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear receptors, regulators of apoptosis, and many transcription factors. The regulated dephosphorylation of MAPKs plays a key role in determining the magnitude and duration of kinase activation and hence the physiological outcome of signaling. MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MKP, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase; HePTP, hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase; STEP, striatal enriched phosphatase; PTP-SL, striatal enriched phosphatase-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase; MESG, 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine; pNPP, para-nitrophenyl phosphate; p38α/pTpY, p38α phosphorylated on both Thr180 and Tyr182; p38α/pY, p38α phosphorylated on Tyr182; p38α/pT, p38α phosphorylated on Thr180; ERK2/pTpY, ERK2 phosphorylated on both Thr180 and Tyr182. are important negative regulators of MAPK signaling. MKPs belong to a family of dual specificity phosphatases and specifically dephosphorylate both threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop of MAPKs. In mammalian cells, there are 10 distinct catalytically active MKPs. Several of these MKPs display distinct in vivo substrate preferences for the various MAPKs. For example, it has been shown that MKP3 selectively targets ERK, whereas MKP5 shows a preference for JNK and p38 (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 9Dickinson R.J. Keyse S.M. J.

MKP3 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and is highly specific for ERK1/2 inactivation (10Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

MKP3 contains a conserved catalytic domain in its C terminus and a less conserved MAPK binding domain at its N terminus (supplemental Fig. S1). The inactive ERK1/2, but not p38 and JNK MAPKs, can form a tight complex with MKP3 via the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and the C-lobe of ERK2. Unlike other PTPases and constitutively active MKPs, MKP3 exhibits very low activity toward small phosphoesters, such as para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), and binding of ERK to the N-terminal domain of MKP3 causes its catalytic activation in vitro. Neither JNK nor p38 MAPKs stimulated significant MKP3 catalytic activity over basal levels (14Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S.

Thus, it has been suggested that the noncatalytic N-terminal domain of MKP3 plays an important role in controlling its substrate specificity and that the ERK-induced MKP3 activation may be responsible for the selective inactivation of ERK MAPKs by MKP3 (8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although studies with small molecule substrates have yielded useful information about MKP3 catalysis, our knowledge of its physiological functions is somewhat less complete. Two important questions concerning the dephosphorylation mechanism of its authentic substrate remain unresolved. How does MKP3 differentially recognize and bind to MAPK isoforms? How does complex formation lead to conformational change within the catalytic domain of MKP3? In this study, we challenge the notion that MKP3, a prototypical ERK-specific MKP, displays little or no activity toward the p38 MAPK isoform. Contrary to a large body of literature, our investigations first show that MKP3 is able to effectively dephosphorylate the phosphotyrosine, but not phosphothreonine, in the activation loop of p38α MAPK in vitro and in intact cells. The catalytic efficiency of MKP3 reaction for p38α substrate is comparable with that for ERK2 as well as other tyrosine-specific phosphatases, including HePTP, PTP-SL, and STEP. Remarkably, binding of ERK2 to the noncatalytic domain of MKP3 increases the catalytic activity of MKP3 toward phosphorylated p38α. These results suggest that phosphorylated p38α is a physiological substrate for MKP3. To gain further insight into the phosphorylation-dependent binding of p38α to MKP3, we determined the crystal structure of bisphosphorylated, active p38α at 2.1 Å resolution. Comparisons between the phosphorylated kinase structures reveal that although p38α and p38γ have greater sequence similarity, the structure of phosphorylated p38γ is more similar to ERK2 than to p38α. The conformation of the activation lip of active p38α is distinct from the phosphorylated ERK2 and p38γ. This structural information reveals new insights into the mechanism of p38α activation by dual phosphorylation and the molecular basis of MKP3 substrate specificity. The N-terminal His6-tagged human MKP5, human HePTP, rat PTP-SL(147–549), mouse STEP, human PP2Cα, and a C-terminal His6-tagged rat MKP3 and its mutants (MKP3C293S, MKP3/ΔN151, and MKP3C293S/ΔN151) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by a nickel-NTA column (Qiagen), followed by an anion exchange Source 15Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The mouse N-terminally His6-tagged unphosphorylated ERK2 and p38α were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by a nickel-NTA column, followed by Source 15Q column. Bisphosphorylated MAPK (ERK2/pTpY or p38α/pTpY) was obtained by coexpressing MAPK (ERK2 or p38α) and its cognate constitutively active MKK (MEK1EEΔN4 or MKK6EE) in vivo. Both MAPK and its cognate MKK were subcloned into the same plasmid pETDuet-1 (Novagen). The bisphosphorylated p38α/pTpY and ERK2/pTpY proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel-NTA, followed by Source 15Q and a size exclusion Superdex 200 column. The purified proteins for enzyme assay were made to 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The protein for crystallization was stored in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) at −80 °C. Crystals of active p38α were obtained at 20 °C in 5 days using the hanging drop technique containing equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir buffer (20–25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m sodium citrate, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Crystals were transferred into the cryoprotectant containing reservoir buffer with 20% glycerol before being “flash-cooled” at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas. X-ray data were collected on a home laboratory x-ray system (Rigaku FR-E rotating anode x-ray generator with an R-AXIS IV++ image plate area detector). Data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Processing of X-ray Diffraction Data Collected in Oscillation Mode, Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 47.3 Å, b = 52.3 Å, c = 168.1 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. There was one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) with the search model of inactive p38α (Protein Data Bank code 1p38). Multiple rounds of the model building and the refinement were carried out with Coot (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and PHENIX (21Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). The final Rfree was 18.2%, and the Rfactor was 23.9%. The final model spans nearly the entire molecule, comprising residues 1–354 and two covalently bound phosphate ions, with residues 355–360 missing because of disordered loops that are not visible in any electron density map. PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to analyze the model stereochemistry. All of the residues were in the most favored and additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated p38α and ERK2 were determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (23Cheng Q. Wang Z.X. Killilea S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 26591-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This assay incorporates a coupled enzyme system, which uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromogenic substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine (MESG) for the quantification of inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction (26Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 1.8 ml of reaction mixture (pH 7.0 buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μm MESG, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase). The reaction was initiated by adding a catalytic amount of phosphates to a reaction mixture, and the dephosphorylation reaction of bisphosphorylated ERK2 and p38α was detected by monitoring the real-time phosphate release at 360 nm. The time courses of absorbance change at 360 nm resulting from the MESG/phosphorylase coupling reaction were recorded on a Lambda 14 PerkinElmer spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. Initial rates were determined from the linear slope of progress curves obtained, and the experimental data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression analysis program. The change in absorbance was due to the conversion of MESG to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine in the presence of inorganic phosphate released from the dephosphorylation of ERK2 and p38α by MKP3. Quantitation of phosphate release was determined using an extinction coefficient of 11,200 m−1 cm−1 for the phosphate-dependent reaction at 360 nm at pH 7.0 (27Sergienko E.A. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of MAPK phosphorylation was then calculated by dividing the relative concentration of the phosphate by that of ERK2 or p38α. The concentration of MESG was determined at 331 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 32,000 m−1 cm−1. Size exclusion chromatography was performed to determine the apparent molecular weight of proteins. 0.1 ml of each sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column, preequilibrated in the buffer (50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA), and run at 4 °C using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the molecular weight markers. For expression in HEK293T cells, cDNAs coding the sequence of wild-type MKP3, mutant MKP3C293S, and HePTP were subcloned into the pCMV-Myc (Clontech) vector. Plasmid pcDL-SRα 296-Myc containing wild type MKP5 was kindly provided by Dr. Eisuke Nishida. The coding region of wild-type p38α was subcloned into pCS2+FLAG vector. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with a total of 2 μg of DNA using VigoFect transfection reagent (Vigorous Biotechnology). After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated for 30 min with 0.5 m sorbitol. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm NaF, and 2 mm Na3VO4). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A/G plus-agarose beads (sc-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)) and anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). After incubation of the membranes with anti-bisphosphorylated p38 (catalog no. 9211, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-phospho-Tyr (catalog no. 9411, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-Myc (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-FLAG antibodies, specific immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL reagents. ITC studies were performed on MacroCal VP-ITC (Northampton, MA). 1.8 mm KIM peptide dissolved in the reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl was titrated against 130 μm ERK2, p38α, or p38α/pTpY proteins in the same buffer. The data were fitted using the software Origin 7.0. To understand the molecular basis of the substrate specificity of MKP3, we prepared milligram quantities of bisphosphorylated ERK2 and p38α (ERK2/pTpY and p38α/pTpY) (25Zhang Y.Y. Mei Z.Q. Wu J.W. Wang Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26591-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This p38α/pTpY preparation corresponds to the highest reported activity against ATF2Δ109 for this enzyme (29Szafranska A.E. Dalby K.N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4631-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The values of kcat and Km were determined to be 4.14 ± 0.06 s−1 and 1.81 ± 0.09 μm, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). We then examined the dephosphorylation kinetics and substrate specificity of MKP3 for ERK2/pTpY and p38α/pTpY using a spectrophotometric method for the quantitation of inorganic phosphate (25Zhang Y.Y. Mei Z.Q. Wu J.W. Wang Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26591-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows typical progress curves of ERK2/pTpY and p38α/pTpY dephosphorylation by MKP3. Both MAPKs can be dephosphorylated rapidly by MKP3. When all the substrate has been converted to product, the phosphorylation stoichiometry of ERK2 was determined to be close to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of ERK2. In comparison, the dephosphorylation rate of p38α/pTpY was about 3-fold slower than that of ERK2/pTpY, and only one equivalent of inorganic phosphates was released upon treatment of p38α/pTpY with MKP3. The phosphorylation state of p38α was further determined by the amount of inorganic phosphate released from p38α upon treatment by various phosphatases (Fig. 1B). The addition of MKP3 (400 nm) to a reaction mixture containing 0.75 μm p38α/pTpY yielded stoichiometric amounts of phosphate released from p38α. The subsequent addition of HePTP to the reaction mixture did not cause any absorbance change at 360 nm, whereas further addition of MKP5 produced another equivalent of inorganic phosphatase, indicating that the purified p38α was phosphorylated equally at Thr180 and Tyr182 (to 1:1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein). We also quantified the variously phosphorylated forms of p38α by performing Western blot analysis using anti-bisphosphorylated p38 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1C). When probed with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody, only p38α/pTpY and p38α/pY showed immunoreactivity (top), and when probed with an anti-bisphosphorylated p38 antibody, only p38α/pTpY and p38α/pT displayed immunoreactivity (middle). No measurable immunoreactivity was apparent with the p38α/pT sample toward anti-Tyr(P) antibody, indicating that dephosphorylation by MKP3 was complete. Thus, our results showed that MKP3 can efficiently hydrolyze Tyr(P) in p38α/pTpY, and the dephosphorylation rate of p38α/pTpY by MKP3 is much faster than that reported by Groom et al. (10Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this discrepancy between the two studies might be that the activated Xenopus p38α used in their study was not fully phosphorylated at Tyr183 (see Fig. 5B of Ref. 10Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) because it is generally difficult to obtain high phosphorylation stoichiometry with the wild type MAPK by in vitro activation (30Szafranska A.E. Luo X. Dalby K.N. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A second intriguing possibility could be due to different origins of p38α proteins because the Xenopus p38α homologue was used by Groom et al. (10Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and ours is of a mammalian origin. MKP3 might exhibit different substrate specificity for the recombinant p38 proteins. For example, we have looked at the ability of MKP3 to dephosphorylate bisphosphorylated p38γ and found that MKP3 is unable to dephosphorylate this isoform of p38 MAPK under identical experimental conditions (Fig. 1D). MKP3 is a rather inefficient enzyme toward small phosphoesters, such as pNPP. However, in the presence of ERK, the catalytic activity of MKP3 increases >35-fold toward pNPP (14Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 31Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The activation of MKP3 is thought to be achieved via the interaction between the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and the non-catalytic regions of ERK2. Thus, MKP3 substrate specificity is linked to the ability of substrate to induce productive orientation in the active site. To evaluate the role of the N-terminal domain of MKP3 in conferring tyrosine specificity to p38α, we examined the dephosphorylation of p38α/pTpY by MKP3/ΔN151 (an N-terminally truncated MKP3, lacking the first 1–151 amino acids) (32Zhao Y. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the time dependence of Pi release from p38α/pTpY for sequential additions of different phosphatase into the coupled reaction system. After completion of MKP3/ΔN151-catalyzed p38α reaction, the addition of HePTP to the reaction mixture did not cause detectable Pi release, whereas the further addition of MKP5 produced another equivalent of inorganic phosphate. This result indicates that MKP3/ΔN151 still specifically dephosphorylated the phosphotyrosine of p38α/pTpY, and the N-terminal domain of MKP3 is not a major determinant for the tyrosine specificity toward p38α. Next, we tested whether the ERK2-induced MKP3 activation is unique for small molecule aryl phosphates. In the initial experiments, the amount of ERK2 required to activate MKP3 maximally was determined by measuring the initial velocities at increasing concentrations of ERK2 and a fixed concentration of phosphatase substrate pNPP. Increasing amounts of ERK2 were added to a solution in which the concentration of MKP3 was at least 10 times higher than the dissociation constant, and the results were plotted to give the stoichiometry. Consistent with previous observations (33Fjeld C.C. Rice A.E. Kim Y. Gee K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6749-6757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we found that the activation of MKP3 by ERK2 is saturable, and maximal activation resulted from an MKP3/ERK2 ratio of 1:1, suggesting a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between MKP3 and ERK2 (Fig. 2B). We then examined the effects of ERK2 on the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of p38α. Fig. 2C shows typical progress curves of the MKP3-catalyzed reaction in the absence and presence of ERK2. It can be seen from this figure that binding of ERK2 to MKP3 significantly increases the rate of MKP3-catalyzed p38α/pTpY dephosphorylation, whereas at the same time it still renders MKP3 incapable of dephosphorylating Thr(P) in p38α/pTpY. These results suggest that ERK2 and activated p38α are capable of binding to MKP3 simultaneously, and MKP3 undergoes catalytic activation toward other protein substrate (phosphorylated p38α) when bound to ERK2. The various phosphorylation states of p38α were also confirmed by Western blot analysis as described above (Fig. 2D). Finally, we evaluated the effect of the unphosphorylated ERK2 on the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY because ERK2 is a product of the MKP3 reaction and has high affinity for MKP3. The kinetics of the MKP3-catalyzed dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY were examined in the presence of various fixed concentrations of ERK2. The initial rates were measured as a function of ERK2/pTpY concentration keeping the ERK2 concentration constant (0–0.4 μm) (supplemental Fig. S3). Under these conditions, the double reciprocal plots yielded a simple competitive pattern with a Ki value of 0.103 ± 0.018 μm. Thus, ERK2 acts as a competitive inhibitor of the ERK2/pTpY dephosphorylation by MKP3. Given that the dephosphorylation of p38α/pTpY by MKP3 can be regulated by ERK2, we devised an in vitro interaction assay employing size exclusion chromatography to test whether ERK2, MKP3, and p38α/pTpY could form a stable ternary complex in solution. First, we studied the interaction between only two of the three proteins. Due to the transient nature of the enzyme-substrate complex, it is difficult to study the binding interaction between wild-type MKP3 and bisphosphorylated p38α/pTpY (Fig. 3A). Consequently, we employed catalytically inactive MKP3C293S to capture the enzyme-substrate complex, as judged by comparing gel filtration profiles of the individual proteins with their equimolar mixture (Fig. 3B). When an equimolar mixture of p38α/pTpY and ERK2 was sized on gel filtration, only ERK2 showed a slight change in elution volume, indicative of an extremely weak interaction between those two proteins (panel 4). Both ERK2 and p38α/pTpY, but not p38α (data not shown), were able to associate with MKP3 to form a stable heterodimer (panels 5 and 6). To demonstrate the formation of ERK2-MKP3-p38α/pTpY heterotrimer in solution, we next incubated the three proteins in an equimolar ratio and performed gel filtration analysis. Gel filtration profiles showed that purified ERK2, MKP3, and p38α/pTpY co-migrated to earlier fractions than MKP3-p38α/pTpY and MKP3-ERK2 heterodimers (panel 7). The apparent molecular mass of the ERK2-MKP3-p38α/pTpY complex appeared to be ∼140 kDa, as assessed from the elution volume of the protein complex peak compared with the protein standards, indicating that these three proteins formed a stable ternary complex in solution. For comparison purposes, we also examined if an ERK2-MKP3-ERK2/pTpY ternary complex could also be formed under the same experimental conditions. In the absence and presence of ERK2, MKP3-ERK2/pTpY binary complex eluted with a similar retention time, and no ERK2-MKP3-ERK2/pTpY ternary complex was observed (supplemental Fig. S4). In order to study the effects of MKP3 in vivo, 293T cells overexpressing the phosphatases and p38α were stimulated with sorbitol to induce p38 phosphorylation and activation, followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody; the phosphorylation state of FLAG-p38α was detected by immunoblot using bisphosphorylated p38 and anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies (Fig. 3C, first and second panels). The results showed that like HePTP and MKP5, MKP3 can effectively diminish the level of phosphotyrosine of FLAG-p38α in intact cells. We further examined the association of MKP3 with its substrate p38α by immunoblot using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3C, third panel, lane 6 versus lane 7). Consistent with our in vitro data, wild-type MKP3 failed to bind to p38α, but the catalytically inactive MKP3 mutant C293S physically interacted with bisphosphorylated p38α, indicating that the phosphorylation at Tyr182 is essential for MKP3-p38α binding. In line with the fact that association of p38α with HePTP and MKP5 is not dependent upon phosphorylation of p38α, these two phosphatases displayed much higher immuoreactivity than that of MKP3C293S (Fig. 3C, third panel, lane 7 versus lanes 8 and 9). ERK2 can form a tight physical complex with MKP3 via the KIM motif in the N-terminal domain of MKP3 and the docking sites on ERK2. Thus, it would be of interest to know whether p38α binds to MKP3 through the same mechanism. To address this issue, we analyzed the interaction of ERK2 and p38α MAPKs with the N-terminal domain of MKP3 (residues 1–154) using gel filtration assays. It can be seen from Fig. 4, A–C, that in contrast to ERK2, neither the unphosphorylated nor the phosphorylated p38α was able to associate with MKP3(1–154) to form a stable heterodimer.

https://openalex.org/W2135504542,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy metabolism; it is inhibited under obese conditions and is activated by exercise and by many anti-diabetic drugs. Emerging evidence also suggests that AMPK regulates cell differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that AMPK regulates cell differentiation via altering β-catenin expression, which involves phosphorylation of class IIa histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). In both C3H10T1/2 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), AMPK activity was positively correlated with β-catenin content. Chemical inhibition of HDAC5 increased β-catenin mRNA expression. HDAC5 overexpression reduced and HDAC5 knockdown increased H3K9 acetylation and cellular β-catenin content. HDAC5 formed a complex with myocyte enhancer factor-2 to down-regulate β-catenin mRNA expression. AMPK phosphorylated HDAC5, which promoted HDAC5 exportation from the nucleus; mutation of two phosphorylation sites in HDAC5, Ser-259 and -498, abolished the regulatory role of AMPK on β-catenin expression. In conclusion, AMPK promotes β-catenin expression through phosphorylation of HDAC5, which reduces HDAC5 interaction with the β-catenin promoter via myocyte enhancer factor-2. Thus, the data indicate that AMPK regulates cell differentiation and development via cross-talk with the wingless and Int (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2016294374,"Recent data have indicated a relationship between placental oxygen and angiogenic protein levels in the first trimester of normal pregnancies. Our objective was to investigate if maternal serum levels of angiogenic factors Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (sFlt-1), soluble Endoglin and placental growth factor (PlGF) are altered in women with symptoms of threatened miscarriage (TM) and if they are predictive of a subsequent miscarriage. Blood samples were collected at 6–10 weeks from women presenting with TM (n = 40), from asymptomatic controls (n = 32) and from non- pregnant women in their luteal phase (n = 14). All samples were assayed for serum level of sFLT-1, PlGF, sEndoglin and HSP70 using commercial ELISAs. Samples were analysed retrospectively on the basis of pregnancy outcome. TM group included 21 women with a normal pregnancy outcome and 19 with subsequent complete miscarriage. The latter subgroup had significantly lower mean maternal serum (MS) sFlt-1 (83%, P<0.001) and PlGF (44%, P<0.001) compared to those with a normal pregnancy outcome. Asymptomatic control pregnant women had similar MS levels of sFlt-1 and PlGF compared to the TM patients with a normal outcome. The mean MS sFlt-1 (>10 fold) and MS PlGF (∼2 fold) levels were significantly (P<0.001) higher in control pregnant women compared to the non-pregnant group in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Soluble Endoglin was not altered in the normal pregnant women compared to non pregnant women, although lower in the TM subgroup with a subsequent miscarriage (∼25%, P<0.001) compared to TM with a live birth. There was no significant difference in the mean MS HSP 70 levels between the different groups. This study shows that sFlt1 and PlGF MS levels are increased by several folds in early pregnancy and that MS sFlt-1 and MS PlGF are markedly decreased in threatened miscarriage patients who subsequently have a miscarriage suggesting these proteins are sensitive predictive markers of subsequent pregnancy loss."

Binding of chorismic acid, which was found converted to benzoate and pyruvate in the MST active centers of the closed form, leads to structural rearrangements that establish an ammonia transport channel approximately 25 Å in length within each of the two MST/GATase1 functional units of the dimer. The assignment of PhzE as an ADIC synthase was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the product, which was also visualized at 1.9 Å resolution by trapping in crystals of an inactive mutant of PhzD, an isochorismatase that catalyzes the subsequent step in phenazine biosynthesis. Unlike in some of the related anthranilate synthases, no allosteric inhibition was observed in PhzE. This can be attributed to a tryptophan residue of the protein blocking the potential regulatory site. Additional electron density in the GATase1 active center was identified as zinc, and it was demonstrated that Zn2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ reduce the activity of PhzE. PhzE utilizes chorismate and glutamine to synthesize 2-amino-2-desoxyisochorismate (ADIC) in the first step of phenazine biosynthesis. The PhzE monomer contains both a chorismate-converting menaquinone, siderophore, tryptophan biosynthesis (MST) and a type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain connected by a 45-residue linker.

IntroductionChorismic acid is the precursor for a large number of primary and secondary metabolites such as e.g. the aromatic amino acids, ubiquinone, folate, vitamin K, and the siderophores enterobactin and pyochelin. Because the production and utilization of chorismic acid are limited to prokaryotic microorganisms and plants, enzymes involved in chorismate metabolism are attractive targets for the development of biologically active compounds as exemplified by the herbicide glyphosate, which inhibits an enzyme of the shikimate pathway required for chorismate biosynthesis.Four chorismate-utilizing enzyme families are known (1Dosselaere F. Vanderleyden J. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 27: 75-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). First, two unrelated types of chorismate mutases, AroH and AroQ, generate prephenate as a precursor of phenylalanine and tyrosine. A third family consists of the chorismate lyases, which cleave chorismic acid to p-hydroxybenzoate and pyruvate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. Finally, the fourth group comprises members of the menaquinone, siderophore, tryptophan (MST) 3The abbreviations used are: MSTmenaquinone, siderophore, tryptophanADIC2-amino-2-desoxyisochorismateASanthranilate synthaseBisTris propane2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolGATase1glutamine amidotransferase type 1PDBProtein Data BankSAXSsmall angle x-ray scattering. biosynthesis family, which utilize water or ammonia to perform nucleophilic substitution at the six-membered ring of chorismate with or without concomitant rearrangement of the double bond system in an Mg2+-dependent reaction (Fig. 1). Of these enzymes, isochorismate, 2-amino-2-desoxyisochorismate (ADIC), and 4-amino-4-desoxychorismate synthases release the isomerized product, whereas anthranilate (AS) and salicylate synthase initiate a subsequent sigmatropic elimination of pyruvate within the same active center, leading to the synthesis of anthranilate or salicylate, respectively (2Spraggon G.

Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The aminating members of the MST family generate ammonia from glutamine in a type 1 glutamine amidotransferase (GATase1) domain, which either forms a heterodimer with or is fused to the N or C terminus of the MST domain. It is believed that glutamine hydrolysis by GATase1 is only initiated once chorismate has bound to the MST domain and that NH3 is delivered through a tunnel to the chorismate binding site to avoid its loss to the solvent (4Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Crystallographic and biochemical studies have led to considerable structural and mechanistic insight into members of the MST family in recent years, yet structures of a MST/GATase1 fusion protein and of an ADIC synthase are lacking. In addition, the existence of an intramolecular channel has never been demonstrated in these enzymes. We have aimed at filling these gaps by determining the crystal structure of ADIC synthase PhzE from Burkholderia lata 383, an enzyme that consists of an MST/GATase1 fusion in a single chain, in an uncomplexed open and a ligand-bound closed conformation. In addition, we have measured small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and biochemical data. PhzE catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of phenazines, a class of redox-active secondary metabolites that a number of bacterial strains produce as virulence factors, antibiotics, and probably also as respiratory pigments (6Mavrodi D.V. Blankenfeldt W. Thomashow L.S. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2006; 44: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 7Mentel M. Ahuja E.G. Mavrodi D.V. Breinbauer R. Thomashow L.S. Blankenfeldt W. Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 2295-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because PhzE commits chorismate to phenazine biosynthesis, we also investigated whether the enzyme is subject to feedback inhibition similar to some of the related anthranilate synthases. In addition, we confirmed the functional assignment of PhzE as an ADIC synthase by mass spectrometry and by visualizing PhzE-produced ADIC in the active center of an inactive mutant of PhzD from Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79. PhzD is an isochorismatase that catalyzes the step following PhzE in phenazine biosynthesis. Together, our new data extend the spectrum of structurally characterized MST proteins to ADIC synthases and also provide new insights into several mechanistic aspects of this enzyme family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFor full experimental details, refer to the supplemental material.Overexpression and Purification of B. lata 383 PhzE and of P. fluorescens 2-79 PhzDB. lata phzE was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET vector extending the protein for an N-terminal protease-cleavable His6 tag. After overexpression in Escherichia coli and purification on immobilized Ni2+, the tag was cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease, and the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Preparation of PhzD from P. fluorescens 2-79 was achieved with a similar protocol. Seleno-l-methionine labeling of PhzE was performed by the methionine biosynthesis suppression method (8Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), and mutations were introduced into PhzE and PhzD with the QuikChange method (Stratagene).Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure DeterminationCrystals of ligand-free B. lata PhzE (native and seleno-l-methionine-labeled) were obtained at room temperature by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method with a 500-μl reservoir consisting of 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 7.0, 0.2 m KSCN, and 22% (w/v) PEG 3350, of which 1 μl was mixed with 2 μl of protein solution containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm glutamine. For the ligand-bound form, the protein was incubated with 50 mm MgCl2, 20 mm chorismate, and 25 mm l-glutamine for 30 min before crystallization against a reservoir containing 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.1, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 15% isopropyl alcohol at 4 °C. Streak seeding was required to obtain suitable crystals. To remove Zn2+ bound to the GATase1 active site in the complex structure (see below), PhzE was incubated with 10 mm EDTA followed by buffer exchange prior to setting up crystallization experiments.Crystals of the D38A mutant of PhzD from P. fluorescens 2-79 were obtained with a precipitant consisting of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 25% (w/v) PEG 4000. They were soaked for 1 h in a solution containing 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm ADIC. ADIC was synthesized enzymatically and purified by HPLC as described in the supplemental materials.Diffraction data of cryoprotected PhzE crystals were collected on a MX-225 CCD detector (marresearch) at beamline X10SA of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) and integrated with XDS (9Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10884) Google Scholar). The structure of apo-PhzE was determined from selenium MAD data, using SHELXD (10Schneider T.R.

Diffraction data of cryoprotected P. fluorescens 2-79 PhzD crystals were collected at 100 K on a mar345 image plate (marresearch) using a Micro-MAX-007 HF rotating copper anode (Rigaku) as x-ray source. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using coordinates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhzD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1NF8) (17Parsons J.F. Calabrese K. Eisenstein E. Ladner J.E.

Finally, 10 independent reconstructions were superimposed with SUBCOMP and DAMAVER (21Svergun D.I. Biophys.

PhzE was diluted to 100 μm in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl with or without 1 mm MgCl2. Chorismate was dissolved in the same buffer as used for the protein to a final concentration of 1 mm. Data were analyzed with Origin version 7 (OriginLab Corporation).Enzymatic Activity AssaysActivity assays were performed by modification of a previously described method (22Morollo A.A. Bauerle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9983-9987Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glutamine, and 1–50 μm chorismic acid at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by addition of PhzE to a final concentration of 100 nm, and initial velocities were determined by following the increase in absorption at 280 nm. Km, and kcat values were determined by fitting to a Michaelis-Menten equation in GraFit (Erithacus Software). Experiments were repeated at least in triplicate. Turnover of ADIC by PhzD was confirmed by HPLC.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here confirm the assignment of PhzE as an ADIC synthase, and the two crystal structures provide insight into structural changes that accompany its catalytic cycle. They also give an opportunity to discuss differences that may lead to the evolution of pyruvate-eliminating and noneliminating MST enzymes.First, it is interesting to note that the ligand-bound structure of PhzE fits the SAXS envelope much better than the crystal structure obtained in the absence of substrates, even if the SAXS measurements were performed without ligands (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, the relative arrangement of the two MST/GATase1 functional units found in the apo crystal structure seems to be influenced by crystal packing forces. Only 219 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area are buried in the MST/MST interface of the ligand-bound structure per monomer. Given this very weak interaction, the occurrence of crystal-packing-induced distortions is not very surprising. More contacts between the two MST domains exist in the apo crystal form (471 Å2 buried per monomer; Fig. 2, A and B), but these additional interactions involve residues Arg221–Pro227, which undergo ligand-induced movement such that the butterfly shape of the open structure cannot be retained in the crystal structure of the complex (see below).Structural changes are triggered by the binding of Mg2+ and chorismic acid, which apparently bind simultaneously. This is indicated by the observation that no Mg2+ was found in the crystal structure of the open form despite being present in the crystallization buffer, and chorismate alone did not show affinity toward PhzE in isothermal titration calorimetry experiments without Mg2+ (supplemental Fig. S8). Interestingly, the binding of Mg2+/chorismate is endothermic, i.e. entropy-driven. This may be a further indication of structural changes that accompany the process. Obviously, glutamine can only bind second, as shown by the fact that glutamine was not observable in the open form despite being included in the crystallization experiment. Together, this argues for sequentially ordered substrate binding in which Mg2+/chorismate binds first, enabling the GATase1 domain to capture glutamine for hydrolysis.The octahedral coordination sphere of Mg2+ involves a bidentate interaction with the carboxylate group of benzoate, the side chains of Glu244 and Glu382, and two water molecules that are held in place by Glu241 and Glu379 (Fig. 4A). These highly conserved acidic residues approach each other with respect to the open structure, leading to a closing of the active center in a clamp-like movement of the α-helix containing Glu379 and Glu382 on one side and the large structural element from Pro215 to Leu249 on the other (Fig. 4A). It thus is conceivable that neutralization of the negative charges in the formation of the active site in part explains the requirement for Mg2+ in the MST enzymes. This is also corroborated by the observation that repositioning of the glutamic acids is accompanied by reorientation of the conserved Lys240, which is disordered and points outward in the apo structure, toward the active center where it interacts with the side chains of Glu241, Glu244, and Glu379, thus adding to the anchoring of both jaws of the clamp (Figs. 3A and 4A).Vice versa, the open conformation of PhzE seems to be stabilized by repulsion of negative charges between the helix containing Glu379 and Glu382 on one side and the highly acidic stretch from Asp238 to Glu244 on the other (Fig. 4C). Of these amino acids, Asp238–Glu241 also change their backbone conformation from coil to α-helical structure, which is the most significant local structural rearrangement within the MST domain on ligand binding (Fig. 4A). This is likely to add further to the stabilization of the closed form and creates a hinge that triggers the concerted motion of residues Pro215–Leu249. Similar refolding, but to a lesser extent, is also observed in AS (PDB ID codes 1I7Q and 1I7S) (2Spraggon G. Kim C. Nguyen-Huu X. Yee M.C. Yanofsky C. Mills S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and isochorismate synthase (PDB ID codes 3BZM and 3HWO) (28Sridharan S. Howard N. Kerbarh O. Blaszczyk M. Abell C. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Parsons J.F. Shi K.M. Ladner J.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Because the structural element Pro215–Leu249 contains part of a central strand of one of the β-sheets (Cys210–Tyr222), it pulls the two strands in Val266–Ile284 with it, together with residues Ala393–Gly419 of the linker, which lines the moving structures in this region. Anchoring of Pro215–Leu249 also involves interactions between the carboxylate group of benzoate and the backbone amide between Ser217 and Gly218, which leads to a peptide flip with respect to the open conformation (Fig. 3A).The position of Pro215–Leu249/Val266–Ile284 of the closed structure is not compatible with the more compressed MST/MST interface observed in the apo crystal structure because it would lead to steric conflicts with Arg221–Pro227 of the MST domain in the second chain. Differences in the MST/MST interfaces between the two crystal structures accumulate to a rotation of approximately 50° between the two MST/GATase1 pairs when one MST domain of the open and closed structure are superimposed (Fig. 2D). Within the functional units, however, these differences are nearly completely compensated through backbone changes of linker residues Asp395–Arg414.The MST/GATase1 interface is also subject to changes, yet these are much less pronounced and proceed around a different rotation axis than the crystal-packing-induced MST/MST reorientation. It seems that the refolding within Asp238–Glu241 mentioned above also triggers motion of the GATase1 domain because it reorients Asp243 outward to form hydrogen bonds with Arg372 and His373. As a consequence, the side chain of Arg372 repositions to interact tightly with the carbonyl groups of Gln548 and Gly549 (Fig. 4B), which may be sufficient to pull the GATase1 into an 8° rotation with a concomitant 8 Å movement at positions most distant to the rotation axis (Fig. 2D).The clamping motion in the MST fold and the rotation of the GATase1 domain shield both active centers toward the solvent. Because the modification of chorismic acid requires ammonia as a nucleophile, both active centers must coordinate their activities and establish a means for transporting the toxic NH3 without loss to the environment. Indeed, analysis with CAVER (30Petrek M. Otyepka M. Banás P. Kosinová P. Koca J. Damborský J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) reveals two halves of an ammonia channel that connect the active centers of the MST and GATase1 domain. The channel is blocked by the side chain of Glu251, which forms two hydrogen bonds with Asn149. Mutation of these residues leads to an inactive enzyme. Glu251 adopts a different rotamer in the open structure to interact with Lys254, and the required space for this rotamer is still available in the closed conformation crystallized here (Fig. 4D). This implies that Glu251 acts as a gatekeeper between the MST and GATase1 active centers, similar to Trp74 in glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase from E. coli (PDB ID code 1JXA) (31Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Badet B. Badet-Denisot M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The closed conformation therefore likely represents a late state of the catalytic cycle in which NH3 has already been passed to the chorismic acid binding site. The ammonia channel is approximately 25 Å long and ends at C2 of the si-face of chorismic acid, thus establishing the stereochemical configuration of ADIC. The nucleophilic attack at C2 is probably assisted by the carbonyl groups of Ile216 and Thr304 together with the side chains of Ser217 and Thr369, which are all positioned to act as hydrogen bond acceptors aiding the deprotonation of NH3. Protonation of the leaving hydroxyl group at C4 of chorismic acid is achieved by Glu201, whose mutation to glutamine rendered the enzyme inactive (Figs. 3A and 5).FIGURE 5Mechanistic proposal for the generation of ADIC in the active site of the MST domain. The identity of the base B required for deprotonation of the NH3 nucleophile is unclear at present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is unclear why benzoate and pyruvate and not chorismate or ADIC were found in the MST active site of the closed crystal form. Although the cleavage of pyruvate seems to be rooted in the tendency of chorismic acid and possibly also of ADIC to undergo sigmatropic reactions including the elimination of pyruvate, the generation of benzoate requires reduction, and the nature of the reducing agent in crystallization of the closed form is unknown at present. However, the breakdown seems associated with an intrinsic enzymatic activity of PhzE because it was not possible to crystallize any of the inactive mutants in the closed conformation. ADIC is a relatively unstable molecule with a half-life of 34 h (22Morollo A.A. Bauerle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9983-9987Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is similar to the time required for crystallization. It therefore is likely that the breakdown products originate from ADIC captured in the active center of PhzE before the enzyme has completed its catalytic cycle with product release. This is also corroborated by the observation that Cys526 is still covalently modified by glutamine and the fact that it was not possible to crystallize PhzE in the presence of exogenously added benzoate and pyruvate. Further, the breakdown of ADIC seems to be linked to the crystallization conditions because no breakdown products were observed in HPLC analysis of enzyme activity assays.Further in this context, questions remain concerning the differences between ADIC synthase PhzE and AS, which lyse ADIC to anthranilate and pyruvate (Fig. 1). We tried to employ structural comparisons to identify residues that could convert PhzE into an AS and hence mutated Ser217, Ser368, and Thr369 to alanine, alanine, and glycine, respectively, which are the three differences in the first coordination sphere of chorismic acid in which PhzE and AS differ (supplemental Fig. S9). Whereas S368A was unstable, S217A and T369G retained lower levels of ADIC synthase activity and the S368A/T369G double as well as the S217A/S368A/T369G triple mutant were inactive. Increased anthranilate production was not observed, indicating that more subtle differences determine the fate of ADIC in these enzymes. In this respect, it is also interesting to note that the mutation of His398 to methionine in AS from Salmonella enterica abolishes pyruvate lyase activity nearly completely to create an ADIC synthase (22Morollo A.A. Bauerle R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9983-9987Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding His279 is also conserved in PhzE (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S9), showing that this residue alone cannot be responsible for the different activities. Convincing theoretical and experimental evidence for a pericyclic pyruvate elimination mechanism in AS and salicylate synthase has been brought forward (32DeClue M.S. Baldridge K.K. Künzler D.E. Kast P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15002-15003Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Zwahlen J. Kolappan S. Zhou R. Kisker C. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the enzyme would be expected to act mainly in properly orienting the methylene group of the enolpyruvyl moiety toward the hydrogen atom at C2 of ADIC. In PhzE, binding of the enolpyruvyl group is achieved by the conserved Arg352, which in the closed conformation interacts with His279 (Fig. 3A). It therefore is conceivable that the H398M mutation in S. enterica AS interferes with the proper conformation of ADIC for pyruvate elimination. Because Arg352 and His279 are conserved in ADIC synthases, however, it seems likely that the difference between these enzymes lies in the substrate release mechanism, which avoids pyruvate elimination in the ADIC synthases by providing a different release path or by shortening the ADIC residence time in the active center. The latter will be strongly prolonged in protein crystals, explaining why pyruvate elimination was observed in PhzE crystals but not in solution. Although it is tempting to speculate that different release mechanisms are a consequence of different quaternary structures, it has to be mentioned that at least one example of an ADIC synthase in which the MST and GATase1 domains are provided from separate polypeptides is known (27Van Lanen S.G. Lin S. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that an anthranilate synthase encoded in a single polypeptide with a linker similar to PhzE has been described in the literature (34Ashenafi M. Carrington R. Collins A.C. Byrnes W.M. Ethn.

Therefore, new and innovative approaches are needed to combat such life-threatening infections. Virulence factor expression in S. aureus is regulated in a cell density-dependent manner using “quorum sensing,” which involves generation and secretion of autoinducing peptides (AIPs) into the surrounding environment to activate a bacterial sensor kinase at a particular threshold concentration. Mouse monoclonal antibody AP4-24H11 was shown previously to blunt quorum sensing-mediated changes in gene expression in vitro and protect mice from a lethal dose of S. aureus by sequestering the AIP signal. We have elucidated the crystal structure of the AP4-24H11 Fab in complex with AIP-4 at 2.5 Å resolution to determine its mechanism of ligand recognition. A key GluH95 provides much of the binding specificity through formation of hydrogen bonds with each of the four amide nitrogens in the AIP-4 macrocyclic ring. Importantly, these structural data give clues as to the interactions between the cognate staphylococcal AIP receptors AgrC and the AIPs, as AP4-24H11·AIP-4 binding recapitulates features that have been proposed for AgrC-AIP recognition. Additionally, these structural insights may enable the engineering of AIP cross-reactive antibodies or quorum quenching vaccines for use in active or passive immunotherapy for prevention or treatment of S. aureus infections.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic single-cell organisms use cell-to-cell communication to coordinate their gene expression as they adapt to changing environmental conditions and compete with multicellular organisms. This chemical exchange of information among microorganisms has been termed “quorum sensing” (QS) 3The abbreviations used are: QS, quorum sensing; AIP, autoinducing peptide; CDR, complementarity determining region.

Lett. 2006; 254: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). With the emergence of highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, new approaches for combating microbial infections are needed desperately (3David M.Z.

Although most antibiotics target essential metabolic pathways, inhibition of virulence-associated processes, such as QS signaling, attenuates the bacteria without exerting as much selective pressure, thereby decreasing development of resistance. Thus, this approach represents a new and innovative concept for antimicrobial drug discovery and might hold promise for the design of the elusive S. aureus vaccine (6Clatworthy A.E. Pierson E.

The agr (accessory gene regulator) QS system in S. aureus contributes to pathogenesis by orchestrating the temporal cell density-dependent expression of virulence genes. During exponential growth, the bacterial cell surface and adhesion molecules are expressed, whereas upon entering stationary phase, the expression pattern changes and results in the down-regulation of surface proteins and activation of genes encoding exoproteins and toxins (10Lebeau C. Vandenesch F. Greenland T. Novick R.P. Etienne J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5534-5536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11MDowell P. Affas Z. Reynolds C. Holden M.T. Wood S.J. Saint S. Cockayne A.

Novick R.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The agr locus is composed of two transcriptional units: the agr (or P2) operon under control of the P2 promoter and RNAIII, the de facto effector of agr QS, regulated by the P3 promoter (see Fig. 1A) (13Morfeldt E. Tegmark K. Arvidson S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Novick R.P. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Ross H.F. Ji G. Kreiswirth B. Vandenesch F. Moghazeh S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The P2 operon consists of four genes, agrBDCA, which encode the proteins responsible for the synthesis of and response to the QS peptides. The agrD gene encodes a 46-amino acid AIP precursor peptide that is processed and cyclized by SpsB and AgrB (15Thoendel M. Horswill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21828-21838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) via formation of a thiolactone bond between a cysteine and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue. The resulting AIP is then secreted into the extracellular environment (16Zhang L. Gray L. Novick R.P. Ji G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34736-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cognate receptor for the AIPs is the transmembrane sensor kinase AgrC. The N-terminal receptor domain of AgrC is predicted to consist of six membrane-spanning helices with three extracellular loops that constitute the AIP binding site (17Jensen R.O. Winzer K. Clarke S.R. Chan W.C. Williams P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Chen L.C. Tsou L.T. Chen F.J. J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 8930-8938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon AIP binding, the C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain relays the signal to AgrA and phosphorylated AgrA binds to the P2 and P3 promoters to activate AIP-controlled gene expression (20Koenig R.L. Ray J.L. Maleki S.J. Smeltzer M.S. Hurlburt B.K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7549-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. aureus strains can be divided into four distinct agr subgroups, generally referred to as groups I, II, III, and IV. In each agr group, the AgrC receptor recognizes a specific AIP structure (i.e. AIP-1 through AIP-4, Fig. 1B) that promotes RNAIII transcription. Through so-called “bacterial interference,” the AIP signal of one agr group can compete for the AgrC receptor of another group and inhibit RNAIII transcription (21Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the AIPs are often classified into three cross-inhibitory groups: (i) AIP-1 and AIP-4, (ii) AIP-2, and (iii) AIP-3. AIP-1 and AIP-4 are grouped together because these structures differ by only one amino acid (Asp5 or Tyr5, respectively) (17Jensen R.O. Winzer K. Clarke S.R. Chan W.C. Williams P. J. Mol.

Recently, blockade of quorum sensing has been shown to attenuate the expression of virulence factors in Gram-positive bacteria (22Lyon G.J. Mayville P. Muir T.W. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Treatment of S. aureus cultures with AP4-24H11 caused an increase in protein A expression and decreases in α-hemolysin expression and RNA III transcription, consistent with suppression of QS signaling (24Park J. Jagasia R. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Ruiz D.I. Moss J.A. Meijler M.M. Ulevitch R.J. Janda K.D. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Most impressive, however, was the ability of this antibody to protect mice from S. aureus infections in vivo, including abscess formation in a skin infection model and lethality in a peritonitis model using a S. aureus group IV strain. Here, we present the structure of the AP4-24H11 Fab in complex with AIP-4, which is the first structure of a quorum-sensing peptide bound to a receptor protein, in this case, an antibody. These structural data provide some possible insights into the interactions between the cognate staphylococcal AIP receptors AgrC and the AIPs, as the antibody binding to AIP-4 shares many features that have been hypothesized for recognition of AIP by AgrC. IgG was produced (25Kaufmann G.F. Park J. Mayorov A.V. Kubitz D.M. Janda K.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 692: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and sequenced (26Marks J.D. Tristem M. Karpas A. Winter G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using established methods. N-terminal sequencing of the AP4-24H11 heavy and light protein chains was performed at The University of Texas Biomedical Branch, Biomolecular Resource Facility. AP4-24H11 IgG was digested to Fab and Fc using 4% (w/w) papain for 4 h (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 626-631Google Scholar). The Fab was purified by successive protein A and protein G chromatography. Fab was further purified by MonoS where the Fab eluted at concentrations of 220–240 mm sodium chloride. The purified protein was concentrated to 19 mg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 1.25 mm EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The AP4-24H11 Fab alone was crystallized by vapor diffusion using 1.0-μl sitting drops. Drops contained equal volumes (0.5 μl) of purified protein and the precipitant (20% PEG 4000, 0.2 m diammonium hydrogen phosphate (pH 8.0)). Crystals appeared after 1 month and grew as clusters of needles. The diffraction data were indexed in space group H3 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. AIP-4 was synthesized as described previously (24Park J. Jagasia R. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Ruiz D.I. Moss J.A. Meijler M.M. Ulevitch R.J. Janda K.D. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). AIP-4 at a final concentration of 5 mm was mixed with the AP4-24H11 Fab (13-fold excess of AIP-4 to Fab) immediately before setting up for crystallization by vapor diffusion using 1.0 μl sitting drops. The AIP-4·AP4-24H11 Fab complex was co-crystallized using equal volumes (0.5 μl) of the protein·ligand complex and precipitant (29 mm zinc acetate, 20% PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5)). Crystals appeared after 1 day and grew as clusters of long needles or plates and were cryoprotected in 20% glycerol prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The crystals were highly anisotropic with almost no diffraction observable when the beam was parallel to the plane of the very thin, plate-like crystals. The data were indexed in monoclinic space group P21 with two Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit. All data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 23ID-B (Argonne National Laboratory) and were processed with HKL2000 (28Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The AP4-24H11 Fab structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (29McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

Coot (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) was used for model building, and Refmac (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) was used for refinement. Only LeuL51 and ProH149 are designated as Ramachandran “outliers,” but both have a good fit to the corresponding electron density. LeuL51 is in a γ-turn commonly found in almost all Fab structures (33Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Additional density in the binding site was modeled as 10 atoms of PEG. There was weak or missing 2Fo − Fc density for heavy chain residues 128–130, 133, and 134, that is also absent or weak in many other Fab structures, and these residues were omitted from the refined structure. The AIP-4·AP4-24H11 Fab complex structure was determined by molecular replacement using the AP4-24H11 Fab solution. The AIP-4 ligand was initially built using Coot. AIP-4 geometric restraints were created with the PRODRG online server (34Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). No density in 2Fo − Fc maps at the 1.0σ level could be seen for AIP-4 Tyr1, and this residue was omitted from the model. Coot was used for model building, and Buster-TNT (36Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was used for refinement. Final rounds of refinement were performed in Refmac. Five zinc ions in the asymmetric unit mediate contacts between Fab molecules and aid in crystal packing interactions. Weak or missing 2Fo − Fc map density was again noted for heavy chain residues 129, 130, 133, and 134, and these residues were omitted from the structure. Both Fab structures were numbered in the Kabat convention using the Abnum online server (37Abhinandan K.R. Martin A.C. Mol.

All S. aureus reporter strains were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth supplemented with chloramphenicol at 10 μg/ml at 37 °C with shaking. For antibody inhibition testing, cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh media, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and 180 μl was dispensed into wells of a microtiter plate (Costar 3603). AP4-24H11 was diluted to a working concentration of 2 mg/ml in PBS, and 2-fold serial dilutions were generated in PBS to a final concentration of 9.8 × 10−4 mg/ml. 20 μl of each antibody dilution was added to the reporter cultures in the microtiter plates in quadruplicate, resulting in an additional 10-fold dilution. As controls, PBS was used as a mock sample (no antibody), and an unrelated mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody was added at 2 mg/ml. The filtered spent medium containing AIP-1 from LAC or AIP-3 from MW2 was used as inhibition controls. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Absorbance and fluorescence was measured in a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Park et al. (24Park J. Jagasia R. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Ruiz D.I. Moss J.A. Meijler M.M. Ulevitch R.J. Janda K.D. Chem.

To clearly delineate the extent of AIP cross-reactivity of AP4-24H11, four S. aureus reporter strains with the agr P3 promoter driving expression of YFP were constructed to represent each agr group. A range of AP4-24H11 concentrations was mixed with early growth phase cultures to assess antibody impact on actively growing S. aureus (Fig. 2). Notably, co-incubation of AP4-24H11 with S. aureus reporter strains belonging to agr group IV (IC50 = 0.00011 mg/ml [0.73 nm]) and to a lesser extent group I (IC50 = 0.040 mg/ml [27 nm]) resulted in significant decreases in YFP production in a dose-dependent manner, whereas QS signaling in agr groups II and III strains was not affected significantly by the antibody (IC50 >1 μm; Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that AP4-24H11 is greater than 350 times more potent in quenching agr signaling in a cognate group IV strain than in an S. aureus group I isolate that produces the nearly sequence-identical AIP-1. To elucidate the molecular interactions that allow for antibody discrimination between similar quorum-sensing peptides, we determined the crystal structure of the AIP-4·AP4-24H11 Fab complex at 2.5 Å resolution (Table 1). Although electron density in 2Fo − Fc maps (contoured at 1.0σ) for the thiolactone ring of AIP-4 is well defined, the three residue N-terminal tail generally is less ordered. However, in one of the two Fab copies in the asymmetric unit, electron density was present for AIP-4 Ser2 and Thr3. The peptide bonds in the thiolactone ring are oriented such that most of the backbone carbonyl oxygens point in the general direction of the light chain, and the amide nitrogens are oriented toward the heavy chain. The side chains of the AIP-4 residues splay outwards from the ring.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsAIP-4·AP4–24H11AP4–24H11·PEGData collectionWavelength (Å)0.9801.033Resolution (Å)2.50 (2.50-2.59)aOuter shell.2.80 (2.80-2.90)Space groupP21H3Cell dimensionsa = 68.4, b = 98.5, c = 73.7 Å; α = 90, β = 114.0, γ = 90°a = 183.2, b = 183.2, c = 42.6 Å; α = 90, β = 90, γ = 120°No. of observations83,59129,584Unique reflections29,01713,033Redundancy2.9 (2.4)aOuter shell.2.3 (2.1)Completeness (%)94.3 (90.7)97.9 (94.0)Rsym (%)bRsym = Σhkl|I − 〈I〉|/Σhkl|I|.16.8 (43.1)10.8 (40.8)I/σ6.4 (1.6)7.7 (1.9)Refinement statisticsResolution39.7-2.50 (2.57-2.50)90-2.78 (2.85-2.78)No. of reflections (working)25,88311,734No. of reflections (test)1,477644Rcryst (%)cRcryst = Σhkl|Fobs − Fcalc|/ΣhklFobs.18.3 (26.4)19.5 (29.2)Rfree (%)dRfree is the same as Rcryst except for 5% of the data excluded from refinement.23.8 (34.0)24.0 (36.3)No. of moles in asugasu, asymmetric unit.21No. of Fab atoms6,5863,272No. of ligand atoms110 (AIP4)27 (PEG)No. of water molecules29451No. of metal ions111Overall B values (Å2)Antibody27.153.5Ligands26.6 (AIP4)59.5 (PEG)Water19.838.4Ions31.1/50.5 (Na+1/Zn+2)53.4 (Na+1)Wilson B-value (Å2)40.641.2Ramachandran plot (%)eRamachandran statistics were calculated with MolProbity (39).Favored96.993.1Allowed3.16.4Disallowed0.00.5r.m.s.d.fr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.Bond length (Å)0.0100.008Angle1.46°1.21°a Outer shell.b Rsym = Σhkl|I − 〈I〉|/Σhkl|I|.c Rcryst = Σhkl|Fobs − Fcalc|/ΣhklFobs.d Rfree is the same as Rcryst except for 5% of the data excluded from refinement.e Ramachandran statistics were calculated with MolProbity (39Sheriff S.

The AIP-4 ligand is recognized by AP4-24H11 primarily through the heavy chain (60%) (Table 3), although all complementarity determining regions (CDRs) make contributions, as well as some framework regions (4.8%). Although CDR1 of the heavy chain (CDRH1) buries the most ligand surface area of any CDR, the most striking features with respect to ligand recognition involve CDRH3.TABLE 2AIP-4 contacts with AP4-24H11AIP-4 ResidueMain chainaHydrogen bonds/van der Waals contacts.Side chainaHydrogen bonds/van der Waals contacts.Buried surface (Å2)Ser20/00/014.5Thr31/40/656.6Cys40/20/422.1Tyr51/30/2372.6Phe61/50/998.1Ile72/40/1388.7Met81/170/20122.3Total6/350/65474.9a Hydrogen bonds/van der Waals contacts.

Martin A.C. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3832-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) that is positioned at the apex of the loop. The GluH95 carboxyl is oriented toward the center of the AIP-4 thiolactone ring and hydrogen bonds with each of the four amide nitrogens in the ring (Fig. 4). Additionally, the aliphatic portion of the GluH95 side chain runs parallel to the AIP-4 Met8 contributing to the burial of hydrophobic surface area. Thus, GluH95 accounts for 13.1% of the total ligand buried surface, greater than twice that of any other single residue. During model building and refinement, we observed strong, spherical density at a distance of 4–5 Å from three of the AIP-4 main chain carbonyl oxygens. Furthermore, many oxygen-containing groups in the nearby light chain are oriented in the direction of this unaccounted for density. Additionally, the plane of the aromatic ring of TyrL32 is oriented such that the ζ-carbon is centered 4.5 Å from the center of this site (43Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar, 44Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). These data suggest the presence of a monovalent cation that forms a cation-π interaction with TyrL32, as well as electrostatic interactions with neighboring electron-donating groups. We have, therefore, modeled this additional density as a monovalent sodium cation. Subsequent refinement showed that it has similar B-values to the side chain of TyrL32 and provides some validation for this assignment. Nevertheless, although we cannot be absolutely certain of the identity of this presumed ion, the positive charge of the sodium would provide stabilizing interactions with the carbonyl oxygens of the thiolactone ring. This interaction, together with the GluH95 hydrogen bonding to the amide nitrogens of the macrocycle, would facilitate antibody recognition of both faces of the AIP-4 ring. Thus far, we have described the AIP-4-AP4-24H11 interaction and specificity as resulting from burial of the C-terminal hydrophobic side chains, recognition of the AIP-4 peptide backbone by hydrogen bonding to GluH95 and proposed electrostatic interactions with a metal ion. However, Park et al. (24Park J. Jagasia R. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Ruiz D.I. Moss J.A. Meijler M.M. Ulevitch R.J. Janda K.D. Chem.

In fact, AIP-1 and AIP-4 differ only at position 5 where AIP-1 contains an aspartic acid rather than tyrosine in AIP-4 (Fig. 1B), which might account for the reduced inhibition of toxin production (24Park J. Jagasia R. Kaufmann G.F. Mathison J.C. Ruiz D.I. Moss J.A. Meijler M.M. Ulevitch R.J. Janda K.D. Chem.

Structurally, AIP-4 Tyr5 makes a CH-π bond with TyrH33 where one of the AIP-4 Tyr5 ϵ-carbons is positioned 3.5–4.0 Å from the TyrH33 aromatic ring (Fig. 5A). Similarly, AIP-4 Phe6 makes a CH-π bond with TyrL49 with its ζ-carbon positioned 4.1–4.5Å from the TyrL49 aromatic ring (Fig. 5B). These are the only interactions where the AIP-4 side chains are recognized specifically by the antibody and may account for the observed discrimination of AIP-1 and AIP-4 by AP4-24H11. Although CH-π, or edge-to-face, interactions are typically regarded as weak, they can contribute 0.6–1.3 kcal/mol in stabilization energy (45Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Sühnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J.

Thus, although recognition of the main chain conformation and burial of hydrophobic surfaces in AIP-4 likely are the major modes of interaction with AP4-24H11, these additional aromatic-aromatic interactions aid in the specificity of ligand recognition. For AIP-2 and AIP-3, although AIP-4 Ile7 does not engage in any specific interactions, the Leu7 side chain in other AIPs might create steric clashes within the binding site (Fig. 5B). Additionally, the long unbranched AIP-4 Met8 packs parallel to the GluH95 side chain and part of the main chain, in contrast to the branched side chains of the other AIPs at this position which would likely have steric clashes with th"
https://openalex.org/W2031853870,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is regulated through a variety of mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and association with regulatory proteins. Alpha4 is one such regulatory protein that binds the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and protects it from polyubiquitination and degradation. Alpha4 is a multidomain protein with a C-terminal domain that binds Mid1, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, and an N-terminal domain containing the PP2Ac-binding site. In this work, we present the structure of the N-terminal domain of mammalian Alpha4 determined by x-ray crystallography and use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to show that it is a flexible tetratricopeptide repeat-like protein. Structurally, Alpha4 differs from its yeast homolog, Tap42, in two important ways: 1) the position of the helix containing the PP2Ac-binding residues is in a more open conformation, showing flexibility in this region; and 2) Alpha4 contains a ubiquitin-interacting motif. The effects of wild-type and mutant Alpha4 on PP2Ac ubiquitination and stability were examined in mammalian cells by performing tandem ubiquitin-binding entity precipitations and cycloheximide chase experiments. Our results reveal that both the C-terminal Mid1-binding domain and the PP2Ac-binding determinants are required for Alpha4-mediated protection of PP2Ac from polyubiquitination and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1974222260,"Intact synaptic function and plasticity are fundamental prerequisites to a healthy brain. Therefore, synaptic proteins are one of the major targets for drugs used as neuro-chemical therapeutics. Unfortunately, the majority of drugs is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is therefore distributed within the CNS parenchyma. Here, we report the development of novel biodegradable Nanoparticles (NPs), made of poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) conjugated with glycopeptides that are able to cross the BBB and deliver for example Zn(2+) ions. We also provide a thorough characterization of loaded and unloaded NPs for their stability, cellular uptake, release properties, toxicity, and impact on cell trafficking. Our data reveal that these NPs are biocompatible, and can be used to elevate intracellular levels of Zn(2+). Importantly, by engineering the surface of NPs with antibodies against NCAM1 and CD44, we were able to selectively target neurons or glial cells, respectively. Our results indicate that these biodegradable NPs provide a potential new venue for the delivery Zn(2+) to the CNS and thus a means to explore the influence of altered zinc levels linked to neuropsychological disorders such as depression."
https://openalex.org/W2067783987,"Chromatin is disassembled and reassembled during DNA repair. To assay chromatin reassembly accompanying DNA double strand break repair, ChIP analysis can be used to monitor the presence of histone H3 near the lesion. The chromatin assembly factor Asf1p, as well as the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56, have been shown to promote chromatin reassembly when DNA double strand break repair is complete. Using Gal-HO-mediated double strand break repair, we have tested each of the components of the nuclear Hat1p-containing type B histone acetyltransferase complex (NuB4) and have found that they can affect repair-linked chromatin reassembly but that their contributions are not equivalent. In particular, deletion of the catalytic subunit, Hat1p, caused a significant defect in chromatin reassembly. In addition, loss of the histone chaperone Hif1p, when combined with an allele of H3 that mutates lysines 14 and 23 to arginine, has a pronounced effect on chromatin reassembly that is similar to that observed in an asf1Δ. The role of Hat1p and Hif1p is at least partially redundant with the role of Asf1p. Consistent with a more prominent role for Hif1p in chromatin reassembly than either Hat1p or Hat2p, Hif1p exists in complex(es) independent of Hat1p and Hat2p and influences the activity of an H3-specific histone acetyltransferase activity. Our data directly demonstrate the role of the nuclear HAT1 complex (NuB4) components in DNA repair-linked chromatin reassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2016305583,"Dental thermal pain is a significant health problem in daily life and dentistry. There is a long-standing question regarding the phenomenon that cold stimulation evokes sharper and more shooting pain sensations than hot stimulation. This phenomenon, however, outlives the well-known hydrodynamic theory used to explain dental thermal pain mechanism. Here, we present a mathematical model based on the hypothesis that hot or cold stimulation-induced different directions of dentinal fluid flow and the corresponding odontoblast movements in dentinal microtubules contribute to different dental pain responses. We coupled a computational fluid dynamics model, describing the fluid mechanics in dentinal microtubules, with a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model, describing the discharge behavior of intradental neuron. The simulated results agreed well with existing experimental measurements. We thence demonstrated theoretically that intradental mechano-sensitive nociceptors are not “equally sensitive” to inward (into the pulp) and outward (away from the pulp) fluid flows, providing mechanistic insights into the difference between hot and cold dental pain. The model developed here could enable better diagnosis in endodontics which requires an understanding of pulpal histology, neurology and physiology, as well as their dynamic response to the thermal stimulation used in dental practices."
https://openalex.org/W2080787716,"The Hairy/Enhancer-of-split-related with YRPW-like motif (HEY) family of proteins are transcriptional repressors and downstream effectors of Notch signaling. We previously reported that HEY1 and HEY2 selectively repress androgen receptor (AR) signaling in mammalian cell lines and have shown that in human tissue HEY1 is excluded from the nuclei in prostate cancer but not benign prostatic hyperplasia. We have now characterized a third member of this family, HEYL, which is a more potent repressor of AR activity. HEYL interacted with and repressed AR activation function-1 domain and competitively inhibited SRC1e activation of AR transcriptional activity. Using a cell line inducibly expressing exogenous HEYL, we showed that HEYL represses endogenous AR-regulated genes and reduces androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth. Using a trans-repression assay, we identified both trichostatin-sensitive and -insensitive domains within HEYL; however, analysis of endogenous AR target genes suggested that HEYL represses AR activity through histone deacetylase I/II-independent mechanisms. Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue indicated that, in a fashion similar to that previously reported for HEY1, HEYL is excluded from the nuclei in prostate cancer but not adjacent benign tissue. This suggests that nuclear exclusion of HEY proteins may be an important step in the progression of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2111964640,"Nerve agents are chiral organophosphate compounds (OPs) that exert their acute toxicity by phosphorylating the catalytic serine of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The inhibited cholinesterases can be reactivated using oximes, but a spontaneous time-dependent process called aging alters the adduct, leading to resistance toward oxime reactivation. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) functions as a bioscavenger, protecting the cholinergic system against OPs. The stereoselectivity of BChE is an important parameter for its efficiency at scavenging the most toxic OPs enantiomer for AChE. Crystals of BChE inhibited in solution or in cristallo with racemic V-agents (VX, Russian VX, and Chinese VX) systematically show the formation of the P(S) adduct. In this configuration, no catalysis of aging seems possible as confirmed by the three-dimensional structures of the three conjugates incubated over a period exceeding a week. Crystals of BChE soaked in optically pure VX(R)-(+) and VX(S)-(-) solutions lead to the formation of the P(S) and P(R) adduct, respectively. These structural data support an in-line phosphonylation mechanism. Additionally, they show that BChE reacts with VX(R)-(+) in the presence of racemic mixture of V-agents, at odds with earlier kinetic results showing a moderate higher inhibition rate for VX(S)-(-). These combined results suggest that the simultaneous presence of both enantiomers alters the enzyme stereoselectivity. In summary, the three-dimensional data show that BChE reacts preferentially with P(R) enantiomer of V-agents and does not age, in complete contrast to AChE, which is selectively inhibited by the P(S) enantiomer and ages."
https://openalex.org/W2063298301,"The human SHOX gene is composed of seven exons and encodes a paired-related homeodomain transcription factor. SHOX mutations or deletions have been associated with different short stature syndromes implying a role in growth and bone formation. During development, SHOX is expressed in a highly specific spatiotemporal expression pattern, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. We have analysed SHOX expression in diverse embryonic, fetal and adult human tissues and detected expression in many tissues that were not known to express SHOX before, e.g. distinct brain regions. By using RT-PCR and comparing the results with RNA-Seq data, we have identified four novel exons (exon 2a, 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3) contributing to different SHOX isoforms, and also established an expression profile for the emerging new SHOX isoforms. Interestingly, we found the exon 7 variants to be exclusively expressed in fetal neural tissues, which could argue for a specific role of these variants during brain development. A bioinformatical analysis of the three novel 3'UTR exons yielded insights into the putative role of the different 3'UTRs as targets for miRNA binding. Functional analysis revealed that inclusion of exon 2a leads to nonsense-mediated RNA decay altering SHOX expression in a tissue and time specific manner. In conclusion, SHOX expression is regulated by different mechanisms and alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated RNA decay constitutes a further component that can be used to fine tune the SHOX expression level."

Each segment was expressed as a monomer, a linear dimer, and a linear trimer fused with the trimerization domain (V domain) in Escherichia coli. All recombinant proteins studied formed stable triple helical structures, but the stability varied depending on the amino acid sequence in the A, B, and C segments and increased as the triple helix got longer. V-AAA was found to melt at a much lower temperature (31.0 °C) than V-ABC (V-CL), whereas V-BBB melted at almost the same temperature (∼36–37 °C). When heat-denatured, the V domain enhanced refolding for all of the constructs; however, the folding rate was affected by their amino acid sequences and became reduced for longer constructs. The folding rates of all the other constructs were lower than that of the natural V-ABC protein. Amino acid substitution mutations at all Pro residues in the C fragment dramatically decreased stability but increased the folding rate.

TGF-β also strongly induced hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) and HAS2 mRNA levels, which increased 50- and 6-fold, respectively. Remarkably, the addition of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) ligands pioglitazone (Pio) or rosiglitazone (Rosi) to TGF-β-treated orbital fibroblasts attenuated HA synthesis and reduced HAS1 and HAS2 mRNA levels. The attenuation of TGF-β function by Pio and Rosi was independent of PPARγ activity. Furthermore, Pio and Rosi treatment inhibited TGF-β-induced T cell adhesion to orbital fibroblasts.

Likewise, when orbital fibroblasts are activated, they release T cell chemoattractants and initiate interactions in which both cell types are further galvanized. One of the key events initiating TED is considered to be excess synthesis of ECM by orbital fibroblasts (20Smith T.J. Koumas L. Gagnon A. Bell A. Sempowski G.D. Phipps R.P. Sorisky A. J. Clin.

The newly synthesized HA polymer can be secreted out of the cell or anchored to the cell surface through the activity of HAS enzymes. HA can also bind its cognate cell surface receptors CD44 or RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility) to form a pericellular coat (22Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar).

Here we hypothesize that in inflamed orbital tissues the accumulation of HA may affect numerous cellular functions involved in the pathogenesis of TED, including regulation of inflammatory cell adhesion to orbital connective tissue. Increased transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) mRNA levels have been observed in orbital tissue from patients with TED (29van Steensel L. Paridaens D. Schrijver B. Dingjan G.M. van Daele P.L. van Hagen P.M. van den Bosch W.A. Drexhage H.A. Hooijkaas H. Dik W.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TGF-β is a key cytokine that regulates ECM production, inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling. Extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen, fibronectin, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteases, and tissue transglutaminase are targets of TGF-β (30Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M.

Hence, we speculated that blockage of TGF-β activity provides a therapeutic mechanism to inhibit fibrosis and HA production associated with periorbital edema in TED. Increasing evidence demonstrates that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) acts as a negative regulator of TGF-β (35Sime P.J. J. Investig Med. 2008; 56: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a ligand-activated transcription factor that modifies numerous pathways including promoting adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity while suppressing inflammation and fibrosis (36Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). PPARγ ligands, such as the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetic drugs (e.g. pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, ciglitazone, and troglitazone), inhibit the expression of various inflammatory proteins like inducible nitric-oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP9) in macrophages (37Li M.

Investig Med. 2008; 56: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we report the new finding that the PPARγ ligands pioglitazone (Pio) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) suppress TGF-β-induced HA production and HAS activation in human orbital fibroblasts through PPARγ-independent pathways. Pio and Rosi also attenuate TGF-β-mediated T cell adhesion to orbital fibroblasts by decreasing HA synthesis. Rosiglitazone and GW9662 were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Pioglitazone HCl was purchased from ChemPacific (Baltimore, MD). Recombinant human TGF-β1 was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Bioscience, La Jolla, CA). [3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Hyaluronic acid potassium salt from human umbilical cord and Streptomyces hyaluronidase (HA'ase) were purchased from Sigma. Unlike other HA'ases, this enzyme is specific for HA and is not active with chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate substrates (42Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Primary orbital fibroblasts were isolated from TED patients undergoing orbital decompression surgery. The protocol for orbital biopsy and blood sample isolation (see below) was approved by the Internal Review Board and informed; written consent was obtained from all patients. The primary fibroblasts were established by standard explant techniques (43Smith T.J. Sempowski G.D. Wang H.S. Del Vecchio P.J. Lippe S.D. Phipps R.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

S. Biochemical Corp.), and nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and gentamicin (Invitrogen). Fibroblasts were characterized by their adherent morphology, expression of vimentin and collagen (types I and III), and the absence of CD45, factor VIII, and cytokeratin. Fibroblasts were used at the earliest passage possible (between passages 4–10). One unit of blood was obtained from healthy donors as approved by the University of Rochester Institutional Review Board and Office for Human Subjects Protection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by density-gradient centrifugation of buffy coat using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were washed in PBS, and T cells were enriched using CD3/CD28 T cell Expander beads (Dynal Inc., Brown Deer, WI). Specifically, 5 × 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with CD3/CD28 beads at ratio 1:1 in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS medium at 37 °C for 2 days. After that, 50 units of recombinant IL-2/ml was added to the culture and incubated for another 2 or 3 days. On day 5, cells were diluted to 0.5 × 106/ml in culture medium containing 50 units/ml recombinant IL-2 and incubated for another 3–7 days according to the cell number. After T cell expansion, the cells were examined for purity by staining with an anti-CD3 phycoerythrin-labeled antibody (BD Biosciences). The T cell purity was >95%. Cell viability was assayed using the colorimetric XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, orbital fibroblasts were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured with various treatments. Twenty hours after treatment, 50 μl of XTT labeling mixture was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The amount of cleaved XTT product generated by metabolically active cells was assayed by measuring absorbance using an ELISA plate reader at 480 nm with a reference wavelength at 650 nm. Cell viability results were also confirmed by trypan blue staining. Enriched human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were surface-stained for CD3 (BD Biosciences) or CD44 (clone IM7, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) for 20 min at 4 °C, washed in staining buffer (PBS with 0.3% BSA), and pelleted by centrifugation. Samples were run on a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience) flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Confluent monolayers of orbital fibroblasts were serum-starved in 0.5% FBS RPMI 1640 medium for 3 days and pretreated with different concentrations of Pio or Rosi for 1 h and then treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. After treatments, an aliquot of culture medium (secreted HA) was removed and centrifuged at 8000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved for later analysis. The cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 0.25% trypsin, EDTA solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of culture medium, and cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. The cells were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min to inactivate trypsin activity. This supernatant was saved for pericellular HA detection. The cell pellet was washed with PBS once and digested with 120 μg/ml proteinase K in 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) at 37 °C for 1 h, and proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and supernatant was analyzed for intracellular HA. The amount of HA in each extract (secreted HA, pericellular HA, and intracellular HA) was measured by ELISA based on the specific interaction of HA with HA-binding protein (HABP). The HA detection kit was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Briefly diluted samples were incubated in HABP-coated microwells, allowing HA present in samples to react with the immobilized HABP. After extensive washing, biotinylated HABP was added to the microwells to form complexes with bound HA. After another round of washing, streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was added. After a brief incubation period and washing, chromogenic substrate was added, and HA levels were determined using a Varioskan Flash plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milford, MA). A fraction of the samples were pretreated with HA'ase (2 units/ml at 37 °C for 2 h) before being subjected to the ELISA assay as a negative control. Furthermore, an additional 50 ng/ml (final concentration) of free soluble HA was added to a fraction of the cell lysate samples to confirm that there are no inhibitory factors present and that the assays show the expected additivity when a known amount of exogenous HA is included. Confluent monolayers of orbital fibroblasts were serum-starved for 3 days and treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. One hour after TGF-β1 treatment, [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 20 μCi/ml. After labeling, the medium, trypsin extract solution, and cell lysate were collected as described above. Radiolabeled macromolecules in each extract were concentrated using a Vivaspin 10-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration spin column (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Goettingen, Germany) and washed with PBS twice. An equivalent radiolabeled aliquot was digested with HA'ase (2 units/ml) at 37 °C overnight before concentration. The concentrated solution was transferred to scintillation vials, and 3H incorporation was determined with a microplate scintillation counter (TopCount; PerkinElmer). Incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into HA was calculated by subtracting the counts from the HA'ase-digested fraction. Enriched T cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were fluorescently labeled by incubation with calcein-AM (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) for 45 min in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red and washed twice in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% FBS. After labeling, some T cells were incubated with monoclonal CD44 antibody (clone IM7, Biolegend) or isotype (rat IgG2b) at a dilution of 1:25 (final concentration is 40 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. Confluent orbital fibroblasts in a 96-well plate were serum-starved and incubated with different concentrations of Pio or Rosi treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF1 for 24 h. In some cultures, orbital fibroblasts were treated with HA'ase (100 milliunits/ml at 37 °C for 1 h) before the adhesion assay to deplete endogenous HA. Immediately before the adhesion assay, the conditioned medium of orbital fibroblasts was removed to eliminate treatments and secreted ECM. 1 × 105/well of calcein-AM-labeled T cells were added to a 96-well plate with a confluent orbital fibroblast monolayer and allowed to adhere for 90 min at 4 °C as previously described (45Wang A. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10279-10285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 46de La Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Yen-Lieberman B. Strong S.A. J. Biol.

Plates were washed 3 times with the addition of 200 μl of PBS followed by plate inversion and gentle tapping to remove the wash solution. Fluorescence was measured with an excitation of 485 nm and detection of 535 nm in a Varioskan Flash plate reader (Thermo Electron Corp.). There is a positive correlation between the labeled T cell number and fluorescence intensity (r2 is >0.998); thus, the number of T cells bound per well was calculated from the fluorescence intensity of the well. Orbital fibroblasts were cultured in 8-chamber slides (BD Biosciences), fixed in room temperature 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and stained with 1 μg/ml biotinylated HABP (Seikagaku, Cape Cod, MA) followed by Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). F-actin was stained with phalloidin (Molecular Probes). In some cultures, orbital fibroblasts were treated with HA'ase before staining. T cells were stained with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (clone UCHT, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) followed by a goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes). DAPI (10 μg/ml, Anaspec, San Jose, CA) was used for nuclear staining. Orbital adipose tissues were obtained from TED patients undergoing orbital decompression surgery. The tissues were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. Tissues were then saturated in 20% sucrose, PBS at 37 °C for 2 h, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Tissue Tek), and frozen in dry ice. Ten-μm-thick sections of frozen tissue were first incubated with biotinylated HABP, anti-CD44 and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies and the stained with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin, Alexa-488 conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody, and Alexa-647-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. Some sections were pretreated with 2 units/ml HA'ase to digest endogenous HA before staining to determine that staining was specific for HA. As an additional negative control, free soluble HA (200 μg/ml) was added to the HABP probe to block binding to endogenous HA. Fat was stained with Bodipy 493/503 dye (Molecular Probes). Slides were photographed using a Carl Zeiss Axio Imager M1 Microscope. RNA was isolated from orbital fibroblast strains using the RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Primers for human HAS1, -2, -and 3 and 7 S and the qRT-PCR method to detect relative abundance of mRNA were previously described (47Guo N. Baglole C.J. O'Loughlin C.W. Feldon S.E. Phipps R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15794-15804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Primers for human PPARγ1 (NM138711) and PPARγ 2 (NM015869) mRNA were 5′-AAAGAAGCCGACACTAAACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCCATTACGGAGAGATCC-3′ (antisense) and 5′-GCGATTCCTTCACTGATAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCCATTACGGAGAGATCC-3′ (antisense), respectively. Orbital fibroblasts were cultured to 80–90% confluence and transfected with PPARγ SMARTpool siRNA and scramble control (SC) siRNA (Dharmacon). Final concentration of siRNA was 80 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 48 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 with or without 10 μm Pio or 10 μm Rosi. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was collected, and HA levels were analyzed by ELISA (see above). For PPARγ mRNA detection, 4 days after transfection, RNA was prepared as above, and PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time PCR. HAS1 and HAS2 siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were also used to knock down HAS1 and HAS2 mRNA expression, respectively, as described previously (47Guo N. Baglole C.J. O'Loughlin C.W. Feldon S.E. Phipps R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15794-15804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were serum-starved and treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h before further experiment. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). For comparison between groups of three or more, an analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test was used to determine differences between treatments. Error bars represent the S.D. of triplicate samples. A p value <0.05 is considered significant. All experiments were performed at least three times. To determine whether the PPARγ ligands Pio and Rosi might block TGF-β1-induced HA synthesis, we selected several representative primary human orbital fibroblast strains and treated them with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of the PPARγ ligands Pio or Rosi at varying concentrations. Representative results from two fibroblast strains are shown. HA, which is synthesized on the plasma membrane, can be secreted into the ECM, stay on the cell membrane, or remain in the cell (48Jenkins R.H. Thomas G.J. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41453-41460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HA levels were detected in the cell culture supernatant (secreted HA), in cell trypsin solution (pericellular HA), and in cell lysate (intracellular HA) using a commercial HA ELISA kit. Fig. 1A demonstrates that TGF-β1 significantly increased secreted and pericellular HA levels (p < 0.001, upper and middle panel), respectively, but had no effect on intracellular HA levels (lower panel). In strain #1, TGF-β1 increased secreted HA levels 12.16 ± 0.15-fold and increased pericellular HA levels 8.34 ± 1.33-fold compared with vehicle control. There was 2.31 ± 0.36-fold more secreted HA compared with pericellular HA in fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1. Strain #2 showed similar results (Fig. 1A). Therefore, about 70% of the TGF-β1-mediated, newly synthesized HA was secreted into the ECM. The remaining newly synthesized HA was localized pericellularly on the cell surface. Fig. 1A also demonstrates that Pio or Rosi treatment alone has no significant effect on HA synthesis. However, treatment with Pio and Rosi substantially diminished the induction of secreted HA and pericellular HA by TGF-β1 in a dose-response manner. 10 μm Pio inhibited TGF-β1-mediated secretion and pericellular accumulation of HA by a 52 ± 2.2% and 40 ± 2.2%, respectively. Experiments using 10 μm Rosi instead of 10 μm Pio showed similar results (Fig. 1A). However, 20 μm Rosi significantly reduced intracellular HA levels in both strains. To confirm the HA ELISA results, [3H]glucosamine, which is incorporated into newly synthesiz"

In the Streptococcus pyogenes collagen-like protein Scl2, a V domain predicted to be largely α-helical, occurs N-terminal to the collagen triple helix (CL). Here, we replace this natural trimerization domain with a de novo designed, hyperstable, parallel, three-stranded, α-helical coiled coil (CC), either at the N terminus (CC-CL) or the C terminus (CL-CC) of the collagen domain. CD spectra of the constructs are consistent with additivity of independently and fully folded CC and CL domains, and the proteins retain their distinctive thermal stabilities, CL at ∼37 °C and CC at >90 °C. Heating the hybrid proteins to 50 °C unfolds CL, leaving CC intact, and upon cooling, the rate of CL refolding is somewhat faster for CL-CC than for CC-CL. A construct with coiled coils on both ends, CC-CL-CC, retains the ∼37 °C thermal stability for CL but shows less triple helix at low temperature and less denaturation at 50 °C. Most strikingly however, in CC-CL-CC, the CL refolds slower than in either CC-CL or CL-CC by almost two orders of magnitude. We propose that a single CC promotes folding of the CL domain via nucleation and in-register growth from one end, whereas initiation and growth from both ends in CC-CL-CC results in mismatched registers that frustrate folding. Bioinformatics analysis of natural collagens lends support to this because, where present, there is generally only one coiled-coil domain close to the triple helix, and it is nearly always N-terminal to the collagen repeat.

https://openalex.org/W2075179388,"Conserved bacteriophage ATP-based DNA translocation motors consist of a multimeric packaging terminase docked onto a unique procapsid vertex containing a portal ring. DNA is translocated into the empty procapsid through the portal ring channel to high density. In vivo the T4 phage packaging motor deals with Y- or X-structures in the replicative concatemer substrate by employing a portal-bound Holliday junction resolvase that trims and releases these DNA roadblocks to packaging. Here using dye-labeled packaging anchored 3.7-kb Y-DNAs or linear DNAs, we demonstrate FRET between the dye-labeled substrates and GFP portal-containing procapsids and between GFP portal and single dye-labeled terminases. We show using FRET-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy that purified T4 gp49 endonuclease VII resolvase can release DNA compression in vitro in prohead portal packaging motor anchored and arrested Y-DNA substrates. In addition, using active terminases labeled at the N- and C-terminal ends with a single dye molecule, we show by FRET distance of the N-terminal GFP-labeled portal protein containing prohead at 6.9 nm from the N terminus and at 5.7 nm from the C terminus of the terminase. Packaging with a C-terminal fluorescent terminase on a GFP portal prohead, FRET shows a reduction in distance to the GFP portal of 0.6 nm in the arrested Y-DNA as compared with linear DNA; the reduction is reversed by resolvase treatment. Conformational changes in both the motor proteins and the DNA substrate itself that are associated with the power stroke of the motor are consistent with a proposed linear motor employing a terminal-to-portal DNA grip-and-release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2061564394,"Bacterial UDP-sugar dehydrogenases are part of the biosynthesis pathway of extracellular polysaccharides. These compounds act as important virulence factors by protecting the cell from opsonophagocytosis and complement-mediated killing. In Staphylococcus aureus, the protein Cap5O catalyzes the oxidation of UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine to UDP-N-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid. Cap5O is crucial for the production of serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide that prevents the interaction of bacteria with both phagocytic and nonphagocytic eukaryotic cells. However, details of its catalytic mechanism remain unknown. We thus crystallized Cap5O and solved the first structure of an UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase. This study revealed that the catalytic cysteine makes a disulfide bond that has never been observed in other structurally characterized members of the NDP-sugar dehydrogenase family. Biochemical and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the formation of this disulfide bridge regulates the activity of Cap5O. We also identified two arginine residues essential for Cap5O activity. Previous data suggested that Cap5O is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, so we characterized the phosphorylation site and examined the underlying regulatory mechanism.

IntroductionStaphyloccocus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for a diverse spectrum of human and animal diseases ranging from soft-tissue infections to life-threatening bacteremia, endocarditis, and abscesses within multiple organs (1Watts A. Ke D. Wang Q. Pillay A. Nicholson-Weller A. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3502-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the multiple factors responsible for the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections, capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) 5The abbreviations used are: CPS, capsular polysaccharide; UDP-ManNAcDH, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase; UDP-ManNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine; UDP-ManNAcA, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; rmsd, root mean-square deviation. have been shown to possess antiphagocytic properties allowing the bacterium to persist in the blood and tissues of infected hosts (2Thakker M.

CPSs are produced by most S. aureus isolates from human and serotypes 5 (CP5) and 8 (CP8) strains are the most prevalent (3O'Riordan K. Lee J.C. Clin. Microbiol.

They differ only in the linkages between sugars and acetylation sites (4Jones C. Carbohydr. Res. 2005; 340: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cap5 and cap8 loci are allelic and comprise a ∼17.5-kb region of the chromosome. Each locus contains 16 genes, cap5A (cap8A) through cap5P (cap8P) (5Sau S. Bhasin N. Wann E.R. Lee J.C. Foster T.J. Lee C.Y. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2395-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Twelve out of these sixteen genes are nearly identical in both gene clusters. The deletion of the conserved cap5O gene product has been shown to inhibit CP5 synthesis, thus enhancing adherence of bacteria to endothelial cells (6Pöhlmann-Dietze P. Ulrich M. Kiser K.B. Döring G. Lee J.C. Fournier J.M. Botzenhart K. Wolz C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Cap5O possesses an UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase (UDP-ManNAcDH) activity catalyzing the oxidation of UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine (UDP-ManNAc) to UDP-N-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid (UDP-ManNAcA), the donor of ManNAcA residues in CP5 (7Portolés M. Kiser K.B. Bhasin N. Chan K.H. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Kawamura T. Ishimoto N. Ito E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8457-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cap5O belongs to the UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase family, a group of enzymes that catalyze the NAD+-dependent 2-fold oxidation of an alcohol to an acid. Structure-function analysis has been performed with the UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GlcDH) from Streptococcus pyogenes (PDB entries 1DLI and 1DLJ) (9Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and with the GDP-mannose dehydrogenase (GDP-ManDH) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB entries 1MV8, 1MFZ, and 1MUU) (10Snook C.F. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4658-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both enzymes display a dimeric quaternary structure. Each monomer is characterized by the presence of three regions: a conserved N-terminal NAD-binding domain, a central α-helical region involved in dimerization and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain. The N-terminal NAD-binding domain consists of a typical Rossmann fold that is also found in a degenerated form in the less conserved C-terminal NDP-sugar-binding domain. It is linked via an additional αβαβ-motif extending the central β-sheet to the central dimerization domain, which consists of a bundle of 4 α-helices. The active site is formed by a cleft at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains. Interestingly, UDP-GlcDH and GDP-ManDH display a different domain organization, and form domain-swapped dimers (supplemental Fig. S1).These dehydrogenases share the same active site topology and the same enzymatic mechanism (10Snook C.F. Tipton P.A. Beamer L.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4658-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Campbell R.E. Tanner M.E. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 9487-9492Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The reaction consists on a 4-electron oxidation using two equivalents of NAD+ to convert NDP-sugars into their acidic form. Initial oxidation of the alcohol C6“ hydroxyl proceeds by transfer of a hydride to NAD+ and produces a sequestered aldehyde intermediate. Nucleophilic attack of the aldehyde by an active site thiol induces the formation of a tetrahedral thiohemiacetal. The latter is oxidized to a thioester intermediate by transfer of the remaining hydride to a second molecule of NAD+. In the final step of the reaction, the thioester is irreversibly hydrolyzed to give the acid. A conserved nucleophilic cysteine is involved in thioester formation (Cys-260 and Cys-268 in UDP-GlcDH and GDP-ManDH, respectively). This catalytic mechanism is supposed to be common to all members of the family. This hypothesis is based on the conservation of several residues proposed to be involved in catalysis. Lys-263/271 (UDP-GlcDH/GDP-ManDH) interacts with the catalytic thiol thus increasing its nucleophilic character and stabilizing the active thiolate anion. Lys-204/Lys-210 acts as the acid/base catalyst assisting hydride transfer. Asp-264/272, Thr-118/124, Asn-208/214, and Glu-141/157 activate water molecules and participate in the tetrahedral intermediate formation or hydride transfer (12Ge X. Penney L.C. van de Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Residues responsible for sugar specificity have not yet been identified and sequence signatures specific of each subfamily remain to be characterized.Enzymatic assays performed with Cap5O demonstrate that its biochemical properties are similar to those described for other members of the family (7Portolés M. Kiser K.B. Bhasin N. Chan K.H. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment (Fig. 1) shows that Cap5O residue Cys-258 corresponds to the nucleophilic cysteine involved in thioester formation. It also shows that the remaining catalytic residues are conserved, except for Lys-263/271, which is replaced by a valine. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that Cap5O dehydrogenase activity is positively controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation (13Soulat D. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 13: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as also reported for the UDP-GlcDHs from Bacillus subtilis (14Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Boël G. Mazé A. Gillet S. Jamet E. Decottignies P. Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Le Maréchal P. Deutscher J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4709-4718Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (15Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39323-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine of these two UDP-GlcDHs has recently been identified as Tyr-70 and Tyr-71 in B. subtilis and E. coli, respectively (16Petranovic D. Grangeasse C. Macek B. Abdillatef M. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Nessler S. Deutscher J. Mijakovic I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 17: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Lacour S. Bechet E. Cozzone A.J. Mijakovic I. Grangeasse C. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, no equivalent of this phosphorylated tyrosine is found in Cap5O (Fig. 1), suggesting that this UDP-ManNAcDH might have an alternative mechanism of activation by phosphorylation. The phosphorylation site of Cap5O has not yet been identified.To address the structural basis for the specificity and regulatory mechanism of S. aureus Cap5O, we have determined its crystal structure and performed functional experiments. This study allowed us to highlight residues potentially involved in the specific recognition of the sugar. We have also identified the phosphorylation site of Cap5O and assessed the influence of tyrosine phosphorylation on its activity. This structural analysis also revealed the existence of an unexpected disulfide bond. We therefore propose an original regulatory process based on both tyrosine phosphorylation and reversible reduction of a disulfide bond involving the catalytic residue Cys-258.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that S. aureus UDP-ManNAc DH Cap5O belongs to the NDP-sugar dehydrogenase family and that it displays the same dimeric conformation as UDP-GlcDHs. The catalytic cysteine Cys-258, the acid/base catalyst Lys-204 and residues Asp-262, Thr-119, Asn-208, and Glu-151 (Cap5O numbering) participating in tetrahedral intermediate formation or hydride transfer are conserved. This suggests that Cap5O most probably possesses the same NAD-dependent 4-electrons oxidation mechanism as the other members of the family. On the other hand, we propose that specific recognition of the sugar moiety of the substrate involves two essential arginine residues, Arg-152 and Arg-211, only found in the sequences of Cap5O closest homologues that are therefore likely to be dehydrogenases specific for NDP-ManNAc.The presence in the crystal structure of a disulfide bridge between Cys-92 and the catalytic Cys-258 suggests that Cap5O dehydrogenase activity could be regulated by a redox-switch mechanism. Our functional analysis demonstrating that Cap5O requires reducing conditions for full dehydrogenase activity supports this hypothesis. Formation of the Cys-92/Cys-258 disulfide bridge sequesters the essential catalytic cysteine, stabilizing an inactive conformation where helix α11 carrying Cys-258 is destroyed and replaced by a flexible loop. A blast search against the UniProtKB database revealed that Cys-92 is conserved among several Cap5O homologues, suggesting that a similar redox regulation mechanism could be used by other NDP-sugar dehydrogenases. As observed in protein tyrosine phosphatases of the Cdc25 family, the formation of a disulfide bond between the catalytic residue and an adjacent back-door cysteine would hinder the reactive catalytic cysteine to oxidize into an irreversibly inactivated sulfinic acid (30Sohn J. Rudolph J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10060-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Chen C.Y. Willard D. Rudolph J.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In addition to this redox-switch, our results show that Cap5O activity is also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and we identified Tyr-89 as the phosphorylatable residue. A similar phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechansim has been reported for two UDP-GlcDHs from E. coli (15Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39323-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Lacour S. Bechet E. Cozzone A.J. Mijakovic I. Grangeasse C. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and B. subtilis (14Mijakovic I. Poncet S. Boël G. Mazé A. Gillet S. Jamet E. Decottignies P. Grangeasse C. Doublet P.

Mijakovic I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 17: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of UDP-sugarDHs seems to represent a conserved regulatory mechanism for several bacteria to control extracellular polysaccharide production. However, the phosphorylation site of these UDP-GlcDHs (Tyr-70 and Tyr-71, in E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively) is located in a very distinct region of the protein compared with Cap5O Tyr-89, suggesting different phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanisms. This latter possibility is not surprising if we consider the poor conservation of phosphorylation sites among bacterial orthologs (33Soufi B. Jers C. Hansen M.E. Petranovic D. Mijakovic I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The analysis of the phosphorylation-mediated activation mechanism of E. coli and B. subtilis UDP-GlcDH is highly speculative (16Petranovic D. Grangeasse C. Macek B. Abdillatef M. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Nessler S. Deutscher J. Mijakovic I. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2009; 17: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) mostly due to the absence of structural data. In Cap5O, Tyr-89 is located on the same loop (βd-α4) as Cys-92, which forms the disulfide bond with the catalytic Cys-258. Because Tyr-89 points toward the flexible (α11-α12) loop, we can suggest that once phosphorylated, Tyr89-P could participate in the stabilization of helix α11 and thus in the correct positioning of the catalytic residue Cys-258.In Cap5O, both redox and phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms thus seem intimately linked. Under normal growth conditions, the bacterial cytoplasm is a reduced environment. Therefore, the described redox-switch might be required for Cap5O activity when the bacterium is exposed to oxidizing condition. Such conditions are encountered by several pathogens during host infection, as for example during polymorphonuclear leukocytes phagocytosis that induces production of reactive oxygen species (34Voyich J.M. Braughton K.R. Sturdevant D.E. Whitney A.R. Säid-Salim B. Porcella S.F. Long R.D. Dorward D.W. Gardner D.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Musser J.M. DeLeo F.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3907-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that genes involved in capsule synthesis, including Cap5O, the tyrosine-kinase Cap5B2 and its transmembrane activator Cap5A1, are up-regulated during S. aureus neutrophil phagocytosis (34Voyich J.M. Braughton K.R. Sturdevant D.E. Whitney A.R. Säid-Salim B. Porcella S.F. Long R.D. Dorward D.W. Gardner D.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Musser J.M. DeLeo F.R. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3907-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In such an oxidizing environment, the thioredoxin system, that is the major disulfide reductant in the bacterial cytosol, is also activated (35Uziel O. Borovok I. Schreiber R. Cohen G. Aharonowitz Y. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and it would contribute together with the tyrosine kinase Cap5B2 to trigger Cap5O activity to allow optimal capsule production. Obviously, this last hypothesis is highly speculative but it could represent an appealing work model to explain the biological function of the Cap5O redox-switch. IntroductionStaphyloccocus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for a diverse spectrum of human and animal diseases ranging from soft-tissue infections to life-threatening bacteremia, endocarditis, and abscesses within multiple organs (1Watts A. Ke D. Wang Q. Pillay A. Nicholson-Weller A. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3502-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the multiple factors responsible for the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections, capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) 5The abbreviations used are: CPS, capsular polysaccharide; UDP-ManNAcDH, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase; UDP-ManNAc, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosamine; UDP-ManNAcA, UDP-N-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; rmsd, root mean-square deviation. have been shown to possess antiphagocytic properties allowing the bacterium to persist in the blood and tissues of infected hosts (2Thakker M.

CPSs are produced by most S. aureus isolates from human and serotypes 5 (CP5) and 8 (CP8) strains are the most prevalent (3O'Riordan K. Lee J.C. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Both CP5 and CP8 are heteropolymers composed of N-acetyl-fucosamine and N-acetyl-d-mannosamine. They differ only in the linkages between sugars and acetylation sites (4Jones C. Carbohydr. Res. 2005; 340: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1985713390,"Necrosis, a type of cell death accompanied by the rupture of the plasma membrane, promotes tumor progression and aggressiveness by releasing the pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokine high mobility group box 1. It is commonly found in the core region of solid tumors due to hypoxia and glucose depletion (GD) resulting from insufficient vascularization. Thus, metabolic stress-induced necrosis has important clinical implications for tumor development; however, its regulatory mechanisms have been poorly investigated.Here, we show that the transcription factor Snail, a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is induced in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner in both two-dimensional culture of cancer cells, including A549, HepG2, and MDA-MB-231, in response to GD and the inner regions of a multicellular tumor spheroid system, an in vitro model of solid tumors and of human tumors. Snail short hairpin (sh) RNA inhibited metabolic stress-induced necrosis in two-dimensional cell culture and in multicellular tumor spheroid system. Snail shRNA-mediated necrosis inhibition appeared to be linked to its ability to suppress metabolic stress-induced mitochondrial ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition, which are the primary events that trigger necrosis.Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Snail is implicated in metabolic stress-induced necrosis, providing a new function for Snail in tumor progression."

In the present study, we constructed yeast Rad52 mutants in which the amino acid residues corresponding to the second DNA-binding site of the human Rad52 protein were replaced with either alanine or aspartic acid. We found that the second DNA-binding site is important for the yeast Rad52 function in vivo. Rad51-Rad52 complexes consisting of these Rad52 mutants were defective in promoting the formation of D-loops, and the ability of the complex to associate with double-stranded DNA was specifically impaired.

When an ssDNA region is formed after double-stranded breakage, the ssDNA is covered by a single-stranded binding protein (SSB) in bacteria and replication protein A (RPA) in eukaryotes. The binding of SSB or RPA to ssDNA stimulates, or is required for, D-loop formation by RecA or Rad51 to unfold the secondary structures of the ssDNA, especially when the ssDNA is long enough to fold tightly (8Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 19McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 1980; 77: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the prior binding of SSB or RPA to ssDNA inhibits the initial binding of RecA or Rad51. The cells have a family of proteins called recombination mediators, which load RecA or Rad51 onto ssDNA by overcoming the inhibitory effects of SSB or RPA (21Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 22Beernink H.T. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Rad52, which is essential for homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the prototype of the mediators (21Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and is ubiquitous in various eukaryotes, except for plants and flies. The yeast Rad52 physically interacts with RPA and Rad51 and facilitates the displacement of RPA by Rad51 (23Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Seong C. Sehorn M.G. Plate I. Shi I. Song B. Chi P. Mortensen U. Sung P. Krejci L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12166-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to its mediator function, Rad52 also possesses potent ssDNA annealing activity in vitro (25Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This activity is believed to be important for capturing the second end of the double-stranded break. Precisely, after the 3′ ssDNA tail derived from the first end of the double-stranded break has been incorporated into a D-loop and repair DNA synthesis initiated at the 3′ termini enlarges the D-loop, the second end is annealed with the displaced strand of the D-loop. Thus, Rad52 is considered to primarily function on ssDNA. Although Rad52 has been shown to bind to dsDNA, the functional relevance of this activity is unknown. A crystallographic study combined with mutational analyses of human Rad52 revealed two distinct DNA-binding sites (26Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Kagawa W. Kagawa A. Saito K. Ikawa S. Shibata T. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24264-24273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first site, located inside the groove that runs around the ring structure, is a binding site for ssDNA. The second site is located at the entrance of the groove, and is a binding site for dsDNA or ssDNA. In the first site, Arg-55 is the key residue for ssDNA binding. Mutating this residue greatly impairs the ssDNA binding activity of human Rad52. The corresponding residue in yeast Rad52 is Arg-70, and in vivo studies revealed homologous recombination deficiencies in yeast when this residue was mutated (28Bai Y. Davis A.P. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1117-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mortensen U.H. Erdeniz N. Feng Q. Rothstein R. Genetics. 2002; 161: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies suggested that Arg-70 is important for the annealing activity of Rad52, which is required for the second end capture of the double-stranded break (30Sugiyama T. Kantake N. Wu Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5539-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31McIlwraith M.J. West S.C. Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 33275-33284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the second DNA-binding site of human Rad52 is composed of Lys-102 and Lys-133, and in vitro studies revealed that these residues are important for the ssDNA annealing activity of Rad52. However, no clear in vivo defects have been demonstrated yet for this DNA-binding site. We previously reported that the yeast Rad51 and Rad52 proteins form a stoichiometric 2:1 complex and that the complex promotes D-loop formation efficiently (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The D-loop formation promoted by the complex does not appear to involve the mediator and ssDNA annealing activities of Rad52. This observation led us to investigate the possible role of the putative second DNA-binding site of yeast Rad52 in the D-loop formation activity of the complex. In the current study, we found that yeast Rad52 also harbors the second DNA-binding site identified in human Rad52. The DNA-binding site was important for homologous recombination in yeast cells and was indispensable for D-loop formation by the Rad51-Rad52 complex. Based on these results, we discuss the possible roles of the second DNA-binding site of Rad52 in yeast. Taq DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and all of the restriction endonucleases were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Pfu polymerase was obtained from Promega Co. Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was purchased from Bio-Rad. The micro Spin S-400 HR column, the Probe Quant G-50 Micro Column, and the Q-Sepharose FF, Mono Q HR5/5, and Sephacryl S-300 HR matrices were obtained from GE Healthcare Biosciences. S. cerevisiae XS560–1C-1D2 (a, rad52-8::TRP1, leu2-3,112, trp1-Δ, ura3-52, his3-Δ, can1) was provided by Dr. Munenori Furuse (RIKEN); YPH499 (a, ura3-52, lys2-801 amber, ade2-101 ochre, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1) was obtained from Stratagene. The standard reaction buffer consisted of 30 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.1), 12 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50–100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), supplemented with 2 mm ATP, unless otherwise stated. DNAs used in these experiments were prepared as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The DNA concentrations are expressed as the concentrations of nucleotide residues in the DNA. The following are the details of each DNA species. We prepared pUC119 and pNS11 form I DNA by the previously described methods (35Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which included the disruption of cells with lysozyme and sarcosyl treatments, phenol extraction, and purification by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Note that, to avoid the induction of non-B form structures in negatively supercoiled DNA and to minimize contamination and damage, the purification procedure for the form I DNA was devoid of denaturation, gel electrophoresis, and contact with intercalators, such as ethidium bromide. The pNS11 plasmid is a pUC119 derivative containing ARG4 and part of the DED81 gene of S. cerevisiae (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We prepared pUC119 circular DNA by the previously described methods (35Cunningham R.P. DasGupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The pNS11 ssDNA259-mer that contained a downstream 20-base region of a meiotic double-stranded break site in ARG4 in S. cerevisiae (36Liu J. Wu T.C. Lichten M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4599-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was prepared as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cy5-labeled pNS11 ssDNA259-mer was prepared by amplification using a 5′-Cy5-labeled AG4sfD primer (prepared by Sigma-Genosys), as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 5′-biotinylated pNS11 ssDNA120-mer, ATATTCTCCCCTAGCTAAAGAAAGGTAGTCTTATCTCAGAGTTCTGTGCTTCGCTGACCTTTTATAATCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCACATGTTTCAATTTGCGCCAGCTTATCCAAAAAGT, which contains some of the sequences of the pNS11 ssDNA259-mer, was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Sigma-Genosys). Both the Lys-117 and Arg-148 residues (numbering from the first ATG) of the wild type Rad52 on pNS145 were replaced by alanine (K117A/R148A) or aspartic acid (K117D/R148D), using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The replacement of both the AAG (Lys-117) and AGA (Arg-148) codons with the GCG (alanine) or GAC (aspartic acid) codon was confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. The expression vector for the mutant and wild type Rad52 in S. cerevisiae, containing the ADH1 promoter and terminatory, ARSH4-CEN6 (a yeast centromere sequence and autonomously replicating sequence) (37Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the LEU2 marker (named pNS31), was constructed by inserting the BamHI fragment containing the ADH1 promoter and the terminator of pAUR123 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) into the PvuII site of pRS415 (Stratagene). The BamHI fragment was blunt-ended by a treatment with Klenow fragment before insertion. The open reading frame of wild type RAD52 (pNS145), rad52K117A/R148A (pNS178), or rad52K117D/R148D (pNS179) on pET3a for expression in E. coli (see below) was removed by EcoT14I digestion and partial digestion with NdeI and then blunt-ended by a treatment with Klenow fragment. The fragment containing the open reading frame of rad52 was inserted in the SmaI site of pNS31. The cells of the rad52Δ strain (XS560-1C-1D2) were transformed with the plasmids. The SD liquid medium (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid (Difco)) for the spot test was supplemented with 2 μg/ml uracil and 2 μg/ml histidine. Cells from an overnight culture (10 ml) were concentrated to 1 ml by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min. The number of cells was counted under a microscope using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer and was adjusted to ∼105 cells/μl. Aliquots (10 μl) of a 10-fold dilution series of each transformant were spotted onto SD plates containing 2 μg/ml uracil and 2 μg/ml histidine with 0.25, 0.59, or 1.18 mm MMS. The plates were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. The SD liquid medium for quantitative analysis was supplemented with 4 μg/ml adenine sulfate, 2 μg/ml uracil, 2 μg/ml histidine, 4 μg/ml lysine, and 4 μg/ml tryptophan (and 6 μg/ml leucine for YPH499 strain without the plasmid)). Cells from an overnight culture (10 ml) were concentrated to 1 ml by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min. After the dilution of the cell cultures, the cells were spread on freshly prepared SD plates containing the appropriate supplements, with MMS at 0, 0.13 (0.001%), 0.25 (0.002%), 0.59 (0.005%), or 1.18 mm (0.010%). The plates were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at 30 °C for 7 days. The wild type Rad52 and the mutant proteins, rad52K191A/R148A and rad52K191D/R148D, were expressed from the third ATG codon of the cloned RAD52 on pET3a (pNS145) in E. coli BLR (DE3). Rad52 was purified as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), i.e. disruption by lysozyme treatment of the expressing cells, Brij58 treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and fractionation by a series of column chromatography steps using SP-Sepharose FF, Sephacryl S300HR, and Mono Q. The purified Rad52 preparations were dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm PMSF), and then 20-μl aliquots were frozen by dipping into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C (final concentration, 162 μm wild type Rad52; 131 μm rad52K191A/R148A; and 101 μm rad52K191D/R148D). The molar concentration of Rad52 was determined from the extinction coefficient, 2.42 × 104 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm, reported by New et al. (38New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The mutant and wild type Rad52 does not have tags of any kinds. The wild type Rad51 (cloned in pET3a) proteins were prepared by a procedure consisting of expression in E. coli BLR (DE3), cell disruption by lysozyme and Brij58 treatments, polymin P precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and a series of column chromatography steps on Q-Sepharose FF, Hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S300HR, and Mono Q, as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The purified Rad52 preparation was dialyzed against storage buffer, and then 20 μl-aliquots (final concentration 170 μm) were stored at −80 °C. The molar concentration of the Rad51 was determined from the extinction coefficient (1.29 × 104 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm) reported by Sugiyama et al. (39Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Rad51 does not have tags of any kind. The natural form of RPA was purified from S. cerevisiae YPH501 (a/α, ura3-52, lys2-801 amber, ade2-101 ochre, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1) as described by Alani et al. (40Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), except the DEAE 650M step was replaced by a Mono Q step. The purified RPA was dialyzed against storage buffer containing 0.02% IGEPAL CA-630. The concentration of RPA was determined based on the extinction coefficient (8.8 × 104 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm) reported by Sugiyama et al. (39Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the purified RPA stimulated Rad51-promoted strand exchange between circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA (data not shown). It is noted that the purified RPA is the authentic yeast RPA produced in yeast cells. DNA (0.8 μm Cy5-labeled pNS11 ssDNA259-mer or 15 μm pUC119 form I DNA) was incubated with Rad52 in the standard reaction buffer (10 μl), except that it contained 20 mm KCl and lacked both MgCl2 and ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. The free and bound DNA were separated by 1% SeaKem GTG agarose (LONZA Group Ltd.) gel electrophoresis with TAE buffer and analyzed by Typhoon 9410 image analyzer for the Cy5-labeled pNS11 ssDNA259-mer or a Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad) for the form I DNA, after ethidium bromide staining. [α-32P]ATP (0.1 mm) was incubated with 0.88 μm RPA and 5.0 μm pUC119 circular ssDNA in the standard reaction buffer (10 μl) but containing 7 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 10 min. After the incubation, 1.0 μm Rad51 and the indicated concentrations of Rad52 were added to the reaction mixture, which was further incubated for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of stop solution (25 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm ADP, 3 mm AMP). Aliquots (15 μl) of the sample were spotted on polyethyleneimine plastic film (POLYGRAM CELL 300 PEI for TLC; MACHERY-NAGEL) and developed in a mixture of 0.5 m lithium chloride and 1 m formic acid (41Scott J.F. Eisenberg S. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After the plastic film was exposed to a Phosphor Screen (GE Healthcare Bioscience) for ∼1 h, the radioactivity was analyzed by a Typhoon 9410 Variable Image Analyzer. The purified anti-Rad51 antibody (90 μg) (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was mixed with 330 μl of protein A-agarose bead suspension (Calbiochem) in PBS with 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 (total, 1.8 ml) and gently shaken at 4 °C for 16 h. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 200 mm triethanolamine (pH 8.2), and were suspended in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce), followed by an incubation at room temperature for 30 min to form a covalent bond between the antibody and the protein A. To stop the reaction, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature with a microcentrifuge, resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After washing three times with 1 ml of TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630), the beads were resuspended in 1 ml of TBS. Rad52 (62.5 pmol) and Rad51 (25 pmol) were mixed in the storage buffer (total, 5 μl) using a Protein LoBind Eppendorf tube and then incubated on ice for 30 min for complex formation. After 100 μl of TBS and 100 μl of the anti-Rad51 antibody protein A-agarose beads were added to the Rad52 and Rad51 mixture, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mixing. The beads were gently washed twice with 200 μl of TBS, and the proteins captured by the anti-Rad51 antibody were eluted by suspending the beads in 12 μl of sample buffer (3% SDS, 100 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and heating for 1 min at 90–95 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The optical densities of the protein bands were measured by the Gel Doc XR system. CD spectra of wild type and mutant Rad52 were measured at 25 °C in the storage buffer and 10 μm wild type or mutant Rad52 by use of the Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The light path length was 1 mm. [θ] is the observed molar ellipticity in mdeg. D-loops were analyzed by detecting the radioactive signals from ssDNA that was paired with homologous dsDNA after agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (34Arai N. Ito D. Inoue T. Shibata T. Takahashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32218-32229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the reaction mixture for D-loop formation (final, 20 μl) contained 0.4 μm [32P]pNS11 ssDNA259-mer, 60 μm pNS11 form I DNA, 0.4 μm Rad51, and 1.0 μm Rad52 in the standard reaction buffer. The complex of Rad52 and Rad51 was allowed to form by mixing Rad52 and Rad51 in the storage buffer and incubating them for at least 30 min on ice. Under the standard conditions for D-loop formation, the standard reaction mixture (19 μl), containing Rad52, Rad51, and ssDNA, was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min without the form I DNA. Then D-loop formation was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 1,200 μm pNS11 form I DNA, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.7 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1.3 μl of 10% SDS and deproteinized by incubating the mixture at 37 °C for 15 min after the addition of 2 μl of 2.6 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). Then 2 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue and 50% (v/v) glycerol were added to the reaction products, which were separated by electrophoresis for 30 min at 5 V/cm on a 1.0% agarose gel with TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried on Gel Bond film (BMA Inc.) and was exposed to a Phosphor Screen (GE Healthcare Biosciences) for ∼16 h. The distribution of radioactivity was analyzed with a Typhoon 9410 variable image analyzer (GE Healthcare). The amounts of D-loops formed were determined by the shift of the radioactivity derived from the [32P]pNS11 ssDNA259-mer to the position of pNS11 form I DNA. pNS11 ssDNA120-mer bound to Dynabeads was prepared by the incubation of 5′-biotinylated pNS11 ssDNA120-mer (0.4 μm) and 2 μl of a Dynabead M-280 streptavidin suspension (streptavidin-associated magnetic beads; Dynal), in 100 μl of the standard reaction buffer containing 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630, for 20 min at room temperature. Previously mixed Rad52 (1.0 μm) and Rad51 (0.4 μm) were incubated with the pNS11 ssDNA120-mer bound to the Dynabeads in the standard reaction buffer (final, 100 μl) at 37 °C for 10 min in a Protein LoBind Eppendorf tube. The pNS11 ssDNA120-mer ssDNA bound to the Dynabeads was recovered from the mixture by the use of a magnet. Sample buffer (10 μl) was added to the recovered Dynabeads and heated for 1 min at 90–95 °C. After applying the magnet again, the proteins in the supernatant were fractionated by polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The optical densities of the protein-bands were measured by the Gel Doc XR system. pNS11 ssDNA120 mer-Dynabeads were prepared by the method described above, with the following modifications. A magnet was applied to 140 μl of a Dynabead M-280 streptavidin suspension (Dynal), and the beads were recovered. To the beads, a solution (280 μl) consisting of 2 μm 5′-biotinylated pNS11 ssDNA120-mer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for at least 20 min. The pNS11 ssDNA120-mer-Dynabead suspension (20 μl) was added to 75 μl of the standard reaction buffer, containing 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 and previously mixed Rad52 (final, 1.0 μm) and Rad51 (final, 0.4 μm), i"

Recently, mutations in prokineticin 2 (PK2) and PKR2 are found to be associated with Kallmann syndrome and/or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, disorders characterized by delayed puberty and infertility. However, little is known how PKRs interact and activate G-proteins to elicit signal transduction. In the present study, we took advantage of one disease-associated mutation (R164Q) located in the second intracellular (IL2) loop of PKR2, to investigate the role of IL2 loop in the cell signaling, G-protein binding and receptor trafficking. R164Q mutant PKR2 showed normal cell surface expression and ligand binding capacity. However, the PKR2 signaling was abolished by R164Q mutation. We demonstrated that R164Q mutation disrupted the interaction of IL2 loop to the Gαq, Gαi, and Gα16-proteins. A positive-charged amino acid at this position is required for proper function, and the signaling efficacy and potency depend on the net amount of positive charges. We also demonstrated that the interactive partner of Arg-164 may localize in the C-terminal five residues of Gαq-protein. A series of mutation analysis indicated that the basic amino acids at the C terminus of IL2 loop may function cooperatively in GPCRs. Furthermore, R164Q mutation also results in minimal ligand-induced endocytosis of PKR2. As many GPCRs share structural homology in the C terminus of IL2 loop, our findings may have general application in understanding structure and function of GPCRs.

The structure of GPCRs consists of seven transmembrane (TM) helices, with three intracellular loops (IL1–3) and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. The extracellular ligands activate GPCRs and enable the receptors to interact with and activate distinct sets of heterotrimeric G proteins (e.g. Gαβγ) (1Jaakola V.P. Ijzerman A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In addition, PKRs may inhibit cAMP accumulation, presumably through Gαi/o proteins (8Keramidas M. Faudot C. Cibiel A. Feige J.J. Thomas M. J.

One disease-causing mutation, R164Q, is located at the C terminus of IL2 loop in PKR2. Herein, we took advantage of this naturally occurred mutation and demonstrated the positive charges at the C terminus of IL2 loop plays a key role in the interaction with the C terminus of G-proteins. Disruption of this interaction abolished the receptor function and endocytosis. The cDNAs for human PKR1 and PKR2 was kindly provided by Dr. Qun-Yong Zhou (University of California, Irvine). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce various mutations into PKR1 and PKR2. The cDNA for human PKR2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pEGFP-N1 in-frame with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) to generate PKR2 tagged with EGFP at the C terminus. The cDNA for Gαq was kindly provided by Dr. Olivier Civelli (University of California, Irvine). A human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the N terminus of Gαq to facilitate immunodetection. The cDNA for Gα16 is a kind gift from Dr. Dian-Qing Wu (Yale University) and an N-terminal 3×Flag tag (Sigma) was added to facilitate immunodetection. An aequorin-based luminescent assay was used to measure mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (15Bullock C.M. Li J.D. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the photoprotein aequorin were transiently transfected with wild-type PKR1/PKR2 or their respective mutants. Two days after transfection, the cells were charged in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 8 μm coelenterazine cp (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were detached by brief trypsinization and maintained in Hank's balanced salt solution plus 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at about 5 × 105 cells/ml. Luminescence measurements were made using a Sirius Single Tube Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). PK2 (a kind gift from Dr. Qun-Yong Zhou, University of California at Irvine) were serially diluted in Hank's balanced salt solution plus 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 100 μl of cells were injected into the tubes with 20 μl of PK2. The luminescence was monitored for 25 s (peak 1), then 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 was injected to lyse the cells, and the luminescence was continuously monitored for another 20 s (peak 2). The area under the curve (AUC) of the peak 1 was divided by the total AUC of peaks 1 and 2, and the maximal responses from wild-type receptors were normalized to 100. An overlapping primer strategy was used to clone the WT, R164Q and H159Q PKR2 IL2 loop into the pGEX-3X vector (GE Healthcare, UK) for expression of fusion proteins with an N-terminal GST. The WT IL2 loop includes amino acid sequences of IDRYLAIVHPLKPRMNYQ. After expression in Escherichia coli, GST fusion proteins were purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare beads for pulldown assays, GST or GST fusion proteins (5 μg of each) were incubated with 30-μl slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads equilibrated in buffer A (PBS, 1% Nonidet P 40, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. After washing with buffer A, the beads were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing lysates from cells transiently expressed with Flag-Gα16, HA-Gαq, and HA-Gαqi5, respectively. Incubation was performed at 4 °C for more than 1 h with constant agitation. The glutathione beads were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively in buffer A prior to resuspension in 20 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against HA or Flag (Sigma), respectively. The HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were selected in the presence of the antibiotic Geneticin (G418) at 1 mg/ml. EGFP expression in clones was initially examined by fluorescence microscopy, and confirmed by immunoblotting using an antibody against GFP (Sigma). Stable transfected HEK293 cells were subcultured onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass slides in 12-well dishes and incubated with cycloheximide (Sigma) for 4 h before experiments. For ligand-induced internalization studies, the cells were treated with PK2 for an indicated period. For washout experiments, cells were washed three times with PBS after 1 h of treatment with 100 nm PK2 and then incubated with culture medium for an indicated time. Cycloheximide was included in all the processes. Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated concanavalin A (Invitrogen) was applied to label the membrane. After washing three times with cold PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min at 4 °C. Images were acquired by using a laser scanning confocal system installed on a Carl Zeiss microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective. EGFP was excited with a 488-nm argon laser and detected with a 530–560-nm band pass filter. The Alexa Fluor 594 was excited at 590 nm and detected with a long pass band filter at 617 nm. We used an aequorin-based calcium measurement to determine the signal transduction of prokineticin receptors after PK2 stimulation (15Bullock C.M. Li J.D. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, PK2 dose-dependently increased the cytoplasmic calcium concentration in cells transfected with wild-type (WT) PKR2; however, R164Q mutation in PKR2 abolished the ligand-induced signaling. To visualize the subcellular location of receptors, we attached an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) at the C terminus of WT PKR2 and its R164Q mutant. The EGFP-tagged WT PKR2 retained full signaling capacity, whereas EGFP-tagged R164Q-PKR2 showed no signal transduction (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, both EGFP-tagged WT and R164Q mutant PKR2 were expressed on the cell surface. Because previous work has indicated R164Q-PKR2 showed intact ligand binding capacity (16Monnier C. Dodé C. Fabre L. Teixeira L. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Hardelin J.P. Rondard P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it is very likely that R164Q substitution affects G-protein coupling. However, it is unclear whether R164Q interferes with either the binding of Gα to PKR2 or the catalytic activation of Gα by PKR2. To explore the possibility that R164Q affects the binding of Gαq to PKR2, we first determined whether Gαq could directly interact with purified second intracellular loop (IL2) of PKR2. Thus, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of WT and R164Q mutant PKR2-IL2 were expressed in E. coli. The GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose, and then incubated with cell lysate overexpressed with human Gαq. As shown in Fig. 2A, WT PKR2-IL2 was able to pulldown Gαq, suggesting that these two proteins form direct protein-protein interactions. Importantly, GST alone was not able to pulldown Gαq (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the interaction was mediated by the IL2 of PKR2. In staggering contrast, the interaction between PKR2-IL2 and Gαq was abolished by the R164Q mutation, suggesting this mutation uncouples functional responses by abrogating receptor/Gαq interaction. Some works have suggested the C-terminal amino acids of Gαq are flexible and interact with a variety of portions in GPCRs, including the IL2 loop (17Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Hu J. Wang Y. Zhang X. Lloyd J.R. Li J.H. Karpiak J. Costanzi S. Wess J. Nat. Chem.

Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To study whether the C terminus of Gαq is involved in the interaction with the PKR2 IL2 loop, we made a truncated Gαq without the C-terminal five amino acids (Gαq-ΔC5). As shown in Fig. 2B, WT PKR2-IL2 failed to pulldown the Gαq-ΔC5, suggesting the significant role of these amino acid residues in receptor coupling. As PKR2 was also reported to couple with Gαi pathway (8Keramidas M. Faudot C. Cibiel A. Feige J.J. Thomas M. J. Endocrinol. 2008; 196: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and the IL2 loop seems to interact directly with the C-terminal five amino acids of Gαq protein, we constructed a modified Gαq-protein with the C-terminal five residues replaced by those from the Gαi3 (e.g. Gαqi5). GST-pulldown assay was also use to determine the interaction between PKR2 IL2 and Gαqi5. As shown in Fig. 2C, WT but not R164Q mutant PKR2-IL2 was able to pulldown Gαqi5, implying that R164Q mutation also disrupted the interaction between the IL2 loop and Gαi-protein. To investigate whether the deficient signaling of R164Q-PKR2 was due to the inadequate levels of Gαq, we co-transfected Gαq with the R164Q-PKR2. As shown in Fig. 3A, R164Q mutant receptor still did not elicit signaling transduction when co-expressed with Gαq. Thus, Gαq overexpression did not overcome the signaling defect of R164Q mutant PKR2, consistent with its deficit in G-protein interaction. The promiscuous murine G-protein α-subunit Gα15 and its human counterpart Gα16 are capable of linking a wide range of Gαs-, Gαi-, and Gαq-coupled receptors to the stimulation of PLC-β and subsequent intracellular Ca2+ release (22Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). As PKRs have been reported to couple to Gαo and Gαi, besides Gαq, we co-expressed Gα16 with R164Q mutant PKR2 to see if this mutation affects these G-protein coupling. As shown in Fig. 3A, Gα16 co-expression did not rescue the signaling deficit of R164Q mutant receptor, either. We also used the GST pulldown assay to see whether R164Q mutation affects the binding of IL2 loop to Gα16. As shown in Fig. 3B, IL2 from the WT PKR2 was able to pulldown Gα16; however, the R164Q mutation significantly attenuated the binding of PKR2-IL2 to Gα16. Cumulatively, our data suggest that the arginine at the position 164 of PKR2 is critical for the interaction with G-proteins. To further understand how the precise physiochemical characteristics of the residue 164 might dictate the strength of PKR2 functional coupling, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert Arg-164 to glutamic acid (R164E), lysine (R164K), histidine (R164H), alanine (R164A), or threonine (R164T). PK2 stimulated Ca2+ mobilization was measured in cells transiently transfected with individual PKR2 variants. As shown in the Fig. 4A, replacement of Arg-164 with small (R164A), acidic (R164E) and threonine (R164T) amino acid residues totally disrupted the receptor signaling. However, change of Arg-164 to positive-charged amino acids lysine (R164K) and histidine (R164H) resulted in receptors with partial activity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, both signaling potency (the half-maximal effective concentration, EC50) and efficiency (the maximal response) correlated well with the net positive charges at position 164 (Fig. 4, C and D). The WT receptor with an arginine, a strong positive-charged residue, at position 164 showed the highest signaling capacity; whereas the replacement of arginine with lysine, a moderate positive-charged residue, moderately attenuated the receptor function. Furthermore, the substitution of arginine with histidine, a weak positive-charged residue significantly impaired the signaling capacity. Nevertheless, R164K and R164H mutant PKR2s were apparently better than other mutant receptors (R164A, R164E, R164T, and R164Q) in the signal transduction, indicating the requirement of positive charges at this position for receptor function. The PKR1 and PKR2 shared about 85% amino acid identity, with the most divergent part residing at the N terminus (6Lin D.C. Bullock C.M. Ehlert F.J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Zhou Q.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, it is reported that the signal transduction efficacy of PKR1 is somewhat higher than that of PKR2 (6Lin D.C. Bullock C.M. Ehlert F.J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Zhou Q.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19276-19280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 7Masuda Y. Takatsu Y. Terao Y. Kumano S. Ishibashi Y. Suenaga M. Abe M. Fukusumi S. Watanabe T.

We noticed some interesting differences in the IL2 loop, especially at the C-terminal portion, between PKR1 and PKR2. As shown in Fig. 5A, there are a cluster of three basic amino acids forming a BXBXB (B represents basic amino acids, and X represents any amino acids) motif in the C-terminal IL2 loop of PKR1. However, the third B is replaced with a neutral amino acid, asparagines (N), in PKR2; and the first B is arginine in PKR1 but lysine in PKR2. As our data have indicated that the basic residues in this portion significantly affect the efficacy of function, we speculate the differences in the IL2 loop of PKR1 and PKR2 may contribute to the variation in function. To test this hypothesis, we first replaced the Lys-175 (the third B) of PKR1 with asparagine (e.g. K175N), which resulted in ∼2-fold reduction in the signaling capacity of PKR1 (Table 1). Conversely, substitution of the Asn-166 of PKR2, at the corresponding position of the third B, to lysine (N166K) increased PKR2 function ∼2 times (Table 1).TABLE 1The signaling parameters of PKR1, PKR2, and their mutantsReceptorsEC50Maximal responseaThe maximal responses of WT PKR1 or PKR2 was set to 100.nmPKR1WT8.29 ± 1.25100R173Q16.40 ± 1.7971.53 ± 8.59K175N14.66 ± 1.28100 ± 9.59R171Q/R173Q19.26 ± 1.4446.57 ± 3.43R173Q/K175NNDbND, not detectable.NDPKR2WT15.85 ± 1.45100H159Q39.09 ± 1.2793.23 ± 6.34R162Q12.1 ± 1.4550.25 ± 3.71R164QNDNDN166K8.28 ± 1.2790.69 ± 4.62a The maximal responses of WT PKR1 or PKR2 was set to 100.b ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab We then replaced the Arg-173 of PKR1, equivalent to Arg-164 in PKR2, with glutamine (R173Q) and measured its activity with the aequorin-based calcium assay. As shown in Fig. 5B, however, R173Q-PKR1 retained the signaling capacity, albeit the potency and efficacy were reduced. We thus speculate that the first and/or the third basic amino acids in the BXBXB motif may function cooperatively with the second basic amino acid. We therefore further made double mutations of PKR1: R171Q/R173Q and R173Q/K175N. As shown in the Fig. 5B and Table 1, both double mutations dramatically reduced the PKR1 signaling capacity, and the R173Q/K175N mutation (mimicking the R164Q mutation of PKR2) totally disrupted the signaling. To further explore the contribution of basic amino acids in the IL2 loop to the function of PKRs, we made H159Q and K162Q mutant PKR2s. As shown in Fig. 5C and Table 1, K162Q-PKR2 showed significant signaling reduction, although it is not as severe as R164Q mutant. On the other hand, H159Q-PKR2 only showed subtle reduction in the signaling capacity as compared with WT receptor. Consistent with this functional results, GST pulldown analysis indicated that H159Q mutant PKR2-IL2 was able to pulldown Gαq-protein (Fig. 2A), indicating His-159 is not necessary for the interaction with G-proteins. Interestingly, a recent study also indicated that the equivalent position of His-159 in M3R receptor is not involved in the contact with Gαq-protein. Persistent stimulation of GPCRs often leads to internalization of receptors into the intracellular vesicles (23Sibley D.R. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

And such ligand-induced endocytosis may contribute to the physiological regulation of receptors, such as the desensitization and resensitization (26Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). However, so far little information has been available on the membrane distribution of the PKR2 and their intracellular trafficking. Here, we have taken advantage of the intrinsic fluorescent properties of EGFP, which provides a high signal-to-noise ratio and stoichiometric labeling of the receptor of interest, to investigate internalization and trafficking of PKR2 using EGFP-tagged PKR2 stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Trafficking of the PKR2-EGFP was studied by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Incubation of PKR2-EGFP-transfected HEK293 cells with PK2 resulted in a dramatic redistribution of PKR2-EGFP fluorescence from the plasma membrane to an intracellular compartment, leading to a rapid and extensive decrease in surface PKR2-EGFP and with a multitude of punctate structures appearing in the cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Internalization was detectable within 5 min, and appeared maximal at 30–60 min (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7PKR2-EGFP was internalized after PK2 treatment and restored to the plasma membrane after washout. PK2 (100 nm) was incubated for an indicated period with HEK293 cells stably expressed with PKR2-EGFP, and the location of EGFP was monitored under a confocal microscope. For the washout experiment, PK2 was removed by washing three times with PBS after 60 min of treatment and then incubated in culture medium for indicated time period. Scale bar: 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After removal of PK2 (washout), PKR2-EGFP was again seen on the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). The receptor on the membrane is not likely to be newly synthesized proteins, as we have incubated a protein synthesis inhibitor-cycloheximide during this process. However, R164Q mutant PKR2 failed to undergo endocytosis after PK2 treatment, implying G-protein coupling and signal transduction play a critical role in receptor internalization. As shown in Fig. 8, the R164Q mutant receptors were still on the surface after 30 min treatment with 100 nm PK2, only a small portion of receptors trafficked into the cytoplasm after 60 min of treatment. The interaction of GPCRs with heterotrimeric G-proteins is one of the most important processes for receptor signal transduction. However, in the absence of a crystal structure of a GPCR in complex with a G-protein, the specific sites that comprise the receptor-G-protein interface remain relatively undefined. Nevertheless, mutagenesis studies have identified multiple GPCR regions involved in receptor-G protein interactions. These receptor regions include the TM3-IL2 loop junction, the IL2 loop, the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6, and the C-terminal tail (18Hu J. Wang Y. Zhang X. Lloyd J.R. Li J.H. Karpiak J. Costanzi S. Wess J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The three key regions of Gα that have been implicated by many studies include the N-terminal helix, the α4-β6 loop and the C-terminal portion (17Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Hu J. Wang Y. Zhang X. Lloyd J.R. Li J.H. Karpiak J. Costanzi S. Wess J. Nat. Chem.

In an elegant study, Hu et al. identified many receptor/G-protein contact points using M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R)-Gαq as a model system (18Hu J. Wang Y. Zhang X. Lloyd J.R. Li J.H. Karpiak J. Costanzi S. Wess J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Specifically, they showed that the Leu-173 and Arg-176 from the IL2 loop of M3R directly contact with the C-terminal residues of Gαq protein. In this report, we identified the Arg-164 of PKR2, equivalent to the Arg-176 of M3R, contacts directly with Gα-proteins, probably the C-terminal 5 amino acids. As R164Q mutation affects receptor interaction with various Gα-proteins, the determinants for coupling selectivity may be located in other regions. The IL2 loop of class A GPCRs can be roughly divided into three portions: the N terminus with a highly conserved (E/D)RY motif; the central portion and the C-terminal motif enriched in basic amino acids. The roles of N-terminal E/DRY motif have been extensively studied in many GPCRs (30Rovati G.E. Capra V. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Of these three residues, tyrosine (Y) is least conserved and considered not important for receptor function. The aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) is conserved, which may regulate receptor activation and G-protein coupling. The arginine (R) is one of the most conserved residues in rhodopsin-like GPCRs, and it is essential for forming intramolecular interactions that constrain receptors in either the inactive or activated conformation, depending on the receptor types (30Rovati G.E. Capra V. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For instance, the arginine side chain of rhodopsin receptor forms salt bridges with the preceding aspartic acid side chain and with a glutamic acid side chain in TM 6, and constrain the receptor in an inactive state (31Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar). The central portion of IL2 loop contains a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (I, L, V, M, or F) at the position 10 in most GPCRs. Moro et al. (32Moro O. Lameh J. Högger P. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified this hydrophobic amino acid is important for the G-protein coupling using alanine mutagenesis scanning. In a seminar report, Wacker et al. analyzed a disease-causing mutation, L148S of GPR54, and demonstrated that L148S does not hinder the association of Gα subunits with GPR54 or its IL2 loop. Instead, L148S impairs the ligand-induced catalytic activation of Gα-protein. Thus, they proposed that Leu-148, or equivalent residue in other type A GPCRs, may stabilize the switch II region of Gα-protein upon ligand stimulation to establish a productive egress route for GDP (33Wacker J.L. Feller D.B. Tang X.B. Defino M.C. Namkung Y. Lyssand J.S. Mhyre A.J. Tan X. Jensen J.B. Hague C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31068-31078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The role of C-terminal basic amino acids-enriched motif is relatively less investigated. Xie et al. (34Xie W. Jiang H. Wu Y. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24948-24951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) identified two basic amino acids (K158/R159) at this location of interleukin-8 receptor are necessary for Gα16 but not Gαi-coupling. However, they showed only one of either basic residue is sufficient for Gα16-coupling (34Xie W. Jiang H. Wu Y. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24948-24951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Iida-Klein et al. demonstrated that a lysine in the C-terminal IL2 of the PTH/PTH-related protein receptor is a key determinant for Gαq-selective coupling. Mutation in this region can selectively abolish the Gαq-coupling of PTH/PTH-related protein receptor but retain the Gαs-coupling capacity (35Iida-Klein A. Guo J. Takemura M. Drake M.T. Potts Jr., J.T. Abou-Samra A. Bringhurst F.R. Segre G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6882-6889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, Saito et al. demonstrated a basic amino acid (Arg-155) in the IL2 of MCHR1 plays a critical role in the G-protein coupling and activation but not selectivity, as both Gαq and Gαi-coupled pathway are disrupted by R155Q mutation (36Saito Y. Tetsuka M. Saito S. Imai K. Yoshikawa A. Doi H. Maruyama K. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3452-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we used GST pulldown assay demonstrating that the Arg-164 in the IL2 of PKR2 is a critical contact point for Gα proteins. Importantly, we identified the C-terminal five amino acids of Gαq were involved in the interaction with IL2 of receptors. Previous reports showed that multiple substitution of the basic amino acids are required to abolish the receptor function (34Xie W. Jiang H. Wu Y. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24948-24951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Saito Y. Tetsuka M. Saito S. Imai K. Yoshikawa A. Doi H. Maruyama K. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3452-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, replacement of Arg-164 alone in PKR2 with amino acids other than positive-charged ones was able to disrupt the receptor function. Nevertheless, studies on the closely related PKR1 indicated that the equivalent Arg-173 does function cooperatively with surrounding basic amino acids. In contrast to Arg-155 of MCHR1, where the R155K substitution results in a receptor with similar signaling property as R155Q mutation (36Saito Y. Tetsuka M. Saito S. Imai K. Yoshikawa A. Doi H. Maruyama K. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3452-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); substitution of Arg-164 of PKR2 with positive-charged (K and H), but not other (Q, E, A, and T) residues apparently restored the receptor activity, suggesting the positive charges at this position is required for receptor function. Interestingly, the net amount of positive charges at this position is required for a full signaling efficacy and potency. Our data also implied that variation in this basic amino acids-enriched motif may be one of the underlying causes for the signaling difference between PKR1 and PKR2. The receptor-mediated endocytosis is an important cellular process in the regulation of receptor signaling, such as down-regulation and desensitization/resensitization. Depending on the particular receptor and cell background, desensitization and internalization are generally followed by resensitization and receptor recycling to the plasma membrane (26Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Cheng et al. (37Cheng M.Y. Bullock C.M. Li C. Lee A.G. Bermak J.C. Belluzzi J. Weaver D.R. Leslie F.M. Zhou Q.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) report that persistent infusion of PK2 intracerebroventricularly seems to desensitize the receptors in vivo. In the present study, by using EGFP-tagged receptor, we demonstrated that PKR2 underwent endocytosis upon ligand stimulation within 5 min. After removal of the ligand, PKR2 trafficked back to the plasma membrane. Importantly, the R164Q mutation that disrupted the signal transduction also inhibited the ligand-induced endocytosis, suggesting that receptor activation is a prerequisite for efficient endocytosis. It is intriguing to utilize the EGFP-tagged receptor described here to investigate how the PKR2 trafficking is regulated. In conclusion, we have identified a basic amino acid at the C terminus of IL2 loop in PKR2 is vital for the Gα-protein interaction. Disruption of this receptor/Gα-protein interaction abolished the signal transduction as well as ligand-induced receptor trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt this interaction can manifest as human disease. As many GPCRs have such a basic amino acids-enriched motif at the C terminus of IL2 loop, our data may have general application for understanding the structure of GPCRs and its activation mechanism. The receptor/Gα-protein contact point identified in this report may also be served as an anchoring point for the delineation of structure model of the receptor-G-protein interface.

https://openalex.org/W2035562175,"A-to-I RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional modification event in vertebrates. It could increase transcriptome and proteome diversity through recoding the genomic information and cross-linking other regulatory events, such as those mediated by alternative splicing, RNAi and microRNA (miRNA). Previous studies indicated that RNA editing can occur in a tissue-specific manner in response to the requirements of the local environment. We set out to systematically detect tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites in 43 human tissues using bioinformatics approaches based on the Fisher's exact test and the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction. Twenty-three sites in total were identified to be tissue-specific. One of them resulted in an altered amino acid residue which may prevent the phosphorylation of PARP-10 and affect its activity. Eight and two tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were predicted to destroy putative exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), respectively. Brain-specific and ovary-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were further verified by comparing the cDNA sequences with their corresponding genomic templates in multiple cell lines from brain, colon, breast, bone marrow, lymph, liver, ovary and kidney tissue. Our findings help to elucidate the role of A-to-I RNA editing in the regulation of tissue-specific development and function, and the approach utilized here can be broadened to study other types of tissue-specific substitution editing."
https://openalex.org/W2030339127,"Two forms of the phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin I distinguished by differences in its photoactive site have been shown to be directly correlated with attractant and repellent signaling by the dual-signaling protein. In prior studies, differences in the photoactive site defined the two forms, namely the direction of light-induced proton transfer from the chromophore and the pK(a) of an Asp counterion to the protonated chromophore. Here, we show by both in vivo and in vitro measurements that the two forms are distinct protein conformers with structural similarities to two conformers seen in the light-driven proton transport cycle of the related protein bacteriorhodopsin. Measurements of spontaneous cell motility reversal frequencies, an in vivo measure of histidine kinase activity in the phototaxis system, indicate that the two forms are a photointerconvertible pair, with one conformer activating and the other inhibiting the kinase. Protein conformational changes in these photoconversions monitored by site-directed spin labeling show that opposite structural changes in helix F, distant from the photoactive site, correspond to the opposite phototaxis signals. The results provide the first direct evidence that displacements of helix F are directly correlated with signaling and impact our understanding of the sensory rhodopsin I signaling mechanism and the evolution of diverse functionality in this protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2066485568,"Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are a family of stress-inducible molecular chaperones that play multiple roles in a wide variety of animals. However, the roles of Hsps in parasitic nematodes remain largely unknown. To elucidate the roles of Hsps in the survival and longevity of nematodes, particularly at the 2 most critical stages in their lifecycle, the infective-L3 stage and adult stage, which is subjected to host-derived immunological pressure, we examined the temporal gene transcription patterns of Hsp12.6, Hsp20, Hsp70, and Hsp90 throughout the developmental course of the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR. Nb-Hsp70 and Nb-Hsp90 expression were observed throughout the nematode's lifecycle, while the expression of Nb-Hsp20 was restricted to adults. Interestingly, Nb-Hsp12.6 showed a biphasic temporal expression pattern; i.e., it was expressed in infective-L3 larvae and in adults during worm expulsion from immunocompetent rats. However, the activation of Nb-Hsp12.6 in adult worms was aborted when they infected permissive athymic-rnu/rnu rats and was only marginal when they infected mast-cell-deficient Ws/Ws rats, which exhibited a low response of rat mast cell protease (RMCP) II and resistin-like molecule (Relm)- β expression compared to those observed in immunocompetent rats. Moreover, the activation of Nb-Hsp12.6 was reversed when adult worms were transplanted into the naive rat intestine. These features of Nb-Hsp12.6, the expression of which is not only stage-specific in infective-L3, but is also inducible by mucosal immunity in adults, have implications for the survival strategies of parasitic nematodes in deleterious environmental conditions both outside and inside the host."

Apoptosis in egg extracts is triggered solely by the cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and neither damage-inducing treatment nor death receptor-ligand signaling is required. Therefore, Bcl-2 family proteins are expected to be functionally involved in the apoptosis-initiating process. Apoptosis in egg extracts is carried out without the requirement of transcription and translation, and all of the components required for apoptotic execution are already stockpiled as maternal products. However, in most studies, exogenously added mammalian proteins or peptides have been employed. For this reason, endogenous Bcl-2 family proteins present in Xenopus egg extracts or mitochondria are still poorly characterized. We have been studying the functions and contributions of apoptosis regulators present in Xenopus egg extracts (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Tsuchiya Y. Murai S. Yamashita S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2237-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Tsuchiya Y.

Biol. 2009; 8: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We recently reported the pro-apoptotic activity of endogenous Xenopus Bid (xBid), a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, in egg extracts (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To further extend this finding, here we systematically examined the mRNA expression profiles and molecular functions of 13 Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins. Especially, we demonstrated the physiological anti-apoptotic activity of endogenous Xenopus Mcl-1 (xMcl-1) in egg extracts. Total RNAs from the eggs, intestine, liver, ovary, and stomach of Xenopus female were purified using the acid guanidinium-phenol chloroform method and LiCl precipitation. Reverse transcription from oligo(dT) primer was carried out using ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO). For known Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins, the following GenBankTM entries were used for the design of primers to amplify each open reading frame (ORF): xBcl-B (BC142549), xBcl2L12 (BP676787 and BP686551), xBcl-G (NM_001093988), xBcl-w/xR1 (BC073259), xBcl-xL/xR11 (X82461), xMcl-1 and its N-terminal deletion mutants (BX855270), xBax (AF288809), xBak (BC099018), xBid (AY518731), xBim (BC106460), xBmf (BJ032144), and xNoxa (CF519813). Nucleotide sequences of xBcl-2 (AB427203) and xBok (AB427204) were deposited to DDBJ. The primer sequences used in this study are summarized in the supplemental material. PCR was performed for 35 cycles using ExTaq (TaKaRa) as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s for xBim, and 55 °C for 30 s for the others and 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and nucleotide sequences were verified by Bio Matrix Research Inc. Animal care and use of female frogs was approved by the Animal Research Committee for Animal Experimentation of Toho University.

Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Tsuchiya Y. Murai S. Yamashita S.

Interphase egg extracts were prepared by the addition of 0.4 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide. These extracts were incubated at room temperature (∼23 °C) to induce spontaneous apoptosis. Where indicated, a caspase inhibitor, 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Peptide Institute); a proteasome inhibitor, 100 μm MG-132 (Peptide Institute); a protein kinase inhibitor, 10 μm staurosporine (Sigma); or a protein phosphatase inhibitor, 10 μm okadaic acid (Wako), was added to egg extracts. To produce recombinant N-terminally His6-tagged proteins, ORF fragments were subcloned into pET-15b (Novagen) using appropriate restriction enzymes. We also replaced the fragment of pET-15b encoding the His6 tag with that encoding the HA tag. This modified vector, named pHA, was used for the expression of recombinant N-terminally HA-tagged proteins. To produce synthetic mRNAs for recombinant N-terminally HA-tagged proteins, the pHA-derived expression vectors described as above were used as templates, and the fragments encompassing the T7 promoter and HA-tagged ORFs were amplified by PCR using the following primers: pET-Transcript-F (5′-CGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and pET-Transcript-R2 (5′-TGTGCTATTTATTATCATGAACATTAACC-3′). Amplified fragments were purified and used as templates for mRNA synthesis using mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion). The concentration of each mRNA was adjusted to 1 μg/μl in H2O, and 1 μl of mRNA solution was mixed with 9 μl of CSF-arrested egg extracts. These egg extracts were incubated for 3 or 6 h in the absence or presence of Z-VAD-fmk to translate recombinant proteins. For subcellular fractionation in Fig. 4, 10 μl of egg extracts containing synthetic mRNA was incubated for 3 h in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, diluted with 90 μl of CSF-XB (10 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sucrose), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The precipitated fractions containing mitochondria were washed with 100 μl of CSF-XB and centrifuged again. Soluble fractions were pooled (∼190 μl) and precipitated with 800 μl of ice acetone. Both fractions were dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer and subjected to Western blot. 35S-Radiolabeled recombinant N-terminally His6-tagged proteins were produced using TNT T7 Quick rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL; Promega). RRL were mixed with interphase extracts containing cycloheximide at 1:9 as described previously (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 33Tsuchiya Y. Murai S. Yamashita S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2237-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36Tsuchiya Y.

Recombinant His6-xMcl-1 N-terminal fragment (residues 1–174) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from the inclusion body fraction, refolded in PBS containing 0.1% SDS, and used for rabbit immunization by Operon Biotechnologies. The same antigen was immobilized on a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare) and used for the affinity purification of antibody. Affinity-purified anti-xBid and anti-xXIAP antibodies were prepared as described previously (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Each antibody was covalently linked to Affi-Prep Protein A beads (Bio-Rad) at 2 mg antibody/ml of beads using dimethylpimelimidate. For the immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiment in Fig. 5A, 250 μl of egg extracts was used per μl of beads. For immunodepletion experiments in FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, 10 μl of egg extracts was used per μl of beads. Monoclonal antibodies against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), HA tag (clone 6E2), and cytochrome c were purchased from BD Transduction, Cell Signaling Technology, and Lab Vision, respectively. Polyclonal antibody against actin was purchased from Sigma. Western blot was carried out as described previously (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, partial or complete nucleotide sequences of 10 Bcl-2 family proteins (xBcl-2, xBcl-B, xBcl-G, xBcl2L12, xBcl2L13, xMcl-1, xBak, xBim, xBmf, and xNoxa) were deposited in the Xenopus nucleotide database, but the functions of their protein products remained uncharacterized (42Coultas L.

Among these, xBcl2L13 was excluded from our study because the complete ORF of xBcl2L13 could not be determined due to limited sequence information. xBcl2L12 was also excluded because the putative ORF of xBcl2L12 showed only weak homology with chicken homolog and lacked the key signature motifs of Bcl2L12 (proline-rich region and C-terminal BH2 domain). Therefore, we aimed to characterize these 13 Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins. First, RT-PCR analyses were carried out to examine the expression profiles of mRNAs encoding Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins. We used oligo(dT) primer to specifically synthesize cDNAs from poly(A)-containing mRNAs, and each primer pair was designed to amplify the fragment containing deduced ORF (supplemental material). Our RT-PCR successfully amplified the corresponding fragments of all members (Fig. 1A). Most of the members showed ubiquitous mRNA expression. However, xBcl-2 was not expressed in egg and ovary, and xBcl-B was not expressed in egg. In contrast, xBmf was not expressed in the liver and stomach. A single fragment was amplified for each of the members except xBim, suggesting the absence of splice variants. In the case of xBim, our RT-PCR amplified three fragments (Fig. 1B). The 0.5-kbp fragment encoded a 166-residue protein with a BH3 motif. The 0.25-kbp fragment encoded an 82-residue protein, which was internally deleted but still contained the BH3 motif. In contrast, the 0.4-kbp fragment encoded a frame-shifted protein of 52 residues lacking the BH3 motif. Analogous to the nomenclature by U et al. (45U M. Miyashita T. Shikama Y. Tadokoro K. Yamada M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we named these proteins as xBimα1, xBimα2, and xBimβ, respectively. Both xBimα1 and xBimα2 mRNAs were strongly expressed in intestine, ovary, and stomach, whereas the expression of xBimβ mRNA was high in egg and ovary (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the apoptosis-regulating activities of recombinant Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins in egg extracts. Each synthetic mRNA was added to CSF-arrested egg extracts to synthesize the corresponding recombinant N-terminally HA-tagged protein by the endogenous translation system. To confirm the correct expression of recombinant proteins, we first carried out the experiment in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (a pancaspase inhibitor) to block apoptotic execution, followed by Western blot with the antibody against HA tag. For all members except xBimβ, recombinant proteins of the expected electrophoretic mobility were translated, but their expression levels were variable (Fig. 2, αHA). In contrast, xBimβ was not expressed in this experimental system. We then performed the same experiment in the absence of Z-VAD-fmk and analyzed the apoptosis-regulating activities of recombinant proteins by monitoring the apoptotic cleavage of endogenous PARP. In the control extract containing no synthetic mRNA, endogenous PARP remained intact after 3 h but was cleaved by caspases after 6 h (Fig. 2, αPARP). Therefore, we determined that the proteins inducing PARP cleavage by 3 h were strongly pro-apoptotic and that the proteins preventing PARP cleavage until 6 h were strongly anti-apoptotic. Our results indicated that four proteins (xBcl-B, xBcl-w/xR1, xBcl-xL/xR11, and xMcl-1) were strongly anti-apoptotic. In contrast, five proteins (xBak, xBid, xBimα1, xBimα2, and xNoxa) were strongly pro-apoptotic. Two proteins (xBcl-G and xBax) slightly accelerated PARP cleavage after 3 h and were defined as weakly pro-apoptotic. Four proteins (xBcl-2, xBok, xBimβ, and xBmf) showed no effect in our experimental system. We next carried out subcellular fractionation analysis to examine the distribution of Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins in egg extracts. The mitochondrial fraction is commonly separated from cytosol and microsomal membrane by low speed centrifugal precipitation (5,000–10,000 × g for 10 min). However, the density of egg extracts is so high that the mitochondrial fraction does not precipitate under this condition. Therefore, the egg extracts containing recombinant N-terminally HA-tagged proteins described as above were first diluted 10-fold with buffer to reduce the density. Diluted extracts were then centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min) to separate supernatant fraction containing cytosol and microsomal membrane (Fig. 3, Sup) from precipitated fraction containing mitochondria (Fig. 3, Ppt), and the fractions were analyzed by Western blot with the antibody against HA tag. Nine proteins (xBcl-2, xBcl-B, xBcl-G, xBcl-w/xR1, xBid, xBimα1, xBimα2, xBmf, and xNoxa) were detected mainly in the supernatant fraction. In contrast, three proteins (xBcl-xL/xR11, xBak, and xBok) were detected only in the precipitated fraction. Two proteins (xMcl-1 and xBax) were present in both supernatant and precipitated fractions. Actin and cytochrome c were recovered in supernatant and precipitated fractions, respectively, thereby validating our subcellular fractionation procedure. These results suggest that Xenopus Bcl-2 family proteins show different subcellular distributions in egg extracts. Apoptosis in egg extracts is carried out without the requirement of new protein synthesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that apoptosis may be triggered by the irreversible changes of existing molecules, such as 1) activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and 2) inactivation of anti-apoptotic proteins. To examine these possibilities, we tested the behaviors of exogenously added, recombinant N-terminally His6-tagged proteins during incubation in interphase egg extracts. When translated in RRL, 12 proteins (xBcl-2, xBcl-G, xBcl-w/xR1, xBcl-xL/xR11, xMcl-1, xBax, xBak, xBok, xBid, xBimα1, xBimα2, and xBmf) were successfully 35S-radiolabeled, whereas the signals of three proteins (xBcl-B, xBimβ, and xNoxa) could not be detected due to poor expression. Each of the above 12 proteins was mixed with egg extracts and incubated for up to 6 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, four proteins (xMcl-1, xBid, xBimα2, and xBmf) of 12 showed significant changes during incubation. As we previously reported (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), recombinant xBid was gradually ubiquitylated and then cleaved by caspases after 4 h in egg extracts, and this change was prevented by Z-VAD-fmk but not by MG-132 (Fig. 4, 6XHis-xBid). In addition, the gradual decreases of recombinant xMcl-1 and xBimα2 were blocked by MG-132 but not by Z-VAD-fmk, suggesting the proteasome-mediated degradation of both proteins in egg extracts (Fig. 4, 6XHis-xMcl-1 and 6XHis-xBimα2). Recombinant xBmf was also unstable in egg extracts, but neither Z-VAD-fmk nor MG-132 blocked its degradation (Fig. 4, 6XHis-xBmf). Although MG-132 blocked the degradation of at least two Bcl-2 family proteins (xMcl-1 and xBimα2), it showed little overall effect on the timing of apoptosis execution in egg extracts (supplemental Fig. S1), as we reported previously (33Tsuchiya Y. Murai S. Yamashita S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2237-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We already characterized endogenous xBid as a physiological accelerator of apoptosis in egg extracts (17Saitoh T. Tsuchiya Y. Kinoshita T. Itoh M. Yamashita S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 384: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is generally believed tha"
