However, the underlying mechanisms and location for generating such innate memory responses in vivo remain unknown. Here, we show that access of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) to the bone marrow (BM) changes the transcriptional landscape of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), leading to local cell expansion and enhanced myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis. Importantly, BCG-educated HSCs generate epigenetically modified macrophages that provide significantly better protection against virulent M. tuberculosis infection than naïve macrophages. By using parabiotic and chimeric mice, as well as adoptive transfer approaches, we demonstrate that training of the monocyte/macrophage lineage via BCG-induced HSC reprogramming is sustainable in vivo. Our results indicate that targeting the HSC compartment provides a novel approach for vaccine development.

Our results indicate that targeting the HSC compartment provides a novel approach for vaccine development. The essential role of innate immunity in elimination of pathogens is reflected by its remarkable existence and diversity at every level of the evolutionary tree of life. Indeed, plants and invertebrates rely solely on their innate immune system to eliminate infectious agents (Netea et al., 2016Netea M.G. Joosten L.A.B. Latz E. Mills K.H.G. Natoli G. Stunnenberg H.G.

Similarly, innate immunity in vertebrates is often sufficient to eradicate many pathogens. One of the ancient cellular compartments of innate immunity with profound capacity to both recognize and destroy microorganisms is the mononuclear phagocyte system. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evolved multiple strategies to subvert or subdue the innate immune mechanisms to bypass its early elimination. Although we and others have previously shown the critical role of macrophages in protective immunity to Mtb infection (Behar et al., 2010Behar S.M. Divangahi M. Remold H.G.

Behr M.A. Cracking the Vaccine Code in Tuberculosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2017; Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Innate immune cells have classically been thought to lack immunological memory. However, recent studies have challenged this dogma by demonstrating that innate immune cells can also develop enhanced resistance upon reinfection with the same or an unrelated pathogen, a phenomenon known as trained immunity (Netea et al., 2016Netea M.G. Joosten L.A.B. Latz E. Mills K.H.G. Natoli G. Stunnenberg H.G. O’Neill L.A.J. Xavier R.J.

This response is considered to be independent of adaptive immunity and driven by epigenetic modifications that influence gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J.

Fil. 1978; 172: 902-904PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the nature of monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mac) differentiation, as well as their relatively short lifespan, it is unknown how these cells transmit their memory phenotype to their progeny and provide sustained protection. Thus, vaccine strategies targeting Mo/Macs have limited efficacy for generating long-term innate immune memory. In contrast to Mo/Macs, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are long-lived cells that mainly reside in the bone marrow (BM). HSCs are self-renewing and able to generate multipotent and lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to all cells of the mammalian blood system (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Klimmeck D. Hansson J. Lipka D.B. Reyes A. Wang Q. Weichenhan D. Lier A. von Paleske L.

While the rapid adaptation of HSCs to hematopoietic stress is well documented (Manz and Boettcher, 2014Manz M.G. Boettcher S. Emergency granulopoiesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), our understanding of the consequences of vaccination or inflammatory signals on HSCs is extremely limited. Although the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of HSC granulopoiesis, monocytopoiesis, or lymphopoiesis are unknown, several studies indicate that sensing pathogens through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (e.g., Toll-like receptors [TLRs] and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptors) and signaling through cytokines (e.g., types I and II interferon [IFN]) or growth factors (e.g., granulocyte-colony-stimulating factors [G-CSFs] and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factors [GM-CSFs]) dictate a specific bias in HSCs via the assembly of unique sets of transcriptional networks (King and Goodell, 2011King K.Y. Goodell M.A. Inflammatory modulation of HSCs: viewing the HSC as a foundation for the immune response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). For instance, the transcription factors (TFs) interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) or CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPβ) have been associated with myelopoiesis (Wang et al., 2001Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. C/EBPalpha arrests cell proliferation through direct inhibition of Cdk2 and Cdk4.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), while the expression of the TFs paired box-5 (Pax5) or the interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) tend to promote lymphopoeisis (Lu, 2008Lu R. Interferon regulatory factor 4 and 8 in B-cell development.Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 487-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been shown to be efficacious in protecting against Mtb in early childhood and, more interestingly, at decreasing overall morbidity and mortality to other infectious diseases, suggesting that the protective mechanism of BCG is not limited to only tuberculosis (TB) (Garly et al., 2003Garly M.-L.

Given the level of cross-protection provided by BCG and the fact that BCG can be used to train Mo/Macs ex vivo (Cheng et al., 2014Cheng S.-C. Quintin J. Cramer R.A. Shepardson K.M. Saeed S. Kumar V. Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J. Martens J.H.A. Rao N.A.

Here, we show that access of BCG to the BM has a profound effect on the transcriptomic landscape of HSCs and MPPs and enhances myelopoiesis. These changes drive the hematopoietic system to generate “trained” Mo/Macs with a unique transcriptomic/epigenomic signature that is associated with long-term innate immune protection against Mtb infection. We vaccinated wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) mice intravenously (iv) or subcutaneously (sc) with BCG-TICE strain, the clinical vaccine strain used in North America. After BCG-iv vaccination, BCG reached the BM, where it was detected up to 7 months post vaccination (Figure 1A ). The number of BCGs in the BM directly correlated with the expansion of the HSC progenitor lineage− c-Kit+ Sca-1+ (LKS+) population (Figure 1B). In contrast, BCG-sc vaccinated mice rarely led to detectable levels of bacteria in their BM and failed to increase the number of LKS+ cells. We next used image stream analysis to investigate whether BCG directly infects HSCs. Consistent with previous reports (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C. Goodell M.A. Quiescent haematopoietic stem cells are activated by IFN-γ in response to chronic infection.Nature. 2010; 465: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Kolb-Mäurer et al., 2002Kolb-Mäurer A. Wilhelm M. Weissinger F. Bröcker E.-B. Goebel W. Interaction of human hematopoietic stem cells with bacterial pathogens.Blood. 2002; 100: 3703-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we found that BCG was unable to infect HSCs either in vitro or in vivo, whereas BCG-infected Mo/Mac lineage cells were readily observed (Figures 1C–1E). Thus, the expansion of the LKS+ population is not a consequence of direct infection with BCG. Since the peak of the LKS response occurred at 4 weeks post BCG-iv vaccination (Figure 1B), we next characterized hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells at this time point. Specifically, we measured the proportions of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs; LKS+CD150+CD48−), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs; LKS+CD150+CD48+), and multipotent progenitors (MPPs; LKS+CD150−CD48+) (Figures 1F–1I and S1). A significant increase of both ST-HSCs and MPPs was observed in BCG-iv vaccinated mice as compared with BCG-sc vaccinated mice or control (PBS-iv) mice (up to a 20-fold increase; Figure 1I). Kinetic analysis of the BM-LKS+ population showed that the increased LKS population in BCG-iv vaccinated mice was largely due to an increase in ST-HSCs and MPPs (Figures 1J–1M). Collectively, these data indicate that infection of the BM by BCG induces HSC expansion in trans and promotes their expansion and differentiation. To understand the impact of BCG on LKS population, we next performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on HSCs (LKS+CD150+) and MPPs (LKS+CD150−) isolated from the BM of BCG-iv vaccinated or control (PBS-iv) WT mice (Figures 2 and S2 and Table S1). The first principal component (PC1) of the resulting gene expression data accounted for 35.4% of the variance in our dataset and separated the LKS population from BCG-iv vaccinated mice and control (PBS-iv) mice (Figure 2A; t test, p = 2.5 × 10−7), while PC2 separated HSCs from MPPs (Figure 2A; 28.3% of the overall variance, t test p = 6.5 × 10−5). Accordingly, we found extensive differences in the gene expression levels between BCG-iv vaccinated mice and controls, with 3,914 (30%) and 4,774 (37%) differentially expressed genes in HSCs and MPPs, respectively (see STAR Methods and Table S2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.01). Genes differentially expressed between BCG-iv vaccinated mice and control mice in HSCs were also often differentially expressed in MPPs (Figure 2B; 40.6% overlap, Fisher’s exact test: odds ratio 3.08, p < 2.2 × 10−16), suggesting that the transcriptomic changes observed in HSCs propagated to MPPs. Genes upregulated in both HSCs and MPPs of BCG-iv vaccinated mice were strongly enriched for gene sets involved in DNA replication, cell division and cell cycle (Figure 2C; FDR ≤ 1.1 × 10−10; Table S3), showing that BCG-iv vaccination remarkably increased the proliferative activity of LKS+ cells. Indeed, virtually all key regulators of cell cycle progression (Cdk1 and Cdk4) and other cyclins (Ccng1, Ccnf, Ccne2, Ccne1, Ccnc, and Ccnb1) were strongly upregulated in HSCs and MPPs of BCG-iv vaccinated mice as compared with HSCs and MPPs from control mice (Figure 2D).Figure S2Gating Strategy for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting of HSCs and MPPs Related to Figure 2Show full captionCells were gated in FSC-A against SSC-A and subsequently doublets were excluded using FSC-H/FSC-W and SSC-H/SSC-W.

The LKS+ cells were defined as double positive for c-Kit and Sca-1.

Subsequently, LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs were defined as LKS+CD150+, and MPPs as LKS+CD150-, which were sorted separately and subjected to RNA sequencing. Our data additionally showed that BCG-iv vaccination induced distinct regulatory networks that promoted the polarization of MPPs towards myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis. Indeed, most genes involved in lymphocyte B and T cell differentiation were downregulated in HSCs and MPPs from BCG-iv vaccinated mice (Figure S3A and Table S3). These genes included several critical lymphoid-lineage markers (Lck, Rag1, and Rag2) and lymphoid TFs (Pax5 and Irf4) (Figure 2D). In contrast, myeloid-lineage TFs (e.g., Cebpe, Cebpa, and IRF8) and key cytokine-cytokine receptor pairs necessary for the generation of Mo/Macs (e.g., Csf1r and Csf2rb) were consistently upregulated in LKS+ cells of BCG-iv vaccinated mice, particularly in MPPs (Figure 2D). We next compared our data with results from a previously published RNA-seq dataset on MPPs polarized towards the myeloid (MPP3) and lymphoid (MPP4) lineages (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Klimmeck D. Hansson J. Lipka D.B. Reyes A. Wang Q. Weichenhan D. Lier A. von Paleske L.

We found that MPPs from BCG-iv vaccinated mice more closely resembled the expression profiles of MPP3 (relative to MPPs from PBS control mice, p < 2.2 × 10−16, Figure 2E) and that the changes in gene expression observed between BCG-iv and PBS-iv vaccinated mice were strikingly similar (83% concordance) to those observed between MPP3 and MPP4 (Figure S3B). To translate our transcriptomic results to functional data, we used flow cytometry to quantify the number of MPP3 (LKS+CD150−CD48+CD34+Flt3−) and MPP4 (LKS+CD150−CD48+CD34+Flt3+) in non-vaccinated, BCG-sc vaccinated, or BCG-iv vaccinated mice. In accordance with transcriptomic analyses, MPP3, but not MPP4, was significantly increased in BCG-iv vaccinated mice (Figures 2F–2H). By contrast, there was no difference in these populations between non-vaccinated (PBS) or BCG-sc vaccinated mice. Collectively, these data indicate that access of BCG to the BM induces LKS expansion and promotes their differentiation into progenitors with restricted myeloid-lineage potential. We next used droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Zheng et al., 2017Zheng G.X.Y. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. Ziraldo S.B. Wheeler T.D. McDermott G.P. Zhu J. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar) to ask how individual cells in the BM respond to BCG-iv vaccination. Following extensive quality control and filtering (Figure S4A), a total of 7,350 high-quality LKS+ cell transcriptomes (5,557 derived from PBS-iv control mice and 1,793 derived from BCG-iv vaccinated mice) were analyzed and clustered using Seurat (Satija et al., 2015Satija R. Farrell J.A. Gennert D. Schier A.F. Regev A. Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar). To visualize the different clusters, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Figure 3A ). Based on known canonical markers, as well as genes that were differently expressed between subsets of LKS+ cells (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014Cabezas-Wallscheid N. Klimmeck D. Hansson J.

The MPP3.C3 is characterized by the high expression of several granulocytic markers, including Ctsg, Mpo, and Elane (Figure S4G and Table S4).Figure 3BCG-iv Vaccination Alters the Transcriptional Landscape of All Subpopulations of LKS+ Cells in the BMShow full caption(A) t-SNE plot of the scRNA-seq data collected from PBS-control (5,557 cells) and BCG-iv vaccinated (2 months post vaccination, 1,793 cells) WT mice.

We found extensive differences in gene expression across all six clusters when comparing cells derived from BCG-iv vaccinated mice and controls (Table S4). Cells of the HSC1 cluster were the most responsive to BCG-iv vaccination, with 1.77- to 6.31-fold more differently expressed genes (5,037 DE genes; FDR < 1%) than cells belonging to the other clusters (Figure 3B). Overall, we found strong concordance in the response to BCG iv across cells belonging to the different lineages (average correlation in response r = 0.746; Figure S4H). However, some marked differences were also apparent. For example, genes involved in response to bacteria or cytokines, as well as antigen processing and presentation, were strongly enriched among genes upregulated in MPPs, specifically in MPP3.C2, but to a much lesser extent in HSCs (Figure 3C and Table S5). Like with the patterns observed in the bulk RNA-seq data (Figures 2C and 2D), we found that the key TFs involved in the response to IFNγ (e.g., Stat1 [Figure 3D] or Irf1 [Figure S4I]) were significantly upregulated in the majority of clusters. These results indicate that IFNγ signaling is critical for the priming and expansion of the LKS population. Consistent with this hypothesis and published reports (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C.

Immunol. 2010; 11: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), IFNγ-receptor-deficient (IFNγR−/−) mice failed to expand the BM LKS population following BCG-iv vaccination (Figure 3E). Considering that BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) are critical in immunity to Mtb infection (Pai et al., 2016Pai M. Behr M.A. Dowdy D. Dheda K. Divangahi M. Boehme C.C. Ginsberg A. Swaminathan S. Spigelman M. Getahun H. et al.Tuberculosis.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2: 16076Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the BCG-induced changes at the level of HSCs and MPPs could alter the antimycobacterial properties of Mo/Macs derived from the BM. To do so, we generated BMDMs from the BM of either control (PBS-iv) or 1, 2, and 5 months BCG-iv or BCG-sc vaccinated WT mice. These BMDMs were free of any viable BCG or BCG-derived products (Figures S5A–S5C). BMDMs were then infected with a virulent strain of Mtb (H37Rv; MOI 1), and their protective capacity was assessed after 4 hr, 3 days, and 5 days of infection (Figure 4A ). Macrophages derived from the BM of mice vaccinated with BCG-iv, but not BCG-sc, demonstrated significantly better protection against Mtb challenge (Figures 4B and S5D). To ensure that the protective phenotype of BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated mice did not require continuous exposure of the BM cells to BCG, mice vaccinated with BCG (iv or sc) or control (PBS-iv) were treated with the antimycobacterial drugs isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), which eliminated virtually all bacteria from the BM (Figure S5E). While the frequency of LKS+ cells decreased to the level of non-vaccinated mice (Figure S5F), the protective capacities of BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated and INH-/RIF-treated mice against in vitro infection with Mtb remained completely intact (Figure 4C). These protective effects were dependent on IFNγ signaling, as no protection was afforded in BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated IFNγR−/− mice (Figure 4D).

The number of CFUs was determined at different time points post Mtb infection.(C) 1-month BCG-iv or -sc vaccinated or PBS-injected mice were treated with antimycobacterial drugs (INH and RIF, labeled “+ Abx”) for 1 month or left untreated. BMDMs were infected in vitro with Mtb (H37Rv; MOI 1) (n = 3 per group), and the number of CFUs was determined at different time points after infection.(D) BMDMs were generated from the BM of 1-month non-vaccinated (PBS-iv) or BCG-iv vaccinated C57BL/6J or IFNγR−/− mice and infected with Mtb (H37Rv; MOI 1). The number of CFUs was determined at different time points after infection.(E) Volcano plot showing DR genes. Genes with a positive and a negative interaction term (y axis) show a response to Mtb infection biased towards higher or lower expression levels, respectively, in the infected state in BCG-iv vaccinated mice. Selected genes showing the most extreme changes and belonging to the most enriched GO biological terms are depicted.(F) Four subclasses of DR genes were defined: pattern I genes that were upregulated in response to Mtb infection and showed a weaker response in BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated mice (n = 254), pattern II genes that were upregulated in response to Mtb infection and showed a stronger response in BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated mice (n = 727), pattern III genes that were downregulated in response to Mtb infection but showed a stronger downregulation in BMDMs from BCG-iv vaccinated m"
https://openalex.org/W2783329544,"Long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells in response to microbes, also termed ""trained immunity,"" causes prolonged altered cellular functionality to protect from secondary infections. Here, we investigated whether sterile triggers of inflammation induce trained immunity and thereby influence innate immune responses. Western diet (WD) feeding of Ldlr-/- mice induced systemic inflammation, which was undetectable in serum soon after mice were shifted back to a chow diet (CD). In contrast, myeloid cell responses toward innate stimuli remained broadly augmented. WD-induced transcriptomic and epigenomic reprogramming of myeloid progenitor cells led to increased proliferation and enhanced innate immune responses. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in human monocytes trained with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suggested inflammasome-mediated trained immunity. Consistently, Nlrp3-/-/Ldlr-/- mice lacked WD-induced systemic inflammation, myeloid progenitor proliferation, and reprogramming. Hence, NLRP3 mediates trained immunity following WD and could thereby mediate the potentially deleterious effects of trained immunity in inflammatory diseases."

We thus hypothesized that trained immunity acts via modulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Administration of β-glucan (prototypical trained-immunity-inducing agonist) to mice induced expansion of progenitors of the myeloid lineage, which was associated with elevated signaling by innate immune mediators, such as IL-1β and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and with adaptations in glucose metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis. The trained-immunity-related increase in myelopoiesis resulted in a beneficial response to secondary LPS challenge and protection from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in mice.

Recent studies have shown that certain microbial challenges or vaccines promote a heightened response of myeloid cell populations to a subsequent infection with the same or even different pathogens. This process involves changes in cell transcription and is designated “trained immunity” (Goodridge et al., 2016Goodridge H.S. Ahmed S.S. Curtis N. Kollmann T.R. Levy O. Netea M.G.

However, the long-term effects (up to months) of trained immunity on circulating monocytes are puzzling, as these cells have a relatively short lifespan in the circulation. We have, thus, hypothesized that the adaptive processes induced by trained immunity involve alterations to progenitors of the hematopoietic system, a concept that has not been addressed yet. Hematopoiesis is a hierarchical system, in which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for its maintenance via their differentiation into progressively committed progenitors and mature cells (Trumpp et al., 2010Trumpp A. Essers M. Wilson A. Awakening dormant haematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). HSPCs are able to respond to stress, such as severe infection, systemic inflammation, or iatrogenic myeloablation, by increasing their proliferation rate and hematopoiesis (Trumpp et al., 2010Trumpp A.

Myeloid lineage commitment and differentiation of hematopoietic and myeloid progenitors are orchestrated by myeloid-lineage-specific growth factors (Boettcher and Manz, 2017Boettcher S. Manz M.G.

Cell metabolic pathways have been implicated in the regulation of HSPC function. Aerobic glycolysis promotes the quiescence—and, thus, maintenance—of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) (Simsek et al., 2010Simsek T. Kocabas F. Zheng J. Deberardinis R.J. Mahmoud A.I.

In turn, fatty acid oxidation drives asymmetric division and differentiation (Ito et al., 2012Ito K. Carracedo A. Weiss D. Arai F. Ala U. Avigan D.E. Schafer Z.T. Evans R.M. Suda T. Lee C.-H.

Our present findings support the hypothesis stated earlier that trained immunity acts at the level of hematopoietic progenitors and specifically involves favorable adaptations in myelopoiesis. Indeed, we show that β-glucan administration induced the expansion of HSPCs, which was associated with IL-1β and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) signaling as well as with changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Importantly, these progenitor adaptations, as conferred by trained immunity, promoted a beneficial response to a secondary inflammatory challenge and gave protection from chemotherapy-induced myeloablation. To study the response of the hematopoietic and myeloid progenitor pool to agonists implicated in innate immune training, mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of β-glucan. After 24 hr, β-glucan increased the numbers and frequency of hematopoietic progenitors (LSKs; Lin−cKit+Sca1+) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs; CD48+CD150−LSK) in the bone marrow (BM), as compared to injection of PBS (Figures 1A–1C). No difference was observed in LT-HSCs (CD48−CD150+LSK), while the numbers and frequency of short-term (ST)-HSCs (CD48−CD150−LSK) were decreased (Figures 1A–1C). Cell-cycle analysis in LT-HSCs revealed that β-glucan led to enhanced cell-cycle progression in HSPCs (Figure S1), thus suggesting enhanced differentiation-associated proliferation of LT-HSCs upon β-glucan administration. The β-glucan-induced increase in MPPs was linked to an increase in the frequency of the MPP3 subset (Flt3−CD48+CD150−LSK), which is biased toward the myeloid lineage (Pietras et al., 2015Pietras E.M. Reynaud D. Kang Y.-A. Carlin D. Calero-Nieto F.J. Leavitt A.D. Stuart J.M. Göttgens B. Passegué E.

In contrast, we found no significant difference in the lymphoid-biased MPP4 (Flt3+CD48+CD150−LSK) subset (Pietras et al., 2015Pietras E.M. Reynaud D. Kang Y.-A. Carlin D. Calero-Nieto F.J.

Moreover, β-glucan induced an increase in the frequency of CD41+ LT-HSCs (Figures 1F and 1G), which are considered the myeloid-biased LT-HSC subpopulation (Gekas and Graf, 2013Gekas C. Graf T. CD41 expression marks myeloid-biased adult hematopoietic stem cells and increases with age.Blood. 2013; 121: 4463-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), although the overall absolute numbers of LT-HSCs remained unaltered (Figure 1B).Figure S1Administration of β-Glucan Promotes Cell Proliferation of LT-HSCs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Cell cycle analysis was performed in LT-HSC at 24h after the administration of PBS or β-glucan by staining for Ki67 and DAPI.

Seven days after β-glucan injection, we observed increased LSK, MPP, and LT-HSC cell numbers (Figure 2A), with an elevated frequency of myeloid-biased MPP3 cells, a corresponding decrease in the frequency of lymphoid-biased MPP4 cells (Figure 2B), and increased frequency of CD41+LT-HSCs (Figure 2C), as compared to findings with the injection of PBS. Analysis of myeloid progenitors (MyPs; Lin−cKit+Sca1−) at the 7-day time point revealed that β-glucan resulted in enhanced granulocyte macrophage progenitor (GMP; Lin−c-Kit+Sca1−CD16/32+CD34+) numbers and in an increased proportion of GMPs within the MyP population, accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the relative abundance of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs; Lin−c-Kit+Sca1−CD16/32−CD34+), as compared to control mice (Figures 2D–2F). Innate immune training has a long-term adaptive effect on myeloid cells (Netea et al., 2016Netea M.G. Joosten L.A.B. Latz E. Mills K.H.G. Natoli G. Stunnenberg H.G. O’Neill L.A.J. Xavier R.J. Trained immunity: A program of innate immune memory in health and disease.Science. 2016; 352: aaf1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the effects of β-glucan on hematopoiesis were sustained over a longer period. Although, 28 days after administration of β-glucan, the numbers of LSKs and LT-HSCs were not affected (Figure 2G), β-glucan induced a significant decrease in the frequency of lymphoid-biased MPP4 cells (Figure 2H) without altering the frequency of MPP3 cells (data not shown). In addition, a significant increase in the numbers of GMPs was observed (Figure 2I). To expand on these findings, we tested the β-glucan-induced effects on HSPCs through a transplantation experiment using the CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic system (Figure 2J). To this end, LT-HSCs were isolated from mice at 28 days after β-glucan or PBS administration and transferred to lethally irradiated recipient mice. Lineage output of donor-derived cells was studied 12 weeks post-transplantation. Peripheral blood analysis demonstrated that LT-HSCs from β-glucan-injected mice gave rise to an increased proportion of Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid cells with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of CD19+ B cells, as compared to LT-HSCs transplanted from PBS-treated mice (Figure 2K). No difference was observed in peripheral chimerism between LT-HSCs from PBS and β-glucan-injected mice, suggesting that the altered lineage output of the cells from the β-glucan group was not due to differences in reconstitution potential (Figure S2). Together, β-glucan induces a sustained increase in myelopoiesis. To dissect the effects of β-glucan, LT-HSCs isolated from mice 24 hr after β-glucan injection were analyzed by single-cell qPCR in terms of expression of genes linked to HSC maintenance, cell cycle, and differentiation. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that LT-HSCs clustered in three subpopulations, in accordance to previously published data (Yang et al., 2017Yang J. Tanaka Y. Seay M. Li Z. Jin J. Garmire L.X. Zhu X. Taylor A. Li W. Euskirchen G. et al.Single cell transcriptomics reveals unanticipated features of early hematopoietic precursors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 1281-1296PubMed Google Scholar). Relative to LT-HSCs from PBS-treated mice, LT-HSCs from β-glucan-treated mice showed higher association with a subpopulation (cluster #2; Figures 3A and 3B ) that displayed an activated cell-cycle program, as indicated by enhanced expression of Mki67; the S/G2/M cyclins Ccna2, Ccnb2, and Cdc20; and the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk6 (Passegué et al., 2005Passegué E.

Moreover, cluster #2 showed increased expression of Itga2b (Cd41), which identifies myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (Gekas and Graf, 2013Gekas C. Graf T. CD41 expression marks myeloid-biased adult hematopoietic stem cells and increases with age.Blood. 2013; 121: 4463-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and of the differentiation markers Cd34 and Cd48 (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A.

Med. 2009; 206: 2987-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Figures 3A–3C). We next sorted CD41− and CD41+ LT-HSCs isolated from mice 24 hr after β-glucan or PBS injection and performed single-cell qPCR analysis. We found that the expression of the cell-cycle-associated genes Cdc20, Ccnb2, and Cdkn2d; of the TFs Meis1, Gata1, Gfi1b, and Gata2; and of the differentiation markers Itga2b, Cd34, and Cd48 was enhanced in CD41+ LT-HSCs (but not in CD41− LT-HSCs) from β-glucan-treated mice, as compared to CD41+ LT-HSCs from PBS control-treated mice (Figures 3D and 3E). These data suggest that β-glucan acts predominantly on myeloid-biased CD41+ LT-HSCs. We next continued to test whether training with β-glucan could improve the response of hematopoietic progenitors to a secondary stimulus that induces emergency myelopoiesis. LPS-mediated systemic inflammation induces hematopoietic progenitor expansion, which facilitates the restoration of BM cellularity and compensates for the increased need for mature myeloid cells (Mitroulis et al., 2017Mitroulis I.

Therefore, mice were injected with a single dose of LPS 28 days after β-glucan or PBS administration, and BM analysis was performed after another 24 hr. Priming with β-glucan resulted in a more favorable response to the secondary LPS challenge 28 days later, as shown by more pronounced expansion of the LSK and MPP pools (Figures 4A–4C). Administration of LPS induces DNA damage in HSPCs due to replication stress, thereby leading to their functional decline (Takizawa et al., 2017Takizawa H. Fritsch K. Kovtonyuk L.V. Saito Y. Yakkala C. Jacobs K. Ahuja A.K. Lopes M. Hausmann A.

To address whether priming with β-glucan protects against replication stress induced by the secondary LPS challenge, we stained for phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX), a marker of the DNA-damage response. Indeed, the frequency of γ-H2AX+ LT-HSCs at 24 hr after the secondary LPS challenge was significantly decreased in mice trained with β-glucan, as compared to mice that received PBS (Figure 4D). No difference in the frequency of γ-H2AX+ LT-HSCs was observed prior to the secondary LPS challenge in mice treated with β-glucan or PBS at 28 days after treatment (Figure 4D). Thus, β-glucan pre-treatment mediated a long-term protective response that mitigated DNA damage in LT-HSCs induced by the secondary acute LPS challenge 28 days after initial β-glucan administration. We subsequently studied the effects of β-glucan on the recovery of hematopoiesis in two models of chemotherapy-induced myeloablation (Trumpp et al., 2010Trumpp A. Essers M. Wilson A.

Upon repeated rounds of cyclophosphamide administration, we observed that training with β-glucan resulted in increased numbers of white blood cells and, especially, Gr1+CD11b+ granulocytes in peripheral blood on day 4 after each cyclophosphamide round (Figures 4E–4G). Additionally, we used a 5-fluoracil (5-FU) suicide assay to study whether β-glucan can promote host survival upon cytotoxic stress (Figure 4H). Notably, β-glucan significantly enhanced mouse survival to repeated rounds of 5-FU administration (Figure 4I), suggesting that β-glucan improved chemoresistance of HSPCs. Moreover, training with β-glucan 7 days before administration of a single dose of 5-FU improved the recovery of neutrophil numbers in the circulation (Figure 4J). Furthermore, we found a decrease in the frequency of γ-H2AX+ LT-HSCs at day 14 after a single dose of 5-FU in mice that were pre-treated with β-glucan (Figure 4K). Together, β-glucan-induced trained immunity in mice mediates a protective hematopoiesis response to a secondary challenge represented by myeloablative chemotherapy. We next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of LT-HSCs from mice on day 7 after β-glucan or PBS administration. We identified 1,683 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate [FDR = 0.05]) in cells from the β-glucan-injected group, compared to those from PBS-treated mice (Figure 5A). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated that pathways involved in innate immune function and pathways of cell metabolism, including glycolysis, cholesterol biosynthesis, and especially the mevalonate pathway, were overrepresented in the upregulated genes (Figure 5B). In contrast, pathways involved in lymphocyte development and function were overrepresented in the downregulated genes (Figure 5B). Upregulation of myeloid lineage markers, including Csf2rb, Elane, and Mpo, and downregulation of lymphoid lineage markers, such as Ms4a1, Il7r, Il2ra, Vpreb1, and Rag1, were also observed in LT-HSCs of β-glucan-treated mice (Figure 5C). Consistently, TFs promoting myelopoiesis (Cebpe, Id1, and Id2) were upregulated in LT-HSCs from β-glucan-treated mice, while lymphopoiesis-related TFs (Pax5, Ebf1, Irf4, Spib, and Lef1) were downregulated (Nimmo et al., 2015Nimmo R.A.

To evaluate how breeding changed the tomato fruit metabolome, we have generated and analyzed a dataset encompassing genomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes from hundreds of tomato genotypes. The combined results illustrate how breeding globally altered fruit metabolite content. Selection for alleles of genes associated with larger fruits altered metabolite profiles as a consequence of linkage with nearby genes. Selection of five major loci reduced the accumulation of anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids in ripened fruits, rendering the fruit more edible. Breeding for pink tomatoes modified the content of over 100 metabolites. The introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives in cultivars also resulted in major and unexpected metabolic changes. The study reveals a multi-omics view of the metabolic breeding history of tomato, as well as provides insights into metabolome-assisted breeding and plant biology."
https://openalex.org/W2782649526,"Innate immune cells can develop long-term memory after stimulation by microbial products during infections or vaccinations. Here, we report that metabolic signals can induce trained immunity. Pharmacological and genetic experiments reveal that activation of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, but not the synthesis of cholesterol itself, is essential for training of myeloid cells. Rather, the metabolite mevalonate is the mediator of training via activation of IGF1-R and mTOR and subsequent histone modifications in inflammatory pathways. Statins, which block mevalonate generation, prevent trained immunity induction. Furthermore, monocytes of patients with hyper immunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS), who are mevalonate kinase deficient and accumulate mevalonate, have a constitutive trained immunity phenotype at both immunological and epigenetic levels, which could explain the attacks of sterile inflammation that these patients experience. Unraveling the role of mevalonate in trained immunity contributes to our understanding of the pathophysiology of HIDS and identifies novel therapeutic targets for clinical conditions with excessive activation of trained immunity."

Taken together, our results point to a trans-synaptic mRNA transport mechanism involving retrovirus-like capsids and extracellular vesicles. Mammalian Activity-Regulated Cytoskeleton-Associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) is pivotal for synapse maturation, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory (Shepherd and Bear, 2011Shepherd J.D. Bear M.F. New views of Arc, a master regulator of synaptic plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Arc is an activity-dependent immediate early gene, and its mRNA is translocated to dendrites via sequences in its 3′ UTR (Dynes and Steward, 2007Dynes J.L. Steward O. Dynamics of bidirectional transport of Arc mRNA in neuronal dendrites.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following plasticity-inducing stimulation, arc mRNA moves into active dendritic spines, where it is translated and regulates trafficking of AMPA receptors by engaging the endocytic machinery (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H. Lyford G. Petralia R.S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Arc/Arg3.1 interacts with the endocytic machinery to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.Neuron. 2006; 52: 445-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Arc is also involved in regulating dendritic spine morphology during plasticity (Peebles et al., 2010Peebles C.L. Yoo J. Thwin M.T. Palop J.J. Noebels J.L. Finkbeiner S. Arc regulates spine morphology and maintains network stability in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 18173-18178Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Arc protein is composed of Group-specific antigen (Gag)-like amino acid sequences typically found in retroviruses such as HIV and in retrotransposons (Campillos et al., 2006Campillos M. Doerks T. Shah P.K. Bork P. Computational characterization of multiple Gag-like human proteins.Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 585-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Beyond its binding to Tarpγ2, an AMPA-receptor binding protein (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang W. Wu J. Ward M.D. Yang S. Chuang Y.A. Xiao M. Li R. Leahy D.J. Worley P.F. Structural basis of arc binding to synaptic proteins: Implications for cognitive disease.Neuron. 2015; 86: 490-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the Gag-like sequences in Arc is unknown. During retroviral replication, Gag proteins multimerize into capsids, which bind and package viral RNA (Chen, 2016Chen B. HIV capsid assembly, mechanism, and structure.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 2539-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Capsids then undergo secondary envelopment by membranes and exit the host cell being competent to infect other cells (Alenquer and Amorim, 2015Alenquer M. Amorim M.J. Exosome biogenesis, regulation, and function in viral infection.Viruses. 2015; 7: 5066-5083Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There is a growing aggregate of evidence that suggests some viruses commandeer host exosomal pathways suggesting a connection between viruses and exosomes (Meckes, 2015Meckes Jr., D.G. Exosomal communication goes viral.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 5200-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as microvesicles have recently emerged as a novel trans-cellular communication strategy in the healthy and diseased brain (Basso and Bonetto, 2016Basso M. Bonetto V. Extracellular vesicles and a novel form of communication in the brain.Front Neurosci. 2016; 10: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For instance, glutamate release by neurons induces oligodendroglial secretion of exosomes, which are taken up and regulate the physiology of recipient neurons (Fruhbeis et al., 2013Fruhbeis C. Frohlich D. Kuo W.P. Amphornrat J. Thilemann S. Saab A.S. Kirchhoff F. Mobius W. Goebbels S. Nave K.A. et al.Neurotransmitter-triggered transfer of exosomes mediates oligodendrocyte-neuron communication.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001604Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). At Drosophila neuromuscular synapses, Wnt signaling is mediated by trans-synaptic transfer of the Wnt, Wingless, via exosomes in vivo (Koles et al., 2012Koles K. Nunnari J. Korkut C. Barria R. Brewer C. Li Y. Leszyk J. Zhang B. Budnik V. Mechanism of evenness interrupted (Evi)-exosome release at synaptic boutons.J. Biol.

Trans-synaptic transmission of vesicular Wnt signals through Evi/Wntless.Cell. 2009; 139: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In mammals, the propagation of neurodegenerative disorders, such as ALS, appears to be partly mediated by the transfer of prion-like proteins across cells via exosomes (Basso and Bonetto, 2016Basso M. Bonetto V. Extracellular vesicles and a novel form of communication in the brain.Front Neurosci. 2016; 10: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In an expression profile of Drosophila cultured cell EVs, we found that one of the most abundant and enriched mRNAs was the Drosophila darc1 (also see Lefebvre et al., 2016Lefebvre F.A. Benoit Bouvrette L.P. Perras L. Blanchet-Cohen A. Garnier D. Rak J. Lécuyer É. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of human and Drosophila extracellular vesicles.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 27680Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), darc1 mRNA and protein were enriched at synaptic boutons of the larval NMJ, and both were transferred from presynaptic boutons to postsynaptic muscles, likely via EVs. Notably, this transfer was dependent on a gypsy retrotransposon-like sequence fragment in the 3′ UTR of darc1. Evocative of retroviral Gags, dArc1 protein physically associated with its own mRNA. In support of this observation, a spliced fragment of the Copia retrotransposon mRNA and protein were also found within EVs. This retroviral-like mechanism of transfer is required for dArc1 function, as blocking the transfer resulted in aberrations in both synapse maturation and activity-dependent plasticity. We propose that in Drosophila, dArc1 influences synaptic plasticity by utilizing a retroviral-like mechanism for transport between synaptic partners. To elucidate the expression profile of Drosophila S2 cell EVs, we collected EV fractions by differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient sedimentation, treated the EV fraction with RNase to digest non-specifically associated extravesicular cytoplasmic RNA and then constructed poly(A)+ libraries for deep sequencing using RNA collected from treated EVs and total cell mRNA. While most mRNAs in the EV fraction (∼96.6% of cellular mRNAs) were equal to or under-represented when compared to total cellular mRNAs, approximately 100 transcripts were enriched in the EV fraction by at least 2-fold. Among the most abundant and enriched mRNAs was darc1 (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1D ). The large enrichment of darc1 in EV preps was confirmed by qPCR (Figure 1C). To determine whether darc1 mRNA was present in vivo at the Drosophila larval NMJ, we conducted fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and double labeled the preparation with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), an antibody that recognizes neuronal membrane antigens in insects (Jan and Jan, 1982Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Antibodies to horseradish peroxidase as specific neuronal markers in Drosophila and in grasshopper embryos.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), to label the presynaptic compartment. darc1 mRNA was present in a punctate pattern both inside presynaptic boutons and muscles, but was particularly enriched at the muscle postsynaptic junctional region, the region of the muscle immediately adjacent to the HRP label (Figure 2A). The FISH signal was largely specific since it was severely reduced in a predicted darc1-null mutant, darc1esm113 (Mattaliano et al., 2007Mattaliano M.D. Montana E.S. Parisky K.M. Littleton J.T.

See also Figure S1. To establish whether dArc1 protein was also observed at these sites, we generated a polyclonal anti-dArc1 antibody and found that dArc1 was also present both pre- and postsynaptically at the NMJ, in a pattern very similar to the RNA localization (Figure 2C). We also generated an independent, cleaner darc1-null mutant via CRIPSR/Cas9, darc1E8, because the darc1esm113 deletion spans into the putative darc2 promoter region (see STAR Methods). In darc1E8/ darc1esm113 and darc1esm113 mutants, there was a similar drastic reduction in dArc1 RNA and protein (Figures 2B and 2D), but residual signal was still observed. The residual signal might correspond to either maternal contribution of darc1 RNA, which is quite large, or to unspecific antibody binding. In support to the former possibility, darc1 RNA could still be detected in extracts from the mutants by PCR, although the amount was very low compared to wild-type (Figure S1C). The anti-dArc1 antibody recognized a band of the expected molecular weight in western blots of body wall muscle protein extracts (Figure 2T) and in immunoprecipitations of dArc1 (Figure S1A). This band was absent in the darc1esm113 and darc1E8/ darc1esm113 mutant, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody (Figures 2T and S1A). However, the antibody also recognized higher-molecular-weight bands (arrow in Figure 2T) that were not altered by the darc1 mutation. This indicates that at least some of the residual signal observed in the mutants might be unspecific. Unlike the specific signal, the residual signal was distributed throughout the muscle and was not concentrated at the NMJ. Thus, darc1 mRNA is enriched in S2 cell EVs, and both darc1 mRNA and dArc1 protein are present at pre- and postsynaptic sites of the NMJ. The open reading frame (ORF) of darc1 is mostly represented by the remnant of a Gypsy-superfamily of transposons (Figure 2U), specifically dArc1 has strong similarities to the GAG region of a Gypsy-like transposon. The presence of darc1 in EVs, together with the observation that darc1 encodes a retroviral Gag-like protein, raised the possibility that the mRNA, similar to retroviral genomic RNA (gRNA), could be transferred across synaptic partners, as we have previously shown for two transmembrane proteins, Evi and Syt4 (Korkut et al., 2009Korkut C. Ataman B. Ramachandran P. Ashley J. Barria R. Gherbesi N. Budnik V.

Regulation of postsynaptic retrograde signaling by presynaptic exosome release.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1039-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we downregulated darc1 exclusively in motorneurons, using the Gal4 driver C380-Gal4 to express UAS-dArc1-RNAi and examined the pre-and postsynaptic levels of dArc1 mRNA via FISH. Expressing dArc1-RNAi in motorneurons resulted in a significant decrease in darc1 FISH signal, not only at presynaptic boutons, but also at the muscle postsynaptic region (Figures 2E, 2F, 2O, and S1B). Given that the C380-Gal4 driver does not express Gal4 in muscles (Budnik et al., 1996Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Regulation of synapse structure and function by the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene dlg.Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and that we have not previously observed transfer of RNAi between NMJ synaptic partners (e.g., Ataman et al., 2006Ataman B. Ashley J. Gorczyca D. Gorczyca M. Mathew D. Wichmann C. Sigrist S.J. Budnik V. Nuclear trafficking of Drosophila Frizzled-2 during synapse development requires the PDZ protein dGRIP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the most parsimonious explanation is that much of the postsynaptic darc1 mRNA is derived from a presynaptic pool, presumably via EVs (see Discussion). Similarly to the FISH results, expressing dArc1-RNAi in motorneurons resulted in a significant decrease in dArc1 protein immunoreactive signal, both in pre- and postsynaptic compartments (Figures 2I, 2J, and 2P). In contrast, expressing dArc1-RNAi with a muscle Gal4 driver, C57-Gal4, did not affect dArc1 RNA nor dArc1 protein levels (Figures 2H, 2L, 2O, and 2P). This raises the possibility that postsynaptic dArc1 RNA is somehow protected from the RNAi machinery (see Discussion). Taken together, the above results suggest that postsynaptic darc1 transcript and/or protein is transported from presynaptic boutons to the postsynaptic compartment in a unidirectional manner. To eliminate the possibility that dArc1 RNAi could, unlike other RNAi species, be transferred from neuron to muscles, we used an approach independent from RNAi to block EV release from presynaptic boutons. We have previously demonstrated that Rab11 is required for the release of exosome-like EVs at the NMJ (Koles et al., 2012Koles K. Nunnari J. Korkut C. Barria R. Brewer C. Li Y. Leszyk J. Zhang B.

Regulation of postsynaptic retrograde signaling by presynaptic exosome release.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1039-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether expressing Rab11 dominant-negative (Rab11-DN) specifically in neurons induced a change in the levels of darc1 RNA or protein in the postsynaptic region. We observed that this manipulation resulted in a highly significant reduction in darc1 RNA and protein in the postsynaptic region (Figures 2G, 2K, 2Q, and 2R). Interestingly, when expressing Rab11DN in neurons, we observed a decrease in dArc1 levels in both the pre- and postsynaptic compartments, suggesting that Rab11 could be required both for the transport and release of dArc1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we calculated the proportion postsynaptic dArc1 levels relative to presynaptic levels (postsynaptic dArc1 levels/presynaptic dArc1 levels). We found that this ratio was significantly decreased upon expressing Rab11DN in neurons (Figure 2S). Together, these data provide additional evidence for the trans-synaptic transfer of darc1 mRNA and/or protein. To further support the above conclusion, we expressed a dArc1 transgene in neurons, in a darc1E8/darc1esm113 mutant background. The transgene was composed of the darc1 ORF, plus the UTR. This resulted in the presence of dArc1, not only in presynaptic boutons, but also at the postsynaptic region (Figure 3A). Interestingly, expressing a dArc1 transgene lacking the 3′ UTR resulted in accumulation of the dArc1 signal in presynaptic terminals, but virtually no signal was observed at the postsynaptic region (Figures 3B and 3I). Notably, the distribution of dArc1 lacking the 3′ UTR was variable, being highly enriched at some synaptic boutons, and less enriched in others (Figure 3C). The quantification of the dArc1 signal in Figure 3I omitted the highly enriched boutons because in order for the quantification to be informative, the fluorescence levels must be in a linear, non-saturating range. Those boutons with very high expression were orders of magnitude brighter, such that the signal became saturated with confocal acquisition parameters that allowed us detect the postsynaptic signal. Notably, expressing the dArc1 construct including the 3′ UTR in the muscles of the null mutant resulted in diffuse distribution of dArc1 signal throughout the muscle, and no postsynaptic enrichment was observed (Figure 3D). Together, the above results provide compelling evidence that dArc1 protein and/or RNA are transferred from synaptic boutons to muscles, and that a normal dArc1 localization at postsynaptic sites depends on such transfer. Yet, an alternative possibility is that alterations in darc1 RNA and/or protein in presynaptic boutons might limit a signaling mechanism that induces darc1 transcription or enrichment of darc1 RNA and/or protein at the postsynaptic compartment. As RNA localization often depends on the RNA 3′ UTR (Berkovits and Mayr, 2015Berkovits B.D. Mayr C. Alternative 3’ UTRs act as scaffolds to regulate membrane protein localization.Nature. 2015; 522: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and as the lack of the darc1 3′ UTR prevented the transfer of darc1, we determined whether expressing darc1 3′UTR alone in neurons was sufficient to allow the transfer. In these experiments darc1-3′UTR was fused to GFP (Figure 2U) and expressed in neurons, and the levels of GFP signal at the postsynaptic compartment was assessed. As a control, we expressed GFP alone. Expressing darc1-3′UTR-GFP (Figure 3E), but not GFP alone (Figures 3H and 3J), resulted in the presence of GFP signal in the muscle. Furthermore, expressing a shorter fragment of the 3′ UTR (A-fragment [Figure 2U]) fused to GFP in motorneurons was also sufficient for the transport of GFP (Figures 3F and 3J). Interestingly, transfer of GFP was also observed when fusing it to a duplication of a darc1 gene fragment (UGR [Figure 2U]) that includes part of the 3′ UTR (Figures 3G and 3J; see below for further analysis of the UGR). Thus, darc1 mRNA can be transferred from neurons to postsynaptic muscles in a manner dependent on its 3′ UTR. Notably, expressing darc1-3′UTR-GFP in neurons in a darc1 mutant background partly but significantly inhibited the transfer of GFP (Figures 3K, 3L, and 3M). The potential implication of this result is explored below. In addition to the presence of retroviral Gag-like sequences (Abrusán et al., 2013Abrusán G. Szilágyi A. Zhang Y. Papp B.

Given that retroviruses are also similar to retrotransposons, which are present throughout the mammalian and fly genomes, we analyzed the S2 deep sequencing data using an algorithm designed to identify transposable elements, which are typically masked by the standard genome browsing algorithms. Strikingly, we found that copia mRNA, a common Drosophila retrotransposon, was highly enriched in S2 EVs (Figure 4A). Closer examination of the sequence reads revealed that the copia RNA sequences present in EVs corresponded to a predicted spliced short copia (copiaS) species consisting primarily of the Gag region (Figure 4B). This is in contrast to the cellular Copia, which has RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads representing the whole transcript (Figure S2). The copiaS isoform appeared to be selectively loaded into EVs as the ratio of copiaS/full-length copia (copiaL) was 12.4/1 in the in the EV fraction, compared to 1.4/1 in the cell. To ascertain whether Copia protein was also present in EVs, we performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the S2 cell EV fraction. Notably, we found that the short Copia protein isoform was enriched in EVs (Figure 4C).Figure S2Full-Length copiaL Transcript Is Found in the Cellular Fraction, Related to Figure 4Show full captionRaw number of RNA-seq reads for cellular Copia showing reads across the entire predicted transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Raw number of RNA-seq reads for cellular Copia showing reads across the entire predicted transcript. Given that both CopiaS protein and copiaS RNA were found in S2 EVs, we also determined whether dArc1 protein, in addition to darc1 mRNA, was similarly enriched in S2 EVs. To determine the relative abundance and enrichment of EV proteins compared to those in the cell, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of EVs compared to total cell proteins. Both dArc1 and dArc2 proteins were highly enriched in EVs compared to cellular proteins (Figure 4C). Interestingly, our mRNA expression analysis did not reveal any enrichment of darc2 mRNA in the EV fraction. The dArc2 ORF has 52.2% identity and 71.6% similarity with the dArc1 ORF but lacks the putative C-terminal zinc finger domain, as well as the long darc1 3′ UTR mRNA sequences present in darc1. The Gag region of retroviruses binds to and packages retroviral gRNA. Thus, the enrichment of both dArc1 protein and mRNA in EVs and their similarity to Gag sequences raised the question as to whether dArc1 protein could bind its own mRNA in vivo. This was addressed by conducting RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments using S2 cell and larval body wall muscle extracts, gel shift assays, and in vitro binding assays. In the RIP experiments, anti-dArc1 was used to immunoprecipitate dArc1 protein and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by qRT-PCR to determine whether darc1 mRNA was present in this fraction. The dArc1 antibody co-immunoprecipitated darc1 mRNA in both S2 cells and body wall muscle preparations (Figures 4D and 4E). In contrast, no co-precipitation of other RNAs, such as 18 s, eEf1a1, and copia was observed (Figure 4E), showing that the binding of dArc1 with its own mRNA has some degree of specificity in vivo. This is consistent with the idea that, like retroviral Gag proteins, dArc1 exists in a complex with its own mRNA in vivo. To further explore the binding of dArc1 to its own transcript in vivo, we expressed darc1-3′UTR-GFP or GFP alone in larval neurons, immunoprecipitated dArc1 from extracts of body wall muscles derived from the above larvae, and tested the precipitate for the presence of GFP mRNA by qRT-PCR. Anti-dArc1 antibodies immunoprecipitated GFP RNA only when GFP was fused to the darc1 3′ UTR, but not when GFP was expressed alone (Figure 4F), in agreement with the model that dArc1 protein binds its own 3′ UTR in vivo. We next tested whether purified dArc1 is capab"

In murine CD8+ T cells activated after Listeria monocytogenes infection, Suv39h1-dependent trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 controls the expression of a set of stem cell-related memory genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a defect in silencing of stem/memory genes selectively in Suv39h1-defective T cell effectors. As a result, Suv39h1-defective CD8+ T cells show sustained survival and increased long-term memory reprogramming capacity. Thus, Suv39h1 plays a critical role in marking chromatin to silence stem/memory genes during CD8+ T effector terminal differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2784170939,"Background Obesity is known to be a major risk factor for diabetes, but the magnitude of risk and variation between blacks and whites are less well documented in populations heavily affected by obesity. Herein we assess rates and risks of incident diabetes in a diverse southern population where obesity is common. Methods A total of 24,000 black and 14,064 white adults aged 40–79 in the Southern Community Cohort Study with no self-reported diabetes at study enrollment during 2002–2009 was followed for up to 10 (median 4.5) years. Incidence rates, odds ratios (OR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI) for medication-treated incident diabetes were determined according to body mass index (BMI) and other characteristics, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, healthy eating and physical activity indices, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results Risk of incident diabetes rose monotonically with increasing BMI, but the trends differed between blacks and whites (pinteraction < .0001). Adjusted ORs (CIs) for diabetes among those with BMI≥40 vs 20–25 kg/m2 were 11.9 (8.4–16.8) for whites and 4.0 (3.3–4.8) for blacks. Diabetes incidence was more than twice as high among blacks than whites of normal BMI, but the racial difference became attenuated as BMI rose, with estimated 5-year probabilities of developing diabetes approaching 20% for both blacks and whites with BMI≥40 kg/m2. Diabetes risk was also associated with low SES, significantly (pinteraction≤.02) more so for whites, current cigarette smoking, and lower healthy eating and physical activity indices, although high BMI remained the predominant risk factor among both blacks and whites. From baseline prevalence and 20-year projections of the incidence trends, we estimate that the large majority of surviving cohort participants with BMI≥40 kg/m2 will be diagnosed with diabetes. Conclusions Even using conservative criteria to ascertain diabetes incidence (i.e., requiring diabetes medication use and ignoring undiagnosed cases), rates of obesity-associated diabetes were exceptionally high in this low-income adult population. The findings indicate that effective strategies to halt the rising prevalence of obesity are needed to avoid substantial increases in diabetes in coming years."
https://openalex.org/W2782628349,"IgA nephropathy is an autoimmune disease characterized by IgA1-containing glomerular immune deposits. We previously proposed a multi-hit pathogenesis model in which patients with IgA nephropathy have elevated levels of circulatory IgA1 with some O-glycans deficient in galactose (Gd-IgA1, autoantigen). Gd-IgA1 is recognized by anti-glycan IgG and/or IgA autoantibodies, resulting in formation of pathogenic immune complexes. Some of these immune complexes deposit in the kidney, activate mesangial cells, and incite glomerular injury leading to clinical presentation of IgA nephropathy. Several studies have demonstrated that elevated circulatory levels of either Gd-IgA1 or the corresponding autoantibodies predict progressive loss of renal clearance function. In this study we assessed a possible association between serum levels of Gd-IgA1 and IgG or IgA autoantibodies specific for Gd-IgA1 in serum samples from 135 patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, 76 patients with other renal diseases, and 106 healthy controls. Our analyses revealed a correlation between the concentrations of the autoantigen and the corresponding IgG autoantibodies in sera of patients with IgA nephropathy, but not of disease or healthy controls. Moreover, our data suggest that IgG is the predominant isotype of Gd-IgA1-specific autoantibodies in IgA nephropathy.

https://openalex.org/W2782558296,"Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, have complex population structures. Mixing of populations is known, but the extent of connectivity is still unclear. Phenotypic plasticity results in divergent phenotypes in response to environmental factors. A marked salinity gradient occurs from Atlantic Ocean (salinity 35) into the Baltic Sea (salinity range 2–12). Herring from both habitats display phenotypic and genetic variability. To explore how genetic factors and salinity influence phenotypic traits like growth, number of vertebrae and otolith shape an experimental population consisting of Atlantic purebreds and Atlantic/Baltic F1 hybrids were incubated and co-reared at two different salinities, 16 and 35, for three years. The F1-generation was repeatedly sampled to evaluate temporal variation. A von Bertalanffy growth model indicated that reared Atlantic purebreds had a higher maximum length (26.2 cm) than Atlantic/Baltic hybrids (24.8 cm) at salinity 35, but not at salinity 16 (25.0 and 24.8 cm, respectively). In contrast, Atlantic/Baltic hybrids achieved larger size-at-age than the wild caught Baltic parental group. Mean vertebral counts and otolith aspect ratios were higher for reared Atlantic purebreds than Atlantic/Baltic hybrids, consistent with the differences between parental groups. There were no significant differences in vertebral counts and otolith aspect ratios between herring with the same genotype but raised in different salinities. A Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates was applied to analyze the variation in wavelet coefficients that described otolith shape. The first discriminating axis identified the differences between Atlantic purebreds and Atlantic/Baltic hybrids, while the second axis represented salinity differences. Assigning otoliths based on genetic groups (Atlantic purebreds vs. Atlantic/Baltic hybrids) yielded higher classification success (~90%) than based on salinities (16 vs. 35; ~60%). Our results demonstrate that otolith shape and vertebral counts have a significant genetic component and are therefore useful for studies on population dynamics and connectivity."

This results from the ability of p66Shc to inhibit Ca2+ and PP2B-dependent CXCR4/CCR7 dephosphorylation and β-arrestin release.

These results, identifying p66Shc as a regulator of CXCR4/CCR7 recycling in B cells, underscore the relevance of its deficiency to CLL pathogenesis and provide new clues to the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib."

Vascular injury induces the production of thrombin, which in addition to its role in blood clotting acts as a mitogenic and chemotactic factor. In exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying restenosis, here we identified LMCD1 (LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1) as a gene highly responsive to thrombin in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Of note, LMCD1 depletion inhibited proliferation of human but not murine vascular smooth muscle cells. We also found that by physically interacting with E2F transcription factor 1, LMCD1 mediates thrombin-induced expression of the CDC6 (cell division cycle 6) gene in the stimulation of HASMC proliferation. Thrombin-induced LMCD1 and CDC6 expression exhibited a requirement for protease-activated receptor 1-mediated Gαq/11-dependent activation of phospholipase C β3. Moreover, the expression of LMCD1 was highly induced in smooth muscle cells located at human atherosclerotic lesions and correlated with CDC6 expression and that of the proliferation marker Ki67. Furthermore, the LMCD1- and SMCαactin-positive cells had higher cholesterol levels in the atherosclerotic lesions. In conclusion, these findings indicate that by acting as a co-activator with E2F transcription factor 1 in CDC6 expression, LMCD1 stimulates HASMC proliferation and thereby promotes human atherogenesis, suggesting an involvement of LMCD1 in restenosis.

In identifying the thrombin-induced genes by microarray analysis, we found that a novel LMCD1 (LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1) gene was induced by thrombin in a sustained manner in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). LMCD1, a member of the LIM protein family, contains a novel cysteine-rich domain at the N terminus, a central PET (Prickle, Espinas, and Testin) domain, and two LIM domains at the C-terminal region (9Bespalova I.N.

It was reported that LMCD1 plays a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy (11Bian Z.Y. Huang H. Jiang H. Shen D.F. Yan L. Zhu L.H. Wang L. Cao F. Liu C. Tang Q.Z. Li H.

Another study suggests that LMCD1 acts as a transcriptional repressor for GATA6, a zinc-finger transcription factor, in lung and cardiac tissues (12Rath N. Wang Z. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E.

Because LMCD1 is identified as a novel gene induced by thrombin and we know that thrombin promotes VSMC proliferation, we asked the question of whether LMCD1 mediates thrombin-induced HASMC proliferation, and if so, what could be the possible mechanism, which is the major goal of this current study. In the present study, we report that LMCD1 acts as a co-activator for E2F1 in the modulation of thrombin-induced CDC6 expression in promoting HASMC replication. vascular smooth muscle cell human aortic smooth muscle cell mouse aortic smooth muscle cell rat aortic smooth muscle cell E2F transcription factor 1 protease-activated receptor 1 phospholipase C electrophoretic mobility shift assay origin recognition complex nucleotide(s) proximal ligation assay platelet-derived growth factor horseradish peroxidase balloon injury carotid artery ligation. To identify thrombin-induced genes in HASMCs, we have performed microarray analysis and identified 47 genes that were up-regulated above 2-fold in response to thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) and were represented as heat map and Venn diagram (Fig. 1, A and B). Gene ontology analysis shows the majority of these genes are involved in protein binding and catalytic activity (Fig. 1C). To validate the microarray data, we have studied the time-course effect of thrombin on the expression of 17 novel genes whose role in vascular wall remodeling is largely unknown (Fig. 1D). Among the genes tested, the expression of LMCD1 is highly induced by thrombin both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, D and E). To find the functional role of LMCD1, first we tested a longer time-course effect of thrombin on its expression in HASMCs. Thrombin induced LMCD1 expression in a sustained manner at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2A). Second, we examined its role in HASMC apoptosis and proliferation. Thrombin had no effect on HASMC apoptosis as measured by TUNEL assay, and siRNA-mediated depletion of LMCD1 levels did not affect this cellular event (Fig. 2B, top and middle panels). On the other hand, thrombin-induced HASMC proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of LMCD1 levels attenuated thrombin-induced HASMC DNA synthesis (Fig. 2B, top and bottom panels). These results indicate a role for LMCD1 in thrombin-induced HASMC replication. To explore the mechanisms by which LMCD1 mediates HASMC DNA synthesis, we first studied the time-course effect of thrombin on CDC6 and MCMs (MCM2-MCM7) that are involved in origin recognition complex (ORC) formation, an essential factor in the initiation of replication (15Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.

Thrombin induced CDC6 but not MCM levels in a sustained manner in HASMCs (Fig. 2C). In addition, silencing LMCD1 levels using its siRNA prevented thrombin-induced CDC6 expression, suggesting that LMCD1 plays a role in the regulation of CDC6 expression by thrombin in HASMCs (Fig. 2D). We also observed that depleting CDC6 levels by its siRNA blocks thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in HASMCs (Fig. 2E).Figure 2LMCD1 plays a role in thrombin-induced CDC6 expression and DNA synthesis in HASMCs. A, growth-arrested HASMCs were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for the indicated time periods, and either RNA was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR for LMCD1 mRNA levels using its specific primers, or cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for LMCD1 protein levels using its specific antibodies. B, top panel, HASMCs were transfected with siControl or siLMCD1 (100 nm). For 48 h later, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for LMCD1 levels using its specific antibody, and the blot was normalized to β-tubulin and CDK4 levels.

In addition, cloning the 1.2-kb human CDC6 promoter into pGL3 basic vector and testing for its activity showed that thrombin induces CDC6 promoter activity by 3-fold, which is substantially attenuated by depletion of LMCD1 levels (Fig. 3B). To identify the minimal CDC6 promoter region required for thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity, we have subcloned the truncated regions −597 to +93 nt (0.690 kb), −354 to +93 nt (0.447 kb), −190 to +93 nt (0.283 kb), and −31 nt to +93 nt (0.124 kb) of CDC6 promoter into pGL3 basic vector, and the constructs were named as pGL3-CDC6p-(0.690 kb), pGL3-CDC6p-(0.447 kb), pGL3-CDC6p-(0.283 kb), and pGL3-CDC6p-(0.124 kb), respectively. We found that CDC6 promoter region from −190 to −31 nt of 0.283-kb promoter is sufficient for thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity (Fig. 3C). In addition, knockdown of LMCD1 levels by its siRNA prevented thrombin-induced CDC6 (0.283 kb) promoter activity (Fig. 3D). This result demonstrates that thrombin-induced LMCD1-responsive regulatory element(s) of CDC6 promoter is present within this 0.283-kb region. Because −190 to −31 nt of 0.283 kb promoter contains only one potential E2F-binding site at −43 nt, we mutated this site and tested its response to thrombin. Site-directed mutagenesis of E2F-binding site at −43 nt significantly reduced thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity (Fig. 3E), suggesting the importance of this E2F site in thrombin-induced CDC6 expression. Having found the requirement of this E2F site in thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity and that a role for E2Fs in the expression of CDC6 has been reported previously (17Ohtani K. Tsujimoto A. Ikeda M. Nakamura M. Regulation of cell growth-dependent expression of mammalian CDC6 gene by the cell cycle transcription factor E2F.Oncogene. 1998; 17 (9778043): 1777-1785https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA117.000866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next sought to examine the role of E2Fs in thrombin-induced CDC6 expression. Toward this end, depletion of E2F1 by it siRNA blocked thrombin-induced CDC6 expression in HASMCs (Fig. 3F). This result infers that E2F1 is also essential for thrombin-induced CDC6 expression. Based on these observations, we wanted to explore any link between LMCD1 and E2F1 in CDC6 expression by thrombin. In this regard we measured DNA-binding activity by EMSA using the E2F-binding element at −43 nt as a biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. Thrombin induced E2F DNA-binding activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3G). In addition, supershift EMSA using anti-E2F1 or anti-LMCD1 antibodies showed the presence of both E2F1 and LMCD1 in thrombin-induced E2F DNA–protein complexes (Fig. 3H). To confirm the binding of E2F1 and LMCD1 to the E2F-binding site at −43 nt in the CDC6 promoter, we mutated this site in the oligonucleotide and used it as a probe for EMSA and supershift EMSA. In both EMSA and supershift EMSA, no DNA–protein complexes were formed with nuclear extracts of either control or thrombin-treated HASMCs using the mutant probe (Fig. 3I). The ChIP assay with anti-E2F1 and anti-LMCD1 antibodies demonstrates that E2F1 and LMCD1 bind to the same promoter region of CDC6 (Fig. 3J). Furthermore, the re-ChIP analysis of anti-LMCD1 chromatin immunocomplexes showed that E2F1 binds to the CDC6 promoter along with LMCD1. Likewise, re-ChIP analysis of anti-E2F1 chromatin immunocomplexes revealed that LMCD1 binds to CDC6 promoter along with E2F1 (Fig. 3J). These results imply that LMCD1 may interact with E2F1 in the transcriptional regulation of CDC6 by thrombin in HASMCs.Figure 3LMCD1 acts as a co-activator for E2F1 in mediating thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity. A, CDC6 promoter encompassing from −1122 to +93 nt (1.215 kb) was cloned into pGL3-basic vector and sequenced. B, HASMCs were transfected with pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-CDC6 promoter (1.215 kb) in combination with siControl or siLMCD1, growth-arrested, and treated with and without thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 6 h, and the luciferase activities were measured. C, HASMCs that were transfected with pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-CDC6 promoter reporter gene constructs with serial 5′-deletions were quiesced and treated with and without thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 6 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. D, HASMCs were transfected with pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-CDC6 promoter (0.283 kb) in combination with siControl or siLMCD1, growth-arrested, and treated with and without thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 6 h, and the luciferase activities were measured. E, HASMCs were transfected with pGL3-basic vector or pGL3-hCDC6 promoter with and without the mutated E2F-binding site (at −43 nt), quiesced, and treated with and without thrombin for 6 h, and the luciferase activity was measured. F, HASMCs that were transfected with siControl or siE2F1 and growth-arrested were treated with and without thrombin (0.5 unit/ml) for 6 h, and either RNA was isolated, or cell extracts were prepared analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, for CDC6 mRNA and protein levels using its specific primers or antibodies and normalized to β-actin transcripts or β-tubulin levels, respectively. G, nuclear extracts of control and various time periods of thrombin-treated HASMCs were analyzed by EMSA using the E2F-binding element at −43 nt as a biotin-labeled probe. H, nuclear extracts of control and 4 h of thrombin-treated cells were analyzed for the presence of E2F1 and LMCD1 in the E2F–DNA complexes by supershift EMSA. I, all the conditions were same as in H, except that both WT and mutant (Mut) probes were used. J, quiescent HASMCs were treated with and without thrombin for the indicated time periods and subjected to ChIP and re-ChIP assays for CDC6 promoter region encompassing the E2F site at −43 nt using anti-E2F1 or anti-LMCD1 antibodies with the indicated sequential order. *, p < 0.05 versus control or siControl; **, p < 0.05 versus thrombin or siControl + thrombin.

Lin K.T. Chen C.H. Lee S.A. Lee P.Y. Liu Y.W. Kuo Y.L. Wang F.S. Lai J.M. Huang C.Y. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay to systematically profile endogenous protein–protein interactions in a pathway network.J.

The PLA results showed that LMCD1 interacts with E2F1 in response to thrombin at 4 h (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that LMCD1 interacts with E2F1 in response to thrombin in HASMCs. To identify the protein domains involved in their physical interaction, we next constructed the full-length and various truncations of LMCD1 and E2F1 in Myc-DDK-tagged and HA-tagged pCMV vectors, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). When the full-length or various truncates of LMCD1 were co-expressed with the full-length of E2F1, we found that only PET–LIM1 domain but not Cys, PET, LIM1, or LIM2 domains alone or any of their other combinations were able to interact with E2F1 (Fig. 4D). Similarly, when the full-length or various truncations of HA-tagged E2F1 were co-expressed with full-length Myc-DDK-tagged LMCD1, in addition to its full length, only the mixed box domain (243–317 amino acids) of E2F1 interacts with LMCD1 (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, although the expression of E2F1 or LMCD1 alone induced the CDC6 promoter activity to some extent, co-expression of E2F1 along with LMCD1 or its PET–LIM1 domain but not PET–LIM2 domain further enhanced the CDC6 promoter activity (Fig. 4F). To further confirm the interdependence between E2F1 and LMCD1 on CDC6 promoter activity, we overexpressed E2F1 or LMCD1 in the absence of LMCD1 or E2F1, respectively, and measured the CDC6 promoter activity. Overexpression of either LMCD1 in the absence of E2F1 or E2F1 in the absence of LMCD1 did not result in enhanced CDC6 promoter activity (Fig. 4G). On the other hand, co-expression of E2F1 with LMCD1 or its PET–LIM1-LIM2 or PET–LIM1 but not PET–LIM2 domain increased CDC6 expression at protein levels (Fig. 4H), suggesting that LMCD1 via its PET–LIM1 domains interacts with E2F1 to enhance CDC6 expression in HASMCs.Figure 4LMCD1 interacts with E2F1 in mediating thrombin-induced CDC6 promoter activity. A, quiescent HASMCs were treated with or without thrombin for the indicated time periods, fixed, and incubated with mouse anti-E2F1 and rabbit anti-LMCD1 antibodies.

Our research aims at assessing the effects of species richness on the aboveground biomass and the ecological driver of this relationship in a primary Pinus kesiya forest. We sampled 112 plots of the primary P. kesiya forests in Yunnan Province. The general linear model and the structural equation model were used to estimate relative effects of multivariate factors among aboveground biomass, species richness and the other explanatory variables, including climate moisture index, soil nutrient regime and stand age. We found a positive linear regression relationship between the species richness and aboveground biomass using ordinary least squares regressions. The species richness and soil nutrient regime had no direct significant effect on aboveground biomass. However, the climate moisture index and stand age had direct effects on aboveground biomass. The climate moisture index could be a better link to mediate the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass. The species richness affected aboveground biomass which was mediated by the climate moisture index. Stand age had direct and indirect effects on aboveground biomass through the climate moisture index. Our results revealed that climate moisture index had a positive feedback in the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass, which played an important role in a link between biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem functioning. Meanwhile, climate moisture index not only affected positively on aboveground biomass, but also indirectly through species richness. The information would be helpful in understanding the biodiversity-aboveground biomass relationship of a primary P. kesiya forest and for forest management."

The effects of high dose of two manganese supplements (organic and inorganic) on rumen microbial ecosystem after four months of treatment of 18 lambs divided into three treatment groups were studied. We examined the enzyme activities (α-amylase, xylanase, and carboxymethyl cellulase), total and differential microscopic counts of rumen ciliates, total microscopic counts of bacteria, and fingerprinting pattern of the eubacterial and ciliates population analyzed by PCR-DGGE. Lambs were fed a basal diet with a basal Mn content (34.3 mg/kg dry matter; control) and supplemented either with inorganic manganous sulfate or organic Mn-chelate hydrate (daily 182.7, 184 mg/kg dry matter of feed, respectively). Basal diet, offered twice daily, consisted of ground barley and hay (268 and 732 g/kg dry matter per animal and day). The rumens of the lambs harbored ciliates of the genera of Entodinium, Epidinium, Diplodinium, Eudiplodinium, Dasytricha, and Isotricha. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in the total ciliate number, the number of ciliates at the genus level, as well as the total number of bacteria. Organic Mn did decrease the species richness and diversity of the eubacterial population examined by PCR-DGGE. No effects of type of Mn supplement on the enzyme activities were observed. In comparison to the control, α-amylase specific activities were decreased and carboxymethyl-cellulase specific activities were increased by the Mn supplements. Xylanase activities were not influenced. In conclusion, our results suggested that the intake of tested inorganic and organic manganese supplements in excess may affect the specific groups of eubacteria. More studies on intake of Mn supplements at a level close to the limit can reveal if the changes in microbial population impact remarkably the other rumen enzymatic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2782945385,"Lipid metabolism plays a critical role in female reproduction. During oogenesis, maturing oocytes accumulate high levels of neutral lipids that are essential for both energy production and the synthesis of other lipid molecules. Metabolic pathways within the ovary are partially regulated by protein kinases that link metabolic status to oocyte development. Although the functions of several kinases in this process are well established, the roles that many other kinases play in coordinating metabolic state with female germ cell development are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the catalytic activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2) is essential for Drosophila oogenesis. Using an unbiased biochemical screen that leveraged an unusual catalytic property of the kinase, we identified a novel CK2 substrate in the Drosophila ovary, the lipid droplet–associated protein Jabba. We show that Jabba is essential for modulating ovarian lipid metabolism and for regulating female fertility in the fly. Our findings shed light on a CK2-dependent signaling pathway governing lipid metabolism in the ovary and provide insight into the long-recognized but poorly understood association between energy metabolism and female reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2782973426,"Transcription factor Runx1 (Runt Related Transcription Factor 1), plays an important role in the differentiation of hematopoetic stem cells, angiogenesis and the development of nociceptive neurons. These known functions have in common that they relate to lineage decisions. We thus asked whether such role might also be found for Runx1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a process, in which such decisions have to be regulated lifelong. Runx1 shows a widespread low expression in the adult mouse brain, not particularly prominent in the hippocampus and the resident neural precursor cells. Isoforms 1 and 2 of Runx1 (but not 3 to 5) driven by the proximal promoter were expressed in hippocampal precursor cells ex vivo, albeit again at very low levels, and were markedly increased after stimulation with TGF-β1. Under differentiation conditions (withdrawal of growth factors) Runx1 became down-regulated. Overexpression of Runx1 in vitro reduced proliferation, increased survival of precursor cells by reducing apoptosis, and increased neuronal differentiation, while slightly reducing dendritic morphology and complexity. Transfection with dominant-negative Runx1 in hippocampal precursor cells in vitro did not result in differences in neurogenesis. Hippocampal expression of Runx1 correlated with adult neurogenesis (precursor cell proliferation) across BXD recombinant strains of mice and covarying transcripts enriched in the GO categories ""neural precursor cell proliferation"" and ""neuron differentiation"". Runx1 is thus a plausible candidate gene to be involved in regulating initial differentiation-related steps of adult neurogenesis. It seems, however, that the relative contribution of Runx1 to such effect is complementary and will explain only small parts of the cell-autonomous pro-differentiation effect."

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan from November 2013 till May 2016 among Type 2 DM patients (DM with no DR and DM with NPDR). The patients were evaluated for anterior ocular segment biometry [central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber width (ACW), angle opening distance (AOD) and anterior chamber angle (ACA)] by using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). Three ml venous blood was taken for the measurement of HbA1c. Results A total of 150 patients were included in this study (DM with no DR: 50 patients, DM with NPDR: 50 patients, non DM: 50 patients as a control group). The mean CCT and ACW showed significant difference among the three groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015 respectively). Based on post hoc result, there were significant mean difference of CCT between non DM and DM with NPDR (mean difference 36.14 μm, p < 0.001) and also between non DM and DM with no DR (mean difference 31.48 μm, p = 0.003). The ACW was significantly narrower in DM with NPDR (11.39 mm SD 0.62) compared to DM with no DR (11.76 mm SD 0.53) (p = 0.012). There were no significant correlation between HbA1c and all the anterior ocular segment biometry. Conclusion Diabetic patients have significantly thicker CCT regardless of retinopathy status whereas ACW was significantly narrower in DM with NPDR group compared to DM with no DR. There was no significant correlations between HbA1c and all anterior ocular segment biometry in diabetic patients regardless of DR status."
https://openalex.org/W2782687713,"Moyamoya is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries. There are two forms: Disease and Syndrome, with each characterized by the sub-population it affects. Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is more prominent in adults in their 20’s-40’s, and is often associated with autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no surgical models for inducing moyamoya syndrome, so our aim was to develop a new animal model to study this relatively unknown cerebrovascular disease. Here, we demonstrate a new surgical technique termed internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS), to mimic MMS using micro-coils on the proximal ICA. We tested for Moyamoya-like vasculopathies by fluorescently labelling the mouse cerebrovasculature with Di I for visualization and analysis of vessel diameter at the distal ICA and anastomoses on the cortical surface. Results show a significant narrowing of the distal ICA and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in the Circle of Willis, as observed in humans. There is also a significant decrease in the number of anastomoses between the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the ACA in the watershed region of the cortex. While further characterization is needed, this ICAS model can be applied to transgenic mice displaying co-morbidities as observed within the Moyamoya syndrome population, allowing a better understanding of the disease and development of novel treatments."

This balance is disrupted in cancer initiation and progression. N-Myc and STAT interactor (NMI: human or Nmi: murine) has emerged as a relevant player in the etiology of breast cancer. However, a fundamental understanding of its relevance to normal mammary biology is lacking. To gain insight into its normal function in mammary gland, we generated a mammary-specific Nmi knockout mouse model. We observed that Nmi protein expression is induced in mammary epithelium at the onset of pregnancy, in luminal cells and persists throughout lactation. Nmi knockout results in a precocious alveolar phenotype. These alveoli exhibit an extensive presence of nuclear β-catenin and enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The Nmi knockout pubertal ductal tree shows enhanced invasion of the mammary fatpad and increased terminal end bud numbers. Tumors from Nmi null mammary epithelium show a significant enrichment of poorly differentiated cells with elevated stem/progenitor markers, active Wnt/β-catenin signaling, highly invasive morphology as well as, increased number of distant metastases. Our study demonstrates that Nmi has a distinct role in the differentiation process of mammary luminal epithelial cell compartment and developmental aberrations resulting from Nmi absence contribute to metastasis and demonstrates that aberration in normal developmental program can lead to metastatic disease, highlighting the contribution and importance of luminal progenitor cells in driving metastatic disease."

There are two COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, distinguished primarily by their patterns of expression. Specifically, the expression of COX-2 is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors, whereas the expression of COX-1 is constitutive in most tissues (3Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L.

In addition, because of its larger active site, COX-2 can oxygenate analogs of AA that are poor substrates for COX-1.

Both COX enzymes, but particularly COX-2, are the major sites of action of the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen (7Blobaum A.L.

This problem was addressed by the development of COX-2–selective inhibitors that preserved COX-1–dependent gastrointestinal PGE2 production.

An alternative approach to NSAID-mediated gastrointestinal toxicity is to increase the levels of AEA and other fatty acyl ethanolamides (FAEs), such as palmitoylethanolamide, in individuals receiving NSAID therapy. AEA and palmitoylethanolamide exert anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in the gastrointestinal tract that can compensate for loss of beneficial PGs (12Sanger G.J. Endocannabinoids and the gastrointestinal tract: what are the key questions?.Br. J.

However, during inflammation, this FAE-dependent signaling may be compromised through increased expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the primary degradative enzyme for FAEs, and COX-2, which may also contribute to AEA depletion because of its oxidation. These considerations have led to the hypothesis that simultaneous blockade of COX and FAAH might promote FAE-mediated prevention of the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs while preserving most of their anti-inflammatory effects. To test this hypothesis, dual inhibitors that simultaneously target both the COX enzymes and FAAH with high potency and oral bioavailability were synthesized. One compound from this class, ARN2508 (see Fig. 1), decreases intestinal inflammation and protects the gastrointestinal tract from NSAID-induced toxicity in vivo (13Sasso O. Migliore M. Habrant D. Armirotti A. Albani C. Summa M. Moreno-Sanz G. Scarpelli R. Piomelli D.

ARN2508 combines key structural features of the compound URB597, an FAAH inhibitor, and flurbiprofen (Fig. 1), a member of the 2-arylpropionic acid class of NSAIDs. Like flurbiprofen, ARN2508 inhibits PGE2 formation in the gastric mucosa, but unlike flurbiprofen, ARN2508 was found to protect the epithelial lining in the stomach of mice, likely through its ability to increase levels of AEA and other FAEs. Inhibition of both FAAH and COX by ARN2508 was found to be functionally irreversible based on dialysis experiments (13Sasso O. Migliore M. Habrant D. Armirotti A. Albani C. Summa M. Moreno-Sanz G.

In the case of FAAH, ARN2508-mediated inhibition was attributed to a covalent bond formed between the carbamate moiety of the inhibitor and the enzyme's catalytic serine (14Mileni M. Kamtekar S.

Thus, the carbamate functional group of ARN2508 is required for FAAH inhibition; however, it is not necessary for inhibition of COX. In fact, the carboxylate moiety is necessary for COX inhibition by ARN2508 as is seen in the case of its parent compound, flurbiprofen, which inhibits COX by a noncovalent mechanism. These findings suggest that covalent modification is not required for ARN2508-mediated inhibition of COX, but they do not completely rule out this possibility. Flurbiprofen contains one chiral center α to the carboxylic acid. Potent COX inhibitory activity is associated only with the S-enantiomer of flurbiprofen; however, the R-enantiomer is a substrate-selective inhibitor of endocannabinoid oxygenation by COX-2 (15Duggan K.C.

ARN2508 shares this chiral carbon, but the initial kinetic evaluation of its COX-inhibitory activity was carried out using the racemic mixture (13Sasso O. Migliore M. Habrant D. Armirotti A.

Here, we report the characterization of the S- and R-enantiomers of ARN2508 with regard to potency, time dependence, isoform selectivity, and substrate selectivity of COX inhibition. We also explore structural determinants of ARN2508-mediated inhibition of COX and report the crystal structure of COX-2 complexed with (S)-ARN2508. Our findings reveal that the enantioselectivity of ARN2508 is similar to that of flurbiprofen. Also, like (S)-flurbiprofen, (S)-ARN2508 is a time-dependent inhibitor of COX-2, although its rate of inhibition is substantially slower than that of its parent. Furthermore, whereas the flurbiprofen moiety of ARN2508 binds in the COX-2 active site in a pose very similar to that of flurbiprofen, the inhibitor's alkyl chain occupies the same channel of COX-2 as the ω-tail of AA in a region of the active site that has not been exploited by any other NSAID for which structural data are available. Thus, in addition to its novel pharmacology as a dual inhibitor of FAAH and COX, ARN2508 exhibits binding properties not previously observed for any of the numerous selective and nonselective COX inhibitors described previously. To better understand the basis for inhibitor binding, we obtained the three-dimensional structure of COX-2 in complex with (S)-ARN2508 via X-ray crystallography by molecular replacement using the high-resolution monomer model of mCOX-2 in complex with naproxen (Protein Data Bank code 3NT1) (16Duggan K.C.

The COX-2·(S)-ARN2508 complex was determined to 2.27-Å resolution in the space group of I4122. The omit difference map (Fo − Fc) clearly revealed that the ligand in the crystal is indeed the S-enantiomer of ARN2508 (Fig. 2 and Table 1). We have not been able to obtain high quality crystals of the COX-2·(R)-ARN2508 complex, possibly due to the low potency of this inhibitor.Table 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsCOX-2·(S)-ARN2508 (Protein Data Bank code 5W58)Data collectionWavelength (Å)0.9792Resolution range (Å)66.05–2.27 (2.35–2.27)Space groupI4122Unit cell (a, b, c)173.8, 173.8, 203.3Total reflections1,048,952 (101,264)Unique reflections71,733 (6,799)Multiplicity14.6 (14.4)Completeness (%)0.99 (0.99)Mean I/σ(I)19.41 (0.82)Wilson B-factor (Å2)48.02Rmerge0.1551 (2.12)CC1/20.999 (0.336)RefinementRwork/Rfree16.9/18.9 (33.3/33.4)Number of atoms (total/protein/ligands/solvents)4,967/4,512/181/275r.m.s.

The active site is separated from the membrane-binding domain and an enlarged “lobby” immediately above it by a constriction formed by Arg-120, Tyr-355, and Glu-524. Above the constriction, the channel is lined predominantly by hydrophobic residues that favor binding of fatty acid substrates to the active site. Notable exceptions are Tyr-385, the catalytic residue that, in radical form, initiates the first step in PG biosynthesis, and Ser-530. Both of these residues are located at the bend in the channel (Fig. 3). AA binds in this channel with the carboxyl group in close proximity to Arg-120 and Tyr-355 at the constriction site, carbon 13 aligned with the catalytic Tyr-385, and the ω-tail deep in the alcove above Ser-530 (17Malkowski M.G.

Thus, the carboxylate moiety of ARN2508 lies at the constriction of the active site, ion-pairing to Arg-120 and hydrogen-bonding to Tyr-355, and the aromatic rings project upward toward Tyr-385. However, hydrogen bond formation with ARN2508's carbamate group requires an upward displacement of the side chain of Ser-530 in the COX-2·(S)-ARN2508 complex relative to its position in the COX-2·flurbiprofen complex. Additional hydrogen bonds form between Tyr-385 and the oxygen atoms of ARN2508's carbamate group. The alkyl chain of ARN2508 reaches deeply into the distal portion of the cyclooxygenase channel between helices 2 and 17, making hydrophobic interactions with various residues including Phe-205, Phe-209, Phe-210, Val-228, Ile-341, Val-344, Ile-377, Phe-381, and Leu-534 (Fig. 2). It was previously reported that racemic ARN2508 has an IC50 value of ∼12 nm for COX-1 and 430 nm for COX-2 (13Sasso O. Migliore M. Habrant D. Armirotti A. Albani C. Summa M. Moreno-Sanz G.

To further assess the potency of the inhibitor, each enantiomer was individually tested for both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. The results (Fig. 4) indicated that the potency of the S-enantiomer of ARN2508 (IC50 = 7.0 nm) for COX-1 inhibition is much greater than that of the R-enantiomer (IC50 = 4.6 μm) (Table 2). Similarly, using 5 μm AA as substrate, the S-enantiomer was the more potent of the two against COX-2, achieving complete inhibition of AA oxygenation with an IC50 of ∼39 nm (Fig. 5A and Table 2), whereas the R-enantiomer inhibited the enzyme by ∼50% at 10 μm and failed to reach complete inhibition at the highest concentration tested (100 μm). Thus, as previously reported for the racemic mixture (13Sasso O. Migliore M. Habrant D. Armirotti A. Albani C. Summa M. Moreno-Sanz G. Scarpelli R. Piomelli D.

The potency of the S-enantiomer for 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2 (IC50 = 21 nm) was greater than that for AA oxygenation but only by ∼2-fold (Fig. 5B and Table 2). In contrast, (R)-ARN2508 exhibited an ∼30-fold higher inhibitor potency for 2-AG (IC50 = 0.34 μm) versus AA oxygenation and completely blocked 2-AG oxygenation. These results indicate that the R-enantiomer is a substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor.Table 2(±)-ARN2508 inhibition IC50 valuesEnzymeSubstratePreincubationIC50(S)-ARN2508(R)-ARN2508minμmCOX-1 WTAA100.0074.6COX-2 WTAA100.03910COX-2 WTAA0n/aan/a, unable to obtain fitting due to incomplete enzyme inhibition.11COX-2 WT2-AG100.0210.34COX-2 WT2-AG0n/a0.54COX-2 Y355FAA100.09929COX-2 S530AAA100.026n/aCOX-2 S530TAA100.291n/aa n/a, unable to obtain fitting due to incomplete enzyme inhibition.

Oxygenation of 5 μm AA (A) or 5 μm 2-AG (B) by mCOX-2 was assessed by quantification of enzymatic product formation utilizing LC-MS/MS as described under “Experimental procedures.” Each enantiomer of ARN2508 was preincubated for 10 min (10 m) or added simultaneously (0 m) with substrate.

Some error bars are shorter than the height of the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As most highly potent COX inhibitors are time-dependent, initial experiments included an arbitrarily chosen 10-min preincubation period prior to substrate addition. To further explore the time dependence of ARN2508, various concentrations of each enantiomer were added simultaneously with either AA or 2-AG to COX-2, reactions were quenched after 10 s, and products were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The data indicate that COX-2 inhibition by the R-enantiomer is essentially time-independent for both AA and 2-AG oxygenation as preincubation had minimal effect on the observed IC50 values or extent of inhibition observed. In contrast, COX-2 inhibition by the S-enantiomer is strongly time-dependent as indicated by IC50 values in the nm range for both AA and 2-AG oxygenation following preincubation but failure to reach even 50% inhibition in the absence of preincubation at the concentrations tested (Fig. 5, A and B, and Table 2). The vast majority of COX-2 inhibitors bind to the enzyme in a non-covalent manner, a notable exception being aspirin, which acetylates Ser-530 (24Roth G.J. Stanford N. Majerus P.W. Acetylation of prostaglandin synthase by aspirin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Most time-dependent, non-covalent inhibitors exhibit kinetics consistent with a two-step binding model that includes rapid, reversible formation of an initial complex followed by a slower step that leads to a much stronger enzyme-inhibitor interaction (25Rome L.H. Lands W.E. Structural requirements for time-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis by anti-inflammatory drugs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To assess the kinetic mechanism of ARN2508-mediated COX-2 inhibition, various concentrations of the S-enantiomer were preincubated with wildtype COX-2 for different time periods, and the activity of the enzyme was measured. A plot of enzyme activity versus time for each inhibitor concentration exhibited pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig. 6A), and the observed first order rate constants for each curve (kobs) were plotted against inhibitor concentration. The resulting data (Fig. 6B) failed to yield the hyperbolic curve that is expected from the two-step model. A possible explanation is that the two-step model is correct, but insufficient concentrations of inhibitor were used to fully delineate the hyperbola. Indeed, fitting of the data to this model yields a first step dissociation constant of 220 μm and inhibition rate constant of 41 min−1, corresponding to an overall kinetic efficiency (kon/KI) of 0.18 min−1·μm−1. These values are, at best, only estimates as evaluation of much higher inhibitor concentrations is necessary to fully define the curve. Unfortunately, solubility limitations prevented this evaluation. An alternative explanation is that the plot is linear rather than hyperbolic, suggesting that ARN2508 does not follow the typical two-step kinetic mechanism. In this case, the binding process would more likely occur in a single step, or if multistep, the first step is rate-limiting. The slope of the line (0.11 min−1·μm−1) provides an estimate of the second order rate constant for the binding of inhibit"

https://openalex.org/W2784212856,"Personalized medicine for cancer patients requires a deep understanding of the underlying genetics that drive cancer and the subsequent identification of predictive biomarkers. To discover new genes and pathways contributing to oncogenesis and therapy resistance in HER2+ breast cancer, we performed Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV)-induced insertional mutagenesis screens in ErbB2/cNeu-transgenic mouse models. The screens revealed 34 common integration sites (CIS) in mammary tumors of MMTV-infected mice, highlighting loci with multiple independent MMTV integrations in which potential oncogenes are activated, most of which had never been reported as MMTV CIS. The CIS most strongly associated with the ErbB2-transgenic genotype was the locus containing Eras (ES cell-expressed Ras), a constitutively active RAS-family GTPase. We show that upon expression, Eras acts as a potent oncogenic driver through hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, in contrast to other RAS proteins that signal primarily via the MAPK/ERK pathway and require upstream activation or activating mutations to induce signaling. We additionally show that ERAS synergistically enhances HER2-induced tumorigenesis and, in this role, can functionally replace ERBB3/HER3 by acting as a more powerful activator of PI3K/AKT signaling. Although previously reported as pseudogene in humans, we observed ERAS RNA and protein expression in a substantial subset of human primary breast carcinomas. Importantly, we show that ERAS induces primary resistance to the widely used HER2-targeting drugs Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) in vivo, and is involved in acquired resistance via selective upregulation during treatment in vitro, indicating that ERAS may serve as a novel clinical biomarker for PI3K/AKT pathway hyperactivation and HER2-targeted therapy resistance."

Although the amplitude of myoplasmic Ca2+ release evoked by low-frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz) was virtually identical in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers obtained from wildtype and homozygous CaV1.1 E1014K mice, CaV1.1 E1014K FDB fibers displayed a pronounced fatigue phenotype because the amplitudes of successive Ca2+ transients decayed more rapidly than in wildtype fibers during high-frequency stimulation (HFS; 50 or 100 Hz) (7Lee C.S.

In addition, homozygous expression of the CaV1.1 E1014K channel caused a gain of glycolytic type IIB fibers at the expense of type IIX fibers in extensor digitorum longus and type IIX and type I fibers in soleus muscles (7Lee C.S.

In stark contrast to CaV1.1 E1014K mice, CaV1.1 N617D mice had no detectable phenotypic differences from wildtype littermates in a variety of assays. Notably, the authors found no significant effects on body weight, fertility, muscle mass/composition, EC coupling, SR Ca2+ store content, twitch or tetanic force, muscle fatigue following HFS, locomotor function or the expression levels of CaV1.1, and other mediators of Ca2+ signaling in skeletal muscle (e.g. RyR1, Orai1, STIM1, SERCA1, CSQ1, CSQ2, etc.). Although neither CaV1.1 E1014K nor CaV1.1 N617D conduct appreciable L-type Ca2+ current in either cultured or acutely dissociated muscle cells, the former channel is known to conduct Na+ and Cs+ currents. Reduction of external Ca2+ in patch-clamp experiments has revealed inward CaV1.1 E1014K-mediated Na+ currents (10Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. Properties of Na+ currents conducted by a skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel pore mutant (SkEIIIK).Channels. 2011; 5 (21406961): 262-268https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ability of CaV1.1 E1014K to conduct large-amplitude outward Cs+ currents was established during the initial characterization of the mutant (5Dirksen R.T.

The apparent impermeability of CaV1.1 N617D to Cs+ suggests that the altered selectivity of CaV1.1 E1014K underlies the phenotypic differences between CaV1.1 E1014K and CaV1.1 N617D mice. Obviously, the Cs+ permeability of CaV1.1 E1014K is inconsequential with regard to phenotype because Cs+ in not present in significant quantities in skeletal muscle fibers in vivo. Likewise, Na+ flux via CaV1.1 E1014K is unlikely to be the basis for these differences because the channel opens much too slowly to conduct Na+ during the upstroke of a single action potential (7Lee C.S.

However, the ability of CaV1.1 E1014K to conduct the other physiologically relevant monovalent cation, K+, has not been determined. In this work, we expressed YFP-tagged CaV1.1 E1014K and CaV1.1 N617D channels in tsA-201 cells to demonstrate that CaV1.1 E1014K functions as a non-inactivating K+ channel, whereas CaV1.1 N617D does not. We postulate, based a very large body of earlier work regarding fatigue (reviewed in detail in Ref. 15Allen D.G. Lamb G.D. Westerblad H. Skeletal muscle fatigue: cellular mechanisms.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88 (18195089): 287-332https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), that the conversion of CaV1.1 to a K+ channel within the transverse tubules (triad junctions) of homozygous CaV1.1 E1014K muscle results in enhanced K+ accumulation leading to accelerated fatigue during periods of high activity. Because changing the selectively of CaV1.1 via the E1014K mutation has not been investigated previously as the mechanism of the accelerated fatigue phenotype, our results may help clarify the impact of L-type Ca2+ flux into skeletal muscle. We first examined whether the CaV1.1 E1014K mutant could be functionally expressed in tsA-201 cells with similar biophysical properties as previously reported for CaV1.1 E1014K expressed in dysgenic myotubes. For this purpose, we constructed a YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K fusion construct similar to the untagged CaV1.1 E1014K channel utilized by Dirksen and Beam (5Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G.

With 2 mm Ca2+/150 TEA+ in the bath (i.e. TEA-Tyrode's solution; see “Experimental procedures”) and ∼160 mm Cs+ in the pipette solution, cells expressing YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K yielded no inward Ca2+ or Na+ current but supported sizable outward Cs+ currents (Idens = +83.4 ± 11.6 pA/pF at +80 mV, n = 18; Fig. 1A) with an current–voltage (I–V) relationship similar to that reported earlier for untagged CaV1.1 E1014K expressed in dysgenic myotubes (Fig. 1C) (5Dirksen R.T.

As expected, the cells expressing YFP-CaV1.1 displayed typical inward L-type Ca2+ currents peaking near +30 mV (Idens = −4.8 ± 1.0 pA/pF, n = 12; Fig. 1B). Importantly, the L-type current mediated by YFP-CaV1.1 did not reverse until test potentials nearing +80 mV (Vrev = +79.2 ± 2.3 mV; Fig. 1, B and C). tsA-201 cells expressing YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K produced charge movement with similar magnitude and voltage dependence compared with cells expressing YFP-Cav1.1 (Qmax = 9.1 ± 1.7 nC/μF, n = 18 versus 9.5 ± 1.3 nC/μF, n = 12, respectively; p > 0.05, unpaired t test; Fig. 2, A–C). Five non-transfected cells had no inward current, very little outward current, and no quantifiable charge movement (Figs. 1C and 2C).Figure 2Similar charge movement for YFP-CaV1.1 and YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K. Representative recordings of charge movements elicited by 20-ms depolarizations from −80 mV to −60, −40, −20, 0, +20, and +40 mV are shown for tsA-201 cells transfected with CaV1.1 E1014K (A) or YFP-CaV1.1 (B) with β1a, α2δ-1, and Stac3.

No inward L-type Ca2+ or Na+ currents were detectable, but non-inactivating outward currents were evident at test potentials greater than 0 mV (Idens = 92.9 ± 14.6 pA/pF at +80 mV; n = 16; Fig. 3, A and D). By contrast, YFP-CaV1.1 N617D produced virtually no outward current above the average tsA-201 background (Idens = 3.3 ± 0.5 pA/pF; n = 9; p < 0.001, unpaired t test versus YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K; Fig. 3, B and D). YFP-CaV1.1 N617D I–V data were collected only from cells in which channel expression was confirmed by the presence of charge movement (Qmax = 12.8 ± 1.9 nC/μF, n = 9). Because YFP-CaV1.1 N617D actually displayed slightly larger charge movement than YFP-CaV1.1 or YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K (p > 0.05, one way-ANOVA; Fig. S1), the lack of K+ current in cells expressing CaV1.1 N617D could not be attributed to fewer channels present in the membrane. Under these conditions, YFP-CaV1.1 produced L-type currents similar in amplitude and voltage dependence to the experiments shown in Fig. 1 in which Cs+ was used as the predominant intracellular monovalent cation (Fig. 3, C and D). The reversal potential was shifted ∼10 in the hyperpolarizing direction with K+ in the pipette (Vrev = 70.1 ± 2.9 mV; p < 0.05), an effect likely caused by an incomplete block of endogenous K+ channels. The effects of DHP agonists and antagonists on CaV1.1 E1014K are complex. For example, the agonist ±Bay K 8644 amplifies inward Na+ currents (10Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. Properties of Na+ currents conducted by a skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel pore mutant (SkEIIIK).Channels. 2011; 5 (21406961): 262-268https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but causes potentiated outward Cs+ currents to rectify (10Bannister R.A.

To determine whether the outward K+ current is sensitive to inhibition by DHP antagonists, YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K-expressing tsA-201 cells were exposed acutely to nifedipine. Fig. 4A shows K+ currents recorded at +80 mV from the same YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K-expressing cell before and during sequential applications of 500 nm and 10 μm nifedipine; the time course of inhibition in this particular experiment is depicted in Fig. 4B. These concentrations of nifedipine reduced the total K+ current by 27.0 ± 3.6% (n = 6; p < 0.05, paired t test versus control) and by 78.8 ± 3.3% (n = 6; p < 0.05, paired t test), respectively (Fig. 4C). The degrees of inhibition by both 500 nm and 10 μm nifedipine were somewhat inconsistent with earlier reports indicating that nifedipine inhibits L-type currents in myotubes with an IC50 near 500 nm (8Bannister R.A. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. The skeletal L-type Ca2+ current is a major contributor to excitation-coupled Ca2+ entry (ECCE).J. Gen.

Upon reflection, it became apparent that the previous studies employed depolarizing steps from the steady holding potential immediately prior to the test step to inactivate the endogenous Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels of myotubes (steps ranging from −50 to −20 mV for durations varying between 50 and 1000 ms). Because the tsA-201 cells do not express Na+ or T-type channels in any abundance, we had been stepping directly from the steady holding potential of −80 mV to test potential of +80 mV without taking into account that DHP affinity is directly dependent on holding potential (Ref. 19Bean B.P. Nitrendipine block of cardiac calcium channels: high-affinity binding to the inactivated state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, we performed an additional experiment in which we stepped to −50 mV for 750 ms prior to the test potential. As shown in Fig. 4D, the degree of inhibition following the step to −50 mV was in much better agreement with the aforementioned studies (47.3 ± 2.7 and 90.2 ± 1.1% inhibition with 500 nm nifedipine and 10 μm nifedipine, respectively; both n = 6). Thus, the bulk of the K+ current arose primarily from the expressed CaV1.1 E1014K channel rather than via endogenous K+ channels. Because CaV1.1 E1014K channels conduct Na+ (10Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. Properties of Na+ currents conducted by a skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel pore mutant (SkEIIIK).Channels. 2011; 5 (21406961): 262-268https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as K+, we recorded hybrid Na+ and K+ currents with regular Tyrode's solution in the bath. In these experiments, we observed both inward Na+ and outward K+ current with a bi-ionic reversal potential ∼+20 mV (n = 10; Fig. 5A). No inward nor appreciable outward currents were observed in seven recordings made from cells expressing CaV1.1 N617D under identical conditions (Fig. 5B). The bionic current–voltage relationships for tsA-201 cells expressing either YFP-CaV1.1 E1014K or YFP-CaV1.1 N617D are shown in Fig. 5C. In this study, we used the newly developed tsA-201 cell heterologous expression system to demonstrate that the CaV1.1 E1014K mutant channel will readily conduct K+ (Fig. 3). Although CaV1.1 E1014K is known to conduct Na+ current (10Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. Properties of Na+ currents conducted by a skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel pore mutant (SkEIIIK).Channels. 2011; 5 (21406961): 262-268https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M117.812446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), L-type Ca2+ channels are unlikely to be open during the upstroke of a single muscle action potential when the membrane potential favors the influx of Na+ (7Lee C.S.

The same cannot be said unequivocally for the more depolarized stages of the action potential when the driving force for K+ is strong (21Donaldson P.L. Beam K.G.

https://openalex.org/W2783469880,"Earth scientists hope a new priority setting effort will help them make the most of NASA9s limited budget for satellite missions that watch over the planet. The so-called decadal survey, issued in January by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, laid out the community9s consensus wish list, ranging from cloud monitoring to multiwavelength imaging—and recommends a strong dose of competition to keep costs down. The report prioritizes five observations for launch, including hyperspectral imaging, clouds, atmospheric particles, and missions to chart gravity variations and tiny crustal movements. It also advocates creating a new line of $350 million missions targeting seven observations, with competitions to choose three for flight in the next 10 years."

But what if Shelley had written her book today? Here is an overview of current and future technologies—from lab-grown organs and bionics to gene editing—that she might call on to produce her iconic creature."
