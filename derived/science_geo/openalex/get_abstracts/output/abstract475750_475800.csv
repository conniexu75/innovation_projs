https://openalex.org/W2090067193,"Cellular senescence disables proliferation in damaged cells, and it is relevant for cancer and aging. Here, we show that senescence occurs during mammalian embryonic development at multiple locations, including the mesonephros and the endolymphatic sac of the inner ear, which we have analyzed in detail. Mechanistically, senescence in both structures is strictly dependent on p21, but independent of DNA damage, p53, or other cell-cycle inhibitors, and it is regulated by the TGF-β/SMAD and PI3K/FOXO pathways. Developmentally programmed senescence is followed by macrophage infiltration, clearance of senescent cells, and tissue remodeling. Loss of senescence due to the absence of p21 is partially compensated by apoptosis but still results in detectable developmental abnormalities. Importantly, the mesonephros and endolymphatic sac of human embryos also show evidence of senescence. We conclude that the role of developmentally programmed senescence is to promote tissue remodeling and propose that this is the evolutionary origin of damage-induced senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1976635482,"Senescence is a form of cell-cycle arrest linked to tumor suppression and aging. However, it remains controversial and has not been documented in nonpathologic states. Here we describe senescence as a normal developmental mechanism found throughout the embryo, including the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the neural roof plate, two signaling centers in embryonic patterning. Embryonic senescent cells are nonproliferative and share features with oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), including expression of p21, p15, and mediators of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Interestingly, mice deficient in p21 have defects in embryonic senescence, AER maintenance, and patterning. Surprisingly, the underlying mesenchyme was identified as a source for senescence instruction in the AER, whereas the ultimate fate of these senescent cells is apoptosis and macrophage-mediated clearance. We propose that senescence is a normal programmed mechanism that plays instructive roles in development, and that OIS is an evolutionarily adapted reactivation of a developmental process."

https://openalex.org/W2055302801,"Recent studies point to a pivotal role of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in stem cell function and cancer. Loss-of-function approaches targeting individual PRC2 subunits have, however, generated findings that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we prevent assembly of both Ezh1- and Ezh2-containing PRC2 complexes by conditional deletion of Eed, a core subunit, and assess hematopoiesis. We find that deletion of Eed exhausts adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), although fetal liver HSCs are produced in normal numbers. Eed-null neonatal HSCs express HSC signature genes but are defective in maintenance and differentiation. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that neonatal and adult HSCs lacking Eed upregulated gene sets of conflicting pathways. Deletion of Cdkn2a, a PRC2 target gene, in Eed-null mice enhances hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) survival but fails to restore HSC functions. Taken together, our findings define developmental-stage-specific requirements for canonical PRC2 complexes in normal HSC function."
https://openalex.org/W2000816595,"In the mouse olfactory bulb, information from sensory neurons is extensively processed by local interneurons before being transmitted to the olfactory cortex by mitral and tufted (M/T) cells. The precise function of these local networks remains elusive because of the vast heterogeneity of interneurons, their diverse physiological properties, and their complex synaptic connectivity. Here we identified the parvalbumin interneurons (PVNs) as a prominent component of the M/T presynaptic landscape by using an improved rabies-based transsynaptic tracing method for local circuits. In vivo two-photon-targeted patch recording revealed that PVNs have exceptionally broad olfactory receptive fields and exhibit largely excitatory and persistent odor responses. Transsynaptic tracing indicated that PVNs receive direct input from widely distributed M/T cells. Both the anatomical and functional extent of this M/T→PVN→M/T circuit contrasts with the narrowly confined M/T→granule cell→M/T circuit, suggesting that olfactory information is processed by multiple local circuits operating at distinct spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2063336974,"Ribozymes are noncoding RNAs that promote chemical transformations with rate enhancements approaching those of protein enzymes. Although ribozymes are likely to have been abundant during the RNA world era, only ten classes are known to exist among contemporary organisms. We report the discovery and analysis of an additional self-cleaving ribozyme class, called twister, which is present in many species of bacteria and eukarya. Nearly 2,700 twister ribozymes were identified that conform to a secondary structure consensus that is small yet complex, with three stems conjoined by internal and terminal loops. Two pseudoknots provide tertiary structure contacts that are critical for catalytic activity. The twister ribozyme motif provides another example of a natural RNA catalyst and calls attention to the potentially varied biological roles of this and other classes of widely distributed self-cleaving RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1986729839,"Excess ammonia in the blood can cause neurologic dysfunction and seizures. Although previous studies have suggested astrocyte swelling and brain edema are associated with hyperammonemia, the authors show that ammonia compromises potassium buffering by astrocytes, increasing extracellular potassium concentrations and resulting in cortical disinhibition. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NKCC1 attenuates ammonia-induced neurologic impairment and seizures, suggesting hyperammonemia may be treated by targeting NKCC1. Ammonia is a ubiquitous waste product of protein metabolism that can accumulate in numerous metabolic disorders, causing neurological dysfunction ranging from cognitive impairment to tremor, ataxia, seizures, coma and death1. The brain is especially vulnerable to ammonia as it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier in its gaseous form, NH3, and rapidly saturates its principal removal pathway located in astrocytes2. Thus, we wanted to determine how astrocytes contribute to the initial deterioration of neurological functions characteristic of hyperammonemia in vivo. Using a combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiology in awake head-restrained mice, we show that ammonia rapidly compromises astrocyte potassium buffering, increasing extracellular potassium concentration and overactivating the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) in neurons. The consequent depolarization of the neuronal GABA reversal potential (EGABA) selectively impairs cortical inhibitory networks. Genetic deletion of NKCC1 or inhibition of it with the clinically used diuretic bumetanide potently suppresses ammonia-induced neurological dysfunction. We did not observe astrocyte swelling or brain edema in the acute phase, calling into question current concepts regarding the neurotoxic effects of ammonia3,4. Instead, our findings identify failure of potassium buffering in astrocytes as a crucial mechanism in ammonia neurotoxicity and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of blocking this pathway by inhibiting NKCC1."
https://openalex.org/W2120491421,"Reprogramming differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) promotes a broad array of cellular changes. Here we show that the let-7 family of microRNAs acts as an inhibitory influence on the reprogramming process through a regulatory pathway involving prodifferentiation factors, including EGR1. Inhibiting let-7 in human cells promotes reprogramming to a comparable extent to c-MYC when combined with OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, and persistence of let-7 inhibits reprogramming. Inhibiting let-7 during reprogramming leads to an increase in the level of the let-7 target LIN-41/TRIM71, which in turn promotes reprogramming and is important for overcoming the let-7 barrier to reprogramming. Mechanistic studies revealed that LIN-41 regulates a broad array of differentiation genes, and more specifically, inhibits translation of EGR1 through binding its cognate mRNA. Together our findings outline a let-7-based pathway that counteracts the activity of reprogramming factors through promoting the expression of prodifferentiation genes."

https://openalex.org/W1966943727,"In the olfactory bulb, odor representations by principal mitral cells are modulated by local inhibitory circuits. While dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells are typically thought to be a major source of this modulation, the contributions of other inhibitory neurons remain unclear. Here we demonstrate the functional properties of olfactory bulb parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV cells) and identify their important role in odor coding. Using paired recordings, we find that PV cells form reciprocal connections with the majority of nearby mitral cells, in contrast to the sparse connectivity between mitral and granule cells. In vivo calcium imaging in awake mice reveals that PV cells are broadly tuned to odors. Furthermore, selective PV cell inactivation enhances mitral cell responses in a linear fashion while maintaining mitral cell odor preferences. Thus, dense connections between mitral and PV cells underlie an inhibitory circuit poised to modulate the gain of olfactory bulb output."

https://openalex.org/W2130966021,"Eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled by a complex pathway that extends from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm and is powered by many energy-consuming enzymes. Nuclear export is a key, irreversible step in pre-ribosome maturation, but mechanisms underlying the timely acquisition of export competence remain poorly understood. Here we show that a conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTPase Nug2 (also known as Nog2, and as NGP-1, GNL2 or nucleostemin 2 in human) has a key role in the timing of export competence. Nug2 binds the inter-subunit face of maturing, nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles, and the location clashes with the position of Nmd3, a key pre-60S export adaptor. Nug2 and Nmd3 are not present on the same pre-60S particles, with Nug2 binding before Nmd3. Depletion of Nug2 causes premature Nmd3 binding to the pre-60S particles, whereas mutations in the G-domain of Nug2 block Nmd3 recruitment, resulting in severe 60S export defects. Two pre-60S remodelling factors, the Rea1 ATPase and its co-substrate Rsa4, are present on Nug2-associated particles, and both show synthetic lethal interactions with nug2 mutants. Release of Nug2 from pre-60S particles requires both its K(+)-dependent GTPase activity and the remodelling ATPase activity of Rea1. We conclude that Nug2 is a regulatory GTPase that monitors pre-60S maturation, with release from its placeholder site linked to recruitment of the nuclear export machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2073943895,"Pathologic review of tumor morphology in histologic sections is the traditional method for cancer classification and grading, yet human review has limitations that can result in low reproducibility and inter-observer agreement. Computerized image analysis can partially overcome these shortcomings due to its capacity to quantitatively and reproducibly measure histologic structures on a large-scale. In this paper, we present an end-to-end image analysis and data integration pipeline for large-scale morphologic analysis of pathology images and demonstrate the ability to correlate phenotypic groups with molecular data and clinical outcomes. We demonstrate our method in the context of glioblastoma (GBM), with specific focus on the degree of the oligodendroglioma component. Over 200 million nuclei in digitized pathology slides from 117 GBMs in the Cancer Genome Atlas were quantitatively analyzed, followed by multiplatform correlation of nuclear features with molecular and clinical data. For each nucleus, a Nuclear Score (NS) was calculated based on the degree of oligodendroglioma appearance, using a regression model trained from the optimal feature set. Using the frequencies of neoplastic nuclei in low and high NS intervals, we were able to cluster patients into three well-separated disease groups that contained low, medium, or high Oligodendroglioma Component (OC). We showed that machine-based classification of GBMs with high oligodendroglioma component uncovered a set of tumors with strong associations with PDGFRA amplification, proneural transcriptional class, and expression of the oligodendrocyte signature genes MBP, HOXD1, PLP1, MOBP and PDGFRA. Quantitative morphologic features within the GBMs that correlated most strongly with oligodendrocyte gene expression were high nuclear circularity and low eccentricity. These findings highlight the potential of high throughput morphologic analysis to complement and inform human-based pathologic review."
https://openalex.org/W2078450002,"Reference frames are important for understanding how sensory cues from different modalities are coordinated to guide behavior, and the parietal cortex is critical to these functions. We compare reference frames of vestibular self-motion signals in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC), and dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd). Vestibular heading tuning in VIP is invariant to changes in both eye and head positions, indicating a body (or world)-centered reference frame. Vestibular signals in PIVC have reference frames that are intermediate between head and body centered. In contrast, MSTd neurons show reference frames between head and eye centered but not body centered. Eye and head position gain fields were strongest in MSTd and weakest in PIVC. Our findings reveal distinct spatial reference frames for representing vestibular signals and pose new challenges for understanding the respective roles of these areas in potentially diverse vestibular functions."

https://openalex.org/W2148351140,"The initiation of cellular programs is orchestrated by key transcription factors and chromatin regulators that activate or inhibit target gene expression. To generate a compendium of chromatin factors that establish the epigenetic code during developmental haematopoiesis, a large-scale reverse genetic screen was conducted targeting orthologues of 425 human chromatin factors in zebrafish. A set of chromatin regulators was identified that target different stages of primitive and definitive blood formation, including factors not previously implicated in haematopoiesis. We identified 15 factors that regulate development of primitive erythroid progenitors and 29 factors that regulate development of definitive haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These chromatin factors are associated with SWI/SNF and ISWI chromatin remodelling, SET1 methyltransferase, CBP-p300-HBO1-NuA4 acetyltransferase, HDAC-NuRD deacetylase, and Polycomb repressive complexes. Our work provides a comprehensive view of how specific chromatin factors and their associated complexes play a major role in the establishment of haematopoietic cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036344491,"We identified a discrete number of microRNAs differentially expressed in benign or malignant mesothelial tissues. We focused on mir-145 whose levels were significantly downregulated in malignant mesothelial tissues and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines as compared to benign tissues (pleura, peritoneum or cysts). We show that promoter hyper-methylation caused very low levels in MPM cell lines and specimens. Treatment of MPM cell lines with mir-145 agonists negatively modulated some protumorigenic properties of MPM cells, such as clonogenicity, cell migration and resistance to pemetrexed treatment. The main effector mechanism of the clonogenic death induced by mir-145 was that of accelerated senescence. We found that mir-145 targeted OCT4 via specific binding to its 3'-UTR. Increased intracellular levels of mir-145 decreased the levels of OCT4 and its target gene ZEB1, thereby counteracting the increase of OCT4 induced by pemetrexed treatment which is known to favor the development of chemoresistant cells. In line with this, reintroduction of OCT4 into mimic-145 treated cells counteracted the effects on clonogenicity and replicative senescence. This further supports the relevance of the mir-145-OCT4 interaction for the survival of MPM cells. The potential use of mir-145 expression levels to classify benign vs malignant mesothelial tissues and the differences between pemetrexed-induced senescence and that induced by the re-expression of mir-145 are discussed."

Here we show that insulin acutely induced dissociation of retromer components from the low density microsomal membranes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes that was accompanied by disruption of the interaction of Vps35 with sortilin.

https://openalex.org/W2084895452,"Detecting tumor recurrences early and developing therapies capable of targeting recurrences that resist frontline therapy could be of enormous benefit to patients with cancer. Using mouse tumor models, Richard Vile and colleagues find a cytokine signature associated with very early stage recurrences, as well as evidence that the recurrent tumors are resistant to innate immune responses. By targeting the altered phenotype of the recurrent tumors, the researchers cured the mice of cancer, suggesting new avenues for research into human cancer recurrence. Tumor recurrence represents a major clinical challenge. Our data show that emergent recurrent tumors acquire a phenotype radically different from that of their originating primary tumors. This phenotype allows them to evade a host-derived innate immune response elicited by the progression from minimal residual disease (MRD) to actively growing recurrence. Screening for this innate response predicted accurately in which mice recurrence would occur. Premature induction of recurrence resensitized MRD to the primary therapy, suggesting a possible paradigm shift for clinical treatment of dormant disease in which the current expectant approach is replaced with active attempts to uncover MRD before evolution of the escape phenotype is complete. By combining screening with second-line treatments targeting innate insensitivity, up to 100% of mice that would have otherwise relapsed were cured. These data may open new avenues for early detection and appropriately timed, highly targeted treatment of tumor recurrence irrespective of tumor type or frontline treatment."

It is unclear if glucose modulation of LCFA-CoA metabolism occurs in neurons and/or astrocytes and whether or not such a feature distinguishes hypothalamic nuclei from other brain regions. Finally, it remains to be elucidated if the type of LCFA (carbon chain length and saturation degree) differentially affects glucose-regulated LCFA metabolism. The goal of the present study was to 1) determine whether or not glucose regulates LCFA metabolism in the hypothalamus, 2) establish if oleate and palmitate metabolism are differentially modulated by glucose, 3) identify the role of AMPK in glucose-regulated LCFA metabolism, and 4) identify which hypothalamic cell type(s) is involved. To this end we have employed a combination of in vitro models consisting of hypothalamic neurons, hypothalamic, and cortical astrocytes cultures as well as ex vivo MBH and cortical slices to measure glucose metabolism, LCFA oxidation, and esterification rates in response to glucose and pharmacological AMPK manipulation. Culture media and serum were from Wisent. Radioactive tracers were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The NPY RIA kit was from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Burlingame, CA). Four-to-five-week-old male Wistar rats and C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Charles River. Animals were housed 2 per cage on a 12-h light/dark cycle at 21 °C with free access to water and standard diet. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Committee for the Protection of Animals (CIPA) at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. GT1-7 (a generous gift from Dr. Pamela Mellon, San Diego, CA) and N46 neurons (Cellutions Biosystems, Toronto, ON, Canada) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 mm glucose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2. Cells were used at an ∼70% confluence for every experiment. To assess the effect of glucose on the expression of esterification enzymes in N46 neurons, cells were starved during 12 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 1 mm glucose. Then cells were maintained for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS with 1 or 15 mm glucose. Primary cultures of hypothalamic and cortical astrocytes were prepared from 1-day-old C57Bl/6 pups using a protocol adapted from the group of Magistretti and co-workers (31Gavillet M. Allaman I. Magistretti P.J. Modulation of astrocytic metabolic phenotype by proinflammatory cytokines.Glia. 2008; 56: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, after decapitation, the brains were removed, and the hypothalami and cortices were dissected and transferred into 6-well plates containing 2 ml of DMEM. The tissues were dissociated by passing through syringe needles of decreasing diameter (22 gauge followed by 25 gauge) 6 times. The cells were plated in polyornithine-coated T25 flasks and maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 44 mm NaHCO3, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, and 10% FBS at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2. Astrocytes were cultured for 14 to 21 days before use (∼70% confluence). Astrocytes cultured on coverslips were fixed in 4% formalin and blocked in presence of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05% Triton. Cells were then incubated with a glial-fibrillary acidic protein primary antibody (1:1000, Dako, Canada) in 5% BSA and 0.05% Triton in PBS overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibody incubation (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 568, A-11004, Invitrogen) in 0.25% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing DAPI (1.5 μg/ml). Cells were observed with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. N46 and GT1-7 neurons and primary astrocytes grown in 6-well plates were rinsed with ice-cold PBS before RNA extraction using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically. 900 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamers following the manufacturer's conditions. The reaction mix was then diluted 5-fold before use. Quantitative gene expression was measured from 1:10 cDNA dilutions. Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines on a Corbett Rotor-Gene 6000. Data were analyzed using the standard curve method and normalized to 18 S expression levels.

After decapitation, the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in ice-cold cutting solution of the composition 1.25 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 2.5 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2-6H2O, 0.5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 28 mm NaHCO3, 8 mm d-glucose, 1 mm l-(+)-ascorbate, 3 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm Hepes, and 200 mm sucrose, pH 7.25, and osmolarity 310–320 mosm oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Four 300-μm-thick sections containing the hypothalamus were cut from each rat using a Vibratome while being continuously immersed in ice-cold cutting solution. The MBH, which includes the arcuate nucleus plus the ventro- and dorso-median hypothalamus, and the mediolateral area of the motor and somatosensory cortex were dissected on each section as previously described (12Alquier T.

Slices were allowed to recover for 1 h at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 118 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mm Hepes, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm d-glucose 5, and 15 mm sucrose, pH 7.25, and osmolarity 310–320 mosm, oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Slices dissected from each hemisphere were pooled together in two distinct incubation chambers to allow two treatment conditions per animal. Slices were then preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in aCSF containing 1 mm glucose before treatment under constant oxygenation. For Neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion in MBH slices, slices were incubated in aCSF containing 1 mm glucose and 0.1 mm palmitate pre-complexed to 0.1% BSA for 1 h 40 min. The media were then collected and replaced by aCSF, 1 mm glucose, 0.1 mm palmitate pre-complexed to 0.1% BSA and 50 mm KCl for 20 min after which the media were collected. NPY radioimmunoassay was performed following the manufacturer's recommendation. At the end of slice experiments, samples were washed in cold PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until subsequent homogenization for protein extraction. The soleus muscle and liver were dissected on animals after decapitation. A 500-μm-thick section of the liver was cut using a slicing matrix. The entire soleus and the liver section were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented by 0.1% BSA and 1 mm glucose under constant oxygenation. The measurement of LCFA oxidation in neurons and primary astrocytes cultures was performed using a protocol adapted from a methodology already described for cultured beta cells (33Roduit R. Nolan C. Alarcon C. Moore P. Barbeau A. Delghingaro-Augusto V. Przybykowski E. Morin J. Massé F. Massie B. Ruderman N. Rhodes C. Poitout V. Prentki M.

Briefly, cells grown in T25 flasks were starved for 2 h in DMEM containing 1 mm glucose followed by a 30-min preincubation in the same media plus 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA. Cells were then incubated 2 h in the presence of different glucose concentrations (1, 8, and 15 mm), 0.3 mm palmitate or oleate pre-complexed to 0.5% BSA, 0.1 μCi/ml [1-14C]palmitate, or 0.1 μCi/ml [1-14C]oleate with or without 200 μm etomoxir, 25 μm Compound C (CpC, Calbiochem), or 1 mm 5-amino-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR, Toronto Research Chemicals). AICAR was dissolved in sterile water. 0.25% DMSO was used as a vehicle for CpC, and 0.25% DMSO was added in all the conditions. The flasks were sealed at the beginning of the incubation with a stopper containing a filter (Whatman GF/B paper) pre-soaked in 5% KOH. The incubation was stopped by the injection of 0.2 ml of 40% perchloric acid into each flask via a needle through the cap to acidify the medium and liberate the CO2. After overnight isotopic equilibration at room temperature, filters were removed, and the trapped 14CO2 and 14C acid-soluble products generated by the oxidation of [14C]palmitate or [14C]oleate were counted to calculate total palmitate and oleate oxidation. The results were normalized by cell protein content. Neurons and primary astrocytes grown in T25 flasks were starved in DMEM containing 1 mm glucose for 2 h and preincubated in DMEM containing 1 mm glucose containing 0.5% BSA during 30 min as described for LCFA oxidation. Cells were then incubated in the presence of different glucose concentrations (1, 8, and 15 mm), 0.3 mm palmitate pre-complexed to 0.5% BSA, d-[U-14C]glucose (0.2 μCi/ml), and d-[5-3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/ml). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 ml of 40% perchloric acid. 14CO2 generated was counted to estimate glucose oxidation, whereas 3H2O was counted to estimate glucose utilization. The results were normalized by cell protein content. Because brain slices have to be constantly oxygenated, 14C-labeled oleate and palmitate tracers could not be used to measure LCFA oxidation via the release of 14CO2. Therefore, 3H tracers were employed to estimate the amount of 3H2O generated and released in the media. Cortical and MBH slices were preincubated in aCSF containing 1 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA for 30 min followed by a 2-h incubation with different concentrations of glucose (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mm), 0.1 mm palmitate, or oleate pre-complexed to 0.13% BSA, [9,10(n)-3H]palmitate or [9,10(n)-3H]oleate (2 μCi/ml) or d-[5-3H]glucose (0.5 μCi/ml) with and without etomoxir (200 μm) or CpC (25 μm) at 37 °C under constant oxygenation with 95% O2, 5% CO2. 0.25% DMSO was used as a vehicle for CpC, and 0.25% DMSO was added under all conditions. Palmitate oxidation was measured in a 500-μm-thick liver section, and the entire soleus muscle was measured under similar conditions except that incubations were performed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer. For glucose utilization measurements, slices were incubated at 1 or 10 mm glucose in the presence of 0.1 mm palmitate pre-complexed to 0.1% BSA. At the end of the incubation, the medium was collected and acidified with concentrated HCl (10% of volume). Samples were placed in scintillation vials containing cold water and incubated for 24 h at 50 °C under constant agitation. After equilibration, 3H2O was counted to calculate palmitate or oleate oxidation or glucose utilization. The results were normalized by slice protein content. Oleate and palmitate esterification into neutral lipids was measured using 14C-labeled tracers and thin layer chromatography (TLC). Cells (neurons and astrocytes) grown in T25 flasks were starved for 2 h in DMEM containing 1 mm glucose followed by a preincubation of 30 min in the same media plus 0.5% BSA. Cells were then incubated during 2 h in the presence of different glucose concentrations (1 and 15 mm), 0.3 mm palmitate or oleate pre-complexed to 0.5% BSA, [1-14C]palmitate or [1-14C]oleate (0.1 μCi/ml). MBH slices were preincubated in aCSF containing 1 mm glucose for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with different concentrations of glucose (1 and 10 mm), 0.1 mm palmitate or oleate pre-complexed to 0.13% BSA and [1-14C]palmitate or [1-14C]oleate (2 μCi/ml) at 37 °C under constant bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation cells and explants were collected, washed with cold PBS, and rapidly frozen in 0.5 ml (cells) or 0.2 ml (slices) of methanol:HCl (100:1) in liquid nitrogen. Total lipids were extracted using the Folch method. Briefly, samples were homogenized using a pestle and loaded into pre-chilled glass tubes containing 2 ml of chloroform then washed with 0.5 ml of methanol and HCl. Water with 0.9% NaCl was added, and samples were vigorously vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the lower phase (organic) was transferred into pre-chilled glass tubes and dried under N2. Each sample was suspended in 50 μl of chloroform and loaded on the TLC plates (Whatman). The samples were delivered by small drops, and 10 μl of the esterification mix was loaded to quantify total palmitate or oleate tracer radioactivity. Total lipids were separated using a solvent for neutral lipids (petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid; 70:30:1) for separation of total phospholipids from mono-, di-, and triacylglycerols. Plates were imaged using a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare) after 9 to 10 days of exposure, and the signal was quantified using a Typhoon scanner (GE H"

We show that BAG neurons are principally tuned to detect molecular CO2, although they can be activated by acid stimuli. One component of the BAG transduction pathway, the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-9, suffices to confer cellular sensitivity to both molecular CO2 and acid, indicating that it is a bifunctional chemoreceptor.

https://openalex.org/W2050238103,"RAS-driven malignancies remain a major therapeutic challenge. The two-stage 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) model of mouse skin carcinogenesis has been used to study mechanisms of epithelial tumor development by oncogenic Hras. We used mice with an HrasG12V knock-in allele to elucidate the early events after Hras activation, and to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of farnesyltransferase inhibition (FTI). Treatment of Caggs-Cre/FR-HrasG12V mice with TPA alone was sufficient to trigger papilloma development with a shorter latency and an ∼10-fold greater tumor burden than DMBA/TPA-treated WT-controls. HrasG12V allele copy number was increased in all papillomas induced by TPA. DMBA/TPA treatment of HrasG12V knock-in mice induced an even greater incidence of papillomas, which either harbored HrasG12V amplification or developed an HrasQ61L mutation in the second allele. Laser-capture microdissection of normal skin, hyperplastic skin and papillomas showed that amplification occurred only at the papilloma stage. HRAS-mutant allelic imbalance was also observed in human cancer cell lines, consistent with a requirement for augmented oncogenic HRAS signaling for tumor development. The FTI SCH66336 blocks HRAS farnesylation and delocalizes it from the plasma membrane. NRAS and KRAS are not affected as they are alternatively prenylated. When tested in lines harboring HRAS, NRAS or KRAS mutations, SCH66336 delocalized, inhibited signaling and preferentially inhibited growth only of HRAS-mutant lines. Treatment with SCH66336 also induced near-complete regression of papillomas of TPA-treated HrasG12V knock-in mice. These data suggest that farnesyl transferase inhibitors should be reevaluated as targeted agents for human HRAS-driven cancers, such as those of bladder, thyroid and other epithelial lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2017050945,"Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal of considerable occupational and environmental concern affecting wildlife and human health. Recent studies indicate that Cd, like other heavy metals, can mimic effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) involving E2 receptor (ER) activation. Lactotrophs, the most abundant cell type in anterior pituitary gland, are the main target of E2, which stimulates cell proliferation and increases prolactin secretion through ERα. The aim of this work was to examine whether Cd at nanomolar concentrations can induce cell proliferation and prolactin release in anterior pituitary cells in culture and whether these effects are mediated through ERs. Here we show that 10 nM Cd was able to stimulate lactotroph proliferation in anterior pituitary cell cultures from female Wistar rats and also in GH3 lactosomatotroph cell line. Proliferation of somatotrophs and gonadotrophs were not affected by Cd exposure. Cd promoted cell cycle progression by increasing cyclins D1, D3 and c-fos expression. Cd enhanced prolactin synthesis and secretion. Cd E2-like effects were blocked by the pure ERs antagonist ICI 182,780 supporting that Cd acts through ERs. Further, both Cd and E2 augmented full-length ERαexpression and its 46 kDa-splicing variant. In addition, when co-incubated Cd was shown to interact with E2 by inducing ERα mRNA expression which indicates an additive effect between them. This study shows for the first time that Cd at nanomolar concentration displays xenoestrogenic activities by inducing cell growth and stimulating prolactin secretion from anterior pituitary cells in an ERs-dependent manner. Cd acting as a potent xenoestrogen can play a key role in the aetiology of different pathologies of the anterior pituitary and in estrogen-responsive tissues which represent considerable risk to human health."
https://openalex.org/W1978208931,"The perception of emotions is often suggested to be multimodal in nature, and bimodal as compared to unimodal (auditory or visual) presentation of emotional stimuli can lead to superior emotion recognition. In previous studies, contrastive aftereffects in emotion perception caused by perceptual adaptation have been shown for faces and for auditory affective vocalization, when adaptors were of the same modality. By contrast, crossmodal aftereffects in the perception of emotional vocalizations have not been demonstrated yet. In three experiments we investigated the influence of emotional voice as well as dynamic facial video adaptors on the perception of emotion-ambiguous voices morphed on an angry-to-happy continuum. Contrastive aftereffects were found for unimodal (voice) adaptation conditions, in that test voices were perceived as happier after adaptation to angry voices, and vice versa. Bimodal (voice + dynamic face) adaptors tended to elicit larger contrastive aftereffects. Importantly, crossmodal (dynamic face) adaptors also elicited substantial aftereffects in male, but not in female participants. Our results (1) support the idea of contrastive processing of emotions (2), show for the first time crossmodal adaptation effects under certain conditions, consistent with the idea that emotion processing is multimodal in nature, and (3) suggest gender differences in the sensory integration of facial and vocal emotional stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2058630843,"The syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta is an epithelial barrier that interacts with maternal blood and is a key for the transfer of nutrients and other solutes to the developing fetus. The syncytiotrophoblast is a true syncytium and fusion of progenitor cytotrophoblasts is the cardinal event leading to the formation of this layer. BeWo cells are often used as a surrogate for cytotrophoblasts, since they can be induced to fuse, and then express certain differentiation markers associated with trophoblast syncytialization. Dysferlin, a syncytiotrophoblast membrane repair protein, is up-regulated in BeWo cells induced to fuse by treatment with forskolin; this fusion is thought to occur through cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that dysferlin may also be up-regulated in response to fusion through other pathways. Here, we show that BeWo cells can also be induced to fuse by treatment with an activator of protein kinase C, and that this fusion is accompanied by increased expression of dysferlin. Moreover, a dramatic synergistic increase in dysferlin expression is observed when both the protein kinase A and protein kinase C pathways are activated in BeWo cells. This synergy in fusion is also accompanied by dramatic increases in mRNA for the placental fusion proteins syncytin 1, syncytin 2, as well as dysferlin. Dysferlin, however, was shown to be dispensable for stimulus-induced BeWo cell syncytialization, since dysferlin knockdown lines fused to the same extent as control cells. The classical trophoblast differentiation marker human chorionic gonadotropin was also monitored and changes in the expression closely parallel that of dysferlin in all of the experimental conditions employed. Thus different biochemical markers of trophoblast fusion behave in concert supporting the hypothesis that activation of both protein kinase C and A pathways lead to trophoblastic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1966848393,"This study used event-related brain potentials to investigate whether math anxiety is related to abnormal error monitoring processing. Seventeen high math-anxious (HMA) and seventeen low math-anxious (LMA) individuals were presented with a numerical and a classical Stroop task. Groups did not differ in terms of trait or state anxiety. We found enhanced error-related negativity (ERN) in the HMA group when subjects committed an error on the numerical Stroop task, but not on the classical Stroop task. Groups did not differ in terms of the correct-related negativity component (CRN), the error positivity component (Pe), classical behavioral measures or post-error measures. The amplitude of the ERN was negatively related to participants’ math anxiety scores, showing a more negative amplitude as the score increased. Moreover, using standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) we found greater activation of the insula in errors on a numerical task as compared to errors in a non-numerical task only for the HMA group. The results were interpreted according to the motivational significance theory of the ERN."

TGF-β1 transmits its signal through Smad transcription factor-dependent and -independent pathways. It was reported that TGF-β1 activates NF-κB and RhoA, and RhoA activates NF-κB in several kinds of cells in a Smad-independent pathway. However, the activation molecular mechanism of NF-κB by RhoA upon TGF-β1 has not been clearly elucidated. We observed that RhoA-GTP level was increased by TGF-β1 in RAW264.7 cells. RhoA-GDP and RhoGDI were bound to N- and C-terminal domains of IKKγ, respectively. Purified IKKγ facilitated GTP binding to RhoA complexed with RhoGDI. Furthermore, Dbs, a guanine nucletotide exchange factor of RhoA much more enhanced GTP binding to RhoA complexed with RhoGDI in the presence of IKKγ. Indeed, si-IKKγ abolished RhoA activation in response to TGF-β1 in cells. However, TGF-β1 stimulated the release of RhoA-GTP from IKKγ and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), an active RhoA effector protein, directly phosphorylated IKKβ in vitro, whereas TGF-β1-activated kinase 1 activated RhoA upon TGF-β1 stimulation. Taken together, our data indicate that IKKγ facilitates RhoA activation via a guanine nucletotide exchange factor, which in turn activates ROCK to phosphorylate IKKβ, leading to NF-κB activation that induced the chemokine expression and cell migration upon TGF-β1.

https://openalex.org/W2091904202,"Arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase; ARSB) removes 4-sulfate groups from chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate and is required for their degradation. In human prostate stromal and epithelial cells, when ARSB was silenced, C4S, versican and versican promoter activity increased, and the galectin-3 that co-immunoprecipitated with C4S declined. Galectin-3 silencing inhibited the ARSB-silencing-induced increases in versican and versican promoter due to effects on the AP-1-binding site in the versican promoter. These findings demonstrate for the first time the transcriptional mechanism whereby ARSB can regulate expression of an extracellular matrix proteoglycan with C4S attachments. In addition, following ARSB silencing, C4S that co-immunoprecipitated with versican increased, whereas co-immunoprecipitated EGFR declined, total EGFR increased and exogenous EGF-induced cell proliferation increased, suggesting profound effects of ARSB on vital cell processes."
https://openalex.org/W2040742944,"Apoptosis and autophagy are fundamental homeostatic processes in eukaryotic organisms fulfilling essential roles in development and adaptation. Recently, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 has been reported to also inhibit autophagy, thus establishing a potential link between these pathways, but the mechanistic details are only beginning to emerge. Here we show that Bcl-2 directly binds to the phagophore-associated protein GABARAP. NMR experiments revealed that the interaction critically depends on a three-residue segment (EWD) of Bcl-2 adjacent to the BH4 region, which is anchored to one of the two hydrophobic pockets on the GABARAP molecule. This is at variance with the majority of GABARAP interaction partners identified previously, which occupy both hydrophobic pockets simultaneously. Bcl-2 affinity could also be detected for GEC1, but not for other mammalian Atg8 homologs. Finally, we provide evidence that overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibits lipidation of GABARAP, a key step in autophagosome formation, possibly via competition with the lipid conjugation machinery. These results support the regulatory role of Bcl-2 in autophagy and define GABARAP as a novel interaction partner involved in this intricate connection."
https://openalex.org/W2046222107,"PRH/HHex (proline-rich homeodomain protein) is a transcription factor that controls cell proliferation and cell differentiation in a variety of tissues. Aberrant subcellular localisation of PRH is associated with breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Further, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia, and a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias, PRH is aberrantly localised and its activity is downregulated. Here we show that PRH is involved in the regulation of cell migration and cancer cell invasion. We show for the first time that PRH is expressed in prostate cells and that a decrease in PRH protein levels increases the migration of normal prostate epithelial cells. We show that a decrease in PRH protein levels also increases the migration of normal breast epithelial cells. Conversely, PRH overexpression inhibits cell migration and cell invasion by PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Previous work has shown that the transforming growth factor-β co-receptor Endoglin inhibits the migration of prostate and breast cancer cells. Here we show that PRH can bind to the Endoglin promoter in immortalised prostate and breast cells. PRH overexpression in these cells results in increased Endoglin protein expression, whereas PRH knockdown results in decreased Endoglin protein expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that Endoglin overexpression abrogates the increased migration shown by PRH knockdown cells. Our data suggest that PRH controls the migration of multiple epithelial cell lineages in part at least through the direct transcriptional regulation of Endoglin. We discuss these results in terms of the functions of PRH in normal cells and the mislocalisation of PRH seen in multiple cancer cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1973709014,"Guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1), a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) subclass of the calmodulin superfamily, confers Ca2+-sensitive activation of retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 (RetGC1) upon light activation of photoreceptor cells. Here we present NMR assignments and functional analysis to probe Ca2+-dependent structural changes in GCAP1 that control activation of RetGC. NMR assignments were obtained for both the Ca2+-saturated inhibitory state of GCAP1 versus a GCAP1 mutant (D144N/D148G, called EF4mut), which lacks Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 4 and models the Ca2+-free/Mg2+-bound activator state of GCAP1. NMR chemical shifts of backbone resonances for Ca2+-saturated wild type GCAP1 are overall similar to those of EF4mut, suggesting a similar main chain structure for assigned residues in both the Ca2+-free activator and Ca2+-bound inhibitor states. This contrasts with large Ca2+-induced chemical shift differences and hence dramatic structural changes seen for other NCS proteins including recoverin and NCS-1. The largest chemical shift differences between GCAP1 and EF4mut are seen for residues in EF4 (S141, K142, V145, N146, G147, G149, E150, L153, E154, M157, E158, Q161, L166), but mutagenesis of EF4 residues (F140A, K142D, L153R, L166R) had little effect on RetGC1 activation. A few GCAP1 residues in EF-hand 1 (K23, T27, G32) also show large chemical shift differences, and two of the mutations (K23D and G32N) each decrease the activation of RetGC, consistent with a functional conformational change in EF1. GCAP1 residues at the domain interface (V77, A78, L82) have NMR resonances that are exchange broadened, suggesting these residues may be conformationally dynamic, consistent with previous studies showing these residues are in a region essential for activating RetGC1."
https://openalex.org/W2059713977,"Muscle tissue has a great intrinsic adaptability to changing functional demands. Triggering more gradual responses such as tissue growth, the immediate responses to altered loading conditions involve changes in the activity. Because the reduction in a limb's function is associated with marked deviations in the gait pattern, understanding the muscular responses in laming animals will provide further insight into their compensatory mechanisms as well as help to improve treatment options to prevent musculoskeletal sequelae in chronic patients. Therefore, this study evaluated the changes in muscle activity in adaptation to a moderate, short-term, weight-bearing hindlimb lameness in two leg and one back muscle using surface electromyography (SEMG). In eight sound adult dogs that trotted on an instrumented treadmill, bilateral, bipolar recordings of the m. triceps brachii, the m. vastus lateralis and the m. longissimus dorsi were obtained before and after lameness was induced. Consistent with the unchanged vertical forces as well as temporal parameters, neither the timing nor the level of activity changed significantly in the m. triceps brachii. In the ipsilateral m. vastus lateralis, peak activity and integrated SEMG area were decreased, while they were significantly increased in the contralateral hindlimb. In both sides, the duration of the muscle activity was significantly longer due to a delayed offset. These observations are in accordance with previously described kinetic and kinematic changes as well as changes in muscle mass. Adaptations in the activity of the m. longissimus dorsi concerned primarily the unilateral activity and are discussed regarding known alterations in trunk and limb motions."
https://openalex.org/W2092650214,"Ubiquitin linkage is critical in directing the cellular fate of a ubiquitinated protein. Although K48-linked polyubiquitination of p53 leads to its degradation, whether K48-independent ubiquitin linkages are involved in p53 activation remains unknown. Here, we show that FATS acts as a p53 activator by inhibiting Mdm2 binding to p53 and stimulating non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of p53. Knockdown of FATS impairs p53 stabilization and activation in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal domain of FATS is sufficient to exhibit ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity and assemble ubiquitin polymers through K11-, K29- and K63-linkages, independently of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). FATS promotes p53-dependent transcription of p21, leading to robust checkpoint response. The E3 activity of FATS is required for promoting p53 stability and activation in response to DNA damage. Our findings reveal K48-linkage-independent non-linear polyubiquitination of p53 as a new barcode for p53 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2045788339,"Recognition of peptide Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) by the T cell receptor causes rapid production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in naïve CD8(+) T cells. Because ROI such as H2O2 are membrane permeable, mechanisms must exist to prevent overoxidation of surface proteins. In this study we used fluorescently labeled conjugates of maleimide to measure the level of cell surface free thiols (CSFT) during the development, activation and differentiation of CD8(+) T cells. We found that during development CSFT were higher on CD8 SP compared to CD4 SP or CD4CD8 DP T cells. After activation CSFT became elevated prior to division but once proliferation started levels continued to rise. During acute viral infection CSFT levels were elevated on antigen-specific effector cells compared to memory cells. Additionally, the CSFT level was always higher on antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in lymphoid compared to nonlymphoid organs. During chronic viral infection, CSFT levels were elevated for extended periods on antigen-specific effector CD8(+) T cells. Finally, CSFT levels on effector CD8(+) T cells, regardless of infection, identified cells undergoing TCR stimulation. Taken together these data suggest that CD8(+) T cells upregulate CSFT following receptor ligation and ROI production during infection to prevent overoxidation of surface proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2068696850,"To date few studies have addressed the development and function of the porcine gastric mucosal immune system and this is a major limitation to understanding the immunopathogenesis of infections occurring in young pigs. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) mediates the transport of secretory immunoglobulins until luminal surface of the gut mucosa and the aim of this study was to investigate the time course of pIgR expression and to determine its localization in three functionally different porcine gastric sites during the suckling period and after weaning. An additional goal was to investigate the time course expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in relation to pIgR expression. Gastric samples were collected from the cardiac-to-oxyntic transition (Cd), the oxyntic (Ox), and the pyloric (Py) regions in 84 pigs, slaughtered before weaning (14, 21 and 28 days of age; 23, 23 and 19 pigs, respectively) and 14 days post-weaning (42 days of age, 23 pigs). PIgR was expressed in the mucosa of all the three gastric sites, and its transcript levels were modulated during suckling and after weaning, with regional differences. PIgR expression increased linearly during suckling (P=0.019) and also increased post-weaning (P=0.001) in Cd, it increased post-weaning in Py (P=0.049) and increased linearly during suckling in Ox (P=0.036). TLRs expression was also modulated during development: in Cd, TLR2 increased linearly during suckling (P=0.003); in Ox, TLR2 decreased after weaning (P=0.038) while TLR4 increased linearly during suckling(P=0.008). The expression of TLR2, 3 and 4 in Ox was positively correlated with pIgR expression (P<0.001). Importantly, both pIgR protein and mRNA were localized, by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively, in the gastric glands of the lamina propria. These results indicate that pIgR is actively synthesized in the gastric mucosa and suggest that pIgR could play a crucial role in gastric mucosal immune defense of growing pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2026541209,"Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) has been found localized in low-density caveolin-rich membrane microdomains. Our previous study suggested that PLD2 and aquaporin 3 (AQP3) interact in these domains to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation and promote differentiation by cooperating to produce phosphatidylglycerol. To examine the effect of membrane microdomain localization on the PLD2/AQP3 signaling module and keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, we treated mouse keratinocytes with 3 µM cell-permeable caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide or a negative control peptide and stimulated cell differentiation using a moderately elevated extracellular calcium concentration (125 uM) to maximally promote differentiation and phosphatidylglycerol production. Cell proliferation, differentiation, total PLD activity, phosphatidylglycerol levels, and AQP3 activity were monitored. The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide itself had no effect on phosphatidylglycerol levels or keratinocyte proliferation or differentiation but prevented the changes induced by a moderately elevated calcium concentration, whereas a negative control did not. The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide had little effect on total PLD activity or glycerol uptake (AQP3 activity). We conclude that the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide disrupts the functional association between AQP3 and PLD2 and prevents both the inhibited proliferation and the stimulated differentiation in response to elevated extracellular calcium levels. The interaction of caveolin-1 and PLD2 is indirect (i.e., lipid mediated); together with the proliferation-promoting effects of caveolin-1 knockout on epidermal keratinocytes, we propose that the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain pepetide exerts a dominant-negative effect on caveolin-1 to alter lipid rafts in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061635869,"Though operationally defined as cis-regulatory elements, enhancers can also communicate with promoters on a separate homolog in trans, a mechanism that has been suggested to account for the ability of certain alleles of the same gene to complement one another in a process otherwise known as transvection. This homolog-pairing dependent process is facilitated in Drosophila by chromatin-associated pairing proteins, many of which remain unknown and their mechanism of action uncharacterized. Here we have tested the role of the gypsy chromatin insulator in facilitating pairing and communication between enhancers and promoters in trans using a transgenic eGFP reporter system engineered to allow for targeted deletions in the vestigial Boundary Enhancer (vgBE) and the hsp70 minimal promoter, along with one or two flanking gypsy elements. We found a modest 2.5-3x increase in eGFP reporter levels from homozygotes carrying an intact copy of the reporter on each homolog compared to unpaired hemizygotes, although this behavior was independent of gypsy. However, detectable levels of GFP protein along the DV wing boundary in trans-heterozygotes lacking a single enhancer and promoter was only observed in the presence of two flanking gypsy elements. Our results demonstrate that gypsy can stimulate enhancer-promoter communication in trans throughout the genome in a context-dependent manner, likely through modulation of local chromatin dynamics once pairing has been established by other elements and highlights chromatin structure as the master regulator of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2042963783,"Crossmodal integration of audio/visual information is vital for recognition, interpretation and appropriate reaction to social signals. Here we examined how rhesus macaques process bimodal species-specific vocalizations by eye tracking, using an unconstrained preferential looking paradigm. Six adult rhesus monkeys (3M, 3F) were presented two side-by-side videos of unknown male conspecifics emitting different vocalizations, accompanied by the audio signal corresponding to one of the videos. The percentage of time animals looked to each video was used to assess crossmodal integration ability and the percentages of time spent looking at each of the six a priori ROIs (eyes, mouth, and rest of each video) were used to characterize scanning patterns. Animals looked more to the congruent video, confirming reports that rhesus monkeys spontaneously integrate conspecific vocalizations. Scanning patterns showed that monkeys preferentially attended to the eyes and mouth of the stimuli, with subtle differences between males and females such that females showed a tendency to differentiate the eye and mouth regions more than males. These results were similar to studies in humans indicating that when asked to assess emotion-related aspects of visual speech, people preferentially attend to the eyes. Thus, the tendency for female monkeys to show a greater differentiation between the eye and mouth regions than males may indicate that female monkeys were slightly more sensitive to the socio-emotional content of complex signals than male monkeys. The current results emphasize the importance of considering both the sex of the observer and individual variability in passive viewing behavior in nonhuman primate research."
https://openalex.org/W1992078211,"N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification performed by members of all three domains of life. Studies on the halophile Haloferax volcanii have offered insight into the archaeal version of this universal protein-processing event. In the present study, AglQ was identified as a novel component of the pathway responsible for the assembly and addition of a pentasaccharide to select Asn residues of Hfx. volcanii glycoproteins, such as the S-layer glycoprotein. In cells deleted of aglQ, both dolichol phosphate, the lipid carrier used in Hfx. volcanii N-glycosylation, and modified S-layer glycoprotein Asn residues only presented the first three pentasaccharide subunits, pointing to a role for AglQ in either preparing the third sugar for attachment of the fourth pentasaccharide subunit or processing the fourth sugar prior to its addition to the lipid-linked trisaccharide. To better define the precise role of AglQ, shown to be a soluble protein, bioinformatics tools were recruited to identify sequence or structural homologs of known function. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments guided by these predictions identified residues important for AglQ function. The results obtained point to AglQ acting as an isomerase in Hfx. volcanii N-glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2073228203,"The molecular determinants that govern nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) assembly and trafficking are poorly defined, and those identified operate largely during initial receptor biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. To identify determinants that regulate later trafficking steps, we performed an unbiased screen using chimeric proteins consisting of CD4 fused to the muscle AChR subunit cytoplasmic loops. In C2 mouse muscle cells, we found that CD4-β and δ subunit loops were expressed at very low levels on the cell surface, whereas the other subunit loops were robustly expressed on the plasma membrane. The low surface expression of CD4-β and δ loops was due to their pronounced retention in the Golgi apparatus and also to their rapid internalization from the plasma membrane. Both retention and recovery were mediated by the proximal 25-28 amino acids in each loop and were dependent on an ordered sequence of charged and hydrophobic residues. Indeed, βK353L and δK351L mutations increased surface trafficking of the CD4-subunit loops by >6-fold and also decreased their internalization from the plasma membrane. Similarly, combined βK353L and δK351L mutations increased the surface levels of assembled AChR expressed in HEK cells to 138% of wild-type levels. This was due to increased trafficking to the plasma membrane and not decreased AChR turnover. These findings identify novel Golgi retention signals in the β and δ subunit loops that regulate surface trafficking of assembled AChR and may help prevent surface expression of unassembled subunits. Together, these results define molecular determinants that govern a Golgi-based regulatory step in nicotinic AChR trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1975827769,"An exactly solvable information-theoretical model of communications with a fully quantum electromagnetic field yields explicit expressions for all point-to-point capacities—the maximum possible rates of data transmission—of noisy quantum channels, with implications for quantum key distribution and fibre-optic communications. The capacity of a noisy channel to transmit information is fundamental to communications theory. Defined as the maximum rate of data transmission, channel capacity can be readily calculated as a function of bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio for classical systems, but the introduction of quantum effects makes calculations based on current theory intractable. Graeme Smith and John Smolin have now developed an exactly solvable model of communications with a fully quantum electromagnetic field that gives explicit expressions for all point-to-point capacities of noisy quantum channels. The work has practical implications for quantum communications networks, such as those used in quantum key distribution. Information theory establishes the ultimate limits on performance for noisy communication systems1. Accurate models of physical communication devices must include quantum effects, but these typically make the theory intractable2,3,4,5. As a result, communication capacities—the maximum possible rates of data transmission—are not known, even for transmission between two users connected by an electromagnetic waveguide with Gaussian noise6. Here we present an exactly solvable model of communication with a fully quantum electromagnetic field. This gives explicit expressions for all point-to-point capacities of noisy quantum channels, with implications for quantum key distribution and fibre-optic communications. We also develop a theory of quantum communication networks by solving some rudimentary models including broadcast and multiple-access channels. We compare the predictions of our model with the orthodox Gaussian model and in all cases find agreement to within a few bits. At high signal-to-noise ratios, our simple model captures the relevant physics while remaining amenable to exact solution."

https://openalex.org/W2071664071,"Force production by kinesins has been linked to structural rearrangements of the N and C termini of their motor domain upon nucleotide binding. In recent crystal structures, the Kar3-associated protein Vik1 shows unexpected homology to these conformational states even though it lacks a nucleotide-binding site. This conservation infers a degree of commonality in the function of the N- and C-terminal regions during the mechanochemical cycle of all kinesins and kinesin-related proteins. We tested this inference by examining the functional effects on Kar3Vik1 of mutating or deleting residues in Vik1 that are involved in stabilizing the C terminus against the core and N terminus of the Vik1 motor homology domain (MHD). Point mutations at two moderately conserved residues near the Vik1 C terminus impaired microtubule gliding and microtubule-stimulated ATP turnover by Kar3Vik1. Deletion of the seven C-terminal residues inhibited Kar3Vik1 motility much more drastically. Interestingly, none of the point mutants seemed to perturb the ability of Kar3Vik1 to bind microtubules, whereas the C-terminal truncation mutant did. Molecular dynamics simulations of these C-terminal mutants showed distinct root mean square fluctuations in the N-terminal region of the Vik1 MHD that connects it to Kar3. Here, the degree of motion in the N-terminal portion of Vik1 highly correlated with that in the C terminus. These observations suggest that the N and C termini of the Vik1 MHD form a discrete folding motif that is part of a communication pathway to the nucleotide-binding site of Kar3."
https://openalex.org/W2036659029,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as chronic myelogenous (CML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML) are frequently induced by tyrosine kinase oncogenes. Although these MPNs are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, patients often relapse upon withdrawal of therapy. We used a model of MPN, which is induced by co-expression of the oncoproteins HIP1/PDGFβR (H/P) and AML1/ETO from their endogenous loci, to examine the mechanisms of disease development and recurrence following imatinib withdrawal. Although the MPN displayed a full hematologic response to imatinib, 100% of the diseased mice relapsed upon drug withdrawal. MPN persistence was not due to imatinib resistance mutations in the H/P oncogene or massive gene expression changes. Within 1 week of imatinib treatment, more than 98% of gene expression changes induced by the oncogenes in isolated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ immunophenotype) normalized. Supplementation of imatinib with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or arsenic trioxide reduced MPN-initiating cell frequencies and the combination of imatinib with arsenic trioxide cured a large fraction of mice with MPNs. In contrast, no mice in the imatinib-treated control cohorts were cured. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of arsenic trioxide and imatinib can eliminate refractory MPN-initiating cells and reduce disease relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2003007293,"DNA damage repair response is a crucial process for cancer prevention. One of the key regulators of this process is ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which modulates the p53 level by direct and indirect phosphorylation. Recent data showed that ATM also localizes at the centrosome, but the function remains elusive. TAX1BP2 was initially identified as a novel centrosomal protein that interacts directly with the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-encoded oncoprotein, Tax, and inhibits centrosome overduplication. Subsequently, TAX1BP2 was found to be a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, and accumulation of TAX1BP2 was observed upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Here, we provide evidence that TAX1BP2 is a direct phosphorylation substrate of ATM. The protein level of TAX1BP2 is significantly upregulated in response to DNA damaging agents. Serine-922 of TAX1BP2 is the phosphorylation site of ATM, and such phosphorylation modulates the protein stability, ubiquitination and tumor suppressor activity of TAX1BP2. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that TAX1BP2 is a novel effector of ATM in DNA damage response and delineated a new mechanism by which ATM stabilizes the tumor suppressor TAX1BP2."
