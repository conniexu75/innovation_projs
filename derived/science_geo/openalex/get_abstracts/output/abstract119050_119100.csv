https://openalex.org/W2051891646,"Mutations in the COX17 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cause a respiratory deficiency due to a block in the production of a functional cytochrome oxidase complex. Because cox17 mutants are able to express both the mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase, the Cox17p most likely affects some late posttranslational step of the assembly pathway. A fragment of yeast nuclear DNA capable of complementing the mutation has been cloned by transformation of the cox17 mutant with a library of genomic DNA. Subcloning and sequencing of the COX17 gene revealed that it codes for a cysteine-rich protein with a molecular weight of 8,057. Unlike other previously described accessory factors involved in cytochrome oxidase assembly, all of which are components of mitochondria, Cox17p is a cytoplasmic protein. The cytoplasmic location of Cox17p suggested that it might have a function in delivery of a prosthetic group to the holoenzyme. A requirement of Cox17p in providing the copper prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase is supported by the finding that a cox17 null mutant is rescued by the addition of copper to the growth medium. Evidence is presented indicating that Cox17p is not involved in general copper metabolism in yeast but rather has a more specific function in the delivery of copper to mitochondria.

Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal complex of mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains (1Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-336Google Scholar), makes use of two different types of electron carriers. One is the central iron of the heme A prosthetic groups of cytochromes a and a3. Each cytochrome has an associated copper center, composed either of one or two copper ions. The ligands for the two heme A groups are contributed exclusively by subunit 1 of the enzyme, and those for copper are shared by subunits 1 and 2 (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Google Scholar, 3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar). Because the synthesis of heme A from protoheme occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane (4Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Google Scholar, 5Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598Google Scholar), this prosthetic group is made available at the site of its utilization during assembly of the complex. Copper, however, must be imported from the cytoplasm in amounts commensurate with its requirement in mitochondria; most of the metal is probably used for cytochrome oxidase. It is unlikely that intracellular copper, whether cytoplasmic or mitochondrial, exists as a free solute. Instead, copper and other trace heavy metals are more likely to be complexed to storage proteins, carriers, and metalloenzymes. The routes used for the intracellular distribution of copper in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are only now beginning to be discerned. External copper is imported into yeast by an ATP-dependent pump encoded by CTR1 (6Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar). One of the better understood routes of internalized copper uses the products of CCC2 (7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar) and FET3 (8Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar). CCC2 has been shown to code for a cytoplasmic protein of yeast that transfers copper to a membrane-bound ceruloplasmin-like oxidase encoded by FET3 (7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar, 8Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Google Scholar). Mature Fet3p is a constituent of the cytoplasmic membrane and is distinct from the high-affinity iron transporter but is essential for iron uptake in yeast (6Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar, 7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Even though mutations in CCC2 produce a respiratory defective phenotype, it is not clear whether this is because Ccc2p also functions on the pathway of copper transport to mitochondria or whether this is secondary to an iron deficiency. That copper delivery by Cccp2 is selective, rather than general, is supported by the observation that the total concentration of copper is not significantly different in ccc2 mutants and in wild-type cells, and that such mutants have normal cytoplasmic copper-dependent superoxide dismutase (7Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized a pet mutant (nuclear respiratory-deficient mutant of yeast) assigned previously to complementation group G74. The failure of the mutant to assemble functional cytochrome oxidase is corrected by high concentrations of exogenous copper, indicating that the lesion limits the availability of copper during assembly of the complex. The responsible gene, referred to as COX17, has been cloned and shown to code for a cysteine-rich cytoplasmic protein. Cox17p is not involved in copper uptake in yeast but rather appears to function in the pathway responsible for copper delivery to mitochondria.

This plasmid was obtained from Dr. Andrew Dancis, National Institutes of Health. Open table in a new tab Wild-type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone), and mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Faye et al. (12Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Google Scholar), except that Glusulase was replaced by Zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) to prepare spheroplasts. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide, as described previously (13Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). Cytochrome spectra of mitochondrial extracts were obtained at room temperature. Cytochrome oxidase activity was measured by following oxidation of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm (13Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). The wild-type COX17 gene was cloned by transformation of the cox17 mutant C129/U1 by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (14Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). The library used for the transformation was constructed from partial Sau3A1 fragments of nuclear DNA (averaging 7–10 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)orfopen reading framePCRpolymerase chain reaction.) cloned into the BamHI site of the shuttle vector YEp24 (15Botstein D.

Approximately 5 × 108 cells were transformed with 100 µg of plasmid DNA. The transformation yielded 105 Ura+ clones, of which 9 were respiratory competent. Two transformants had identical plasmids (pG74/T2 and pG74/T3). A third transformant was found to have a plasmid (pG74/T8) with a smaller insert completely included in pG74/T2. kilobase pair(s) open reading frame polymerase chain reaction. To create a gene expressing Cox17p with a biotinylation site at its carboxyl terminus (16Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Google Scholar), the termination codon of COX17 was destroyed and replaced by a PstI site. The two primers used to amplify the modified gene were each 24 nucleotides long and included the sequence from −99 to the termination codon. The amplified fragment was digested with a combination of HindIII (site upstream of the coding sequence) and PstI and cloned into YEp352-Bio7 (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar). The resultant construct consisted of 99 nucleotides 5′ to the initiation codon plus the entire COX17 coding sequence fused in-frame to the 270-nucleotide fragment coding for the in vivo biotinylation signal sequence. Since the modified gene containing only 99 nucleotides of the 5′ sequence was not efficiently expressed, the construct was further modified by the addition of a 750-base pair HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pG74/ST4 (Fig. 4). The newer construct with 550 nucleotides of upstream sequence was also transferred to the integrative vector YIp352 (17Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from Escherichia coli (18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast nuclear DNA and the conditions for the Southern hybridizations were as described by Myers et al. (19Myers A.M. Pape K.L. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Google Scholar), except that probes were labeled by random priming (20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Immunodetection of proteins on Western blot was carried out with 125I-labeled protein A (23Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). C129 is a single mutant of complementation group G74 of our pet mutant collection (10Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). The phenotype of this mutant suggests that the respiratory deficiency stems from a specific defect in cytochrome oxidase. The mutant shows a substantial decrease in cytochromes a and a3 but not in cytochrome b (Fig. 1A). The cytochrome oxidase deficiency was also confirmed by direct measurements of enzyme activity (data not shown). The respiratory deficiency in C129 is complemented by a ρo (cytoplasmic petite mutant lacking mitochondrial DNA) tester strain indicating that the cytochrome oxidase defect is the result of a recessive mutation in a nuclear gene. This gene has been named COX17, in keeping with the nomenclature adopted previously in designating nuclear genes required for expression of yeast cytochrome oxidase (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar). The low level of cytochrome oxidase seen in the spectrum of C129 is a consequence of the C129 mutant allele. This is supported by the phenotype of a strain containing a null mutation in the COX17 gene, which lacks any detectable a-type cytochromes (Fig. 1A) as well as cytochrome oxidase activity. In vivo labeling of the mitochondrially encoded subunits indicated that their synthesis is not affected in the mutants (data not shown). Western blot analysis of the subunits synthesized in the cytoplasm also precludes an involvement of the gene in expression or import of these proteins (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that Cox17p was likely to be involved in the addition/synthesis of a prosthetic group or in the assembly of the subunits. To clone the gene carrying the mutation in C129, a derivative strain, C129/U1, with a ura3 mutation, was transformed with a yeast genomic library as described under “Materials and Methods.” Three of the uracil-independent and respiratory-competent clones obtained from the transformation were found to have plasmid with related inserts of yeast nuclear DNA. The region responsible for complementation of C129/U1 was mapped to a 700-base pair XbaI-NheI fragment (Fig. 2). The sequence of this region, obtained from both DNA strands, is shown in Fig. 3. A search in GenBank indicated that the cloned fragment overlaps with a sequence reported previously to code for an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (25Ripmaster T.L. Vaughn G.P. Woolford Jr., J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11131-11135Google Scholar). The sequence from NheI to the XbaI site (Fig. 4) contained four open reading frames (orfs 1–4) of sufficient length to qualify as the complementing gene. The four frames overlap with one another and are located near the NheI site. Two of the frames (orfs 1 and 2) are encoded in the same strand as the helicase, while the other two (orfs 3 and 4) are in the opposite strand (Fig. 4). The candidacy of orf4 as the complementing gene was excluded by subclone pG74/ST2, which contained only this frame in its entirety but failed to complement. Neither pG74/ST2 nor any of the other subclones, however, discriminated among the other three possible genes. To distinguish which of the three was responsible for the complementation, two additional subclones were obtained by PCR amplification. Only pG74/ST8 complemented C129/U1. The failure of pG74/ST7 to complement the mutant eliminated orf1 as the gene.Fig. 3Sequence of the COX17 gene obtained from pG74/ST6. A partial sequence of the insert subcloned in pG74/ST6 is presented. Only the sense strand is shown, and the reading frame proposed to code for Cox17p has been translated. The EcoRI site used to create the disrupted cox17::TRP1 allele is underlined. The Cys → Tyr mutation present in C129 is indicated in brackets above the amino acid sequence. This sequence has been deposited with.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The almost complete overlap of orf2 and orf3 made further subcloning impractical. To identify which of the two reading frames encodes the gene of interest, each frame was fused to a sequence containing the biotinylation site of a bacterial transcarboxylase (see “Materials and Methods”). Since this sequence is also recognized as a biotinylation signal by yeast, it was possible to determine whether both or only one of the two frames is expressed. Multicopy plasmids containing the fusion genes were used to transform a strain with a disrupted copy of orf2 and orf3 (W303ΔCOX17; see below). Single transformants verified to harbor each fusion construct were grown up under derepressed conditions, and both the mitochondria and postmitochondrial supernatant fractions were assayed for the presence of a novel biotinylated protein (Fig. 5). The results of these analyses failed to show the presence of a new biotinylated protein in either fraction of the transformant containing orf2 fused to the biotinylation signal sequence. The transformant harboring the orf3 fusion, however, had an abundant novel biotinylated protein of Mr 16,000. This product was found exclusively in the postmicrosomal supernatant fraction. The size of the new biotinylated protein is in agreement with the expected size of the protein expected to be translated from the orf3 fusion gene. The finding that only the orf3 fusion was capable of being expressed in vivo provided strong evidence for the identity of this frame as the COX17 gene. COX17 encodes an acidic protein of 69 amino acids with a high content of cysteine (10%) residues (Fig. 3). The sequence is very hydrophilic, consistent with its properties. The mutation in C129 was determined by sequence analysis of two independent clones obtained by PCR amplification of nuclear DNA prepared from this mutant. A comparison of the PCR-generated sequences with that of the wild-type gene indicated a single mutation at codon 57 of the gene, resulting in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution. A null allele of COX17 was created by insertion of the yeast TRP1 gene at the EcoRI site internal to the coding sequence (Fig. 6). The disrupted allele was isolated on a linear fragment and was used to transform the respiratory-competent haploid strains W303-1A and W303-1B. Two respiratory deficient and tryptophan prototrophic clones (W303ΔCOX17 and aW303ΔCOX17) obtained from the transformation were verified by genomic Southern analysis to have acquired the disrupted cox17::TRP1 allele (Fig. 6). The respiratory-deficient phenotype of the two transformants was complemented by ρo strains but not by C129. W303ΔCOX17 strains exhibit a specific cytochrome oxidase deficiency similar to C129 (Fig. 1). As indicated above, the biotinylated product was detected in the postmicrosomal supernatant but not in mitochondria, suggesting that Cox17p is a cytoplasmic protein. Since the localization of Cox17p was done in a transformant containing the fusion gene on a multicopy plasmid, the possibility existed that overproduction of the protein interfered with its import into mitochondria. This was excluded by transformation of a COX17 null mutant with the same construct in an integrative vector (pG74/ST17). The presence in the transformant W303ΔCOX17/ST17 of the COX17-BIO gene, in a single copy at the URA3 locus, restored normal growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, indicating that the presence of the carboxyl-terminal extension with biotin does not significantly affect the activity of the protein (see also the spectrum in Fig. 1A). Analysis of the distribution of biotinylated Cox17p expressed from the chromosomally integrated COX17-BIO fusion also showed the protein to be present exclusively in the postmicrosomal supernatant fraction (Fig. 5). This fraction consists not only of the soluble cytoplasmic proteins of yeast but also contains proteins released from nuclei as a result of the fractionation procedure. A nuclear localization of the Cox17p was excluded since purified nuclei did not contain any biotinylated Cox17p (data not shown). The cytoplasmic localization of Cox17p precluded a chaperone-like function for this protein. The presence of near normal levels of the mature, cytoplasmically synthesized proteins in the mutant also strongly argue against a role of Cox17p in expression of this set of cytochrome oxidase subunit polypeptides. A cytoplasmic protein, however, could affect production of the functional complex if it were required for the synthesis or mitochondrial import of a prosthetic group or cofactor. The two known electron carriers of cytochrome oxidase are heme a and copper (1Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-336Google Scholar, 2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Google Scholar, 3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar). Since heme a is synthesized in mitochondria (5Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598Google Scholar), it is unlikely that Cox17p is involved in this process. The alternative possibility that Cox17p might be involved in copper metabolism, was tested by examining the effect of copper on growth of cox17 mutants on nonfermentable substrates as carbon sources. As shown in Fig. 7A, growth of the null strain W303ΔCOX17 was restored on ethanol/glycerol when the medium was supplemented with 0.4% copper. This effect was also seen at lower copper concentrations (0.1%), but the cells grew more slowly. Higher concentrations of copper (0.8%) were lethal to both the mutant and the wild-type strain. Even though CTR1 (structural gene for the copper transporter) on a high copy plasmid does not suppress the respiratory defect of the cox17 null mutant, it does substantially lower the concentration of copper (0.01%) needed to support growth on nonfermentable substrates (Fig. 7B). The ctr1 mutant and the cox17 mutant transformed with CTR1 on a high copy plasmid (W303ΔCOX17/ST19) both acquire respiratory competency in the presence of 0.01% copper in the medium (6Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Google Scholar; Fig. 7). The cox17 transformant, however, grows more slowly. The ability of copper to rescue the deficiency of the cox17 mutation is not general to cytochrome oxidase mutants. Copper supplemented media failed to elicit growth of a large number of different cytochrome oxidase mutants, including the sco1 mutant shown in Fig. 7. The SCO1 gene has been shown to be required for a posttranslational step during cytochrome oxidase assembly (27Schultze M. Rodel G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Google Scholar). The ability of copper to reverse the cytochrome oxidase defect in cox17 mutants strongly supported the idea that the encoded protein played an important role in delivery of copper to mitochondria. It was not excluded, however, that Cox17p might have a more general function in making copper available to other copper-bearing proteins of yeast such as the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase. The cytoplasmic enzyme is known to use copper as its prosthetic group (28Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Google Scholar). The superoxide dismutase activity was compared in wild-type and in several different pet strains, including the cox17 and ctr1 null mutants (Fig. 8). The ctr1 mutant, because of its impaired copper transport, fails to make active cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (30Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Google Scholar). The absence of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase in the ctr1 strain is confirmed by the results shown in Fig. 8. In contrast, the cox17 mutant shows the presence of superoxide dismutase activity, although it is somewhat lower than in the wild-type parent or in the mutant transformed with COX17. This partial decrease, also observed in another cytochrome oxidase deficient mutant (cox14), is probably a secondary effect of decreased cellular ATP in respiratory-defective mutants. The synthesis of cytochrome oxidase in S. cerevisiae is a complex process requiring the expression not only of the nuclearly and mitochondrially encoded subunits of the enzyme but also numerous other nuclear genes that code for factors involved in the processing of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase-specific pre-mRNAs (31Pel H.J. Tzagoloff A. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 139-146Google Scholar, 32Seraphin B. Simon M. Faye G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1455-1464Google Scholar), translation of the mitochondrial mRNAs for subunits 2 and 3 (33Costanzo M.C. Seaver E.C. Fox T.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3637-3641Google Scholar, 34Poutre C.G. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 637-647Google Scholar), and the assembly process itself, which to date remains poorly understood (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar, 27Schultze M. Rodel G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Google Scholar, 35McEwen J.E. Hong K.H. Park S. Preciado G.T. Curr.

The COX17 gene reported here does not appear to be important for either synthesis, import, or processing of the subunits but rather fits into the category of genes whose products intercede during the late stages of cytochrome oxidase assembly. There are currently half a dozen examples of such proteins (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar, 27Schultze M. Rodel G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Google Scholar, 35McEwen J.E. Hong K.H. Park S. Preciado G.T. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 9-14Google Scholar, 36Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Google Scholar). The COX17 gene described here is unusual because its product is a cytoplasmic protein. In contrast, all of the other genes currently known to affect cytochrome oxidase assembly code for proteins that are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where assembly occurs. The cytoplasmic localization of the COX17 product provided the initial clue that cox17 mutants might be deficient in mitochondrial copper. This is supported by the following observations. Copper-supplemented media can support growth of a cox17 null mutant on nonfermentable carbon sources. The concentration of copper required to rescue cox17, however, is at least one order of magnitude higher than that needed to promote growth of ctr1 mutants, which have lesions in the copper pump. Although the concentration of copper in the medium can be substantially reduced when the CTR1 gene is overexpressed in the cox17 mutant, the transformant nonetheless grows more slowly than ctr1 mutants under the same conditions. The differences in the copper-dependent growth of the two mutants suggests that the lesion in the cox17 strain is not related to copper uptake. The presence in cox17 mutants of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase, the activity of which depends on copper (28Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Google Scholar), provides additional evidence that Cox17p is not essential for copper uptake. Since the cox17 mutation appears to preferentially affect a copper enzyme of mitochondria, we propose that Cox17p functions on the pathway responsible for the delivery of copper to mitochondria (Fig. 9). Externally high concentrations of copper probably compensate for the absence of Cox17p by allowing the metal to passively diffuse into mitochondria as a result of higher concentrations of the metal in the cytoplasm. The primary sequence of Cox17p suggests that it may complex copper targeted for mitochondria through its cysteine residues, which make up 10% of the protein. The partial loss of function as a result of the Cys57 → Tyr substitution in C129 is consistent with this notion. The importance of heme A and copper as obligatory electron carriers of cytochrome oxidase is well established (1Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-336Google Scholar, 2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Google Scholar, 3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar). Less appreciated, however, are more recent findings indicating that the heme A and copper prosthetic groups probably also make a structural contribution by stabilizing the final assembled complex. In yeast, mutations interfering with heme A biosynthesis have a profound effect on cytochrome oxidase (4Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Google Scholar, 5Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598Google Scholar). The reduction in the steady-state levels of some subunits in such mutants suggests that heme A protects the holoenzyme, or partially assembled intermediates, against proteolytic degradation (4Nobrega M.P. Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14220-14226Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that mutations in the copper ligands of subunit 2 also destabilize the enzyme (37Speno H. Taheri M.R. Sieburth D. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25363-25369Google Scholar). This implies that mutations affecting the availability of copper for cytochrome oxidase synthesis should also increase turnover of the less stable subunits. Western analysis has revealed cox17 mutants to have severely reduced steady-state concentrations of subunits 1 and 2, a hallmark of mutants arrested in cytochrome oxidase assembly (11Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Google Scholar, 27Schultze M. Rodel G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Google Scholar, 34Poutre C.G. Fox T.D.

Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Google Scholar). This further supports the notion that copper contributes to the structural stability of the holoenzyme. We express our gratitude to Dr. Andrew Dancis of the National Institutes of Health for providing us with the ctr1 mutant, the CTR1 gene, and the procedure for assaying superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W2031967567,"An Alu element preceding the myeloperoxidase gene (MPO) contains four hexamer motifs related to the consensus recognition sequence for nuclear hormone receptors (AGGTCA), arranged as direct repeats with spacing of 2, 4, and 2 nucleotides (DR-2-4-2). Gel shift experiments and transient transfection assays demonstrate that these sequences include binding sites for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors and function in vivo to activate transcription of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. The first DR-2 elements of the series do not bind known receptors but do bind the SP1 transcription factor. Two alleles of the MPO gene exist that differ at one position within this element, resulting in one allele with and one without a strong SP1 binding site. The element with the SP1 site activates transcription by 25-fold in transient transfection assays, while the alternative allele confers severalfold less transcriptional activity. Most cases of acute myelocytic leukemia are homozygous for the allele with the SP1 binding site, suggesting this element plays an important role in regulating the MPO gene in myeloid leukemias. This MPO-Alu is a representative of an Alu subclass numbering ∼400,000 copies, suggesting many genes may be regulated by such elements.

This MPO-Alu is a representative of an Alu subclass numbering ∼400,000 copies, suggesting many genes may be regulated by such elements. The human genome contains up to one million copies of a sequence element known as the Alu repeats, comprising ∼5% of the DNA. These elements are potentially functional class III genes, transcribable by RNA polymerase III, originally derived from a 7SL gene. During the preceding 30–50 million years of primate evolution, Alu transcripts were converted into cDNA by a reverse transcription mechanism and reinserted randomly throughout the genome in retroposon fashion. An evolutionary lineage of highly conserved Alu source genes is thought to have provided the transcripts, which were converted into retroposons (1Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Hutchison III, C.A. Edgell M.H. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 307-311Google Scholar, 2Britten R.J. Baron W.F. Stout D.B. Davidson E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4770-4774Google Scholar). The Alu elements can be grouped into several subfamilies, each representing the progeny of one Alu source gene. The degree of sequence divergence within an Alu subfamily is a measure of the time elapsed since those Alu retroposons were introduced into the genome, with subgroups I-IV representing the oldest to the most recent retroposition events. There has long been suggestive evidence that Alus or other polymerase III genes may function in gene regulation (3Britten R.J. Davidson E.H. Science. 1969; 165: 349-357Google Scholar, 4Britten R.J.

We reported that a major class of Alu elements (subclass III-IV) has evolved to encode a composite hormone response element (HRE) 1The abbreviations used are: HREhormone response elementRAretinoic acidRARretinoic acid receptorTRthyroid hormoneCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseAMLacute myelocytic leukemia(s)APLacute promyelocytic leukemia(s)TRET3 response elementRXRretinoid X receptorRAREretinoic acid receptor elementPCRpolymerase chain reactionDRdirect repeatsbpbase pair(s). overlapping the internal promoter of the Alu (7Vansant G. Reynolds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8229-8233Google Scholar). These several hexamer sequences are related to a consensus binding site, AGGTCA, recognizable by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, including receptors for retinoic acid (RA) (RAR), thyroid hormone (T3) (TR), vitamin D (VDR), steroids, and a number of orphan receptors for which a ligand has not yet been identified (13Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar, 14Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Google Scholar, 15Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Google Scholar, 16Pfahl M. Apfel R. Bendik I. Fanjul A. Graupner G. Lee M.O. La-Vista N. Lu X.P. Piedrafita J. Ortiz M.A. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 327-382Google Scholar). Most of these nuclear receptors recognize two adjacent hexamer half-sites that can be arranged as direct repeats (DR), palindromes, or inverted palindromes. The spacing and orientation of the half-sites is a major determinant of receptor binding specificity (17Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Google Scholar, 18Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Google Scholar, 19Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). Receptors can bind DNA as monomers to a single half-site, as homodimers to two adjacent half-sites, or as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RAR/TR family requires heterodimerization with RXRs for effective DNA binding and function (20Zhang X.-K. Hoffmann B. Tran P. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Google Scholar, 21Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 446-449Google Scholar, 22Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M.

An Alu preceding the human keratin K18 gene was shown to contain four half-sites oriented as direct repeats and spaced by 2 base pairs (DR-2) (7Vansant G. Reynolds W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8229-8233Google Scholar), consistent with the binding characteristics of RAR-RXR. DNA binding and transfection studies confirmed that these sites included two overlapping retinoic acid response elements (RARE), which were recognized by RAR-RXR heterodimers and functioned as positive activators of CAT gene expression in transient transfection assays. Those findings and previous studies (25Thorey I.S. Cecena G. Reynolds W.F. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Google Scholar) implicated this Alu-RARE in the regulation of the keratin K18 gene. Alu elements with encoded HREs could thus represent mobile enhancers containing recognition sites for RARs or other types of nuclear receptors. Random insertion of hundreds of thousands of these elements during primate evolution is likely to have affected the regulation of numbers of genes and may have represented an important source of genomic plasticity. To obtain evidence as to the extent to which Alu-HREs regulate neighboring genes, a literature search was performed that revealed a number of Alu elements with potential regulatory function, one being upstream of the human myeloperoxidase gene (MPO) (26Austin G.E. Lam L. Zaki S.R. Chan W.C. Hodge T. Hou J. Swan D. Zhang W. Racine M. Whitsett C. Brown T. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1993; 7: 1445-1450Google Scholar). The MPO gene is expressed specifically in the myeloid lineage (27Bainton D.F. Ullyot J.L. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 134: 907-934Google Scholar). The encoded myeloperoxidase enzyme is localized in lysosomal vesicles and catalyzes the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions to form hypoclorous acid, a potent antibacterial agent and generator of oxidizing free radicals (28Klebanoff S.J. Annu. Int. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Google Scholar, 29Ramos C.L. Pou S. Rosen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1079-1084Google Scholar). The MPO gene is transcribed in the early stages of myeloid cell differentiation, myeloblasts, and promyelocytes; transcription ceases when these cells differentiate into mature granulocytes or monocytes/macrophages (27Bainton D.F. Ullyot J.L. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 134: 907-934Google Scholar, 30Yamada M. Kurahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3021-3025Google Scholar, 31Tobler A. Miller C.W. Johnson K.R. Selsted M.E.

Blood. 1985; 65: 484-491Google Scholar). MPO is also expressed in acute myelocytic leukemic cells, which represent a clonal expansion of early myeloid cells blocked in their ability to differentiate. Acute myelocytic leukemias (AML) account for 46% of all major leukemias and are subdivided into six subtypes, M1 through M6, distinguishable by cytochemical, morphological, and immunological characteristics (34Bennett J.M. Catovsky D. Daniel M.T. Flandrin G. Galton D.A. Gralnick H.R. Sultan C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1985; 103: 620-625Google Scholar). While the myeloperoxidase gene is expressed in all six subtypes of AML, the levels of expression vary considerably with the highest level seen in M3, or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (35Zaki S.R. Austin G.E. Swan D. Srinivasan A. Ragab A.H. Chan W.C. Blood. 1989; 74: 2096-2102Google Scholar). This M3-APL subtype is associated with a chromosomal translocation t(15:17) fusing the PML gene to the RARα gene. The resultant PML-RAR fusion protein retains most of the functional domains of the parental proteins (36Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K. Warrell Jr., R.P. Frankel S.R. Murty V.V.V.S.

Most clinical cases of APL can be driven into remission by treatment with all-trans RA (40Huang M.E. Ye Y.C. Chen S.R. Chai J.R. Lu J.X. Zhoa L. Gu L.J. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Google Scholar). A single A/G base transition within the Alu element preceding the MPO gene was previously reported to be associated with most cases of AML (26Austin G.E. Lam L. Zaki S.R. Chan W.C. Hodge T. Hou J. Swan D. Zhang W. Racine M. Whitsett C. Brown T. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1993; 7: 1445-1450Google Scholar). We noted that this base difference was within the HRE region, and the AML-associated residue resulted in an improved fit to the half-site consensus sequence. This raised the possibility that this base transition enhanced binding by a nuclear receptor or other transcription factor, altering MPO gene expression in a way that might potentiate the development of AML. To investigate this possibility, we tested the ability of several nuclear receptors to bind these elements and activate transcription in vivo. Our results indicate that the MPO-associated Alu includes a RARE as well as a T3 response element (TRE). Interestingly, a strong binding site for the general transcription factor SP1 is created by the single base difference associated with acute myelocytic leukemia. The oligonucleotides encoding the different response elements from the Alu sequence were annealed and inserted upstream of the CAT gene in the pBLCAT2 vector between the SalI and XbaI sites (41Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). One copy of each response element was present as verified by DNA sequencing. The receptor expression vectors used in this study, pECE-RARα, pECE-RXRα, and pECE-TRα, have been described elsewhere (20Zhang X.-K. Hoffmann B. Tran P. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Google Scholar and references therein). CV-1 cells (104 cells/well) were plated in 96 well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were transfected 24 h later by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The transfection mixture contained 100 ng of reporter pBLCAT2 plasmids and the indicated receptor expression vectors. The amount of total DNA was adjusted to 200 ng with pBluescript. 24 h after DNA addition, the medium was removed, and the cells were treated with retinoic acid (1 µM) or thyroid hormone (T3) (0.1 µM) for an additional 24-h period prior to harvesting. CAT activity was assayed by a standard phase extraction method using [3H]acetyl coenzyme A and chloramphenicol and normalized against total protein concentration. NB4 cells (42Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For transient transfections, cells were electroporated using 2 × 106 cells in 400-µl and 50-µg reporter pBLCAT2 plasmids, using a BTX electroporator (capacitance, 500 microfarads; 200 V; pulse length, 20 ms). Receptor proteins were produced by in vitro transcription-translation from the corresponding linearized pBluescript vector using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) as described previously (43Zhang X. Tran P. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1909-1920Google Scholar, 44Piedrafita F.J. Bendik I. Ortiz M.A. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 563-577Google Scholar). To normalize for amounts of proteins, reactions containing [35S]methionine were performed in parallel, and the products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts were basically prepared as described (45Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1489Google Scholar). The final high salt extract was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Purified human SP1 was purchased from Promega. Proteins were incubated with 1 µg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) for 15 min at room temperature. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotides (20,000 cpm) were then added, and incubation continued for 20 min at room temperature. A 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel was used to analyze the protein-DNA complexes (44Piedrafita F.J. Bendik I. Ortiz M.A. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 563-577Google Scholar). When antibodies were used, proteins were mixed with 1 µl of non-immune serum, polyclonal αRXR (kindly donated by A. Lombardo and K. Ely), or αSP1 (Santa Cruz) for 30 min on ice before incubation with the DNA. In the competition experiments, the indicated amounts of nonlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction together with the poly(dI-dC). PCR was performed with 200 ng of genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes or bone marrow lymphocytes, with 0.5 µg of each primer in a 50-µl reaction volume containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM nucleotides, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus). Nested primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were synthesized to amplify a region extending from position +310 within the myeloperoxidase gene to position −829 bp. The first primer set was 5′-CTTGGTCCTGCGCCCACAGTCCCC-3′ and 5′-TCCCACCTTGGGAACTGTTACCTG-3′, and the second set was 5′-GCTGCCCATTGGGTGGCTGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-AGAGGGCTGGGGCGTGGCCAGAAT-3′. The cycling conditions were 94°C for 6 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min. 10 µl of the first reaction was used in a second PCR reaction with the second primer set, internal to the first set. The resultant 1129-bp PCR product was electrophoresed in agarose gels and purified. The PCR products were sequenced directly or, in some cases, ligated into a plasmid vector prior to sequencing. Each blood sample was analyzed at least twice. The DNA sequences preceding the MPO gene (26Austin G.E. Lam L. Zaki S.R. Chan W.C. Hodge T. Hou J. Swan D. Zhang W. Racine M. Whitsett C. Brown T. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1993; 7: 1445-1450Google Scholar, 46Hashinaka K. Nishio C. Hur S.J. Sakiyama F. Tsunasawa S. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5906-5914Google Scholar) include a ∼300-bp Alu element situated between positions −200 and −505 (Fig. 1A). A previous report suggested that a G residue at position −463 was associated with AML more often than an A residue (Fig. 1B). That site is within a region of four potential hexamer half-sites, related to the consensus AGGTCA, located between positions −436 and −467, with the fourth half-site overlapping the B box internal promoter element of the Alu gene (Fig. 1C). All four half-sites are oriented as direct repeats with the first two separated by two base pairs (DR-2), typical of RARE; the second and third half-sites are DR-4, consistent with TRE, and the third and fourth half-sites are again DR-2 (Fig. 1C). The third and fourth half-sites fit the consensus HRE sequence (Fig. 1D), while the first and second half-sites are nonconsensus at positions four and three, respectively. The G/A base difference associated with AML is at position 5 of the first potential half-site, and the G residue creates a better fit to the HRE consensus (19Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Google Scholar). The A/G transition at position −463 in acute myelocytic leukemias has been suggested to arise by somatic mutation (26Austin G.E. Lam L. Zaki S.R. Chan W.C. Hodge T. Hou J. Swan D. Zhang W. Racine M. Whitsett C. Brown T. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1993; 7: 1445-1450Google Scholar). Alternatively, this could represent allelic polymorphism in the population, with a preference for the G allele in leukemic cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the sequences of DNA isolated from lymphocytes from 18 AML patients and 44 control blood donors. Nested oligonucleotide primers were designed to allow PCR amplification of sequences extending from −829 to +310 of the MPO gene. Sequence analysis showed that 50% of the normal donors (22 of 44) were homozygous for the G residue at position −463, 18 were heterozygous, and 4 were homozygous for the A residue, indicating an allelic polymorphism. Examination of the DNA sequences from the AML samples revealed that 13 out of 18, or 72%, were homozygous for the G residue at −463, indicating a preference for that allele. This preference was most pronounced in the M3 and M4 subclasses (6 of 7, or 85%). The M3 subclass produces the highest levels of MPO gene expression, severalfold above that of M4 and M2, and as much as 20-fold above the levels seen in M1 and M5 (35Zaki S.R. Austin G.E. Swan D. Srinivasan A. Ragab A.H. Chan W.C. Blood. 1989; 74: 2096-2102Google Scholar). This suggests a correlation between the G-containing allele and AMLs with high levels of MPO gene expression. In this study, the allele with the G residue at position −463 is designated AML, while the allele with A at position −463 is designated MPO (Fig. 1B). The composite MPO-Alu HRE contains two DR-2 elements, which are potential RAREs, and one DR-4 element, a potential TRE. To assay the ability of the Alu DR-2/DR-4 elements to function as RARE or TRE, these were inserted upstream of the CAT reporter gene in the pBLCAT2 vector. The pBLCAT2 reporter constructs containing the composite HRE, or the individual DR-2 or DR-4 elements (Fig. 1C), were transiently transfected into CV-1 cells in the presence or absence of cotransfected expression vectors encoding RARα and RXRα (Fig. 2A). The AML12 element activated transcription of the CAT gene by 25-fold in the presence of both RAR and RXR expression constructs and all-trans RA. This level of activation was severalfold higher than that obtained with MPO12. The other DR-2 element, MPO34, produced a ∼35-fold transcriptional activation in the presence of cotransfected receptors and RA. In the absence of cotransfected RAR/RXR, 2–3-fold lower levels of activation were observed for both AML12 and MPO34. The DR-4 element, MPO23, had little to no effect on CAT gene expression under these conditions. Curiously the activation obtained with the AML1234 element, containing all four half-sites, was significantly below the ∼60-fold predicted additive effect of the AML12 and MPO34 elements, suggesting competition or interference with binding or activation when all four overlapping half-sites are present. The activation obtained with AML1234 was about twice that obtained with the MPO1234 element. These findings establish that the DR-2 elements, AML12 and MPO34, function as strong activators of CAT gene expression in CV-1 cells and provide the greatest transactivation in the presence of cotransfected RAR and RXR as well as RA. To test the ability of the central DR-4 element, MPO23, to function as a TRE, CAT constructs carrying this element were transfected into CV-1 cells along with expression vectors for thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) and RXR in the presence or absence of thyroid hormone (T3). Under these conditions, the MPO23 element activated transcription by ∼7-fold in the presence of TR/RXR and T3, indicating the MPO23 element can function as a positive TRE (Fig. 2B). We analyzed the binding of several nuclear hormone receptors to the MPO-Alu sites using a gel retardation assay. In vitro translated proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing all four MPO half-sites in the presence or absence of in vitro synthesized RXR (Fig. 3A). TRα, TRβ, RAR(α, β,γ) formed strong complexes with the DNA. Binding was also found with the oncoprotein v-ErbA, a mutated form of TRα, but not with the TRα variant, TRα2. Binding by these receptors required the presence of RXR, consistent with previous studies (18Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Google Scholar, 20Zhang X.-K. Hoffmann B. Tran P. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Google Scholar, 47Hermann T. Hoffmann B. Piedrafita F.J. Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 55-65Google Scholar). The ARP-1 receptor, bound independently of RXR and TRα monomer, was also found. Binding to AML1234 was also investigated, and identical patterns were observed (data not shown). To determine which of the DR elements are recognized by these various receptors, the elements were tested as individual dimer sites in gel retardation experiments. The central DR4 element, MPO23, formed a strong complex with TRα, TRβ, and v-ErbA, all requiring RXR (Fig. 3B). TRα also formed a relatively weak monomer complex in the absence of RXR, and the mobility and intensity of this complex increased in the presence of 100 nM T3. ARP-1 bound independently of RXR, while RARα and TRα2 failed to bind (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the DR2 element, MPO34, formed a complex with all three isoforms of RAR, all requiring RXR, but did not bind TRα (Fig. 3C). The ARP-1 receptor bound in the presence or absence of RXRα. These findings are consistent with the known binding preferences of RAR-RXR for DR-2 elements and TR-RXR complexes for DR-4 elements. Surprisingly, the DR2 elements, AML12 and MPO12, did not form a complex with in vitro synthesized RARα-RXR (Fig. 3D) nor with the other isoforms, RARβ and RARγ (data not shown). This was unexpected since the AML12 element is a strong transcriptional activator of the CAT reporter gene in transfection assays and produced the highest level of transactivation in the presence of RAR-RXR expression vectors and RA (Fig. 2A). Other nuclear hormone receptors (ARP-1, TRs) were assayed and also failed to bind this potential DR-2 element (data not shown). Because AML12, and to a lesser extent MPO12, activates transcription of a CAT reporter gene in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2A), transcription factors recognizing these elements presumably exist in CV-1 cells. To test for such factors, nuclear extracts were prepared from cell lines including CV-1, NB4, CaSki, and HeLa, treated or untreated with 1 µM RA (Fig. 4A). These extracts were incubated with32P-labeled AML12 and MPO12 elements, and the protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Four complexes, termed I-IV, were observed with the MPO12 element, most clearly seen with the CaSki nuclear extracts. With AML12, only three of these complexes, I, II, and IV, were observed. The amount of complexes I, II, and IV formed was severalfold greater with the AML12 element than with MPO12, indicating the single base difference in the first half-site results in higher affinity binding. This single base difference also results in specific binding by complex III to the MPO12 element. Treatment with RA had no effect on the efficiency of complex formation with extracts from CV-1, CaSki, and HeLa cells. However, in the AML-M3-derived cell line, NB4 (42Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Google Scholar), RA treatment resulted in a strong inducement of complex III to MPO12, and also binding of complexes I, II, and IV to AML12 was increased. To test whether complexes I, II, III, and/or IV contain RAR or RXR, competition studies were performed. Binding of HeLa nuclear proteins to the AML12 element was competed by a 250-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing AML12 or MPO12 sequences (Fig. 4B), but binding was not competed by the MPO34 sequence, which binds RAR-RXR heterodimers (Fig. 4B and 3C). This argues that complexes I, II, and IV do not contain RAR-RXR heterodimers. Incubation of the labeled MPO34 element with HeLa nuclear extracts produced a complex with mobility equivalent to that of in vitro synthesized RARα and RXRα. This complex was not competed by an excess of unlabeled AML12 or MPO12, further indicating these elements do not bind RAR-RXR. As further evidence, we investigated the effect of several antibodies raised against RXRα, RARα/β/γ, TRα/β, and COUP. The binding of nuclear extracts to AML12 and MPO12 was not affected by incubation with any of these antibodies (data not shown), further confirming the absence of those receptors in the complexes observed with nuclear extracts. Examination of the AML12 sequence revealed a perfect match to a 10-base pair consensus binding site for the general transcription factor SP1 (48Dynan W.S. Tijan R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Google Scholar, 49Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The nucleotide difference between AML12 and MPO12 is within the core SP1 binding site, converting GGCGG to GGCGG. To investigate whether complexes I, II, III, and/or IV contain SP1 protein, purified SP1 was incubated with labeled AML12 and MPO12 elements. A single complex was observed that had a mobility equivalent to complex I. As observed with the nuclear extracts, SP1 binding efficiency was severalfold greater for AML12 than MPO12. These findings suggest that complex I contains the SPI transcription factor. To gain further evidence for the presence of SP1 in complex I, we tested the effect of anti-SP1 antibody on binding by purified SP1 protein and HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 5B). In both cases, the αSP1 antibody inhibited complex I formation and produced a supershifted complex. Complexes II and IV were also inhibited, although not as completely, suggesting these complexes may also contain an SP1-like protein. As controls, an antibody directed against RXR and non-"

It has previously been shown that one important mechanism by which TNF-α interferes with insulin signaling is through the serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which can then function as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor (IR). However, the receptors and the signaling pathway used by TNF-α that mediate the inhibition of IR activity are unknown. We show here that human TNF-α, which binds only to the murine p55 TNF receptor (TNFR), is as effective at inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 in adipocytes and myeloid 32D cells as murine TNF-α, which binds to both p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR. Likewise, antibodies that are specific agonists for p55 TNFR or p75 TNFR demonstrate that stimulation of p55 TNFR is sufficient to inhibit insulin signaling, though a small effect can also be seen with antibodies to p75 TNFR. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and ceramides, known to be formed by activation of p55 TNFR, inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells expressing IR and IRS-1 are sensitive to this inhibition, but cells expressing IR and IRS-2 are resistant, pointing to an important difference in the biological function between IRS-1 and IRS-2. These data strongly suggest that TNF-α inhibits insulin signaling via stimulation of p55 TNFR and sphingomyelinase activity, which results in the production of an inhibitory form of IRS-1.

INTRODUCTIONInsulin resistance is defined as a smaller than normal response to a given dose of insulin. It is also a ubiquitous correlate of obesity and a central component of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, likely representing a major causal link between these two disorders (1Olefsky J. Molina J. Rifkin H. Porte D.J. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1990: 121Google Scholar). Insulin resistance has been implicated in a wide range of pathological states such as dyslepidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disorders (2Bennet P. Rifkin H. Porte J.D. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1990: 357Google Scholar). Since as many as 30% of the adult population in the United States are obese, a better understanding of insulin resistance is an important scientific and medical goal. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of the close association between obesity and insulin resistance is very incomplete.Several lines of evidence indicate that TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorIRinsulin receptorIRSinsulin receptor substrateTNFRTNF receptorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a central role in the insulin resistance observed in obesity (3Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes from most if not all obese animals overexpress TNF-α relative to their lean counterparts (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar, 5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This observation has been extended to humans where expression of TNF-α is in strong positive correlation with the degree of obesity and the level of hyperinsulinemia, often taken as an indirect measure of insulin resistance (7Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 8Kern P. Saghizadeh M. Ong J. Bosch R. Deem R. Simsolo R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). More recently, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, TNF-α has also been shown to be overexpressed in muscle during obesity (9Saghizadeh M. Ong J.M. Garvey T.W. Henry R. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). TNF-α plays a causal role in the insulin resistance of experimental animals since neutralization of TNF-α in obese rats increases their insulin sensitivity (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar), probably due to the concomitant increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR in adipose tissue and muscle (10Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). TNF-α has been shown to interfere with insulin signaling by inhibiting IR tyrosine kinase activity in cell culture (11Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 12Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, it has recently been shown that TNF-α induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 14Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and this modified form of IRS-1 can function as an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro and in intact cells (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar).Despite the considerable evidence for a key role for TNF-α, the early steps by which this cytokine inhibits insulin signaling are unknown. TNF-α binds with high affinity to two receptors that possess totally different intracellular domains (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These receptors, p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR, are glycoproteins with a single transmembrane domain. Both proteins are devoid of any enzymatic activity but can associate with several different intracellular proteins (16Song H. Dunbar J. Zhang Y. Guo D. Donner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Although it seems clear that associated proteins play a role in the signal transduction by these receptors, their precise functions are unknown.The ability of p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR individually to mediate TNF-α signaling has been an area of active study. p75 TNFR binds TNF-α with a higher affinity and with a higher dissociation rate than p55 TNFR (Kd of 100 pM versus 500 pM and t1/2 of 10 min versus 3 h) (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The p55 TNFR has been implicated in many biological processes including lipopolysaccharide- and D-galactosamine-induced lethality and production of interleukin-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor in fibroblasts (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The p75 TNFR has been associated with several biological activities, including inhibition of early hematopoiesis, induction of cytokine production, activation of NF-κB, and at high abundance of p75 TNFR, cell death (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). At present, the role played by the individual TNF receptors in insulin resistance is not known.We show here that TNF-α inhibits insulin-induced IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in two cell lines that express the genes for both p55 and p75 TNF receptors. Using two different approaches, stimulation of p55 TNFR strongly inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1. An inhibition of IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed after treatment of the cells with sphingomyelinase and synthetic analogous of ceramide, mediators that have been linked to p55 TNFR. Similar to TNF-α, sphingomyelinase and ceramide convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Interestingly, this effect is very specific for IRS-1, since IRS-2 cannot serve as an inhibitor in this assay.DISCUSSIONSeveral recent lines of evidence now indicate that TNF-α is a very important link between insulin resistance and obesity. In addition to the data showing overexpression of TNF-α from adipose tissue of obese and insulin-resistant rodents (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar, 5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), new evidence indicates a tight correlation between obesity, insulin resistance, and TNF-α expression in humans (7Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 8Kern P. Saghizadeh M. Ong J. Bosch R. Deem R. Simsolo R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). That the relationship between TNF-α and insulin resistance is causal has been shown directly in animal neutralization studies. Using a soluble TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein designed to neutralize TNF-α, it has been shown that insulin resistance could be greatly reduced in obese Zucker fatty rats, along with an improvement in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia (10Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This correlated with a large increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both the IR and IRS-1, which are known to be affected during obesity and insulin resistance (10Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, treatment of adipocytes in culture with TNF-α induces a decrease in the tyrosine kinase activity of IR (11Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). An inhibition of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 has also been shown in cultured hepatoma cells (12Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is very likely that this inhibition of IR tyrosine kinase activity by TNF-α is a major mechanism by which TNF-α induces insulin resistance in obesity. Indeed, although several defects located at a postinsulin receptor level have been detected in obese animals, such as a decrease in the quantity of IR and of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter Glut4, it has been noted that none of them can explain the extent of insulin resistance in this disease (1Olefsky J. Molina J. Rifkin H. Porte D.J. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1990: 121Google Scholar, 28Sheperd P. Khan B. Moller D.E. Insulin Resistance. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 253Google Scholar). On the other hand, reduced tyrosine kinase activity of the IR, such as occurred under the action of TNF-α, has been noted in both animals and human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (29Saad M.J.A. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 30Thies R.S. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T. Freindenber G.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 250-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, induced tyrosine kinase activity would be expected to affect all subsequent actions of insulin (31White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which TNF-α inhibits IR tyrosine kinase activity and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 will provide insight into the the molecular basis of TNF-α-induced insulin resistance in obesity.One mechanism by which TNF-α interferes with the function of the IR appears to involve TNF-α-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 14Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 acts as an inhibitor of IR in vitro and is also associated with reduced IR activity in intact cells (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the first steps stimulated by TNF-α, which lead to the inhibition of IR tyrosine phosphorylation, were unknown. By using human TNF-α we observed that stimulation of p55 TNFR alone was sufficient to inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with the same potency of stimulation of both TNF receptors. Agonist antibodies to p55 TNFR induced a very similar effect. Activation of p75 TNFR alone by specific agonist antibodies also resulted in an inhibition of the IR signaling, though this effect is smaller compared with that induced by antibodies to p55 TNFR. Of course, it is possible that the difference in the magnitude of the effects of p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR antibodies resides in differences in their respective affinities for their ligands or in their stability. However, the fact that the two approaches yield similar results strongly suggests that stimulation of p55 TNFR is mainly responsible for the effect of TNF-α on IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. However, it is important to note that there is some reason to believe that p75 TNFR could play some role in vivo. First, the mRNA for p75 TNFR is dramatically increased (4.5-fold) (5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) in the adipose tissue of obese/insulin-resistant mice. Second, since the absolute levels of TNF-α are rather low in obesity (less than 100 pg/ml) (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar) and the p75 TNFR has a higher affinity for TNF-α, it could play a relatively more important role. The definitive role of these two receptors must include an analysis of insulin resistance in obese mice containing appropriate null alleles for both receptors (32Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P. Kronke M. Mak T. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar, 33Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lotscher H.

Nature. 1994; 372: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar).One of the signaling events triggered by p55 TNFR is the stimulation of a membrane-bound neutral sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide and choline (26Kolesnick R. Golde D. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 27Heller R.A. Krönke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We show here that ceramides and sphingomyelinase can also induce a decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1. At the molecular level, ceramide and sphingomyelinase convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase activity, as does TNF-α. These compounds have some specificity for IR signaling since they do not inhibit PDGF tyrosine phosphorylation in adipocytes nor do they modify IR and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in 32D-IR/IRS-2 cells. These data indicate that activation of sphingomyelinase and production of ceramides is likely to be a major pathway used by p55 TNFR to mediate IR inhibition. Ceramides directly activate various enzymes such as PKC-ζ (35Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K.

Chem. 1993; 269: 3047-3052Google Scholar) that phosphorylates and activates Raf-1 (38Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase that is a subtype of heterotrimeric phosphatase 2A (39Dobrowsky R. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the activation of a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events (26Kolesnick R. Golde D. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). It is likely that stimulation of these enzymes leads to modification of IRS-1 and subsequent inhibition of the IR.Since IRS-1 is a central component in the mechanism by which TNF-α inhibits IR signaling, it was of potential interest to investigate a role for IRS-2 in this process. IRS-2, also known as 4PS, exhibits substantial structural homology with IRS-1 (40Sun X.J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), and they also share similar biological function. Indeed, as does IRS-1, IRS-2 binds to Grb2, to the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and possesses potential binding sites for PTP-2C (40Sun X.J. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L.

Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, IRS-2 has been shown to be the alternative substrate of the IR in IRS-1-deficient mice (41Patty M.-E. Sun X.-J. Bruening J.C. Araki E. Lipes M.A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from Fig. 4, Fig. 5 that IRS-2 cannot replace IRS-1 in this inhibition. This is the first important difference observed in the function of IRS-1 and IRS-2, and this could be an important tool to understand the mechanism by which IRS-1 inhibits the IR upon TNF-α treatment of the cells. INTRODUCTIONInsulin resistance is defined as a smaller than normal response to a given dose of insulin. It is also a ubiquitous correlate of obesity and a central component of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, likely representing a major causal link between these two disorders (1Olefsky J. Molina J. Rifkin H. Porte D.J. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1990: 121Google Scholar). Insulin resistance has been implicated in a wide range of pathological states such as dyslepidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disorders (2Bennet P. Rifkin H. Porte J.D. Diabetes Mellitus. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1990: 357Google Scholar). Since as many as 30% of the adult population in the United States are obese, a better understanding of insulin resistance is an important scientific and medical goal. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of the close association between obesity and insulin resistance is very incomplete.Several lines of evidence indicate that TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorIRinsulin receptorIRSinsulin receptor substrateTNFRTNF receptorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a central role in the insulin resistance observed in obesity (3Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes from most if not all obese animals overexpress TNF-α relative to their lean counterparts (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar, 5Hofmann C. Lorenz K. Braithwaite S.S. Colca J.R. Palazuk B.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This observation has been extended to humans where expression of TNF-α is in strong positive correlation with the degree of obesity and the level of hyperinsulinemia, often taken as an indirect measure of insulin resistance (7Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 8Kern P. Saghizadeh M. Ong J. Bosch R. Deem R. Simsolo R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). More recently, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, TNF-α has also been shown to be overexpressed in muscle during obesity (9Saghizadeh M. Ong J.M. Garvey T.W. Henry R. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). TNF-α plays a causal role in the insulin resistance of experimental animals since neutralization of TNF-α in obese rats increases their insulin sensitivity (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar), probably due to the concomitant increase in the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR in adipose tissue and muscle (10Hotamisligil G.S. Budavari A. Murray D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). TNF-α has been shown to interfere with insulin signaling by inhibiting IR tyrosine kinase activity in cell culture (11Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 12Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the molecular level, it has recently been shown that TNF-α induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 14Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and this modified form of IRS-1 can function as an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro and in intact cells (13Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar).Despite the considerable evidence for a key role for TNF-α, the early steps by which this cytokine inhibits insulin signaling are unknown. TNF-α binds with high affinity to two receptors that possess totally different intracellular domains (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These receptors, p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR, are glycoproteins with a single transmembrane domain. Both proteins are devoid of any enzymatic activity but can associate with several different intracellular proteins (16Song H. Dunbar J. Zhang Y. Guo D. Donner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Although it seems clear that associated proteins play a role in the signal transduction by these receptors, their precise functions are unknown.The ability of p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR individually to mediate TNF-α signaling has been an area of active study. p75 TNFR binds TNF-α with a higher affinity and with a higher dissociation rate than p55 TNFR (Kd of 100 pM versus 500 pM and t1/2 of 10 min versus 3 h) (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The p55 TNFR has been implicated in many biological processes including lipopolysaccharide- and D-galactosamine-induced lethality and production of interleukin-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor in fibroblasts (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The p75 TNFR has been associated with several biological activities, including inhibition of early hematopoiesis, induction of cytokine production, activation of NF-κB, and at high abundance of p75 TNFR, cell death (15Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). At present, the role played by the individual TNF receptors in insulin resistance is not known.We show here that TNF-α inhibits insulin-induced IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in two cell lines that express the genes for both p55 and p75 TNF receptors. Using two different approaches, stimulation of p55 TNFR strongly inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1. An inhibition of IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also observed after treatment of the cells with sphingomyelinase and synthetic analogous of ceramide, mediators that have been linked to p55 TNFR. Similar to TNF-α, sphingomyelinase and ceramide convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Interestingly, this effect is very specific for IRS-1, since IRS-2 cannot serve as an inhibitor in this assay."

We investigated the intracellular signaling pathways activated in L929 cells by TNFα. TNFα robustly activates Jun kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. In addition, p42MAPK is activated, but a 10-fold greater concentration of TNFα was required for substantial MAPK activation than was needed for maximal JNK stimulation. Simultaneous treatment of L929 cells with fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) significantly reduced the apoptotic response to TNFα. FGF-2 substantially activated the Raf/MEK/MAPK (where MEK is mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) pathway but did not affect TNFα activation of JNK. These results indicate that although JNK may play an important role in transmitting the TNFα signal from the cell surface to the nucleus, activation of the JNK pathway is not sufficient to induce apoptosis. Expression of dominant-negative Asn-17 Ras in L929 cells diminished the FGF-2 stimulation of p42MAPK and eliminated the protective effect of FGF-2. Asn-17 Ras expression did not affect JNK activity and had no effect on TNFα activation of JNK. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK-1 activity by incubation of cells with the compound PD 098059 blocked p42MAPK activation and FGF-2 protection against apoptosis. Interestingly, activated Val-12 Ras expression substantially enhanced TNFα-mediated apoptosis in L929 cells, but Val-12 Ras did not constitutively activate MAPK in L929 cells and FGF-2 partially protected Val-12 Ras-expressing cells from TNFα-mediated apoptosis.

The primary structure of OFQ shares several sequence motifs with the opioid peptides that are known to be important for biological activity of the opioid peptides. In particular, the amino-terminal tetrapeptide Phe-Gly-Gly-Phe in OFQ is strikingly similar to the canonical sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe found in all natural mammalian opioid peptides. However, OFQ did not show any activity at the opioid receptors (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O.

It has been postulated that the opioid peptides primarily interact with a common binding site on their receptors via the amino-terminal pentapeptide moiety (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met/Leu in all mammalian species), whereas the carboxyl-terminal extensions are believed to determine their relative selectivities toward a specific subtype of opioid receptor. The notion of such a bipartite structure contained within the same molecule fostered the development of the so-called “message-address concept” (7Schwyzer R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 297: 3-26Google Scholar, 8Goldstein A. Schmidt F.O. Bird S.J. Bloom F.E. Molecular Genetic Neuroscience. Raven Press Ltd., New York1982: 249Google Scholar). According to this theory, the “message” domain consists of the amino-terminal Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe motif that can also serve as the minimally active structure and unequivocally defines such peptides as “with opiate-like activity.” The carboxyl-terminal extensions of the opioid peptides are supposed to contain the “address” part which determines their individual receptor selectivity without exerting biological activity on their own. The absence of interaction between OFQ and the opioid receptors and vice versa could indicate that OFQ interacts with its receptor via a mechanism different from that of the opioids with their receptors. In order to determine the structural components important for OFQ to activate its receptor, we investigated the pharmacological activity of a series of OFQ analogs. We also examined the contribution of each amino acid in OFQ to support a biologically active conformation of the peptide. Our data suggest that, in contrast to the opioid system, the OFQ receptor might recognize different parts of the OFQ molecule and seems to require the complete peptide structure for biological activity, thus leading to the observed selectivity. Orphanin FQ and all analogs were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Opioid peptides were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and non-peptidergic agonists and antagonists were purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). 125I-Labeled [Tyr14]orphanin and cAMP radioimmunoassay kits were obtained from Amersham Corp. Forskolin was purchased from Calbiochem, and HPLC columns and solvents were from Merck (Darmstadt, FRG). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck, Fluka, or Sigma. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The OFQ receptor was cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells as described previously (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A.

Colonies were selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and screened for expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and functional assays. Cells were cultured at 5% CO2 in α-modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 500 µg/ml G418. Mono- and diiodinated [Tyr14]orphanin were synthesized by the chloramine-T method and purified by HPLC (10Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µl of 0.1 mM [Tyr14]orphanin in 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 mM NaI in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 µl of a chloramine-T solution (1 mg/ml in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). After 30 s, 500 µl of Na2S2O3 (3 mg/ml in deionized water) was added, and the reaction mixture was loaded onto a LiChrospher RP select B HPLC column (125 × 3 mm) equilibrated with 11% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Reaction products were eluted with a linear gradient to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min while the effluent was monitored at 215 nm. Individual peaks were collected manually. The identity of the mono- and diiodinated species was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. Ligand binding assays were done in 96-well deep bottom microwell plates. CHO cells stably expressing the OFQ receptor were harvested and resuspended in 10 volumes of binding buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin.

Total membrane particulate was obtained after centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended and centrifuged twice as described above. Membranes were finally diluted in an appropriate volume of binding buffer and stored at −70°C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Incubation of membranes (10–18 mg of protein) with [125I-Tyr14]orphanin was performed at room temperature for 60 min in a total volume of 200 µl of binding buffer. For competition binding experiments 50,000 cpm of [125I-Tyr14]orphanin (62.5 pM) were added together with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 nM orphanin FQ. Bound and free ligand were separated by rapid vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel multichannel harvester. GF/C filters had been pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed six times with 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then counted in a gamma counter. All experiments were done at least three times in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed with the LIGAND software (11Munson P.J. Rodbart D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar), and curves were fitted with the Kaleidagraph software. Adenylyl cyclase assays were carried out as described previously (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Google Scholar). L-Alanine and D-amino acid-substituted orphanin peptides were initially tested at a single concentration of 1 µM. Some peptides were investigated in more detail to compare dose-response data with receptor binding data. For the investigation of potential antagonistic properties of OFQ analogs, peptides (all at 1 µM) were coadministered with 10 nM OFQ. To elucidate the involvement of G protein coupling in intracellular signal transduction, OFQ receptor-transfected CHO cells were plated in 24-well clusters and preincubated with 10 ng/ml pertussis toxin in culture medium for 18 h before testing. All experiments were done at least three times in triplicate. Dose-response curves were fitted and calculated with a Kaleidagraph. The effect of OFQ on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in OFQ receptor-transfected cells was completely abolished after pretreatment with 10 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the intracellular transduction of receptor activation might be mediated by a Gi/Go-like protein. In order to develop an analog of OFQ that would be suitable for radioiodination, we synthesized a series of tyrosine-substituted peptides and compared their biological activity with that of the authentic OFQ (for sequences see Table I). OFQ inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in CHO and HEK 293 cells expressing the OFQ receptor with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 1.05 ± 0.28 and 0.98 ± 0.11 nM, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table II). The exchange of tyrosine for Phe1 or Leu14, respectively, did not affect biological activity as measured in cAMP assays, whereas the substitution of Phe4 dramatically reduced the ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 1 and Table II). Since the amino-terminal domain of the opioid peptides is known to play a crucial role for their biological activity, we decided to use [Tyr14]orphanin as a substrate for radioiodination. In a “cold” labeling experiment we first synthesized both the mono- and diiodinated species, separated them on HPLC, and confirmed their identity by mass spectrometry ((M + H) = 1952 for [monoiodo-Tyr14]orphanin and (M + H) = 2078 for [diiodo-Tyr14]orphanin; data not shown). Both peptides were tested in cAMP assays. [monoiodo-Tyr14]orphanin retained full biological activity with an EC50 of 1.32 ± 0.79 nM, whereas the dose-response curve of the diiodinated analog was slightly shifted to the right showing an EC50 of 1.78 ± 0.5 nM (Fig. 1 and Table II). Consequently, [125I-Tyr14]orphanin was used as a radioligand in binding studies. [125I-Tyr14]orphanin bound to membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing the OFQ receptor in a saturable and displaceable manner with a Kd of 56.2 ± 7.3 pM and a Bmax of about 200 fmol/mg protein (data not shown). The Hill coefficient was close to unity in all experiments. Although [125I-Tyr14]orphanin is supposed to be an agonist at the OFQ receptor, we did not observe more than one affinity constant using the LIGAND program. OFQ inhibited the binding of [125I-Tyr14]orphanin to the OFQ receptor with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 0.19 ± 0.02 nM (Fig. 2 and Table II). The [Tyr1]- and [Tyr14]orphanin analogs also showed high potencies in inhibiting [125I-Tyr14]orphanin binding, with Ki values of 0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.68 ± 0.06 nM, respectively. In contrast, [Tyr4]orphanin displaced the tracer with about 9-fold lower potency (as compared with OFQ) at a Ki of 1.67 ± 0.25 nM. Dynorphin A, which is most closely related to OFQ, only showed weak potency at the OFQ receptor with a Ki of 449 ± 70 nM (Table II). A striking feature of OFQ is the occurrence of two Arg-Lys motifs in the primary structure (Table I). Such pairs of basic amino acids are known to serve as enzymatic cleavage sites during precursor maturation. This could indicate further processing of the peptide giving rise to additional peptides that might also be biologically active. We therefore examined carboxyl- and amino-terminally truncated analogs of OFQ for their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in OFQ receptor-transfected CHO cells and in competition binding experiments. Based on these assumptions, orphanin- (1Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O.

Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar) and orphanin-(1–7) were synthesized (Table I). By analogy to the opioid peptides, where the first five amino acids always contain the Leu- or Met-enkephalin sequence, orphanin-(1–5) was also synthesized and tested for biological activity. Finally, orphanin-(10–17) was synthesized to investigate the contribution of the carboxyl terminus toward receptor activation. As shown in Table II, orphanin-(1–11), -(1–7), and -(1–5) as well as orphanin-(10–17) were devoid of any biological activity up to concentrations of 10 µM. Furthermore, no antagonistic properties were detected with the truncated OFQ analogs (data not shown). A similar loss of potency was also observed for the truncated OFQ peptides when tested in competition binding experiments. While orphanin-(1–11) still displaced [125I-Tyr14]orphanin binding with a Ki of 138 ± 22 nM, orphanin-(1–7), orphanin-(1–5), and orphanin-(10–17) were inactive. We therefore concluded that the entire structure of OFQ seems to be necessary for biological activity and receptor binding. In order to investigate more precisely which structural components in orphanin FQ may be important for receptor activation and binding, a series of OFQ peptide analogs were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in OFQ receptor-transfected CHO cells and for their affinity to the OFQ receptor. In these experiments, the contribution of single amino acids to biological activity and binding potency was assessed by alanine- and D-amino acid-scannning mutagenesis of the natural peptide. In positions where alanine itself is already present in the primary structure, we chose serine as a substitute. Similarly, glycine was substituted by D-alanine in the D-amino acid scan. As shown in Fig. 3, in the alanine-substituted OFQ peptides, positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 appeared to be most critical for receptor activation as measured by their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. However, alanine substitution in these positions resulted in only a moderate decrease of binding potency, with Ki values still in the nanomolar range (Table II). Exchange of other carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues by alanine (positions 9–17) was less detrimental for biological activity and binding affinities. Similar results were obtained for the D-amino acid-substituted orphanin analogs. [D-Phe1]-, [D-Ala3]-, [D-Phe4]-, [D-Thr5]-, [D-Ala7]-, and [D-Arg8]orphanin were either unable to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in receptor-transfected cells or had a markedly reduced potency (Fig. 3). Again, the significant reduction in biological activity contrasted with their moderate reduction in binding affinity (Table II). Both structural and conformational changes of Arg12 yielded less active peptides, as compared with the authentic OFQ. In general, it was noticed that almost any alteration in the amino-terminal part of OFQ reduced the biological activity, whereas receptor binding potencies often did not reflect these differences. All alanine and D-amino acid-substituted peptides were also examined for potential antagonistic potency, expressed as their ability to reverse the effect of 10 nM orphanin FQ on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Only [D-Ala7]orphanin displayed a weak antagonism. As shown in Fig. 4, 100 nM [D-Ala7]orphanin coadministered with increasing concentrations of OFQ reduced the maximal inhibitory effect of OFQ on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation to about 50%, as compared with ∼80% for OFQ alone. However, when applied alone, [D-Ala7]orphanin also revealed agonistic behavior with an EC50 of 33.9 ± 2.4 nM but achieving only ∼35% inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Therefore, we conclude that [D-Ala7]orphanin is a partial agonist at the OFQ receptor. None of the other peptide analogs showed antagonist activity in these assays (data not shown). We have investigated the structural requirements for binding and receptor activation of orphanin FQ, a novel neuropeptide which is related to the opioid peptides. We have utilized a variety of OFQ analogs, representing either truncated peptides or alanine or D-amino acid substitutions. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of other bioactive peptides, like the enkephalins (12Beddell C.R. Clark R.B. Hardy G.W. Lowe L.A. Ubatuba F.B. Vane J.R. Wilkinson S. Chang K.-J. Cuatrecasas P. Miller R.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1977; 198: 249-265Google Scholar), dynorphin A (13Turcotte A. Lalonde J.M. Pierre S.S. Lemaire S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1984; 23: 361-367Google Scholar), dermorphin (14Darlak K. Gronzka Z. Krzascik P. Janicki P. Gumulka S.W. Peptides (Elmsford). 1984; 5: 687-689Google Scholar), or bradykinin (15Rudinger J. DeStevens G. Drug Design. Academic Press, New York1971: 319Google Scholar), has been shown useful in characterizing the contribution of the respective amino acid side chain to biological activity. Substitutions by D-amino acids introduce a conformational change in the peptide backbone and are therefore more suitable to detect the contribution of individual amino acids to the secondary structure of the peptide required for activity (16Paterson S.J. Kosterlitz H.W. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Neuropeptides. 1984; 5: 177-180Google Scholar). The results of these studies indicate distinct differences in the structural requirements for OFQ activity as compared with the opioid peptides. We found that position 1 in the OFQ primary structure does not stringently require a Phe residue, since substitution by tyrosine is tolerated without loss of biological activity or receptor affinity. Replacement by D-Phe results in a partially active peptide, whereas an alanine-substituted analog is inactive. Thus, the presence of an aromatic side chain in position 1 seems to be the minimal consensus. This is in striking contrast to the opioid peptides where any change of the Tyr1 position leads to a complete loss of activity (for an overview see 17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar, 18Hruby V.J. Gehrig C.A. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 343-401Google Scholar). Introduction of L-alanine in place of Gly2 leads to an almost inactive compound, whereas substitution with the corresponding D-enantiomer does not affect biological activity or binding potency. Glycine is known to allow for conformational flexibility of peptide backbones. It is therefore likely that the more bulky side chain of L-alanine in this position prevents the formation of a favorable secondary structure, whereas D-alanine might rather mimic the conformation induced by the natural glycine residue. Similar results have been reported for the enkephalins where a substitution of Gly2 by L-alanine causes a profound loss of activity, but [D-Ala2]analogs possess an even increased potency as compared with the natural peptide (17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar). Structural or conformational changes in the Gly3 position lead to a decrease or loss of biological activity. While the [L-Ala3] analog still activated the receptor with an EC50 of ∼40 nM, [D-Ala3]orphanin is inactive. Again, similar structural requirements have been demonstrated for the enkephalins at this position (17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar, 18Hruby V.J. Gehrig C.A. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 343-401Google Scholar). Any change of the Phe residue in position 4 results in a complete loss of biological activity. Even the introduction of a hydroxyl moiety into the amino acid side chain (as in the case of [Tyr4]orphanin) is detrimental. Comparable observations were made in structure-activity relationship studies with the enkephalins (17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar, 18Hruby V.J. Gehrig C.A. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 343-401Google Scholar). Despite the functional inactivity of [Tyr4]orphanin, it still has an appreciably high receptor binding affinity. However, we could not detect any functional antagonism of [Tyr4]orphanin in cAMP assays. We are currently analyzing this discrepancy. Changes of Thr5 cause a marked reduction of both biological activity and binding affinity. This is in some contrast to the opioid peptides where a greater structural freedom is already indicated by the natural occurrence of Leu or Met in this position. However, structure-activity relationship experiments with the enkephalins indicate that substitution of most other amino acids for Leu or Met also results in reduced binding affinity or biological potency (17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar). In OFQ, Gly6 does not represent an absolute structural requirement for biological activity, since substitutions by L-Ala or D-Ala result in only moderate losses of potency. Interestingly, substitution of Ala7 by its D-enantiomer produces a partial agonist as determined by cAMP assays. The conformation of the peptide backbone at this position might therefore be necessary to attain or stabilize an agonistic higher order structure. Replacement of Arg8 by L-alanine results in a decrease of both functional potency and receptor affinity, whereas a conformational conversion in that position has a less profound effect. We therefore concluded that the positive charge of the arginine side chain and, to a lesser extent, its proper orientation are critical for receptor activation. The positive charge might actually interact with the side chain of a Glu or Asp residue on the receptor and thus serve to anchor the peptide. A similar yet less pronounced effect is observed for the Arg12 position, where replacement by alanine or D-arginine reduces biological activity. However, both lysine residues in OFQ, whose side chains are also assumed to carry a positive charge under physiological conditions, can be substituted by alanine as well as D-Lys residues without loss of potency. Interestingly, for dynorphin A-(1–13) the importance of both arginine and lysine residues for biological activity has been demonstrated. Successive carboxyl-terminal deletions of dynorphin A-(1–13) identified Arg7, Lys11, and Lys13 as contributing prominently to the peptide's high potency and opioid receptor selectivity (19Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Google Scholar), whereas conversion of all three arginine residues in dynorphin A-(1–9) to the corresponding D-enantiomers had only minor effects on receptor binding (16Paterson S.J. Kosterlitz H.W. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Neuropeptides. 1984; 5: 177-180Google Scholar). On the other hand, [Ala8]dynorphin A-(1–13) retained only 35% of the dynorphin A-(1–13) receptor binding potency but showed an increased selectivity toward the κ opioid receptor (20Lemaire S. Lafrance L. Dumont M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 27: 300-305Google Scholar). In another study [Gln8, Gly31]human β-endorphin-Gly-Gly-NH2 (replacing the original Glu in position 8 by the uncharged Gln) was shown to be an effective antagonist, modulating analgesic responses to β-endorphin in vivo (21Nicolas P. Hammonds Jr., R.G. Li C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3074-3077Google Scholar). These observations might indicate that a similar mode of receptor interaction, involving either the side chain of the amino acid in position 8 or the overall conformation influenced by this residue, could have been conserved among OFQ, dynorphin A, and β-endorphin. Whether this homology is dependent on a conserved structure within the corresponding receptors will be part of future studies using site-directed mutagenesis. The exchange of all other amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal part of OFQ had little or no effect on their biological activity or receptor binding affinity. However, the overall structure of the carboxyl-terminal part of OFQ is indispensable, because all truncated peptides were devoid of any biological activity or reasonable affinity. Similar results have been obtained for β-endorphin, where removal of the last four amino acids leads to a complete loss of analgesic potency (21Nicolas P. Hammonds Jr., R.G. Li C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3074-3077Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown for dynorphin A that successive carboxyl-terminal truncation usually only results in a gradual decrease of biological potency and opioid receptor selectivity (19Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude that truncated forms of OFQ, if generated in vivo, might interact with other hitherto unknown receptors. Comparison of the data obtained for biological activity and receptor binding affinity of OFQ reveals some contradictions. In many cases it is not possible to detect receptor activation or antagonism, yet the peptides still exhibit appreciable affinities for receptor binding. For most of these peptides their Ki values are several hundredfold lower as compared with the natural OFQ (Table II). This observation may indicate the existence of a threshold binding affinity that must be surpassed for a biological effect to be elicited. The results of our alanine- and D-amino acid scanning mutagenesis indicate multiple amino acid residues critical for activation of the OFQ receptor. It is therefore possible that only the combined interaction of these residues with their binding sites on the receptor is able to induce an active conformation of the receptor. Such a model does not rule out binding of structurally altered peptides to some but not all of the binding sites on the receptor molecule. In fact, similar results have also been reported for a number of opioid peptide analogs (17Morley J.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 81-110Google Scholar, 18Hruby V.J. Gehrig C.A. Med. Res. Rev. 1989; 9: 343-401Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that in the amino-terminal part (e.g. positions 1–5) of the OFQ molecule, structural and conformational constraints for receptor activation are most stringent. This is quite similar to what has been shown for the opioid peptides, the striking difference being the greater structural freedom at position 1 of OFQ as compared with the opioid peptides and the importance of Thr5 for receptor activation. In addition, the two arginine residues in position 8 and 12 seem to play an important role for biological activity of OFQ. Finally, there appears to be no minimally active structure present within the OFQ sequence, whereas the Leu- or Met-enkephalin moieties contained in all the opioid peptides can serve as full agonists, albeit with reduced potency and receptor selectivity. Our data imply that the complete OFQ molecule is necessary for biological activity, whereas the amino-terminal part extending up to position 8 contains most of the biological “information” for this effect. Such a bipartite structure resembles to some extent the message-address concept proposed for dynorphin A and the other opioid peptides (8Goldstein A. Schmidt F.O. Bird S.J. Bloom F.E. Molecular Genetic Neuroscience. Raven Press Ltd., New York1982: 249Google Scholar, 19Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Google Scholar). In the case of the opioids this theory was used to explain the structural basis for receptor selectivity, based on the observation that a multitude of structurally similar opioid peptides could interact with any of the three main subtypes of opioid receptors, µ, δ, and κ, although with different efficiencies. Another central paradigm of this concept states that the message domain itself is sufficient to exert biological activity. Orphanin FQ does not interact with the opioid receptors and, conversely, the OFQ receptor does not bind opioid peptides. In addition, OFQ seems to lack a minimally active core. Our data, therefore, would not provide evidence for such a message domain within the OFQ molecule, so that by definition of the theory outlined above, OFQ can not be integrated into the message-address concept. It will be interesting to investigate and identify the structural parts within both the opioid and the OFQ receptors responsible for the observed high degree of selectivity. Studies aimed at these questions might yield valuable information about the mechanisms determining receptor selectivity and could also help to explain the evolutionary events separating OFQ from the opioid peptide family. We would like to thank Dr. H.-P. Nothacker for fruitful discussions and J. Higelin and R. A. Henningsen for expert technical assistance."

These three proteins belong to the intermediate filament protein family and are classified along with α-internexin as type IV intermediate filaments. Like all other intermediate filament proteins, neurofilament proteins contain an amino-terminal head domain, a central α-helical domain of ∼310 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal tail domain of variable length. The tail domains increase in length with increasing size of the neurofilament proteins and are extensively phosphorylated in NF-M and NF-H (5Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

Phosphate determinations have shown that most of these sites are phosphorylated in vivo (8Geisler N. Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 403-407Google Scholar, 11Julien J.P. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Google Scholar, 12Wong J. Hutchison S.B. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10867-10874Google Scholar). Rat NF-M contains only 5 KSP sites (13Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599Google Scholar), and human NF-M has 12 KSP sites (14Myers M.W. Lazzarini R.A. Lee V.M. Schlaepfer W.W. Nelson D.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1617-1626Google Scholar). Antibodies have been raised which can distinguish phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated KSP epitopes (15Sternberger L.A. Sternberger N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6126-6130Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that after extensive dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase, NF-H migrates more rapidly on SDS-PAGE (5Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9805-9817Google Scholar, 16Lee V.M.-Y. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Google Scholar). This characteristic mobility shift upon phosphorylation of NF-H and the antibodies specific for the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated KSP epitopes are therefore useful tools for studying its phosphorylation. neurofilament high, middle, and low molecular weight proteins, respectively polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cyclin dependent kinase polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase kilobase(s) enhanced chemiluminescence glycogen synthase kinase 3β hemagglutinin. The functional role of neurofilament phosphorylation is still not completely clear. Early studies indicated that NF-H might function as a cross-linking protein whose phosphorylation was thought to be important for the formation of cross-linking bridges between neurofilaments (17Hirokawa N. Glicksman M.A. Willard M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1523-1536Google Scholar, 18Liem R.K. Pachter J.S. Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S. Moraru E. Heimann R. Ann N. Y. Acad Sci. 1985; 455: 492-508Google Scholar). However, a later study showed that nonphosphorylated NF-H was also situated between intermediate filaments (19Hisanaga S. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 959-966Google Scholar). More recently it has been suggested that the phosphate groups of NF-H may result in electrostatic repulsion, which in turn could increase axonal diameter (20Shaw G. The Neuronal Cytoskeleton. Alan R. Liss, New York1991: 185Google Scholar, 21Carden M.J. Trojanowski J.Q. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3489-3504Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of NF-H has also been correlated with its ability to interact with microtubules (22Hisanaga S. Kusubata M. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21798-21803Google Scholar). The kinase(s) which phosphorylate the KSP sequences on NF-H are still not completely identified. A number of different protein kinases, including casein kinase (23Floyd C.C. Grant P. Gallant P.E. Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4987-4994Google Scholar), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (24Dosemeci A. Pant H.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 477-481Google Scholar), Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (25Vallano M.L. Buckholz T.M. DeLorenzo R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 957-963Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (26Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4166-4171Google Scholar) are able to phosphorylate the neurofilament proteins. However, NF-M is a better substrate than NF-H for all these protein kinases, and the characteristic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE due to phosphorylation of NF-H is not observed. Other studies have revealed protein kinases which are associated with neurofilaments, including a protein kinase activity from bovine spinal cord neurofilament-enriched preparations (27Dosemeci A. Floyd C.C. Pant H.C. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1990; 10: 369-382Google Scholar) and a 115-kDa neurofilament-associated kinase isolated by affinity chromatography using bacterially produced NF-H (28Xiao J. Monteiro M.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 820-833Google Scholar). These protein kinases also only phosphorylate NF-H in a limited manner and there is no evidence that they phosphorylate NF-H at the KSP sites. Recent results have pointed to the family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) as candidate kinases for the KSP sites on NF-H. The cell cycle kinase Cdc2 was shown to phosphorylate neurofilaments (29Guan R.J. Hall F.L. Cohlberg J.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1365-1371Google Scholar, 30Hisanaga S. Kusubata M. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21798-21803Google Scholar) and cause the characteristic gel mobility shift of NF-H upon phosphorylation (30Hisanaga S. Kusubata M. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21798-21803Google Scholar). However, these results do not have much physiological relevance, since it is known that Cdc2 kinase is absent in terminally differentiated neurons. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved regions of the Cdks, a family of novel Cdc2-related cDNA clones have been isolated (31Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Google Scholar). Among them, PSSALRE is expressed in neuronal cell lines and brain, as well as other cell lines and organs (31Meyerson M. Enders G.H. Wu C.L. Su L.K. Gorka C. Nelson C. Harlow E. Tsai L.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2909-2917Google Scholar). This same kinase was also separately identified by another laboratory, shown to be able to bind cyclin D1 (32Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Google Scholar) and renamed as Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5). A number of recent studies have shown that Cdk5 is associated with the cytoskeleton and able to phosphorylate NF-H in vitro. (33Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Google Scholar, 34Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Jaffe H. Wang J. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2681-2690Google Scholar, 35Hisanaga S. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okumura E. Okano T. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15056-15060Google Scholar). An additional protein with a molecular mass of 23–25 kDa was observed in most of the Cdk5 preparations. cDNA cloning showed that this 23–25-kDa protein is a degradation product of a larger protein, p35, which acts as a neural-specific regulatory subunit of Cdk5 (36Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Google Scholar, 37Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Zhong Q. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar). p35 associates physically with and activates Cdk5 kinase. Although it has no homology with cyclins, it serves a similar function in modulating the activity of Cdk5. In this study, we have cloned the cDNAs for both Cdk5 and p35 from rat brain and conducted NF-H phosphorylation studies by transient transfections and immunoprecipitation/kinase assays. We have demonstrated that NF-H can be phosphorylated only in the presence of both Cdk5 and p35. Furthermore, this phosphorylation is specific for the KSPXK sites. Rat Cdk5 cDNA was amplified from mRNA by the RT-PCR method. Briefly, 1 µg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat brain (Clontech) was primed with random hexamers and reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Perkin-Elmer). For amplification of Cdk5 cDNA, the RT reaction was added to a PCR reaction mixture, containing reaction buffer, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, sense (5′-CGAAGCTTGGACTCTTAGAACCGA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGGAAGCTTGGCTTAAATAGGTCAGG-3′) oligonucleotide primers (Operon) corresponding to the published rat Cdk5 sequence. This reaction was heated to 94°C for 5 min, cooled to 72°C for 5 min, and cycled 30 times at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The resulting rat Cdk5 PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-7 (Promega) and pRSVi vectors and sequenced in its entirety from both directions. Bovine p23 cDNA was obtained by the same approach with sense (5′-GGCATATGTCGTCCGTCAAGAAGG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGCATATGGCTGGCGGGCTCACC-3′) primers corresponding to the published sequence of bovine p23 (34Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Jaffe H. Wang J. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2681-2690Google Scholar). The bovine p23 PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-5 and pRSVi vectors and used in screening a rat brain λgt11 cDNA library (generously provided by Dr. David Colman at Mt. Sinai Medical Center). Standard cDNA library screening procedures were employed (38Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the 0.5-kb HindIII fragment containing the bovine p23 cDNA was purified from pRSVi-p23, labeled with 32P by random primer synthesis (Amersham) and used as a probe for screening the amplified λgt11 rat brain cDNA expression library (13Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599Google Scholar). After screening approximately 1 × 105 plaques, 20 positive plaques were recovered and confirmed to correspond to be rat p35 by secondary and tertiary screening. The largest p35 cDNA clone was isolated from the phage, subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-7 (Promega), and sequenced in its entirety from both directions. The Cdk5 dominant negative construct was generated by two-step PCR (39Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 15: 277-286Google Scholar). The first amplification was performed using an antisense primer corresponding to the amino acid residues KLAD*FGL (where * marks the point of a mutation, which contains a single G to A mismatch resulting in a Asp → Asn mutation (40van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Google Scholar)) and a sense primer corresponding to the 5′ end of Cdk5 described above. The resulting PCR product was purified and used with the Cdk5 antisense primer described above for the second amplification. The final PCR product was subcloned into the pRSVi vector and sequenced to confirm the Asp → Asn mutation. The 3.4-kb cDNA of rat NF-H encoding the full-length polypeptide was previously cloned into the pRSVi-HindIII vector (10Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Google Scholar), which contains the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (41Forman B.M. Yang C.R. Stanley F. Casanova J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 902-911Google Scholar). The full-length NF-H cDNA was also cloned into the expression vector pET-16b (Novagen Inc.). The truncated NF-H tail constructs which contain either the KSPXK or KSPXY sequences were generated by PCR. Two pairs of primers (Operon) were designed according to the NF-H sequence (10Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Google Scholar). Primers KSP1 (5′-GAACATATGTCTCCTGTGAAAGAA-3′) and KSP2 (5′-TCTGGATCCTTTATGGAGATTTTA-3′) were for the KSPXY-containing construct, whereas primers KSP3 (5′-GCCCATATGCCCGTGAAGGAAGGT-3′) and KSP4 (5′-GAGGGATCCGGGCTATTCTGGGTG-3′) were for the KSPXK-containing construct. PCR was carried out as described above, and the resulting PCR products were subcloned in pET16b at the NdeI and BamHI sites and sequenced. GSK3β cDNA was cloned using sense (5′-AGGTCATATGAGAAGAGCCATC-3′) and antisense (5′-AAACCATCTGAGTGTTGCTGAGTG-3′) primers based on the published sequence (61Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Google Scholar) by RT-PCR. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEM-5 and pRSVi vectors and sequenced in its entirety from both directions. The SW13.cl.2Vim− cell line was the kind gift of Dr. Robert M. Evans (University of Colorado Health Science Center, Denver, CO) and was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All the transient transfections in this study were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure previously described (44Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Google Scholar). The transiently transfected cells were lysed in 6.25 mM Tris buffer, pH 6.5 and 1% SDS, an equal amount of sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) in different percentage vertical slab gels. For immunoblots, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) and probed with the different antibodies. ECL (Amersham) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols, and the blots were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Antibodies SMI36 and SMI32 were purchased from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. The Cdk5 antibodies C-8 and DC-17 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech. The pET constructs encoding NF-H, “KSPXY” and “KSPXK” proteins were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The transformed bacteria were cultured in 500 ml of LB containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin to A600 of 0.5 at 37°C. After adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyanoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, the cultures were incubated another 4 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g and the “KSPXY” and “KSPXK” proteins, which contained the histidine tag from pET16b were further purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). Briefly, the bacterial pellets were sonicated in binding buffer containing 5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g to collect the inclusion bodies and cellular debris, while leaving other proteins in solution. Repeating the previous step several times released more of the trapped soluble proteins. The final pellets were sonicated in binding buffer prepared in 6 M urea and incubated on ice for 1 h. The remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 39,000 × g, and the supernatants were filtered through 0.45-micron membranes. For the “KSPXK” and “KSPXY” proteins, the filtered supernatants were loaded onto NiSO4 columns, equilibrated according to the manufacturer's protocol, washed with binding buffer, and eluted with elution buffer. All the buffers used in chromatography were prepared in 6 M urea. The eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C, and the protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The NiSO4 column was not effective for the purification of full-length NF-H, and we therefore purified full-length NF-H using an HTP column as described elsewhere (42Kaplan M.P. Chin S.S. Macioce P. Srinawasan J. Hashim G. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 45-54Google Scholar); the protein concentrations were measured by the same method. Transiently transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and 1 × proteinase inhibitors (5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were then scraped into Eppendorf tubes and incubated on ice for 1 h. The cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were mixed with 1 µg of antibody for 2 h at 4°C. 20 µl of Protein G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotech) was added, and the mixtures were subsequently incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and washed with cold lysis buffer four times. The kinase assays were initiated by mixing kinase buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), and 2 mg of substrate with the final immune complex pellet. The reaction mixtures were then incubated in a 30°C water bath for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were saved and the pellets were washed 3 times. An equal amount of 2 × sample buffer (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) were added to the supernatants and pellets, and the samples were boiled for 10 min before SDS-PAGE. In order to study Cdk5 and its activator, p35, we first isolated their cDNAs by RT-PCR. To obtain the Cdk5 cDNA, reverse transcription was carried out using rat brain mRNA as template, and the resulting RT-PCR product was amplified by two primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the published Cdk5 cDNA sequence (45Hellmich M.R. Pant H.C. Wada E. Battey J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10867-10871Google Scholar). This PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM-5 vector, its sequence was determined and confirmed to be identical with the Cdk5 sequence from GenBank™. The full-length rat p35 cDNA was obtained by first isolating a cDNA corresponding to the partial sequence of bovine p35 (p23) by RT-PCR using bovine brain mRNA as template (46Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S. Omori A. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Anzai K. Imahori K. Uchida T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 203-208Google Scholar) and screening a rat brain cDNA library using the bovine p23 cDNA as a probe. The resulting p35 cDNA was subcloned into pGEM-5 and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat p35 is nearly identical with those of human and bovine p35 (Fig. 1). There are only four amino acid differences between rat and human p35 (36Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Google Scholar) or between rat and bovine p35 (37Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Zhong Q. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar). The Cdk5 dominant-negative (Cdk5dn) construct was generated by PCR and subcloned into the expression vectors described under “Materials and Methods.” This dominant-negative Cdk5dn contains a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid residue change (Asp144→ Asn) in the kinase domain of Cdk5. This mutant form has previously been shown to result in an inactive kinase, which competes with the activator protein p35 and thereby inhibits Cdk5 kinase activity (40van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA for glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was also generated by RT-PCR using primers based on the published sequence (61Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Google Scholar). The resulting GSK3β cDNA was subcloned into pGEM-5 and sequenced. The sequence was found to be identical with the GSK3β sequence obtained from GenBank™. Rat NF-H contains 52 KSP repeats, which can be divided into KSPXK and KSPXY repeats. After analyzing the protein sequence, we noticed that most of the KSPXY repeats are clustered in the amino-terminal part of the NF-H tail domain, while most of the KSPXK repeats are located after the KSPXY repeats. Using PCR, we were able to separate these 2 groups of repeats and prepare a “KSPXY” construct which contains 41 KSPXY repeats and no KSPXK repeats and a “KSPXK” construct which contains 7 KSPXK repeats (and 2 KSPXY repeats). These constructs were subcloned into the pET16b expression vector (Fig. 2). It should be noted that a single KSPXK is present in front of the cluster of the KSPXY repeats in the NF-H sequence and the “KSPXY” construct starts from the middle of this KSPXK motif. To study the phosphorylation of NF-H by Cdk5, transient transfections were performed with SW13cl2Vim− cells, a human adrenal carcinoma cell line without cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (47Sattia A.J. Nordeen S.K. Evans R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 553-565Google Scholar). We have previously shown by Western blot analysis and immunostaining that NF-H is predominantly in the nonphosphorylated form in transiently transfected fibroblasts (10Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Google Scholar). The same result is obtained from SW13cl2Vim− cells transiently transfected with NF-H alone (Fig. 3B). Cdk5 is expressed in a number of cell lines and tissues, but its activity has been shown to be present only in brain (48Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Cdk5 protein can be detected in SW13cl2Vim− cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C), but the immunoprecipitated Cdk5 from cells lacking p35 does not have kinase activity on histone H1 (Fig. 4A), NF-H (Fig. 4B), “KSPXK” (Fig. 4C), or “KSPXY” proteins (Fig. 4D). Several recent reports have shown that p35 is only expressed in the central nervous system (36Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Google Scholar, 37Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Zhong Q. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, our Northern blot analysis showed that the SW13cl2Vim− cell line does not have any p35 mRNA (data not shown). These results indicate that the SW13cl2Vim− cell line is a good system to study the phosphorylation of NF-H by Cdk5 and its activator, p35.Fig. 4In vitro kinase assays. Extracts from cells, which had been transiently transfected with combinations of Cdk5, p35, and Cdk5dn constructs were immunoprecipitated with the Cdk5 antibody C-8 and used for the in vitro kinase assays. Histone H1 was used as a positive control (A). Bacterially expressed NF-H (B), “KSPXK” (C), and “KSPXY” (D) proteins were purified and used as substrates for the in vitro kinase assays. Lane 7 shows the Coomassie Blue stain of the substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For every transient transfection experiment, 20 µg of each plasmid was used, and the resulting cell lysates were analyzed by Western blots using antibodies SMI36 and SMI32. SMI36 is specific for the phosphorylated KSP epitope on NF-H, while SMI32 recognizes this epitope in the nonphosphorylated form (15Sternberger L.A. Sternberger N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6126-6130Google Scholar). Purified NF-H from rat spinal cord shows an apparent molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa on SDS-PAGE. After alkaline phosphatase treatment, the dephosphorylated NF-H migrates faster on SDS-PAGE (5Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9805-9817Google Scholar, 49Lee V.M.-Y. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Google Scholar). We used this mobility shift on SDS-PAGE and the immunoreactivity of NF-H with the two phosphorylation state-dependent antibodies as the criteria to determine whether or not the transfected NF-H was phosphorylated. As shown in Fig. 3, when NF-H is transfected by itself (lane 2) or co-transfected with Cdk5 (lane 3) into SW13cl2Vim− cells, the exogenously expressed NF-H protein is detected only by SMI32 and does not show the mobility shift characteristic of the phosphorylated NF-H, indicating the absence of any significant amount of NF-H phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). However, when both Cdk5 and p35 are transfected along with NF-H (Fig. 3, lane 6), the expressed NF-H shows an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa, comparable to that of the phosphorylated NF-H. Furthermore, the protein is recognized by SMI36 (Fig. 3A), which is specific for the phosphorylated NF-H, but not by SMI32 (Fig. 3B), which detects the nonphosphorylated KSP sequences on NF-H. From these results, it is quite clear that the NF-H expressed in the transfected cells is extensively phosphorylated. When NF-H is co-transfected with only p35 (Fig. 3, lane 5), a slight mobility shift of the NF-H band is observed on the immunoblots and this broadly diffuse band is recognized by both SMI36 and SMI32 (Fig. 3, A and B). These results are consistent with partial phosphorylation of NF-H by the endogenous Cdk5 activated by the transfected p35. However, the endogenous Cdk5 is apparently not present in sufficient quantity to phosphorylate NF-H to the same degree as the exogenous Cdk5 (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5 and 6). When the dominant-negative Cdk5dn is introd"
https://openalex.org/W2156666782,"To elucidate the pathological metabolism of glutathione synthesis in diabetic endothelial cells, we studied the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) using a mouse vascular endothelial cell line.Exposing normoglycemic endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increased the activity and the mRNA expression of γ-GCS. The addition of inhibitors for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to the cells caused a loss of the γ-GCS mRNA expression in response to TNF-α.A shift of the concentration of glucose in the medium from 5.5 to 28 mM glucose and a following incubation for 7 days decreased the expression of γ-GCS mRNA. These cells showed no apparent responses of γ-GCS mRNA or the activity of NF-κB to TNF-α or IL-β. Increase in the GSH concentration of the cells treated with 28 mM glucose restored the expression of γ-GCS mRNA and its response to TNF-α or IL-β, suggesting that redox regulation is involved in the expression of γ-GCS.In summary, the expression of γ-GCS is regulated by TNF-α or IL-1β in endothelial cells mediated by NF-κB stimulation, and impairment of the regulation of γ-GCS in hyperglycemic cells may be a cause of medical complications that develop in diabetes mellitus. To elucidate the pathological metabolism of glutathione synthesis in diabetic endothelial cells, we studied the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) using a mouse vascular endothelial cell line. Exposing normoglycemic endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increased the activity and the mRNA expression of γ-GCS. The addition of inhibitors for nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) to the cells caused a loss of the γ-GCS mRNA expression in response to TNF-α. A shift of the concentration of glucose in the medium from 5.5 to 28 mM glucose and a following incubation for 7 days decreased the expression of γ-GCS mRNA. These cells showed no apparent responses of γ-GCS mRNA or the activity of NF-κB to TNF-α or IL-β. Increase in the GSH concentration of the cells treated with 28 mM glucose restored the expression of γ-GCS mRNA and its response to TNF-α or IL-β, suggesting that redox regulation is involved in the expression of γ-GCS. In summary, the expression of γ-GCS is regulated by TNF-α or IL-1β in endothelial cells mediated by NF-κB stimulation, and impairment of the regulation of γ-GCS in hyperglycemic cells may be a cause of medical complications that develop in diabetes mellitus."

We have used pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure that produces synchronous and sustained neuronal activity as a model to examine the mechanism(s) of gene activation. The transcription factor CREB (Ca2+/cAMP response element-binding protein) is thought to be necessary for long-term memory formation both in invertebrates and vertebrates. When phosphorylated on Ser133 either by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, CREB increases transcription of genes containing the CRE (cAMP response element) sequence. Using an antibody that detects Ser133-phosphorylated CREB protein, we show that CREB phosphorylation is maximal between 3 and 8 min after the onset of seizure activity and declines slowly both in the hippocampus and the cortex. The total amount of CREB protein did not change at the time points examined. The increased phosphorylation of CREB protein is preceded by an increase in the amount of cAMP, suggestive of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, in the hippocampus and activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in the cortex. Subsequent to CREB phosphorylation, the expression of the CRE-containing gene, c-fos, and the AP-1 complexes (heterodimers of Fos and Jun family members) is increased. These findings support the role of CREB-mediated gene expression in activity-dependent neuronal plasticities.

Neuronal activity plays a critical role in many forms of plasticities such as learning and memory (1Bear M.F. Kleinschmidt A. Gu Q. Singer W. J.

Studies on the formation of long-term memory indicate that the induction of immediate-early genes is often associated with memory storage (3Rose S.P.R.

The immediate-early gene products are thought to activate late-effector genes, which alter the structural and functional properties of nerve cells (5Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Schacher S. Kandel E.R.

Moreover, CREB protein has been implicated in the formation of long-term memory. For example, blockade of CREB by injection of CRE sequence containing oligonucleotides impedes long-term facilitation, a correlate of memory in the marine mollusc Aplysia californica (12Dash P.K.

In addition, overexpression of wild type CREB in Drosophila facilitates the formation of long-term memory (16Yin J.C.P. Del Vecchio M. Zhou H. Tully T.

Increases in intracellular cAMP result in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by the dissociation of the catalytic from the regulatory subunits. Prolonged increase in cAMP causes translocation of the catalytic subunits into the nucleus (21Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). It has also recently been shown that isozymes of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK IV and certain isoforms of CaMK II) are localized to the nucleus (22Mathews R.P. Guthrie C.R.

Many models of neuronal activity, including seizure, produce long-lasting changes in both the structure and function of the brain (31Cotman C.W. Nieto-Sampedro M. Science. 1984; 225: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 32Dichter M.A. Ayala G.F. Science. 1987; 237: 157-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Greenough W.T. Bailey C.H.

Several of these studies have demonstrated that c-fos, fra-1, nur/77, c-jun, prodynorphin, enkephalin, and nerve growth factor are induced during stimulation of intact nervous systems, supporting the idea that these genes are important regulators of nerve cell responses in vivo (34Anokhin K. Mileusnic R. Shamakina I. Rose S.P.R. Brain Res. 1991; 544: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Cole A.J. Abu-Shakra S. Saffen D.W. Baraban J.M. Worley P.F. J.

Neuron. 1990; 4: 603-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). For example, long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, a proposed model for spatial learning and memory, is associated with increased expression of zif/268 (6Cole A.J. Saffen D.W. Baraban J.M. Worley P.F. Nature. 1989; 340: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Direct electrical stimulation as well as kindling stimulation increase c-fos mRNA (38Dragunow M. Robertson H.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 39White Gall C. Brain Res. 1987; 427: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). c-Fos also is increased in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei involved in thirst control following 24-h water deprivation (40Sagar S.M. Sharp F.R. Curran T. Science. 1988; 240: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) and in the dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord following peripheral sensory stimulation (40Sagar S.M. Sharp F.R. Curran T. Science. 1988; 240: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 41Hunt S.P. Pini A. Evan G. Nature. 1987; 328: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Taken together, these in vivo studies are consistent with the idea that alteration in gene expression may underlie longlasting changes in brain function. Many of the genes induced by neuronal activity have CRE-like sequences in their promoter regions and therefore are likely to be induced by CREB phosphorylation (7Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). Using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure to induce maximal neuronal activity (42Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), we have examined the phosphorylation of the CREB protein. We have utilized an antibody that specifically detects CREB when phosphorylated on Ser133 (10Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the phosphorylation of CREB is maximal between 3 and 8 min after the onset of seizure both in the hippocampus and cortex and declines slowly thereafter. This enhanced phosphorylation of CREB can be reduced by pretreatment with sodium pentobarbital, a GABA receptor agonist which blocks neuronal activity (43Sanna E. Garau F. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 213-217PubMed Google Scholar). Preceding CREB phosphorylation, we observed an increased activity of autophosphorylated CaMK in the cortex and enhanced concentrations of intracellular cAMP in the hippocampus. Finally, we report that subsequent to CREB phosphorylation, the expression of a CRE-containing gene c-fos and AP-1 complexes (heterodimers of Fos and Jun family members) is increased. These data suggest that neuronal activity stimulates PKA and CaMK, resulting in the phosphorylation of the CREB protein and induction of CRE-containing genes. PhosphoCREB and CREB antibodies were purchased from UpState Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). c-Fos antibodies were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). [32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Corp. Male rats (180–200 g) were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). All procedures involving the use of animals were performed under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health's Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with 55 mg/kg of PTZ prepared in saline (42Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Control animals were injected with saline. As an additional control, some animals were intraperitoneally injected with 30 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital 15 min prior to PTZ injection. At various times following injection, animals were sacrificed by a guillotine. The cortical (parietal and half of the frontal cortex) and the hippocampal tissues were quickly removed in oxygenated ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.3 mM NaH2PO4, 3 mM KCl, 124 mM NaCl, 10 mM dextrose, 26 mM NaHCO3, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2). Sample preparation was carried out at 4°C. The tissues were separately homogenized (10 strokes) in 5 volumes of a buffer containing 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.25 M sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, plus protease inhibitors (1 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF), and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM NaF, 2 mM NaPPi, and 5 µM microcystin-LR) in a Dounce homogenizer using a loose pestle. The cells were then pelletized at 2,000 × g for 10 min. To lyse the cells, the pelletized material was incubated in 5 volumes of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 µM microcystin-LR, 2 mM NaF, and 2 mM NaPPi for 5 min. The cell suspension was homogenized (7 strokes) in a Dounce homogenizer using a tight pestle. The nuclei were pelletized at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclei were lysed in 1 bed volume of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 25% glycerol, 2 mM NaF, 2 mM NaPPi, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 µM microcystin-LR by gentle rocking for 30 min. Cell debris and genomic DNA were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant solution was removed and frozen. At different time points following the onset of seizure, rats were sacrificed by decapitation. The cortex and hippocampus were immediately dissected while submerged under oxygenated ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid without Ca2+ or Mg2+. The tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptine, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 µM microcystin-LR. After 20 strokes in a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer, 0.6 ml of each sample was added to an equal volume of 12% trichloroacetic acid for cAMP measurements. The rest of the homogenate was aliquoted and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The total homogenates, supernatant solutions, and pelletized materials were stored at −80°C. For cAMP sample preparation, the 0.6 ml of homogenate mixed with an equal volume of 12% trichloroacetic acid was allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. This was followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant solutions were collected and divided into three aliquots. Aliquots were washed five times with 2.5 volumes of water-saturated ether to remove the trichloroacetic acid. Each wash was performed by vigorous vortexing followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min to separate the two phases. The organic phase was discarded prior to the addition of the next wash. Ether-extracted samples were frozen at −80°C until ready for use. For CREB and c-Fos Western blots, nuclear extracts were diluted in water to reduce the salt concentration to approximately 100 mM prior to use. For Western blots examining the α isoform of CaMK II, supernatant solutions were thawed on ice and sonicated briefly to ensure homogeneity. The pellet samples were resuspended in 200 µl of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, and 5 µM microcystin-LR) and sonicated briefly. The amount of protein in each sample was measured using a Micro BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were prepared by boiling in sample buffer, and equal amounts of protein were separated on a 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Millipore). Western blots were carried out using antibodies at a final concentration of 0.2 µg/ml as described previously (44Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The blots were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescence detection system (Life Technologies, Inc.), which allowed the production of multiple fluorographs with different lengths of exposure. The quantification of the immunoreactive bands was carried out utilizing a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer. The Western blots were repeated in at least four independent experiments. Equal amounts of the nuclear extracts were used for gel retardation assays using the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) sequence as a probe for measuring the AP-1 binding. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was synthesized using the metallothionein gene TRE sequence 5′-GATCTGTGAGTCAGCGCGA-3′ and its complement sequence (45Lee W. Haslinger A. Karin M. Tjian R. Nature. 1987; 325: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Probe preparation and assays were carried out essentially as described previously (46Dash P.K. Moore A.N. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 39: 35-43PubMed Google Scholar). For competition with oligonucleotides, the cold competitors were added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of protein extracts. The oligonucleotides used for competition were 5′-GATCATCTCAATTAGTCAGCAA-3′ and its complement for TRE, and 5′-GGAGCGCGCCTCGAATGTTCTAGAAAAGGCTGCA-3′ and its complement for the heat shock element. Supershift assays were performed by preincubating the nuclear extracts with 0.2 µg of c-Fos antibodies in the absence of any thiol reagent for 15 min at room temperature. The resulting antibody-antigen complex was then incubated with the probe. Hippocampi were removed quickly as described under “Preparation of Nuclear Extracts.” The tissues were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 15% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 8–10 h. The tissue was then placed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at room temperature. Tissues were briefly dried to remove any surface liquid and mounted in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T., Miles Inc.) cryostat imbedding medium. 50-micron slices were prepared using a cryostat. Slices were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 5 µg/ml primary antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature overnight. Slices were washed four times with PBS, and immunoreactivity was detected using an avidin-biotin detection system from Vector Laboratory essentially as suggested by the supplier. Supernatant and total homogenate samples were thawed on ice and sonicated briefly to ensure homogeneity. Pellet samples were resuspended and sonicated as described under “Western Blots.” The protein concentration in each sample was determined using Micro BCA assays with bovine serum albumin as the standard. CaMK activity was measured using a synthetic peptide substrate (autocamtide-3; KKALHRQETVDAL) (47Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 3 µg of protein to a 20-µl mixture resulting in the following final concentrations: 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 µM substrate peptide, 50 µM ATP, 3 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). After a 1-min incubation at 30°C, the reactions were terminated by spotting 15 µl of the reaction mixture on P-81 phosphocellulose filters (Whatman). The filters were washed three times, 10 min each, in 75 mM phosphoric acid, rinsed with ethanol, and dried under air flow. The radioactivity on the phosphorylated peptide substrate was quantitated in a scintillation counter by the Cerenkov method. cAMP was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit purchased from Amersham. Frozen samples were completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge at ambient temperature. Dried samples were resuspended in diluted assay buffer as recommended by the vendor. cAMP measurements were performed utilizing the acetylation method and compared to a standard curve, which was prepared simultaneously. The amount of cAMP in each sample was normalized to the total amount of protein in the homogenate prior to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The results from the three aliquots were averaged for each hippocampal or cortical sample. cAMP measurements were repeated in at least three independent experiments. An analysis of variance was computed to detect a significant main effect for groups (p < 0.05). This was followed by a Tukey's b post-hoc test to identify specific group differences. Statistical analyses were performed using the integrated optical densities (Western blots), counts per minute (kinase assays), or by comparison to standard curves (cAMP measurements). The data are presented as percent control. PTZ-induced seizure has been used as a model for robust neuronal activity (42Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 58Ben-Ari Y. Represa A. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 8: 312-318Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” seizure activity was initiated by an intraperitoneal injection of PTZ at a dose of 55 mg/kg body weight (42Qian Z. Gilbert M.E. Colicos M.A. Kandel E.R. Kuhl D. Nature. 1993; 361: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We consistently observed the physical manifestations of seizure activity in all animals approximately 58 s after injection of the drug. As previously reported, the activity began with acute facial and forelimb contraction progressing to animals running and bouncing as well as tonic convulsion (49Browning R.A. Wang C. Lanker M.L. Jobe P.C. Epilepsy Res. 1990; 6: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No seizure activity was observed in either the saline or the sodium pentobarbital controls. Phosphorylation of the CREB protein following PTZ injection was examined using an antibody that detects Ser133-phosphorylated CREB protein (10Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). As an initial study, nuclear extracts were prepared 8 min after the injection of PTZ or saline, and the levels of total CREB and phosphorylated CREB were determined by Western blots. Fig. 1A shows that total amount of CREB protein remained unchanged by seizure activity both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. In contrast, the phosphorylation of CREB in the cortex and hippocampus is enhanced at this time point in experimental animals (Fig. 1B). In addition to the 43-kDa phosphoCREB, weakly cross-reacting bands were detected at 40 kDa and around 100 kDa. The identity of these cross-reactive bands is unknown at present. When animals were injected with 30 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital prior to PTZ injection to block neuronal activity, the increased phosphoCREB signal was reduced both in the hippocampus and the cortex (Fig. 1, B and C). In the cortical samples, the signal for phosphoCREB was lower in comparison to saline controls. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In addition, no significant difference was detected between naive or saline-injected animals (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows the summary of results from several such experiments. The signal for phosphoCREB is increased by approximately 62% (saline = 99.5 ± 16.6%, experimental = 161.8 ± 34.1%, p < 0.05) in the hippocampus and by approximately 76% (saline = 99.7 ± 13.3%, experimental = 175.8 ± 13.3%, p < 0.05) in the cortex of experimental animals compared to saline-injected animals. Injection of sodium pentobarbital 15 min prior to PTZ injection blocked the enhanced CREB phosphorylation in both the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 1C). We next examined the time course of CREB phosphorylation. Fig. 2A shows that phosphorylation of CREB protein is increased in the hippocampus as early as 3 min after the onset of seizure activity. The phosphorylation was maximal between 3 and 8 min and declined slowly. At 60 min following the onset of seizure, the phosphorylation was higher compared to the control. A similar time course for CREB phosphorylation was observed in the cortical tissue. The total amount of CREB protein remained unchanged both in the cortex and hippocampus at these time points (Fig. 2B). The spatial pattern of CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Animals for this study were sacrificed 8 min after the injection of PTZ or saline. Fig. 3A shows the cellular staining for total CREB protein. Both pyramidal and granular neurons show CREB immunoreactivity. When examined under high magnification, the signal for CREB immunoreactivity was found to be localized to the nucleus (data not shown). Consistent with the Western blot data, immunohistochemistry did not show any difference in total CREB protein between the control and experimental hippocampi. No staining was detected when the primary antibody was eliminated from the incubation solution (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows the low level of phosphorylated CREB-like proteins present in a control hippocampus. Seizure activity increases the phosphorylation of CREB-like proteins in the CA1, CA3 subfields and to a lesser extent in the dentate gyrus. CREB protein when phosphorylated on Ser133 either by PKA or CaMK can induce transcription of CRE-containing genes (20Sheng M. Thomson M.A. Greenberg M.E.

To examine PKA activation, the amount of cAMP in both the cortical and hippocampal tissues at various time points following the onset of seizure activity were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It has been reported that increased levels of cAMP correlate well with enhanced PKA activity (50Keely S.L.

Chem. 269, 31198-31206) have suggested that the Vmax of Ca2+ uptake is enhanced up to 2-fold through phosphorylation of Ser38 in the cardiac Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase). It is difficult, however, to determine whether stimulation is caused by phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase or by phosphorylation of phospholamban in cardiac microsomes. We have expressed SERCA2a in HEK-293 cells in the presence or absence of phospholamban and measured the effects on Ca2+ uptake activity of phosphorylation of microsomal proteins by CaM kinase or protein kinase A (PKA). We found no effect on the Vmax of Ca2+ uptake following phosphorylation by CaM kinase or PKA in either the presence or absence of phospholamban. The K0.5 for Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ transport, however, was shifted following phosphorylation by either CaM kinase or PKA in those microsomes containing both SERCA2a and phospholamban, but not in those expressing only SERCA2a. Thus, we cannot confirm earlier reports of stimulation of SERCA2a activity by CaM kinase II phosphorylation of Ser38.

The expression of GADD153 (rowth rrest and NA amage inducible gene 153) is low during normal cell growth but is highly induced in response to a variety of cellular stresses including glucose deprivation, exposure to genotoxic agents, and other growth-arresting situations (1Fornace Jr., A.J.

In addition to GADD153, the C/EBP family is comprised of at least three major members designated in rat as C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ. C/EBP-α, whose expression is largely restricted to liver and adipose tissues, has been shown to play a critical role in regulating liver-specific gene expression and is required for adipocyte differentiation (4Birkenmeier E.H.

Like GADD153, C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ are widely expressed in mammalian cells and tissues, suggesting that they serve a more general role in regulating gene expression. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein luciferase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. C/EBPs are characterized by a conserved leucine zipper domain in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein adjacent to a basic region involved in DNA sequence recognition (12Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar, 13Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Dimerization of monomeric proteins through the leucine zipper domain is necessary for sequence-specific binding to DNA. C/EBP-α, -β, and -δ are all capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other C/EBPs (9Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar). GADD153 is unique in that it lacks a functional DNA binding domain, cannot bind to consensus C/EBP sites (14Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar), and appears unable to form homodimers. 2Ubeda, M., Wang, X., Zinszner, H., Wu, I., Habner, J. F., and Ron, D. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 1479-1489., 3T. W. Fawcett, unpublished observations. However, in vitro studies have indicated that GADD153 can heterodimerize with other members of the C/EBP family, thereby inhibiting their ability to bind DNA (14Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that GADD153 acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of other C/EBPs. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of GADD153 can prevent C/EBP-regulated gene activation and block adipocyte differentiation in cultured cells (14Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar, 15Batchvarova N. Wang X.Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Google Scholar). The functional significance of these interactions and their relationship to the ubiquitous and marked elevation in GADD153 expression during conditions of growth arrest and/or stress is unclear. The elucidation of the regulation and function of GADD153 during cellular stress is a primary interest in our laboratory. Particular issues of concern are the determination of which proteins interact with GADD153 in vivo during conditions of stress and which genes are regulated by these interactions. To address these questions we have examined the expression of the various members of the C/EBP family in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells treated with arsenite, a metabolic stress and potent inducer of GADD153. We demonstrate that, like GADD153, C/EBP-β expression is induced by arsenite treatment. Through immunoprecipitation assays we provide evidence for the formation of endogenous GADD153-C/EBP-β complexes in arsenite-treated cells. In addition, we show that C/EBP-β can transactivate the GADD153 promoter through a C/EBP site in PC12 cells, and we provide evidence in support of an autoregulatory feedback loop in which expression of GADD153 serves to suppress its own transcription through interference with C/EBP transactivation. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 µg/ml gentamicin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 in air. For arsenite treatment, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-cm2 dish 48 h prior to treatment. Sodium arsenite (Sigma) was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 50 µM for the duration of the experiment or for 30 min at a final concentration of 400 µM followed by replacement with fresh medium. Since previous studies have indicated that GADD153 expression is induced by serum depletion and nutrient deprivation (3Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Google Scholar), the evening prior to arsenite treatment, cells were refed with fresh medium. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using CsCl gradient-purified plasmid DNA as described previously (16Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in the transfection was kept constant by the addition of sheared salmon sperm DNA. Twenty-four h after transfection cells were harvested for luciferase assays. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the C/EBP binding site from the hamster GADD153 promoter (5′-GAT CCG GTT GCC AAA CAT TGC ATC ATC CA-3′) were custom synthesized. The SP-1 and NFκB consensus oligonucleotides were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The C/EBP-β expression plasmid MSV/EBP5 was the generous gift of Dr. Steven McKnight (9Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar). The GADD153 cDNA was cloned from human fibroblasts (17Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.C. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 259-267Google Scholar). For mammalian expression of sense and antisense GADD153 the entire coding region plus 130 base pairs of 3′-untranslated DNA of the human GADD153 cDNA were cloned into the XhoI site of pCMVneo (a gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein) (18Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Google Scholar). The GADD153-LUC construct containing the promoter sequence spanning the region −778 to +21 of the hamster GADD153 gene was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. S. Howell (19Gately D. Sharma A.A. Christen R. Howell S. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 18-23Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells using Stat-60 (Tel-Test “B”, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously using cDNAs labeled by the random primer method (3Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Google Scholar). The integrity of the mRNA was assessed by visualization of the ethidium bromide-stained RNA following transfer. Hybridization signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Following analysis of the GADD153 and C/EBP signals, blots were rehybridized to an end-labeled 24-base oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S RNA (3Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Google Scholar), and the C/EBP signals were normalized to 18 S values obtained on the same blot to control for variation in loading and transfer among samples. Lysates from untreated or arsenite-treated cells were prepared using a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 as described previously (20Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C.Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Conner Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the crude extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments the cell lysates were precleared by a 1-h incubation with rabbit normal serum and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4°C. Antibodies specific to GADD153, C/EBP-β, or C/EBP-δ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated an additional 45 min. The immune complexes were washed 10 times in the same buffer at room temperature, and bound proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling for 2 min in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Following 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western analysis was performed to detect the presence of GADD153 protein coprecipitated with C/EBP-β or C/EBP-δ during the immunoprecipitation step. Immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For detection of GADD153-C/EBP-β protein complexes shown in Fig. 3B, PC12 cells were metabolically labeled. Cells were incubated in medium with or without 400 µM sodium arsenite for 30 min, after which the medium was removed, and fresh medium minus methionine was added along with 300 µCi of [35S]methionine for 6 h at 37°C. Following immunoprecipitation using a GADD153 antibody, the samples were electrophoresed, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and exposed to autoradiography to detect the presence of GADD153 in the immunoprecipitates. Western analysis using a C/EBP-β antibody was then performed on the same membrane to detect the presence of C/EBP-β in the coimmunoprecipitation complexes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from arsenite-treated cells, and DNA binding reactions were carried out as described previously (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 µg of nuclear extract was incubated for 30 min on ice with 10 fmol of double-stranded 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Reactions were electrophoresed through 4% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. For the competition assays, 1-, 50-, or 100-fold excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture along with protein and labeled probe. For DNA supershift analysis 1 µl of antibody specific to either GADD153 or C/EBP-β (a gift from S. McKnight) was added to the binding reaction after the 30-min incubation on ice. Samples were then incubated for an additional 45 min at room temperature. We have shown recently that treatment of HeLa cells with arsenite, a severe metabolic stress with genotoxic effects, results in the rapid induction of GADD153 mRNA (22Guyton K.Z. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 547-554Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, GADD153 mRNA is also highly induced in PC12 cells following treatment with 50 µM sodium arsenite. The biphasic pattern of induction seen here is consistent with that observed in HeLa cells. To determine the effects of arsenite treatment on the expression of other C/EBP family members, the same RNA samples were examined for expression of the C/EBP-β, -δ, and -α genes. As expected, based on its known tissue-restricted expression, no C/EBP-α mRNA expression was detected in PC12 cells (data not shown). Similarly, no C/EBP-δ induction was apparent in these cells. However, C/EBP-β mRNA was detected readily even in untreated cells, and its expression was elevated further in response to arsenite treatment (Fig. 1, A and C). It is worth noting that while C/EBP-β mRNA levels begin to decline after 6 h of treatment, this is not reflected in C/EBP-β protein levels, which remain high for the duration of the arsenite treatment (Fig. 2). It is possible that differences in mRNA stability or protein turnover rates account for such differences.Fig. 2Western blot analysis of GADD153, C/EBP-β, and C/EBP-δ protein levels in arsenite-treated PC12 cells. Total cell lysates were prepared from PC12 cells treated with sodium arsenite for various lengths of time (h). Western blot analysis was performed with 60 µg of protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mobility of molecular mass standards is given on the right side of the figure (in kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western blot analysis was used to determine whether induction of GADD153 and C/EBP-β mRNAs was associated with increased amounts of the respective proteins. As seen in Fig. 2, arsenite treatment of PC12 cells resulted in a time-dependent increase in both GADD153 and C/EBP-β proteins. C/EBP-β was present as a doublet, consistent with previous observations by others in PC12 cells (23Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Google Scholar). In contrast to that seen for GADD153 and C/EBP-β, C/EBP-δ protein expression was low and did not change in response to arsenite treatment. These findings are consistent with the lack of C/EBP-δ mRNA expression noted above. Experiments employing either recombinant proteins in vitro or vectors overexpressing the proteins in transiently transfected cells have provided evidence that the GADD153 and C/EBP proteins can form dimers (14Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). Whether such interactions occur between endogenous proteins in vivo has not been demonstrated. Since both GADD153 and C/EBP-β show increased expression in response to arsenite treatment, we sought evidence for their functional interaction in vivo. To examine this possibility, two-stage experiments were performed in which C/EBP-β, C/EBP-δ, and GADD153 proteins were first immunoprecipitated from control (0 h) and arsenite-treated (8 h) cells under mild nondenaturing conditions, after which the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of GADD153 protein by Western analysis (Fig. 3A). As shown, immunoprecipitation of each of the three proteins, C/EBP-β, C/EBP-δ, and GADD153, with their respective antibodies followed by Western analysis with the same antibody resulted in the expected size bands (lanes 1–3 and 6), verifying the specificity of the various antibodies and successful immunoprecipitation of each protein. Although Western analysis of C/EBP-β immunoprecipitates with an anti-GADD153 antibody showed little or no GADD153 protein in control cells (lane 4), a significant amount of GADD153 protein coprecipitated with C/EBP-β in 8-h arsenite-treated cells (lane 7). Similar experiments with C/EBP-δ immunoprecipitates showed no evidence of GADD153 protein in either control or arsenite-treated cells (lanes 5 and 8). To confirm the specificity of the GADD153-C/EBP-β interactions, the inverse experiment was performed. GADD153 antibody immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of C/EBP-β by Western analysis in both untreated and arsenite-treated cellular extracts (Fig. 3B). Immunoprecipitation using a GADD153 antibody revealed a novel band of 29 kDa which corresponds to the molecular mass of GADD153. This band was seen only in extracts prepared from arsenite-treated cells (lanes 9 and 10). Western analysis of the same GADD153 immunoprecipitates using antibodies against C/EBP-β resulted in detection of C/EBP-β only in lanes in which GADD153 was also detected (lanes 11 and 12). These results are consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A and lend further support for GADD153-C/EBP-β interactions in response to arsenite treatment. We previously identified a functional C/EBP binding site in the GADD153 promoter and demonstrated that this site is responsible for the transactivation of a GADD153-CAT reporter construct by C/EBPs in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (24Sylvester S.L. Rhys C.M.J. Luethy-Martindale J.D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Google Scholar). Since C/EBP-β and GADD153 are induced by arsenite in PC12 cells, it was of interest to determine whether, in this cell type, C/EBP-β would bind to this same promoter region and thereby contribute to the activation of GADD153. Nuclear extracts isolated at various times after arsenite treatment were analyzed for binding activity to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide encompassing the GADD153-C/EBP site (Fig. 4A). A time-dependent increase in protein binding to the GADD153-C/EBP oligonucleotide was observed with two regions of binding activity. A faster migrating band (labeled A) was maximum in abundance 2 h after arsenite treatment but decreased in activity thereafter. The second, slower migrating band (labeled B) increased at later time points (maximum at 6 h). A third band (labeled C) was present in both treated and untreated extracts. As shown in Fig. 4B, binding activity associated with all bands was competed out by the addition of excess cold (unlabeled) GADD153-C/EBP oligonucleotide (self), but not by the addition of oligonucleotides containing binding sites for other unrelated transcription factors (NFκB or SP-1). Supershift analysis was used to determine the presence of C/EBP-β and GADD153 proteins in the DNA-binding complexes of nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated with arsenite for either 2 or 6 h (Fig. 4C). Extracts preincubated with labeled probe were incubated further with nothing (−), preimmune (normal) serum (NS), or antibodies specific to C/EBP-β (β) or GADD153 prior to gel loading (Fig. 4C). Lanes containing anti-C/EBP-β antibody showed the appearance of a novel band or supershift, indicating that C/EBP-β contributes to the DNA-binding complexes seen with extracts from arsenite-treated cells. The absence of GADD153 in the DNA-binding complexes, as evidenced by the lack of a supershift, is consistent with the notion that GADD153 contains a nonfunctional DNA binding domain. Similar analysis using antibodies specific for C/EBP-α and C/EBP-δ also showed no evidence of a shift in the DNA binding pattern, indicating that these proteins do not contribute to the DNA-binding complexes (data not shown). The ability of C/EBP-β to transactivate the GADD153 promoter in PC12 cells is shown in Fig. 5A. Cotransfection of a GADD153 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (GADD153-LUC) with increasing amounts of a plasmid that constitutively expresses high levels of C/EBP-β resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. Next, we examined whether overexpression of GADD153 protein could block GADD153 promoter transactivation by C/EBP-β. For this experiment, 1 µg of GADD153-LUC reporter construct was transfected into PC12 cells along with 3 µg of C/EBP-β expression vector and varying amounts of expression vectors containing the GADD153 cDNA sequence in either the sense (solid bars) or antisense (hatched bars) orientation. As shown in Fig. 5B, transfection of cells with the plasmid overexpressing GADD153 in the sense orientation prevented transactivation of the GADD153 promoter by C/EBP-β, whereas the antisense expressing vector was without effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that GADD153 is itself a C/EBP-regulated gene and that expression of GADD153 protein serves to feedback and suppress transactivation of GADD153. Although in vitro studies with purified proteins and in vivo experiments using vectors overexpressing GADD153 and C/EBP-β indicated that these proteins could in fact form heterodimers, prior to this report no studies had shown evidence for an interaction between endogenous C/EBP-β and GADD153. In this study we provide evidence for such an interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GADD153-C/EBP-β heterocomplexes increase in arsenite-treated cells. Since both C/EBP-β and GADD153 are ubiquitously expressed and are up-regulated in response to numerous treatments, C/EBP-β and GADD153 heterodimers are likely to function not only in regulating gene expression in response to arsenite, but also during other conditions of stress. We had shown previously that GADD153 expression increases in rat liver during the acute phase response following lipopolysaccharide injection (24Sylvester S.L. Rhys C.M.J. Luethy-Martindale J.D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Google Scholar). We suggested that in liver, GADD153 was itself a C/EBP-regulated gene and perhaps was involved in the attenuation of the acute phase response through its interference with C/EBP activity. Our findings presented here are consistent with this view and further extend the role of GADD153-C/EBP interactions to other conditions of stress, as well as to other cell types. Based on our current knowledge, we propose the model depicted in Fig. 6 in which GADD153 protein plays a role both in self-regulating GADD153 gene expression as well as in the attenuation of other C/EBP-β-regulated genes. According to the proposed model, in the absence of stress both C/EBP-β and GADD153 protein levels are relatively low, although levels of C/EBP-β are higher than GADD153. Following stress, C/EBP-β DNA binding activity increases as a result of posttranslational modification of preexisting C/EBP-β as well as from increased levels of new C/EBP-β protein. C/EBP-β then acts to activate GADD153 transcriptionally (as well as other C/EBP-β-regulated genes). As GADD153 protein levels increase, GADD153 and C/EBP-β form heterodimers, resulting in a relative decline in C/EBP-β dimers capable of binding to the promoter. Therefore, it is the ratio of GADD153 and C/EBP-β proteins which determines whether transcriptional activity will be enhanced or suppressed. Although it is presented in a simplistic form in Fig. 6, this model does not preclude the interaction of C/EBP-β with other regulatory proteins. Furthermore, it is important to note that although neither our current nor our previous studies on the acute phase response have provided evidence to suggest any interaction between GADD153 and C/EBP-δ, these do not preclude the possibility for such interactions in other cell types or in response to other stresses where C/EBP-δ is highly expressed. Finally, it is also possible that, like other C/EBPs, GADD153 interacts with other classes of leucine zipper proteins to modify their DNA binding activity, and such interactions could have either an inhibitory or stimulatory (through relief of repression) effect on gene transcription. Whatever the outcome, the GADD153 protein, through its interaction with C/EBPs, is likely to participate in the regulation of gene expression during the cellular response to a variety of stressful conditions."

Also a LacS deletion mutant, lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain, could be amplified to levels >20% of membrane protein. Membranes from S. thermophilus proved to be superior in terms of efficient solubilization and ease and extent of purification of LacS; >95% of LacS was solubilized with relatively low concentrations of Triton X-100, n-octyl-β-D-glucoside, n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, or C12E8. The LacS protein carrying a poly-histidine tag was purified in large quantities (∼5 mg/liter of culture) and with a purity >98% in a two-step process involving nickel chelate affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The membrane reconstitution of LacS was studied systematically by stepwise solubilization of preformed liposomes, prepared from E. coli phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine, and protein incorporation at the different stages of liposome solubilization. The detergents were removed by adsorption onto polystyrene beads and H+-lactose symport and lactose counterflow were measured. Highest transport activities were obtained when Triton X-100 was used throughout the solubilization/purification procedure, whereas activity was lost irreversibly with n-octyl-β-D-glucoside. For reconstitutions mediated by n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, C12E8, and to a lesser extent Triton X-100, the highest transport activities were obtained when the liposomes were titrated with low amounts of detergent (onset of liposome solubilization). Importantly, under these conditions proteoliposomes were obtained in which LacS was reconstituted in an inside-out orientation, as suggested by the outside labeling of a single cysteine mutant with a membrane impermeable biotin-maleimide. The results are consistent with a mechanism of reconstitution in which the hydrophilic regions of LacS prevent a random insertion of the protein into the membrane.

To determine whether the IL-10R has signaling functions similar to IL-6R in cells normally expressing these receptors, leukocytes of the B-, T-, and NK-cell lineages were treated with either cytokine.

Although IL-10 and IL-4 are involved in the control of the same physiological process and have common target cells such as lymphocytes and monocytes, their mechanism of actions appears to be substantially different. The IL-10R is structurally related to IFN receptors (3Ho A.S. Liu Y. Khan T.A. Hsu D.H. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11267-11271Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Wei S.H.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3773-3779Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (27Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Google Scholar) with DNA mixtures containing 1 µg/ml expression vector for receptors and 3 µg/ml expression for STATs. Transfected cultures were subdivided and used to determine the activation of STAT isoforms by 15 min cytokine treatment as described (21Wang Y. Morella K.K. Ripperger J. Lai C.-F. Gearing D.P.

Virology. 1973; 52: 456-461Google Scholar) using DNA mixture containing CAT reporter gene construct (15 µg/ml), expression vector for receptors (1 µg/ml) and for STATs (1–5 µg/ml) (15Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Subcultures were treated for 24 h with cytokines, extracted, and analyzed for CAT activity following standard procedures (16Morella K.K. Lai C. Kumaki S. Kumaki N. Wang Y. Bluman E.M. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Giri J. Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Ziegler S.F. Tweardy D.J. Campos S.P. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8298-8310Google Scholar, 21Wang Y. Morella K.K. Ripperger J.

Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Google Scholar). The normalized values for CAT activity were expressed relative to the untreated control in each experimental series (=1.0). Cell cultures transfected with bacterial β-galactosidase gene were stained, and the percentage of strongly positive cells was determined in randomly chosen areas on the culture dish (containing between 250 ando 390 cells). The transient transfection protocol for HepG2 cells yielded high expressing transfectants that amounted to 2.1 ± 2.4% of the cells in the culture (mean ± S.D., n = 50). A retroviral expression vector for the human IL-10R (MSCV-hIL-10R) was constructed by inserting the 2200-bp XhoI fragment of the hIL-10R cDNA (4Liu Y. Wei S.H. Ho A.S. de Wassl Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1821-1829Google Scholar) into the XhoI site of MSCVneoEB carrying the bacterial neo gene (29Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H.L. Fong A.Z.C. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138Google Scholar). Replication-defective recombinant MSCV-hIL-10R virus with amphotropic host range was produced from stably transduced PA317 packaging cells (30Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Google Scholar; American Type Culture Collection CRL 9078) generated essentially as described (31Hawley R.G. Fong A.Z.C. Ngan B.-Y. Hawley T.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1113-1123Google Scholar) by infection with virus harvested from transiently transfected GP+E-86 ecotropic packaging cells (32Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Virus-containing supernatant was collected from confluent cultures 24 h after medium change and filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane. The virus titer on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was 1 × 107 G418-resistant colony-forming units/ml. The virus-containing medium was added to monolayers of HepG2 cells in the presence of 8 µg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 12 h. The infected cells were cultured in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The viral infection was repeated twice on the same cell population after 3 and 6 days. The cells with vector integration were selected by increasing G418 in the culture medium to 2 mg/ml. The proliferating cells recovered after 4 weeks of selection (termed IL-10R-HepG2 cells) were used for the analysis of IL-10R functions. Whole cell extracts were prepared and applied to EMSA as described (33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 26: 1739-1744Google Scholar). The 23-bp high affinity SIEm67 (5′-GATCTGATTACGGGAAATG-3, 33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

Hocke G. Goel A. Fey G.H. Mol. Biol. & Med. 1991; 8: 267-285Google Scholar) as substrate for STAT1, −5, and −6 (21Wang Y. Morella K.K. Ripperger J. Lai C.-F. Gearing D.P. Fey G.H. Campos S.P.

Anti-STAT3 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT1 (anti-ISGF-3, Transduction Laboratories), and control antibodies (Cappel) were used for supershift assay. Extracts from HepG2 and H-35 cells treated for 15 min with IL-6 were included as standard for indicating the relative mobilities of human and rat SIF complexes, respectively (16Morella K.K. Lai C. Kumaki S. Kumaki N. Wang Y. Bluman E.M. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Giri J. Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Ziegler S.F. Tweardy D.J. Campos S.P. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Aliquots of cell extracts (30 µg of protein) were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and reacted with anti-STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complex was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham). The amount of plasma proteins secreted into the culture medium was quantitated by immunoelectrophoresis using monospecific antibodies to human plasma proteins (Dako Corp.). Total cell RNA were extracted (34Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20 µg of RNA were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel, transferred to Nytran Plus membrane (Scheicher & Schuell), and analyzed by hybridization with 32P-labeled IL-10R cDNA (4Liu Y. Wei S.H. Ho A.S. de Wassl Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1821-1829Google Scholar). The primary structure of the IL-10R indicated the presence of two box 3 sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domain at positions 446–449 (YXRQ) and 496–499 (YXKQ) in the human receptor (4Liu Y. Wei S.H. Ho A.S. de Wassl Malefyt R. Moore K.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1821-1829Google Scholar) and at positions 427–430 (YXKQ) and 477–480 (YXKQ) in the mouse receptor (11Ho A.S.-Y. Wei S.H.-Y. Mui L.-F. Miyajima A. Moore K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Google Scholar). Such box 3 motifs have been identified in gp130 and found necessary for activating STAT1 and STAT3 and for inducing transcription via IL-6RE (23Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Google Scholar, 36Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar). Hence, we wished to determine whether the IL-10R exerted a signaling reaction with the specificity of the IL-6R. As the first step, we compared the STAT activation patterns in cells constitutively expressing both receptors (37Jurlander J. Lai C.-F. Tan J. Chou C.C. Geisler G.H. Narula S.K. Baumann H. Caligiuri M.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1371Google Scholar) and used lymphocytes isolated from a B-cell CLL patient. Treatment with various cytokines revealed the receptor-specific recruitment of latent DNA binding factors (Fig. 1A, Second Preparation). The extracts from IL-10- and IL-6-treated cells produced complexes that comigrated with SIF-A, -B, and -C which, based on the previous analyses (33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 26: 1739-1744Google Scholar, 38Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Google Scholar), consisted of SIE bound to STAT3 homodimer, STAT3 and STAT1 heterodimer, and STAT1 homodimer, respectively. The contribution of STAT1 and STAT3 to the SIF patterns was also detected by antibody supershift assay (Figs. 1C and 2B). The cells responded to IL-4 and IFNγ by activating appropriately STAT6 and STAT1, respectively. These factors yielded the characteristic EMSA patterns with SIE and TB-2 (Fig. 1A). IL-2 and IL-15 were ineffective; thus, a receptor activation of STAT5 could not be detected in these cells. The STAT activation pattern in the freshly isolated lymphocyte preparation was comparable to that in cells collected from the same patient one year earlier (Fig. 1A, First Preparation). Differences appeared to be quantitative and included a more effective activation of the SIF-C complex by IL-6 and a lower IL-4 response. The ability of IL-10 and IL-6 to activate SIE-binding factors was also observed in CLL cells collected from different patients (Fig. 1B). In each case, IL-10 was highly effective, whereas IL-6 action was more variable. By antibody supershift assay, we determined that STAT3 and, to a lesser extent, STAT1 contributed to the complex SIF pattern as noted in the example of the IL-10- or IL-6-treated CLL cells from patient A (Fig. 1C). The EMSA patterns obtained with extracts from CLL cells were highly similar to the patterns from IL-6-treated HepG2 cells, whose STAT1 and STAT3 compositions (Fig. 1C) were in agreement with published data (33Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 26: 1739-1744Google Scholar, 38Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Google Scholar). The minor response to IL-6 of some of the CLL cell preparations (e.g. Patient 6 in Fig. 1B) may in part be due to a lower level of effective IL-6R subunits in these cells. Nevertheless, despite the rather drastic differences in intensities, the SIF patterns produced by IL-10 and IL-6 in the individual cell preparations showed comparable qualitative compositions (Fig. 1, C and D). To identify whether the pattern of STAT activation by the IL-10R in CCL cells was representative for other IL-10R-bearing cells, we analyzed freshly isolated resting T-cells, and cells from the established NK-92 line (Fig. 2A). Based on the SIF pattern, IL-10 prominently activated STAT3 and to a lesser extent STAT1, which could be verified by antibody supershift assay (Fig. 2B). IL-6 was only effective in T-cells and elicited a strong activation of STAT1 and −3. The IL-2 or IL-15 response in T-cells and NK-92 cells demonstrated that these cells, unlike CLL cells, express and activate STAT5 that produced a prominent complex with TB-2 (Fig. 2A). Although a relatively minor TB-2-bound complex was also noted in IL-10-treated T-cells, this complex was not recognized by anti-STAT5 in supershift EMSA (data not shown) and may represent complexes including STAT1 and/or STAT3 (22Ripperger J.A. Fritz S. Richter K. Hocke G.M. Lottspeich T. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Google Scholar). 2J. Ripperger, unpublished data. Since each of the lymphocyte types analyzed in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 contained a characteristic and complex mixture of DNA-binding proteins, a precise assessment of the IL-10R's capability to activate individual STAT proteins and to compare its action with that of the IL-6R was difficult. Therefore, we defined the signaling potential of the IL-10R by reconstitution in the IL-10R-deficient COS-1 cells using overexpressed proteins (Fig. 3). To grade the specificity and efficacy of the signaling, we tested in parallel transfected G-CSFR. The G-CSFR was selected because like the IL-10R, it is a homo-oligomeric receptor (39Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Google Scholar), contains one box 3 motif, and is able to activate with equal efficiency STAT1, STAT3 (Fig. 3A, patterns with SIE), and STAT5B (Fig. 3A, patterns with TB-2). The transfected IL-10R activated STAT1 and STAT3. By comparing the intensity of the SIF complexes, the IL-10R, unlike the G-CSFR, appeared to have a higher preference for STAT3 than STAT1. The STAT3 preference was also noted in the presence of overexpressed STAT1. One half of the radioactivity was confined to a heterodimeric complex that included transfected STAT1 and COS-1 STAT3 and migrated slower than the rat STAT1 homodimer (SIF-C in Fig. 3A). The activation of endogenous COS-1 STAT3 by transfected IL-10R (Fig. 3A, major band in the lane labeled control + 10 is COS-1 SIF-A) was particularly notable because transfection of various hematopoietin receptors, including the G-CSFR and those for IL-6-type cytokines, had yielded primarily activation of COS-1 STAT1 (15Lai C.-F.

Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23254-23257Google Scholar). No detectable effect of the IL-10R on STAT5B or −6 was evident. The failure of STAT5B activation appeared to distinguish the IL-10R from many hematopoietin receptors including the G-CSFR (Fig. 3A, TB-2 panel), which have shown the potential to activate STAT5 (40Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-256Google Scholar, 41Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar). That the reconstituted COS-1 cells provided abundant amounts of STAT5 proteins was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). The results indicated that signaling functions initiated by the IL-10R in the normal cell environment (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) could be accurately reproduced by transfection into heterologous cells (Fig. 3). The effects of the IL-10R, with the exception of activating STAT5, were similar to those of box 3-containing hematopoietin receptors, but clearly differed from IFNα/βR or IFNγR, even though, like the IL-10R, the latter two receptors utilized JAK1 and TYK2 as signal-communicating kinases (10Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 11Ho A.S.-Y. Wei S.H.-Y. Mui L.-F. Miyajima A. Moore K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Google Scholar, 41Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar). Signaling by the IL-10R may involve reactions that have been predicted for gp130 (31Hawley R.G. Fong A.Z.C. Ngan B.-Y. Hawley T.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1113-1123Google Scholar, 42Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Google Scholar) and may entail the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in box 3 that in turn serves as a high affinity docking site for STAT3, and to a lesser degree, for STAT1. The activation of STAT function is conceivably due to the action of IL-10R-associated JAK1 and/or TYK2 (10Finbloom D.S. Winestock K.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1079-1090Google Scholar, 11Ho A.S.-Y. Wei S.H.-Y. Mui L.-F. Miyajima A. Moore K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Google Scholar). To assess whether the IL-10R executed a gp130-like effect not only on STAT activation but also on gene transcription that may or may not be caused by STATs, we needed a suitable experimental assay system. Since we had no adequate molecular tools available to study gene induction by IL-6 or IL-10 in leukocytes, we resorted to the application of hepatoma cells as surrogate system. Hepatoma cells were attractive because the IL-6R-mediated gene induction had been well characterized in these cells and the signaling process could experimentally be manipulated. We transfected the IL-10R together with characteristic IL-6-responsive CAT gene constructs, pHRRE-CAT and pIL-6RE-CAT, into HepG2 cells. We had verified that HepG2 cells do not express endogenous IL-10R mRNA nor respond to IL-10 treatment (see Fig. 6, A, C, and D). IL-10 treatment of the transfected cells stimulated the expression of both CAT gene constructs to a level achieved by IL-6 (Fig. 4, left panel), indicating that the ectopically expressed IL-10R was able to engage the cellular signaling mechanisms like the endogenous IL-6R. The CAT constructs represented artificial and optimized response systems whose regulation might substantially differ from that of natural gene promoters. Therefore, we also tested CAT reporter gene constructs that contained promoter and 5′ flanking regions of representative APP genes (Fig. 4, right panel). The promoter of the type 2 rat APP genes, α2-MG and SPI-3, both containing an APRE-related sequence, r"

All of these cross-links lead to inhibition of ATP hydrolysis activity. In the two double mutants, containing a cysteine in εSer-108 along with either the DELSEED region of β (Glu-381) or the homologous region in α (Ser-411), there was a clear nucleotide dependence of the cross-link formation with the ε subunit. In βE381C/εS108C the β-ε cross-link was obtained preferentially when Mg2+ and ADP + Pi (addition of MgCl2+ ATP) was present, while the α-ε cross-link product was strongly favored in the αS411C/εS108C mutant in the Mg2+ ATP state (addition of MgCl2+ 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate). In the triple mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108C, the ε subunit bound to the β subunit in Mg2+-ADP and to the α subunit in Mg2+-ATP, indicating a significant movement of this subunit.

INTRODUCTIONThere has been significant recent progress in determining the structure of the F1 part of the F1F0-type ATP synthase, a key enzyme in oxidative phosphorylation and photo-phosphorylation (Senior 27Senior A.E.

The F1, which can be detached from the F0 and studied separately, is a complex of five different types of subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε in the molar ratio 3:3:1:1:1. Electron microscopy has shown that the α and β subunits are hexagonally arranged, and alternate around a central cavity in which the γ subunit is located (Gogol et al. 18Gogol E.P. Aggeler R.

Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Lücken et al., 24Lücken U. Gogol E.P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recently published high resolution structure of a major part of the F1 molecule confirms the above described arrangement of the α, β, and γ subunits relative to one another and adds important details (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits have a similar overall fold, each made up of three domains: an NH2-terminal, predominantly β-sheet domain, a nucleotide-binding domain of 9 β strands and 9 α helices, and a COOH-terminal, predominantly α-helical domain, that provides the binding site for the ε subunit, probably the δ subunit, as well as the b subunit of the F0. The part of the γ subunit within the ring of α and β subunits is arranged as two α helices: a long COOH-terminal helix extending from the top NH2-terminal domain of the α and β subunits into the stalk region, and a short NH2-terminal helix running from the catalytic site domain into the stalk. These two α helices form a coiled coil. A third short α-helix of the γ subunit (residues 82-99 in the E. coli enzyme) is inclined at about 45° to the two larger helices at the bottom of the F1 as it becomes the stalk. The remainder of the γ subunit is unresolved in the structure, presumably because it was disordered in the crystal form. A key feature of F1 from a functional standpoint is its asymmetry, identified earlier and clearly revealed in the x-ray structure determination. In the crystal form examined, three α-β pairs can be distinguished based upon nucleotide occupancy of catalytic sites and by interactions of the γ subunit. One β subunit (βTP), with Mg2+ AMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in its catalytic site, is linked to the short α-helix of the γ subunit via the COOH-terminal domain at the sequence DELSEED (which is highly conserved in all F1ATPases). In a second β subunit, the catalytic site is empty (βE). The β subunit and its partner α subunit (αE) have several contacts with the two long α-helices of the γ subunit. The catalytic site in the third α-β pair (αDP-βDP) contains Mg2+-ADP. Overall, the interactions between the γ subunit and the ring of α and β subunits are few, and relatively nonspecific. The major contact is at the top of the molecule. Here, the COOH-terminal helix of γ is slotted into the continuous ring provided by hydrophobic loops under the β-sheet region of the six α and β subunits. Abrahams et al. (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) have likened this region to a molecular bearing which could allow the γ subunit to rotate relative to the α and β subunits. Evidence for movements of the γ subunit relative to α-β subunit pairs has been accumulating for several years, beginning with the electron microscopy studies of Gogol et al. (20Gogol E.P. Johnston E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13465-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also clear evidence of movements of the ε subunit during the working of the enzyme (Mendel-Hartvig and Capaldi, 26Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar; Aggeler et al., 4Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A.

Here, we describe experiments showing that the ε subunit can be bound at either α or β subunits, a switching that would appear to require significant rotational movements of this subunit within the α-β subunit ring.RESULTSFour different mutants were used in this study: (i) βE381C/εS108C, (ii) αS411C/εS108C, (iii) αS411C/βE381C, and (iv) αS411C/βE381C/εS108C. All grew to the same density on succinate and showed multisite or cooperative ATPase activities similar to wild-type enzyme, i.e. 8-14 µmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg.Cross-linking Studies with the Mutant β E381C/εS108CPrevious studies had shown that addition of CuCl2 to ECF1 isolated from the mutant βE381C/εS108C catalyzed disulfide bond formation between Cys-381 of one β subunit and the intrinsic Cys-87 of the γ subunit (see “Discussion”), as well as a cross-link between Cys-381 of a second β subunit and Cys-108 of ε (Aggeler et al. 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Either cross-link inhibited ATPase activity essentially fully. Additional cross-links were also formed in lower yield between an as yet unidentified intrinsic Cys of α and the intrinsic Cys-140 of δ, and between Cys-381 of the third β subunit and Cys-140 of δ. It was shown that neither of the cross-links involving the δ subunit affected activity. The cross-linking between β and ε, and β and γ subunits in the mutant βE381C/εS108C is both CuCl2 concentration dependent and sensitive to which nucleotides are present in catalytic sites, as shown in Fig. 1. With Mg2+ AMP-PNP (a non-cleavable analog of ATP) bound in the three catalytic sites (concentration 2 mM), the yield of cross-linking of β to ε is lower at all CuCl2 concentrations than with Mg2+ ADP + Pi in catalytic sites. At the same time, the yield of disulfide bond formation between β and γ is higher in Mg2+ AMP-PNP than in Mg2+ ADP + Pi.Cross-linking Studies with the Mutant αS411C/εS108CThe α and β subunits of F1-ATPases have a very similar fold (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) and residue 411 of the α subunit is the equivalent of Glu-381 in the DELSEED region of the β subunit. Treatment of ECF1 from the mutant αS411C/εS108C with CuCl2 induced disulfide bond formation between an α subunit and the ε subunit in high yield, along with a small amount of cross-linking between an α and the γ subunit (Fig. 2A). There was inhibition of ATPase activity in proportion to the yield of cross-linking (result not shown) as in the case of the mutant βE381C/εS108C (Aggeler et al., 6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the clear nucleotide dependence of the yield of cross-linking of α to ε. The ε subunit was linked to α with much higher yield at any CuCl2 concentration with Mg2+ AMP-PNP in catalytic sites than when Mg2+ ADP + Pi was present. This is the opposite of what is seen in the mutant βE381C/εS108C. Note that the yield of cross-linking of α to γ is low and relatively insensitive to nucleotide conditions (although essentially full cross-linking is obtained at 200 µM CuCl2, Fig. 2B) indicating that this product is less favored than the β-γ cross-linked product formed in the mutant βE381C/εS108C.Fig. 2Cross-linking of ECF1-ATPase from αS411C/εS108C. A, ATPase was precipitated in 70% ammonium sulfate and passed through two centrifuge columns in Sephadex G-50 in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. ECF1 at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol was supplemented with 2.5 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM ATP (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) or 2.5 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM AMP-PNP (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, samples were treated for 2 h at a CuCl2 concentration of 5 µM (lanes 3 and 4), 10 µM (lanes 5 and 6), 20 µM (lanes 7 and 8), 30 µM (lanes 9 and 10), and 40 µM (lanes 11 and 12). Controls containing no CuCl2 are shown in lanes 1 and 2. 32 µg of protein was loaded per lane. B, ATPase at 0.45 mg/ml was incubated for 2 h after adding 2.5 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM AMP-PNP with 200 µM CuCl2 (lane 1) or no CuCl2 (lane 2). 40 µg of protein was loaded per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cross-linking Studies with the Mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108CThe observations with mutants βE381C/εS108C and αS411C/εS108C suggest that the ε subunit is able to move between two positions in a nucleotide dependent manner, one position close to α, the other close to a β subunit. This was examined further in the mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108C. As shown in Fig. 3A, the predominant cross-linked product involving the ε subunit is with the β subunit in Mg2+ ADP + Pi and with the α subunit in Mg2+ AMP-PNP. These nucleotide dependent interactions of the ε subunit were clearly observed at 5 µM CuCl2 within 5 min. However, in order to obtain maximal cross-linking yields, incubation times longer than 30 min were necessary. CuCl2 treatment of the mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108C also created a cross-link product between an α and β subunit that was not seen in either mutant αS411C/εS108C or βE381C/εS108C, indicating that it involves disulfide bond formation between the Cys-411 of α and Cys-381 of β. This disulfide bond formation between the α and β subunits inhibited ATPase activity in proportion to yield, based on studies with the mutant αS411C/βE381C in which this is the exclusive cross-linked product at low CuCl2 concentrations (result not shown). At high CuCl2 concentrations, it was possible to obtain very high yields of the α-β subunit product and, at the same time, to get essentially full cross-linking of γ and ε in products with an α or β subunit (Fig. 3B). The only significant triple subunit cross-link observed involved α+β and the δ subunit. Therefore, the α-β pair that becomes internally cross-linked is different from the α-β pair interacting with ε, or that pair interacting with the γ subunit. It may be the α-β pair that interacts internally is the one that has the δ subunit bound. However, it is not clear that the δ subunit is bound at its physiological binding site in isolated F1, which complicates the analysis.Fig. 3Cross-linking of ECF1-ATPase from αS411C/βE381C/εS108C. A, ATPase was precipitated in 70% ammonium sulfate and passed through two centrifuge columns in Sephadex G-50 in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. ECF1 at a concentration of 0.7 mg/ml in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol was supplemented with 2.5 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM ATP (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) or 2.5 mM MgCl2+ 2 mM AMP-PNP (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, samples were treated for 2 h at a CuCl2 concentration of 1 µM (lanes 3 and 4), 2 µM (lanes 5 and 6), 5 µM (lanes 7 and 8), and 10 µM (lanes 9 and 10).

After cross-linking, no dithiothreitol (lanes 1 and 2) and 20 mM dithiothreitol (lanes 3 and 4), respectively, was added and incubation carried out for 3 h at room temperature. 40 µg of protein was loaded per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of CuCl2 treatment on ECF1F0 isolated from the mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108C is shown in Fig. 4A. The same α-β cross-linked product, along with cross-links involving α and β with γ and ε, were obtained in the intact ATP synthase that were seen in isolated ECF1. Moreover, the nucleotide dependent shifting of the ε subunit between an α and β subunit was also observed in ECF1F0 (Fig. 4, B and C).Fig. 4Cross-linking of ECF1F0 ATP synthase from αS411C/βE381C/εS108C. A, F1F0 was reconstituted in egg lecithin vesicles on a Sephadex G-50 column in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM dithioerythritol, and 10% glycerol. Before CuCl2 induced cross-linking, the ATP synthase was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor. The pellet was resuspended and pelleted twice in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. At a protein concentration of 0.26 mg/ml, 2 mM ATP was added and, after 10 min at room temperature, 100 µM CuCl2 was added and incubation carried out for 2 h (lane 2). A control containing no CuCl2 was applied on lane 1. 30 µg of enzyme were loaded per lane under non-reducing conditions. B, F1F0 at 0.46 mg/ml in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol was supplemented with 2 mM ATP (lanes 1 and 3) or 2 mM AMP-PNP (lanes 2 and 4) and incubated for 10 min. Samples were cross-linked with 5 µM CuCl2 for 15 min, either with (lanes 1 and 2) or without (lanes 3 and 4) prior addition of 7.5 mM EDTA. 50 µg of protein was applied per lane.

Monoclonal antibodies used were against γ subunit (lane 1), α subunit (lane 2), β subunit (lane 3), and ε subunit (lanes 4 and 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In ECF1F0, there was less than full cross-linking of γ and ε to α and β subunits. At the same time, there appeared to be a higher yield of the α-β cross-linked product than can be accounted for by only one α-β pair being involved. This suggests that there is competition between cross-linking of ε and γ to α and β versus cross-linking between α and β subunits, which is in favor of the latter product in the intact ATP synthase.DISCUSSIONThe results of CuCl2-induced disulfide bond formation in mutants that have a Cys at position 381 of the β subunit and at the equivalent position, 411, in the α subunit, along with a Cys in the ε subunit at position 108, provide important insight into the dynamics of the structure of ECF1 and ECF1F0. They show clearly that the ε subunit can move such that the COOH-terminal domain of this subunit interacts with the equivalent regions of either an α or β subunit. The shifting of the ε subunit between these subunits is nucleotide dependent. With Mg2+ ADP + Pi in catalytic sites, the linkage of ε from the Cys at 108 is predominantly with Cys-381 of a β subunit, while in Mg2+-ATP (by using Mg2+ AMP-PNP) the ε subunit is linked to the equivalent position in the α subunit. The cross-linking results described here expand on our previous cryoelectron microscopy studies which had shown a shifting of the ε subunit by 20-25 Å between adjacent α and β subunits. In addition to interactions with α and β subunits, the ε subunit is also bound to the γ subunit (Dunn, 16Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Aggeler et al., 4Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) 2C. Tang and R. A. Capaldi, unpublished data. and to the c subunit ring of the F0 part of the ATP synthase complex (Zhang and Fillingame, 31Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24609-24614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We suggest, therefore, that the movements of the ε subunit seen here, and in Wilkens and Capaldi (30Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), are involved in energy coupling between the F1 and F0 parts.Our data also show a nucleotide dependent movement of the γ subunit in concert with the movement of the ε subunit. The γ subunit can be cross-linked to a β subunit readily with ATP bound, less readily with Mg2+-ADP bound in catalytic sites. In what may be its less tightly bound state, in Mg2+-ADP, the γ subunit appears to be able to reside somewhat closer to an α subunit and can be trapped there by prolonged incubation in high concentrations of CuCl2. This interaction between γ and β subunits involves Cys-87 based on the close positioning of this residue and β Glu-381 from the crystallographic data (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar), and based on recent studies from Duncan et al. (15Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) in which cross-linking between the β (DELSEED region) and γ subunit was abolished in the mutant ECF1βD380C/γC87S. Cross-linking between the α and γ subunits most likely involves Cys-87 as well, but the possibility that Cys-112 is involved has not been ruled out.In the mutant αS411C/βE381C/εS108C, there is high yield cross-linking of α to β subunits by CuCl2 treatment involving the Cys residues introduced into these subunits. This requires the rotation of the COOH-terminal α-helical region of α and/or β toward each other. That such a rotation can occur is evident in the recent high resolution structure of MF1 (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). In the form of the enzyme crystallized, αE is arranged differently with respect to αDP or αTP in that the region involving Ser-411 is rotated so that it is very close to the region of βDP including E381, i.e. the distance between these two residues is 6.8 Å from α backbone carbon to α backbone carbon. The results presented here show that rotation of α subunits with respect to β subunits occurs not only in F1, but also in F1F0, implying that catalytic sites can be open at all times even in the presence of high concentrations of ATP or ADP.In terms of the mechanism of cooperative ATP hydrolysis (and ATP synthesis) it is possible that the switching of the ε, and possibly the γ subunit, shown schematically in Fig. 5, is an oscillation between two adjacent subunit (pairs). If this switching is not back and forth, but continues clockwise or anti-clockwise, the rotation of the small subunit(s) could then “alternate” the different nucleotide affinities of the three catalytic sites.Fig. 5Nucleotide dependent arrangement of small subunits in ECF1 ATPase. Cross-links formed between subunits and positions of the ε and γ subunit in the presence of Mg2+ ADP + Pi (MgCl2+ ATP) and Mg2+-ATP (MgCl2+ AMP-PNP) are indicated with solid and dashed lines, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) INTRODUCTIONThere has been significant recent progress in determining the structure of the F1 part of the F1F0-type ATP synthase, a key enzyme in oxidative phosphorylation and photo-phosphorylation (Senior 27Senior A.E.

The F1, which can be detached from the F0 and studied separately, is a complex of five different types of subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε in the molar ratio 3:3:1:1:1. Electron microscopy has shown that the α and β subunits are hexagonally arranged, and alternate around a central cavity in which the γ subunit is located (Gogol et al. 18Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28 (a): 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Bork T. Capaldi R.A.

Biochemical studies place the δ and ε subunits (nomenclature for the Escherichia coli enzyme) at the bottom of the α3β3γ core complex (Beckers et al., 7Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim.

Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Lücken et al., 24Lücken U. Gogol E.P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recently published high resolution structure of a major part of the F1 molecule confirms the above described arrangement of the α, β, and γ subunits relative to one another and adds important details (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits have a similar overall fold, each made up of three domains: an NH2-terminal, predominantly β-sheet domain, a nucleotide-binding domain of 9 β strands and 9 α helices, and a COOH-terminal, predominantly α-helical domain, that provides the binding site for the ε subunit, probably the δ subunit, as well as the b subunit of the F0. The part of the γ subunit within the ring of α and β subunits is arranged as two α helices: a long COOH-terminal helix extending from the top NH2-terminal domain of the α and β subunits into the stalk region, and a short NH2-terminal helix running from the catalytic site domain into the stalk. These two α helices form a coiled coil. A third short α-helix of the γ subunit (residues 82-99 in the E. coli enzyme) is inclined at about 45° to the two larger helices at the bottom of the F1 as it becomes the stalk. The remainder of the γ subunit is unresolved in the structure, presumably because it was disordered in the crystal form. A key feature of F1 from a functional standpoint is its asymmetry, identified earlier and clearly revealed in the x-ray structure determination. In the crystal form examined, three α-β pairs can be distinguished based upon nucleotide occupancy of catalytic sites and by interactions of the γ subunit. One β subunit (βTP), with Mg2+ AMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in its catalytic site, is linked to the short α-helix of the γ subunit via the COOH-terminal domain at the sequence DELSEED (which is highly conserved in all F1ATPases). In a second β subunit, the catalytic site is empty (βE). The β subunit and its partner α subunit (αE) have several contacts with the two long α-helices of the γ subunit. The catalytic site in the third α-β pair (αDP-βDP) contains Mg2+-ADP. Overall, the interactions between the γ subunit and the ring of α and β subunits are few, and relatively nonspecific. The major contact is at the top of the molecule. Here, the COOH-terminal helix of γ is slotted into the continuous ring provided by hydrophobic loops under the β-sheet region of the six α and β subunits. Abrahams et al. (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) have likened this region to a molecular bearing which could allow the γ subunit to rotate relative to the α and β subunits. Evidence for movements of the γ subunit relative to α-β subunit pairs has been accumulating for several years, beginning with the electron microscopy studies of Gogol et al. (20Gogol E.P. Johnston E.

It esterified the hydroxyl group at the carbon-1 position of the ceramide. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 4.2 and a Km of 9.4 µM for N-acetylsphingosine at pH 4.5. The transacylase activity is independent of free fatty acid or acyl-CoA and instead uses the 2-acyl group of phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine. The transacylase activity in the homogenate was present in the 100,000 × g supernatant, and the lipid extracted from the membranous fraction could function as a donor of the acyl group. When liposomes consisting of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine:1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine:sulfatide (70:0.2:30) were incubated with the supernatant and N-acetylsphingosine, the formation of free arachidonic acid and O-arachidonoyl-N-acetylsphingosine was observed. The ratio of the two products depended on the concentration of ceramide; only the free acid was formed if the truncated ceramide was absent. Both deacylase and transacylase activities were inhibited 50–60% by 20 µMD-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of several glucosphingolipid synthases. Neither activity was inhibited by nonadecyltetraenyl trifluoromethyl ketone, a potent inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2. N-Acetyldihydrosphingosine and N-octanoylsphingosine were only 55 and 10%, respectively, as effective as N-acetylsphingosine as acyl acceptors. Oleoylsphingosine was only slightly reactive. An esterase that releases the truncated ceramide from its ester linkage appears to be membrane bound. Lecithin was less effective than phosphatidylethanolamine as an acyl donor in the transacylation. Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cultures treated with N-acetyl-[3-3H]sphingosine formed radioactive polar sphingolipids, long chain ceramide, free sphingosine, and O-acyl-N-acetylsphingosine.

T3, an active form of the thyroid hormones, exerts its effect through binding to its nuclear receptor and regulating expression of target genes. Thus, identification of T3-responsive genes in various tissues is important to elucidate T3 action at molecular and cellular levels in humans. However, the search for T3-responsive genes in human tissues is hampered by the difficulty of obtaining tissues from subjects in various thyroid states. Clonal cell lines established from malignant tissues could be used to identify T3-responsive genes. However, they might aberrantly respond to hormones (1Seo H. Refetoff S. Fang V.S. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 216-226Google Scholar, 2Dannies P.S. Yen P.M. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Endocrinology. 1977; 101: 1151-1156Google Scholar). Identification of T3-responsive gene(s) from the tissues that maintain differentiated function is thus preferable. Human skin fibroblasts fulfill this requirement since they express T3-receptors (3Ichikawa K. DeGroot L.J. Refetoff S. Horwitz A.L. Pollak E.R. Metabolism. 1986; 35: 861-868Google Scholar, 4Klann R.C. Torres B. Menke J.B. Holbrook C.T. Bercu B.B. Usala S.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 969-975Google Scholar, 5Hayashi Y. Janssen O.E.

These effects of T3 were used for the tissue diagnosis of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (11Refetoff S. Weiss R.E. Usala S.J. Endocr.

Despite the fact that cultured human skin fibroblasts are responsive to T3, few T3-responsive genes have been cloned. Recently, Liang and Pardee (12Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Google Scholar, 13Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968Google Scholar) developed a method called “differential display of mRNA by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)” to identify and analyze altered gene expression at the mRNA level in any eukaryotic cells. A similar method was developed by Welsh et al. (14Welsh J. Chada K. Dalal S. Ralph D. Chang R. McClelland M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4965-4970Google Scholar, 15Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Google Scholar). We have chosen the method to clone T3-responsive genes in cultured skin fibroblasts, since it has been successfully employed to identify transcripts specific for human tumors (13Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968Google Scholar). We identified a T3-responsive gene expressed in cultured human skin fibroblasts. The expression of the gene termed ZAKI-4 is positively regulated by a physiological concentration of T3. Complete cDNA sequence obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (16Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 28Google Scholar) revealed that the gene is transcribed into two mRNA species, both of which code a single peptide of 192 amino acids. Skin fibroblasts were obtained by punch biopsies from the deltoid region of four healthy subjects (two men and two women, ranging in age from 9 to 37 years old (males 9 and 29 years, females 25 and 37 years)). The fibroblasts were used between the fourth and the ninth passages after the initial plating and were grown to confluence in 60-mm-diameter plastic culture dishes (Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) with 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioserum, Victoria, Australia) and 50 units/ml penicillin G (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in an atmosphere of air, 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity. To study the effect of T3 on ZAKI-4 mRNA, the cells were exposed to 4 ml of the same medium in which fetal bovine serum was replaced with 10% bovine serum from a thyroidectomized calf (TxBS; Rockland Farms, Gilbertsville, PA) (7Smith T.J. Murata Y. Horwitz A.L. Philpson L. Refetoff S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1066-1073Google Scholar). After three days of culture, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing either 10% TxBS alone or TxBS plus T3 (10−10-10−8M; Sigma). The cells were further incubated for the indicated periods of time. Total RNA was extracted from cells by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). To examine whether the T3-mediated increase in ZAKI-4 mRNA requires de novo protein synthesis, the medium of confluent fibroblast cultures was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% TxBS and 25 µM cycloheximide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was added 15 min before T3 (10−7M) addition. The cells were further incubated for 24 h, and total RNA was extracted. The effect of T3 on the stability of ZAKI-4 mRNA was evaluated as follows. Fibroblast cultures in confluency were treated with 10−7M T3 for 72 h. Then the cells were washed two times with 4 ml of serumless DMEM. They were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% TxBS containing actinomycin D (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml with or without 10−7M T3. After further incubation for 12, 24, and 48 h, the cells were harvested for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the two fibroblast cell lines, a) male 29 year and b) female 25 year, incubated with or without T3 for 24 h. Differential display was carried out using RNAmap Kit (GenHunter Corp., Brookline, MA). Briefly, 0.2 µg of the total RNA was reverse transcribed with T12MA (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTMA-3′, where M represents degenerate bases) and subsequently amplified by PCR using five different arbitrary primers AP-16 (5′-CGTCAGTGAC-3′), AP-17 (5′-GCAAGGAGTC-3′), AP-18 (5′-CTGAGCTAGG-3′), AP-19 (5′-GGCTAATGCC-3′), and AP-20 (5′-GTGATCGGAC-3′) according to the supplier's protocol with minor modification. In the PCR [33P]dATP (specific activity 70 TBq/mmol; DuPont NEN) was used instead of [35S]dATP as recommended by Trentmann et al. (18Trentmann S.M. van der Knaap E. Kende H. Science. 1995; 267: 1186Google Scholar). After an initial 2-min denaturation at 94°C, PCR was carried out using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 40°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. An aliquot of each PCR product (5 µl) was analyzed on a 5% DNA sequence gel, which was subsequently exposed to X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiography. The cDNA fragments of interest were recovered from the gel and subsequently reamplified with the same primer set and PCR conditions except that no isotopes were added. The reamplified cDNA fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector from Promega (Madison, WI). Total RNA samples isolated from the four fibroblast cell lines cultured in the presence or absence of T3 were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (19Miyazaki T. Sato M. Murata Y. Maeda K. Seo H. Am. J. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 48-56Google Scholar). For the analysis of tissue distribution of ZAKI-4 mRNA expression, human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), premade Northern blot of 2 µg of poly(A) RNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, was used. RACE (13Liang P. Averboukh L. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6966-6968Google Scholar), a procedure to amplify nucleic acid sequences from an mRNA template between a defined internal site and unknown sequences at either the 3′ or 5′ end of mRNA, was performed by utilizing a kit (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the supplier's protocol. To increase the fidelity of PCR, Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) was used in RACE, since Ex Taq possesses 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (3′-editing activity), resulting in the reduction of misincorporation per cycle as reported by Barnes (20Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Google Scholar). DNA sequences from both strands were determined on an ABI 373A DNA sequencer at least four times. Sequence searches of GenBank™ was carried out using BLAST program (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). The complete cDNAs coding ZAKI-4 mRNAs (1.4 and 3.4 kb) were synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into pGEM-T vector. In vitro transcription and translation were performed by using TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega) with EXPRE35S 35S protein labeling mix (DuPont NEN), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The synthesized proteins were analyzed by 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Fig. 1A illustrates the differential display of mRNAs in human skin fibroblasts cultured in the presence or absence of T3. At a glance, the patterns of bands were similar between T3-treated and nontreated fibroblasts. The patterns between the two fibroblasts from different individuals were similar when the same set of primers was used. However, a closer look identified some bands whose densities were either increased or decreased in the fibroblasts cultured with or without T3 (Fig. 1B). When the changes in the densities by T3 were reproduced in the two fibroblasts from different individuals, the bands were selected as candidates of T3-responsive genes. Nine cDNA fragments were extracted from the gel, reamplified by PCR with the same set of primers, and subcloned into pGEM-T vector. The cloned cDNA fragments were used as the probes for Northern blot analysis to confirm that the expression of the putative T3-responsive genes was indeed regulated by T3. It was demonstrated that the expression of only one gene (ZAKI-4) was up-regulated by T3. The mRNA for the rest of the genes were either undetectable or unaltered by the addition of T3 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, a significant increase was observed 24 h after the addition of 10−10M T3, a physiological concentration in the presence of 10% TxBS (7Smith T.J. Murata Y. Horwitz A.L. Philpson L. Refetoff S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1066-1073Google Scholar). The mRNA was further increased by the addition of 10−8M T3. Also shown in the figures was the existence of two species of ZAKI-4 mRNA. In addition to a dominant band of 3.4 kb, a faint band of 1.4 kb was observed. The two mRNA species were increased proportionately by T3. As illustrated in Fig. 3, ZAKI-4 mRNA levels increased 12 h after the addition of T3 (10−8M). These results were reproduced with four different human skin fibroblasts obtained from different individuals (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the increase in ZAKI-4 mRNA was completely blocked by the treatment with cycloheximide. By using actinomycin D the half-life of ZAKI-4 mRNA was studied (Fig. 5). It was demonstrated that T3 did not affect the stability (t 22 h in the absence and 20 h in the presence of T3). These results indicate that T3 induces ZAKI-4 mRNA at the transcriptional level, but de novo protein synthesis is required for the induction. The expression of ZAKI-4 mRNA was evident in the poly(A) RNAs from heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 6). However, no mRNA band was detected in the poly(A) RNAs from placenta, lung, kidney, and pancreas. Thus, ZAKI-4 mRNA is not only expressed in the fibroblasts but also in various T3-responsive organs. Note that dominant ZAKI-4 mRNA in skeletal muscle as well as in fibroblasts is 3.4 kb in size, whereas it is 1.4 kb in the other organs. The entire nucleotide sequence of ZAKI-4 cDNA is shown in Fig. 7. As illustrated at the top of the figure, the original cDNA isolated from the differential display was approximately 180 base pairs long. To isolate the full-length cDNA, RACE was employed (primer design was indicated in the figure). 5′-RACE produced a product extending 680 base pairs from the 5′-end of the original clone. On the other hand, 3′-RACE produced two products, one extending approximately 200 base pairs from the 3′-end of the original clone and the other extending 2,300 base pairs. Two products produced by 3′-RACE suggested the presence of two mRNA species with different 3′-ends. Alignment of the sequences enabled us to delineate the entire cDNA sequence. Putative polyadenylation signals could be assigned at nucleotide positions 1023ATTAAA1028 and 3168AATATA3173, giving rise to two mRNA species. The search for an open reading frame revealed that both short and long species of ZAKI-4 mRNAs code a single polypeptide. In frame termination codon 160TAA162 was followed by two initiation codons. The presence of two ATG codons for methionine at N-terminal ends suggested that ZAKI-4 mRNAs may code a protein of either 192 or 197 amino acids. Since Kozak's sequence (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar) is present 5′-upstream of the second ATG codon, translation initiation likely occurs at the second ATG, giving rise to a protein of 192 amino acids. Proline and valine residues were abundant in the molecule. From the cDNA sequence, it was also deduced that the original clone isolated from the differential display was amplified from the sequence 5′-684CGACAGTGAC693-3′ to 5′-848TCAAAAAAAA857-3′ with the corresponding primer AP-16 (5′-CGCAGTGAC-3′) and T12MA (3′-AMTTTTTTTTTTTT-5′). Thus, there is only one mismatch between 5′-end sequence of the arbitrary primer, while 3′-primer T12MA did not hybridize with the actual cDNA ends but recognized eight adenylate sequences present in the nucleotide from 848 to 857. Homology search of the ZAKI-4 sequence revealed that there are at least two related sequences. Both of them are short sequences reported as expressed sequence tag (EST). The 5′-end (277–614) of ZAKI-4 cDNA is identical to the EST (NCBI accession number T09144) from 73 days postnatal female human brain (24Adams M.D. Soares M.B. Kerlavage A.R. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 373-380Google Scholar). Another EST (NCBI accession T23571) from 3-month human infant brain is identical to the 3′-end (2939-3187). Since the present study revealed that ZAKI-4 gene is also expressed in human brain, these two ESTs are likely to be a part of ZAKI-4 cDNA. Both short and long species of mRNAs for ZAKI-4 contained an open reading frame as described above. To confirm that both mRNAs code a single peptide, each cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA obtained from the fibroblasts cultured in the presence of T3 and cloned into pGEM-T vector. The corresponding mRNAs were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As shown in Fig. 8, both mRNAs programmed the synthesis of a peptide with a molecular mass of 26 kDa, which roughly corresponds to the molecular weight estimated from the amino acid sequence. The cloning of a T3-responsive gene ZAKI-4 in human fibroblasts was described. It was demonstrated that the increase of ZAKI-4 mRNA by T3 is regulated at the transcriptional level, since the stability of the mRNA was not affected by T3. However, the T3 effect requires de novo protein synthesis, suggesting the possibility that regulation of ZAKI-4 gene expression by T3 is indirect. To date, very few T3-responsive genes have been cloned in human skin fibroblasts. Expression of fibronectin mRNA was suppressed by T3 (23Sobiezczyk S. Refetoff S. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: T-24Google Scholar). The decrease in glycosaminoglycan (7Smith T.J. Murata Y. Horwitz A.L. Philpson L. Refetoff S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 1066-1073Google Scholar, 8Murata Y. Refetoff S. Horwitz A.L. Smith T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1983; 57: 1233-1239Google Scholar) synthesis by T3 suggested that expression of some genes involved in the synthesis could be repressed by the hormone. To our knowledge, ZAKI-4 gene is the only gene that is up-regulated by T3 in human skin fibroblasts. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of two mRNA transcripts (3.4 and 1.4 kb) for ZAKI-4 gene. Since both mRNA species were proportionately increased by T3, it was suggested that both mRNAs were transcribed from the same gene. The data from 3′-RACE also suggested the presence of two mRNA species with different 3′-ends. From the sequence of the entire cDNA it is suggested that the two mRNA species originate from alternative polyadenylation, since putative polyadenylation signals could be localized at two sites with a distance of 2 kb, accounting for the size difference. No homologous protein sequence to ZAKI-4 was found in the SWISSPROT data base. It is thus impossible to speculate about the function of ZAKI-4 gene product based on the sequence data. However, ZAKI-4 mRNA is expressed not only in fibroblasts but also in brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, suggesting that thyroid hormone exerts its effect by up-regulating its expression in these organs. There was a size difference in the predominant ZAKI-4 mRNA species in different organs. In skin fibroblasts and skeletal muscles, the mRNA of 3.4 kb in size was the major species, whereas 1.4 kb mRNA was dominant in brain, heart, and liver. Specific distribution of ZAKI-4 mRNA species with differing 3′-ends raises a possibility that there is a mechanism for tissue-specific regulation of alternative polyadenylation.

https://openalex.org/W2091907275,"Abstract The small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan is involved in several physiological and pathophysiological processes through the ability of its core protein to interact with other extracellular matrix molecules and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). To learn more about the regulation of biglycan core protein expression, we have cloned and sequenced 1218 base pairs from the 5′-flanking region of the human biglycan gene, demonstrated functional promoter activity, and investigated the molecular mechanisms through which various agents modulate its transcriptional activity. Sequencing revealed the presence of several cis-acting elements including multiple AP-2 sites and interleukin-6 response elements, a NF-κB site, a TGF-β negative element, and an E-box. The TATA and CAAT box-lacking promoter possesses many features of a growth-related gene, e.g. a GC-rich immediate 5′ region, many Sp1 sites, and the use of multiple transcriptional start sites. Transient transfections of the tumor cell lines MG-63, SK-UT-1, and T47D with various biglycan 5′-flanking region-luciferase reporter gene constructs showed that the proximal 78 base pairs are sufficient for full promoter activity. Several agents among them interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. were capable of altering biglycan promoter activity. However, in MG-63 cells, TGF-β1 failed to increase either activity of the biglycan promoter constructs or specific transcription from the endogenous biglycan gene. Since TGF-β1 also did not alter the stability of cytoplasmic biglycan mRNA as determined from Northern analysis after inhibition of transcription with 5,6-dichloro-1β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, an as yet unidentified nuclear post-transcriptional mechanism was considered responsible for the TGF-β effect in this cell type. These results might help to elucidate the molecular pathways leading to pathological alterations of biglycan expression observed in atherosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1571320850,"The NF-κB transcription factor is activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In its inactive state, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm tethered to an inhibitor protein, IκB. Activation comprises the rapid phosphorylation of IκB-α at N-terminal sites, which presumably marks IκB-α for proteolytic degradation and leads to release of NF-κB into the nucleus. In addition, IκB-α is constitutively phosphorylated at the C terminus, which may be a prerequisite for proper IκB function. Protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and has been previously reported to phosphorylate IκB-α in vitro. As PKC has turned out to constitute a multigene family encoding isozymes with different biological functions, we have reinvestigated IκB-α phosphorylation by PKC using recombinant PKC isozymes expressed in insect cells. While crude PKC preparations were efficient IκB-α kinases, highly purified PKC isozymes completely failed to phosphorylate IκB-α. Biochemical separation of porcine spleen yielded at least two fractions with IκB-α kinase activity, both of which were devoid of detectable PKC isozymes. One peak contained both Raf-1 and casein kinase II (CKII). Purified Raf-1 does not phosphorylate IκB-α directly, but associates with CKII, which efficiently phosphorylates the C terminus of IκB-α. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping and high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that all IκB-α kinases induced phosphorylation at the same prominent sites in the C terminus. Our results clearly indicate that PKC isozymes α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, and ζ as well as Raf-1 are not IκB-α kinases.

NF-κB is composed of a dimer of related proteins belonging to the Rel superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 1Thanos D. Maniatis T.

The induction of NF-κB activity is an immediate-early event, when cells are exposed to inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1, phorbol esters, e.g. TPA, 1The abbreviations used are: TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePKCprotein kinase CCKIIcasein kinase IIPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMBPmyelin basic protein.

The activation of NF-κB is a unique paradigm for the regulation of a transcription factor by subcellular compartmentalization. In the inactive state, NF-κB is complexed with cytosolic proteins collectively designated as inhibitors of NF-κB, IκB, which retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm. The prototypic and best studied IκB is IκB-α. Activation induces the phosphorylation of IκB-α, ubiquitination, and its subsequent proteolytic degradation (4Traeckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T.

Science. 1994; 267: 1485-1488Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). As a consequence, NF-κB can translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes. The role of IκB-α phosphorylation is not entirely defined, but recent work suggests that IκB-α is phosphorylated on multiple sites located at the C and N termini (4Traeckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L.

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal sites is constitutive (7Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1994; 267: 1485-1488Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites does not suffice to release NF-κB, but rather seems to mark IκB-α for degradation (5Chen Z.

The central role of phosphorylation in the NF-κB activation pathway has evoked an intense interest in the identification of kinases that phosphorylate IκB-α. A prime candidate for such kinases has been PKC. Phorbol esters, which activate PKC, are efficient inducers of NF-κB, and PKC has been reported to phosphorylate IκB in vitro (9Gosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). These studies were carried out at a time, however, when PKC was characterized mainly as a biochemical entity that could be activated by phorbol esters, phospholipids, and calcium. Molecular cloning of PKC cDNAs has shown that PKC is a multigene family comprising at least 10 genes, whose protein products differ in structure and biological effects (reviewed in Ref. 10Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 159-209Crossref Google Scholar). The classical PKC isozymes α, βI, βII, and γ feature all the properties of the initial biochemical description. The novel PKCs (PKC-δ, -ε, -η, -θ, and -µ) lack the calcium-binding domain and hence are calcium-independent. The atypical PKCs (PKC-ζ and PKC-λ) do not bind and respond to phorbol ester or calcium, but instead, at least PKC-ζ may be activated by ceramide (11Lozano J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.-T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cell, ceramide is generated in response to tumor necrosis factor-α and can mediate NF-κB induction (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of individual PKC isozymes in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and 32D promyelocytes has revealed very diverse biological effects. PKC-ε and PKC-η can transform NIH cells, whereas PKC-δ inhibits proliferation (13Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schæchtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F.

Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to reinvestigate the phosphorylation of IκB-α using recombinant PKC isozymes produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. Unexpectedly, highly purified PKC isozymes failed to phosphorylate IκB-α, while crude PKC preparations were active as IκB-α kinases. The IκB-α kinase activity could be separated from PKC by further purification. In concordance with these results, we could not detect PKC isozymes in IκB-α kinase preparations from chromatographically fractionated porcine spleen extracts. These separations yielded two different peaks with IκB-α kinase activity, one of which copurified with Raf-1 and CKII, which both have previously been shown to function as IκB-α kinases (7Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified CKII as well as the other IκB-α kinase fractions phosphorylated the same sites in IκB-α located at the C terminus. PKC isozymes were purified from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses expressing the different PKCs (15Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of PKC isozymes was carried out essentially as described (16Huang K.-P. Huang F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In short, cell pellets of 3 × 109 baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were lysed in 100 ml of Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the clear supernatant was applied to a 20 × 100-mm Q-Sepharose fast flow column. The column was eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing high PKC activity (as measured by histone phosphorylation) were pooled and applied to a 10 × 100-mm hydroxylapatite column. The column was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0-400 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) containing 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM EDTA. Active fractions were pooled again, adjusted to 1 M KCl, and loaded onto a 5 × 50-mm phenyl-Superose column. The column was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 1 to 0 M NaCl, and the purity of the active fractions was assayed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing PKC as the major protein were pooled; dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol; and subsequently stored at −80°C. Raf-1 was expressed in Sf9 cells as a GST fusion protein and purified as described (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). GST-IκB-α was a kind gift from Dr. Ulli Siebenlist. GST-IκB-α was prepared as described (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST portion, and stored at −70°C. PKC activity was determined in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgAc2, 1 µM TPA, 80 µg/ml phosphatidylethanolamine, 20 µg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 10 µM ATP/[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 2 Ci/mmol). Raf-1, CKII, and IκB-α kinase assays were performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgAc2, and 10 µM ATP/[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 2 Ci/mmol). The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 10 min. Subsequently, the kinase reactions were stopped by boiling the sample in SDS-PAGE buffer. The reactions were resolved on 10% SDS gels, and the gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film. 5 g of frozen porcine spleen were homogenized in a mortar under liquid nitrogen. Purification of the IκB-α kinases was carried out following a procedure similar to that described above for PKC, using a Mono-Q or Q-Sepharose fast flow column followed by a hydroxylapatite column. 1 µg of IκB-α was phosphorylated as described above, and bands of phosphorylated IκB-α were cut out from an SDS gel and processed for two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping as described using pH 8.9 buffer for the first dimension and 1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water (15:10:3:12) for the second dimension (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Kölch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Hummel R. Marmee D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed on an ABI Model 172 micropurification system connected to a Perkin-Elmer API 100 quadrupol mass spectrometer and a Berthold radioactivity detector. IκB-α was phosphorylated and digested as described above. Tryptic peptides from 5 µg of IκB-α were loaded onto a Pharmacia Biotech reversed-phase column. A gradient of 0-35% acetonitrile in 100 min and subsequently of 35-70% in 10 min was run at 40 µl/min. Masses were determined in 0.1-atomic mass unit steps over an m/z range from 500 to 3000 with an orifice voltage of 20 V. Protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml IκB-α. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice for 10 min with 250 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% isopropyl alcohol. After equilibration for 1 h at room temperature with 250 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, the gel was denatured twice for 30 min at room temperature with 6 M guanidinium Cl in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The gel was subsequently renatured overnight at 4°C in 500 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol containing 0.04% Tween. The gel was equilibrated for 30 min at 30°C in kinase buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgCl2, and 90 µM Na3VO4) and incubated in kinase buffer containing 250 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 30°C. The gel was washed extensively four times for 4 h in 500 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Nonspecific binding to nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min, and the blots were subsequently incubated with primary antibody and, after extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline and 1% Tween 20, with secondary antibody for 1 h each. The primary antibodies used were either a monoclonal antibody against PKC-α (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or antisera against classical PKCs (201, directed against the pseudosubstrate domain of the PKCs), PKC-δ (19Mischak H. Bodenteich A. Kolch W. Goodnight J. Hofer F. Mushinski J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7925-7931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), c-Raf (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), or CKII (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Dianova. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Different PKC isozymes were produced in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system and purified by successive chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow, hydroxylapatite, and phenyl-Superose columns. Column fractions were monitored for PKC activity employing histone as substrate. Active fractions were pooled and further purified. The presence of PKC was confirmed by Western blotting with appropriate PKC isozyme-specific antibodies. In parallel, the purity was assessed by staining duplicate gels with Coomassie Blue. A routine purification of PKC-α is shown in Fig. 1. PKC-α preparations of <10% purity (Fig. 1A) efficiently phosphorylated recombinant IκB-α purified from Escherichia coli (Fig. 1B). The IκB-α kinase activity, however, could be separated from PKC-α by further purification, suggesting that it copurified with kinases that were distinct from PKC-α. Additional evidence was obtained with the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X, which did not affect the IκB-α kinase activity, but reduced the histone kinase activity by >95% (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with PKC-βII, -γ, -δ, -ε, -η, and -ζ. The IκB-α kinase activity of these PKC preparations could be removed by enrichment of PKC above 50% (by phenyl-Superose chromatography, step 3 in the purification protocol). A representative assay is shown in Fig. 2. Purified preparations of PKC-α, -δ, and -ζ efficiently phosphorylated histone or myelin basic protein (MBP), but completely failed to phosphorylate 38-kDa IκB-α. To exclude the possibility that the IκB-α preparations contained an unspecific PKC inhibitor, a mixture of histone, MBP, and IκB-α was used as substrate. IκB-α was not phosphorylated and did not reduce the phosphorylation of histone or MBP by PKC. To corroborate these findings, we attempted to purify IκB-α kinases from porcine spleen. Spleen lysates were separated by chromatography on a HiLoad-Q-Sepharose column (Fig. 3A). Individual fractions were assayed for kinase activity using IκB-α as substrate. Two peaks of IκB-α kinase activity were recovered, pooled, and further fractionated on a hydroxylapatite column (Fig. 3B). Their elution profiles differed from those of PKC-α, -β, and -γ, which were determined in parallel experiments. The peaks containing IκB-α kinases were examined for the presence of PKC by kinase assays using histone as substrate and by Western blotting with anti-PKC antibodies (data not shown). Both methods failed to detect appreciable amounts of PKC in the IκB-α kinase fractions, confirming the results obtained in the course of purification of PKC isozymes expressed in insect cells. As Raf-1 and CKII have been reported to phosphorylate IκB-α, the Western blots were also tested for the presence of these two kinases. As shown in Fig. 4, pool II contained readily detectable amounts of Raf-1 and CKII. While Raf-1 was also present in fractions that were devoid of appreciable IκB-α kinase activity, CKII was present only in the fractions of the second peak containing IκB-α kinase activity. To assess the question of which of these two enzymes does in fact phosphorylate IκB-α, we used purified CKII (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and purified Raf-1 (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, both enzyme preparations contained IκB-α kinase activity. The addition of heparin, a CKII inhibitor (20Hathaway G.M. Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8038-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely abolished the IκB-α kinase activity of both the Raf-1 and CKII preparations. As shown in Fig. 5, the Raf-1 kinase activity against Mek was not inhibited at all with heparin, while CKII activity using casein as substrate was abolished in the presence of heparin. Furthermore, the Raf-1 preparations, although pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Ref. 17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar and data not shown), did contain detectable amounts of CKII, as can be seen in the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 5. These results suggest that CKII associates with Raf-1 under the conditions used and that the associating CKII, but not Raf-1, phosphorylates IκB-α. To eliminate association of CKII with Raf-1, the immobilized GST-Raf fusion protein was washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). As shown in Fig. 6, these additional washes resulted in the essentially complete absence of both CKII as well as IκB-α kinase activity, while the Raf-1 kinase activity (using Mek as substrate) was unchanged. To further substantiate the finding that the CKII associating with Raf-1, and not Raf-1 itself, phosphorylates IκB-α, we assayed the Mek and IκB-α kinase activity of both wild-type and kinase-negative Raf-1. Both wild-type and kinase-negative preparations of Raf-1 contained roughly equal amounts of IκB-α kinase activity, while the Mek kinase activity was present only in the wild-type Raf-1 preparation, but was completely absent in the kinase-negative mutant (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Kinase activity of wild-type Raf-1 or a kinase-negative mutant (S621D) using Mek and IκB-α as substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As several protein kinases can at least be partially renatured after SDS electrophoresis and their presence detected in in-gel kinase assays, we attempted to visualize IκB-α kinase activity in in-gel kinase assays using SDS gels that were polymerized in the presence or absence of recombinant IκB-α. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 8. While the presence of CKII was readily detectable using this approach in fractions of pool II of our IκB-α kinase preparations as well as in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates, no activity could be detected in pool I. These experiments further supported that CKII efficiently phosphorylates IκB-α, but unfortunately, they failed to help identify the IκB-α kinase present in pool I. These results demonstrate that IκB-α serves as substrate for at least two different kinases. Therefore, the pattern of phosphorylation sites induced by these kinases was compared by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 9). IκB-α was phosphorylated by crude PKC-α preparations, purified Raf-1, CKII, or the IκB-α kinases purified from spleen; isolated by SDS-PAGE; and digested with proteases. Phosphopeptides were resolved on thin-layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in the second dimension and autoradiographed. The standard digestion protocol with trypsin proved unsatisfactory, resulting in smeary maps (data not shown), probably due to the large size of the tryptic phosphopeptide. Therefore, a combination of trypsin and Asp-N endoproteases was used for subsequent experiments, which allowed the resolution of two major phosphopeptides. All IκB-α kinases (Fig. 9) yielded identical phosphopeptide maps, indicating that a common set of phosphorylation sites is targeted by different kinases. To identify the phosphorylation sites in IκB-α, we performed HPLC-mass spectroscopy analysis of the tryptic digests. Digestion with trypsin yielded one radioactive peak that eluted at ~35% acetonitrile (Fig. 10) and comigrated with a peptide with a mass of 5917 Da. This corresponds to the mass of the C-terminal tryptic peptide IQQQ … (amino acids 265-314, 5906 Da). Digestion with trypsin and Asp-N yielded two radioactive peaks (Fig. 10). The major mass detected in the first peak was 2935 Da, with a second peak at 3015 Da, which was absent in the unphosphorylated preparation. This corresponds exactly to the peptide IQQQLGQLTLENLQMLPESEDEESY (amino acids 265-289) and its singly phosphorylated form, respectively. The masses found in the second peak, however (2015 and 2175 Da, the latter only present in phosphorylated IκB-α), could not be correlated with any of the predicted masses from the IκB-α sequence. Since both peptides resulting from the additional Asp-N digest must be derived from the only radiolabeled peak in the trypsin digest, they must lie within the large tryptic peptide at amino acids 265-314. To investigate this assumption, we generated a GST-IκB-α mutant protein with a stop codon at amino acid 236. This protein in fact was not phosphorylated by any of the IκB-α kinases tested here (data not shown). Hence, the phosphorylation sites of all IκB-α kinases described here must lie within amino acids 242-307, and no phosphorylation of Ser-32 or Ser-36 could be detected. To prove the identity of the phosphorylated peptide (amino acids 265-288), we synthesized the identical peptide. This synthetic peptide was readily phosphorylated by CKII and comigrated exactly with the first peptide resulting from the trypsin and Asp-N digest of IκB-α (Fig. 11). PKC isozymes expressed in insect cells were purified and assayed as IκB-α kinases. Enriched PKC preparations (~10% pure) efficiently phosphorylated IκB-α, whereas highly purified PKCs, including PKC-ζ, failed. This result was not due to a loss of PKC activity or to the presence of a PKC inhibitor in the IκB-α preparations used. Furthermore, in crude preparations of PKC that still contained IκB-α kinase activity, we could inhibit the histone and MBP kinase activity with a highly specific PKC inhibitor, while the activity of the IκB-α kinase remained unchanged. In a complementary experiment, we partially purified IκB-α kinases from porcine spleen. Fractions active as IκB-α kinases were devoid of PKC, further proving that PKC is not an IκB-α kinase. The latter experiments demonstrated that at least two IκB-α kinase activities could be separated. One of the IκB-α kinase peaks contained both Raf-1 and CKII; the latter was in fact identified as IκB-α kinase. A Raf-1 mutant, BXB, rendered constitutively activated by deletion of the regulatory domain, has been shown to phosphorylate IκB-α in vitro and to activate NF-κB transcription in cells (17Häfner S. Adler H. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Üffing M. Kölch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 21Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9247-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). While the in vitro phosphorylation of IκB-α is certainly due to the presence of contaminating CKII, it still remains unclear how Raf-1 can initiate the down-regulation of IκB and hence NF-kB activation if it does not phosphorylate IκB. From our studies, it is clear that IκB-α can be targeted by at least two distinct kinases. This finding is not unexpected, given the pleiotropic modes of NF-κB induction. These different signaling pathways seem to converge on the level of IκB-α phosphorylation, as distinct kinases phosphorylate the same set of sites resolved on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of trypsin/Asp-N-digested IκB-α. Unfortunately, the kinase activity present in pool I could not be renatured after SDS electrophoresis under various different conditions. Hence, we are unable to even speculate on the nature of this second IκB-α kinase. We could not detect any phosphorylation of IκB-α serines 32 and 36, which have been indirectly implicated as IκB-α phosphorylation sites (4Traeckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 14: 2876-2883Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 6Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1994; 267: 1485-1488Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Since kinases that phosphorylate these sites might only be active in, for example, TPA-stimulated cells, we also purified IκB-α kinases from TPA-stimulated WEHI 3Z cells (data not shown). We again only obtained the two pools of IκB-α kinases that were described above, but no activity that phosphorylated IκB-α on other sites, including serines 32 and 36, could be detected. Although IκB-α point mutants at serines 32 and 36 have been reported to be resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-induced degradation, direct phosphorylation of these sites has not yet been shown. Recently, two laboratories reported that IκB-α is constitutively phosphorylated by CKII (6Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1994; 267: 1485-1488Crossref Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 8McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with our data. The phosphorylation sites described for CKII match the sites we identified here. Although McElhinny et al. (8McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show phosphorylation of IκB-α by PKC, they also state that the efficiency is ~1000-fold less than with CKII, suggesting that the phosphorylation actually results from impurities in the PKC preparation. The authors were, as we were, unable to detect phosphorylation of IκB-α at the N terminus, including serines 32 and 36. It is tempting to speculate that the phosphorylation of IκB-α at the C terminus is required for an additional phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36. Since the IκB-α protein used to detect IκB-α kinases was unphosphorylated, the “inducible” phosphorylation at the N terminus would not be detected. In conclusion, our data indicate that PKC isozymes and Raf-1 are not IκB-α kinases; however, Raf-1 associates with an IκB-α kinase, CKII. We thank A. Kieser for thoughtfully and critically reading the manuscript and Dr. Ulli Siebenlist for the GST-IκB-α plasmid."

To explore the role of HKII in muscle glucose metabolism, two lines of transgenic mice were generated where overexpression was restricted to striated muscle; HKII protein levels and activity were increased by 3–8-fold. Oral glucose tolerance, intravenous insulin tolerance, and insulin and lactate levels were unaffected in transgenic mice. There was a trend toward increased levels of muscle glycogen; however, glucose-6-phosphate levels were increased by 43% in transgenic skeletal muscle following in vivo glucose and insulin administration. Using 2-[3H]deoxyglucose as a tracer, in vitro basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were determined in extensor digitorum longus, soleus, and epitrochlearis muscles. Maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was increased by 17% (extensor digitorum longus), 34% (soleus), and 90% (epitrochlearis) in transgenic muscles; basal and submaximal glucose uptake was also modestly increased in soleus and epitrochlearis. These data suggest that increased muscle HKII (corresponding to the upper end of the physiologic range) may not be sufficient to augment net in vivo glucose homeostasis. However, glucose phosphorylation can represent a rate-limiting step for skeletal muscle glucose utilization since muscle glucose-6-phosphate levels are increased during in vivo hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia; furthermore, basal and insulin-mediated muscle glucose uptake can be increased by a selective increase in HKII expression.

Of the three “low Km” mammalian hexokinases (types I, II, and III), hexokinase II (HKII) is the predominant isozyme expressed in insulin-responsive tissues (1Katzen H.M. Adv.

Both HKII and the “insulin-responsive” glucose transporter GLUT4 have been suggested to be functionally paired since their levels of gene expression are coordinately regulated under a variety of physiological circumstances. During development in the rat, the appearance of both GLUT4 and HKII in skeletal muscle coincides with the acquisition of insulin sensitivity around the time of weaning (4Postic C. Leturque A. Printz R. Maulard P. Loizeau M. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E548-E559PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes the expression of both genes is coordinately activated by insulin and repressed by hypoinsulinemia (2Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K.

Both GLUT4 and HKII expression are also down-regulated in adipose tissue derived from insulin-resistant rodents (7Braithwaite S.S. Palazuk B. Colca J.R. Edwards C.W.I. Hofmann C. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 43-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, the levels of GLUT4 and HKII vary in parallel according to fiber type, and both genes are dramatically induced by chronic electrical stimulation (8Kong X. Manchester J. Salmons S. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12963-12967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only a single bout of acute exercise is necessary to stimulate an increase in HKII (9O'Doherty R.M. Bracy D.P. Osawa H. Wasserman D.H. Granner D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E171-E178PubMed Google Scholar) or GLUT4 (10Ren J. Semenkovich C.F. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol.

Hofmann C. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 43-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose transport, rather than phosphorylation, is commonly viewed as the rate-limiting step for insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in muscle (12Ziel F. Venkatesan N. Davidson M.B. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 885-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a primary increase in muscle glucose transporter expression (GLUT1 in transgenic mice) resulted in increased glucose utilization and glycogen storage (13Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several previous studies suggest that glucose phosphorylation may be rate-limiting under certain physiologic conditions. Insulin stimulation of rat cardiac muscle (14Cheung J.Y. Conover C. Regen D.M. Whitfield C.F. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 234: E70-E78PubMed Google Scholar) or isolated rat myocytes (15Manchester J. Kong X. Nerbonne J. Lowry O.H. Lawrence J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E326-E333PubMed Google Scholar) results in the accumulation of intracellular free glucose, indicating that glucose phosphorylation is saturated in this setting. Accumulation of intracellular free glucose was also observed in skeletal muscle from transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT1, showing that hexokinase is saturated with the markedly increased glucose flux into this tissue (13Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetic analyses of glucose uptake by the perfused rat hindlimb (16Kubo K. Foley J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: E100-E102PubMed Google Scholar), human forearm, or in vivo glucose disposal in man (17Yki-Jarvinen H. Young A.A. Lamkin C. Foley J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) suggest a shift in the rate-limiting step from glucose transport to some step beyond transport under conditions of hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia. Finally, substantial increases in glucose transport, which occur in the context of muscle contraction, may result in glucose utilization becoming limited by phosphorylation since intracellular glucose levels are also increased by exercise (18Katz A. Sahlin K. Broberg S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: E411-E415PubMed Google Scholar) and electrical stimulation (19Hintz C.S. Chi M.-Y. Fell R.D. Ivy J.L. Kaiser K.K. Lowry C.V. Lowry O.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 242: C218-C228Crossref Google Scholar). Part of the limitation in glucose flux which is imposed by HKII during situations associated with increased glucose transport is likely to be due to feedback inhibition of the enzyme by its product, G6P (20Lueck J.D. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1341-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Defects in insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose disposal represent an important component of the pathophysiology of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Importantly, recent evidence points to a proximal defect involving glucose transport and/or its initial phosphorylation by hexokinase (21Alzaid A. Rizza R.A. Moller D.E. Insulin Resistance. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, New York1993: 143Google Scholar, 22Rothman D.L. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin.

A recently developed triple tracer forearm perfusion technique has allowed for the measurement of glucose phosphorylation rates in humans; in preliminary studies using this method, Pendergrass et al. (24Pendergrass M. Gulli G. Saccomani M.P. Cobelli C. DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 72AGoogle Scholar, 25Pendergrass M. Fazioni E. Saccomani M.P. Collins D. Bonadonna R. Gulli G. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 197AGoogle Scholar) suggest that an independent defect in muscle glucose phosphorylation exists in the muscle of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects or their offspring. Given the potential importance of muscle HKII for human disease, its prominent regulation by physiologic perturbations, and controversy surrounding the question of whether phosphorylation may be rate-limiting for muscle glucose utilization, we created a new transgenic mouse model characterized by muscle-specific overexpression of human HKII. These transgenic mice were characterized by assessment of their in vivo phenotype and by determination of in vitro glucose uptake using isolated incubated muscles. A muscle-specific human HKII transgenic vector consisting of promoter-enhancer elements from the rat muscle creatinine kinase gene (provided by Steve Hauschka, University of Washington, and Jeff Chamberlain, University of Michigan) coupled to the human HKII cDNA and an 850-base pair cassette (SVPA) containing the polyadenylation and splice site sequences of SV40 (provided by Nadia Rosenthal, Boston University Medical Center) was generated (see Fig. 1). In brief, an EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the full-length human HKII cDNA (3Printz R.L. Ardehali H. Koch S. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was ligated into the pGEM7 vector resulting in pGEM7/HKII. The 850-base pair HindIII-BamHI SVPA cassette (26Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into pGEM11 to create pGEM11/SVPA. An 850-base pair HindIII-SacI fragment of pGEM11/SVPA (containing the SVPA fragment) was then subcloned into pGEM/HKII to generate pGEM7/HKII/SVPA. A 6.5-kb KpnI-AatII fragment of the muscle creatinine kinase gene, which contains 3.3 kb of 5′-flanking sequences, exon 1 (non-coding), and the first intron into exon 2, was used. The KpnI-AatII muscle creatinine kinase fragment was subcloned into pGEM7/HKII/SVPA to create a plasmid containing muscle creatinine kinase promoter, HKII, and SVPA. The transgene containing-fragment was then excised from the parent plasmid using AatII and MluI. Linearized transgene DNA was microinjected into male pronuclei of FVB/NJ mice and transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant recipient CD-1 mice as described previously (26Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis of founder mice or for offspring screening, BamHI-digested genomic DNA derived from tail biopsies was used (27Benecke H. Flier J.S. Rosenthal N. Siddle K. Klein H.H. Moller D.E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transgene integration was detected using a [32P]dCTP-labeled fragment of HKII cDNA (3Printz R.L. Ardehali H. Koch S. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conditions for hybridization, washing, and autoradiography have been previously described (26Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Benecke H. Flier J.S. Rosenthal N. Siddle K. Klein H.H. Moller D.E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were mated with nontransgenic FVB/NJ mice to establish hemizygous lines. Samples of frozen muscles were homogenized in a buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM glucose, 0.5% Triton X-100) and briefly centrifuged. The supernatants were used for Western blot analysis and measurement of hexokinase II enzyme activity. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). For Western blotting, samples of cleared lysate containing 50 µg of solubilized protein were separated by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-HKII antibody (αHKII), a protein A-purified polyclonal antiserum produced using a synthesized peptide (GAALITAVACRIREAGQR) corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of rat HKII (2Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Levels of HKII protein expression were quantitated using a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Samples of muscle lysate were prepared as described above. Hexokinase activity was measured by determination of [U-14C]glucose phosphorylation to G6P as follows. For total HK activity, 5 µl of lysate containing 20 µg of solubilized protein was added to 45 µl of assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM glucose with 0.01 µCi D-[U-14C]glucose (Amersham). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 µl of isopropanol. A 60-µl aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied to a column containing 0.5 ml of DEAE-Sephadex (Pharmacia) in the acetate form, followed by extensive washing with distilled water. Phosphorylated glucose was then eluted from the column with 2 ml of 1 N HCl into plastic vials, and scintillation fluid was added for counting. For determination of HKI activity, lysates were first incubated at 45°C for 45 min. Under these conditions, >90% of HKII activity is lost (28Walters E. McLean P. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 778-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HKII activity was subsequently calculated by subtracting HKI from total HK activity and expressed as nmol of G6P produced/mg of protein/min. Glucose phosphorylation was linear during the assay, and the concentration of G6P at the termination of the assay was less than 0.1 mM. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were measured with mice that were fasted overnight or fed ad libitum. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin standards (Linco, St. Louis, MO). Blood glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method as reported previously (27Benecke H. Flier J.S. Rosenthal N. Siddle K. Klein H.H. Moller D.E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasma lactate levels were measured using lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma, procedure 826-UV). For glucose tolerance testing, mice were fasted overnight, anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg body weight), and placed on a warm surface. After 30 min, basal blood samples were collected, and glucose (2 mg/g) was administered by oral gavage. Blood samples were withdrawn at the indicated time points, and plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured as described above. For insulin tolerance tests, fasted mice were anesthetized as described above. 30 min later, basal blood samples were collected via the retro-orbital sinus, and insulin (0.4 milliunits/g) was injected via tail vein. Additional blood samples were obtained at several time points (0′, 5′, 10′, 20′, 40′). The levels of blood glucose were determined as described above. Muscle glycogen content was measured as we have previously described (26Chang P.-Y. Benecke H. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Lawitts J. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16034-16040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of muscle G6P levels, overnight-fasted mice were anesthetized as described above, followed by administration of a mixture containing insulin (0.4 milliunits/g) and glucose (2 mg/g) via tail vein (29Goodman M.N. Berger M. Ruderman N.B. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After 20 min, the gastrocnemius and heart muscles were freeze-clamped in situ, immediately excised, and stored in liquid nitrogen (30Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Frozen muscle samples were weighed, pulverized, and homogenized in 10% perchloric acid (31Cartee G.D. Young D.A. Sleeper M.D. Zierath J. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E494-E499PubMed Google Scholar), followed by brief centrifugation to remove insoluble matter. The supernatants were neutralized with 2 N KOH containing 0.4 M triethanolamine and 0.4 M KCl and centrifuged at 4°C. The neutralized supernatants were then used to determine G6P levels by the G6P dehydrogenase/NADP+ method (32Lang G. Michal G. Lowry O.H. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 1238Google Scholar). Sample protein concentrations were determined as described above. Gluteal muscle samples were obtained from overnight-fasted mice and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant (S2) and pellet (P2) were subjected to measurement of HKII activity as described above. Marker enzymes were measured to confirm that the P2 fraction was enriched in mitochondrial proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase) and that the S2 fraction was enriched in cytosolic proteins (glycogen synthase). Glycogen synthase activity was measured according to the method of Thomas et al. (33Thomas J. Schlender K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The pyruvate dehydrogenase assay was conducted as described previously by Mandarino et al. (34Mandarino L.J. Madar Z. Kolterman O.G. Bell J.M. Olefsky J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: E489-E496PubMed Google Scholar). Soleus, EDL, and epitrochlearis muscles were excised from mice that had been briefly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Isolated muscles were preincubated for 20 min in 2 ml of incubation medium (Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KBH) containing 5 mM HEPES, 8 mM glucose, 2 mM sodium acetate, and 0.1% dialyzed bovine serum albumin (fraction V)). The muscles were then transferred to incubation medium containing 8 mM glucose, 2 µCi/ml 2-[3H]deoxyglucose, and 0.3 µCi of [14C]mannitol with 0, 0.08, or 10 milliunits/ml insulin followed by incubation for 30 min at 30°C while shaking and continually being gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After incubation, the muscles were rapidly blotted and freeze-clamped. Muscles were then weighed and subsequently dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 M KOH at 70°C for 20 min. The tissue extracts were then neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1 M HCl, and duplicate samples (0.3 ml) were transferred to vials containing 7.0 ml of BioSafe II (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) followed by scintillation counting. The accumulation of intracellular 2-[3H]deoxyglucose, which is indicative of muscle glucose uptake, was calculated by subtracting the concentration of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose in the extracellular space from the total muscle 2-[3H]deoxyglucose concentration. Extracellular 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was quantified by measuring the concentration of [14C]mannitol in the muscle sample. A transgenic vector containing the muscle-specific promoter-enhancer region of the rat muscle creatinine kinase gene (35Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) coupled to a human HKII cDNA was prepared and used for microinjection into fertilized FVB/NJ mouse zygotes (Fig. 1). A total of 169 mice were screened by Southern analysis, and five transgenic founders were identified. To assess the level of HKII expression in muscle, gluteal muscle biopsies from transgenic founder and control mice were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a specific HKII antibody. Gluteal muscles from three founder mice demonstrated HKII levels that were severalfold higher than control mice (see Fig. 2). Two of these three founders were propagated by backcrossing with nontransgenic FVB/NJ mice to generate independent lines (line 1, line 2) of hemizygous transgenic mice for further study. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were conducted using similar numbers of transgenic mice from both lines in comparison with corresponding age- and sex-matched littermate control mice. Fig. 3 shows that HKII was substantially overexpressed (3–9-fold) in several different muscles derived from transgenic mice as determined by parallel increases in both HKII protein content and HKII enzyme activity. Levels of muscle HKI were consistently <10% of total HK activity (in normal mice) and did not differ between transgenic and control mice. In addition, we performed other experiments to verify that human HKII overexpression was restricted to striated muscle. Thus, HKII overexpression was not detected in other tissues including liver, intestine, fat, and brain (data not shown). Importantly, the degree of muscle-specific HKII overexpression that we achieved in transgenic mice is similar to the increase in muscle HKII levels and activity that we have observed during in vivo hyperinsulinemia (5Postic C. Leturque A. Rencurel F. Printz R.L. Forest C. Granner D.K. Girard J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 922-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mandarino L. Printz R. Cusi K. O'Doherty R. Osawa H. Sewell C. Granner D. DeFronzo R. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 75ACrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or following exercise (9O'Doherty R.M. Bracy D.P. Osawa H. Wasserman D.H. Granner D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E171-E178PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HKII transgenic mice represent a model characterized by increased muscle HKII, which corresponds to the upper end of the physiologic range of expression for this enzyme. A substantial portion of skeletal muscle HKII is known to be bound to mitochondria (36Katzen H.M. Soderman D.D. Wiley C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4081-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Viitanen P.V. Geiger P.J. Erickson-Viitanen S. Bessman S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9679-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of muscle HKII compartmentation are incompletely understood, we found that the relative abundance of HKII in mitochondrial (60%) and cytosolic (40%) skeletal muscle (gluteal) fractions was similar in transgenic versus nontransgenic mice. Thus, the subcellular distribution of overexpressed human HKII was similar to that of the endogenous enzyme. The potential impact of increased muscle HKII on in vivo glucose homeostasis was assessed by performing oral glucose tolerance tests and intravenous insulin tolerance tests. As shown in Fig. 4A, transgenic mice were identical to their controls with respect to fasting blood glucose and the excursion in glucose values following oral administration. In addition, the increase in plasma insulin values following the oral glucose challenge did not differ between transgenic and control mice (Fig. 4B). In both transgenic and control mice, intravenous administration of 0.4 milliunits/g insulin resulted in a similar decrement (50%) in glucose levels (not shown). Analysis of a larger number of mice revealed that both fasting and fed glucose levels were normal in transgenic mice, although there was a slight but nonsignificant trend toward decreased fasted plasma insulin values and increased plasma lactate (Table I). Taken together, these results suggested that increases in the expression of muscle HKII alone (within the broad physiologic range) are not sufficient to significantly augment net in vivo glucose utilization or insulin responsiveness in otherwise normal mice. Further studies will be required to determine whether HKII overexpression might ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetes or result in improved exercise tolerance.Table IPhysiologic parametersTransgenicControlFasted glucose (mM)6.49 ± 0.66.48 ± 0.4Fed glucose (mM)7.39 ± 0.37.27 ± 0.3Fasted insulin (ng/ml)0.71 ± 0.461.05 ± 0.25Fed insulin (ng/ml)1.22 ± 0.31.25 ± 0.4Fasted lactate (mM)11.3 ± 1.010.3 ± 1.1Fed lactate (mM)30.7 ± 2.527.1 ± 2.1 Open table in a new tab Although the in vivo phenotype of HKII overexpressing mice was apparently normal, we sought to determine whether potential changes in muscle glucose uptake or metabolism could be detected. Since increased glucose flux might be expected to result in increased glycogen stores, skeletal muscle glycogen content in gluteal and gastrocnemius muscles was determined using fed transgenic mice and littermate controls. In gluteal muscle, mean glycogen levels in transgenic mice were 15.2 ± 2.2 versus 13.3 ± 1.6 µg/mg protein in controls (n = 21 mice each, not significant). There was also a nonsignificant trend toward increased glycogen in gastrocnemius muscles from transgenic mice versus controls (15.4 ± 2.3 versus 13.5 ± 1.8 µg/mg protein, n = 22 mice each). In contrast, Ren et al. (13Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that muscle glycogen content was markedly increased in transgenic mice that overexpress GLUT1 and have a 6–7-fold increase in basal muscle glucose uptake (13Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since G6P is the direct product of glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase, we next determined whether HKII overexpression in muscle would result in increased muscle G6P levels. Given that muscle glycogen levels were not significantly increased in transgenic mice, we attempted to accentuate potential differences by using conditions that were designed to result in elevated muscle glucose flux, which reportedly also increase muscle G6P by 60–70% (29Goodman M.N. Berger M. Ruderman N.B. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, after in vivo administration of glucose and insulin, mean G6P levels in gastrocnemius muscles from transgenic mice were 44% higher than their littermate controls. There was also a trend toward increased G6P levels in transgenic cardiac muscle (Fig. 5). The presence of higher skeletal muscle G6P concentrations in transgenic mice indicates that human HKII was functionally active in vivo. Under these experimental conditions, we also noted that the blood glucose nadir (45 min after infusion of glucose plus insulin) was lower in transgenic (2.59 ± 0.1 mM, n = 5) than in control mice (3.92 ± 0.7, n = 4, p = 0.05). In addition, recent experiments showed that in vivo 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in transgenic gastrocnemius and gluteal muscles was increased relative to control during mild (230 mg/dl) hyperglycemic clamp conditions. 2A.-M. Lombardi, J. Girard, and A. Leturque, unpublished data. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, at least under conditions of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia (even within the physiologic range), glucose phosphorylation is rate-limiting for muscle glucose uptake. Our results also suggest that the increase in muscle HKII expression, which follows exercise training and muscle contraction (8Kong X. Manchester J. Salmons S. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12963-12967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9O'Doherty R.M. Bracy D.P. Osawa H. Wasserman D.H. Granner D.K. Am. J.

DeFronzo R. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 75ACrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has an important physiologic role in helping to compensate for the increased glucose transport that occurs in these settings. To further explore the potential effects of increased muscle HKII activity, we measured basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake using 2-[3H]deoxyglucose as a tracer in three different muscles that were isolated from transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates and incubated in vitro. Results obtained with EDL, soleus, and epitrochlearis muscles from nontransgenic mice (Fig. 6) showed that the absolute rates and relative stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin were similar to data reported by others using the same mouse muscles (39Gulve E.A. Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Hansen P.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18366-18370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with a maximally effective insulin concentration (10 milliunits/ml) was associated with increased rates of glucose uptake in transgenic muscles that were 17% (EDL), 34% (soleus), and 90% (epitrochlearis) higher than control values. Using a submaximal insulin concentration (80 microunits/ml), we found that glucose uptake by transgenic soleus and epitrochlearis muscles was higher than in control muscles. Surprisingly, basal rates of glucose uptake were also increased in these muscles obtained from transgenic mice. Glucose transport is generally considered to be rate-limiting for muscle glucose uptake, particularly under basal conditions or with submaximal insulin stimulation. The primary evidence that supports this contention is that levels of intracellular free glucose are thought to be very low (12Ziel F. Venkatesan N. Davidson M.B. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 885-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Katz A. Nyomba B.L. Bogardus C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E942-E945PubMed Google Scholar). However, direct measurement of intracellular glucose has not been possible (previous data represent calculated values). Furthermore, Saccomani et al. (41Saccomani M.P. Bonadonna R.C. Bier D.M. DeFronzo R.A. Cobelli C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) performed forearm perfusion experiments in humans using a triple tracer technique and reported that only a fraction (30%) of the intracellular water space was accessible to glucose. Importantly, these investigators calculated an intracellular free glucose concentration of 1.2 mM within this space and estimated that the outside/inside glucose gradient across the plasma membrane was only 2.9 in the postabsorptive state. Thus, it is plausible that increased muscle hexokinase activity could result in an altered transmembrane glucose gradient, thereby causing increased facilitated glucose entry. An additional potential explanation for the increased rates of glucose uptake we observed is that a secondary increase in glucose transport might exist in transgenic muscles. In a preliminary experiment, we found that net GLUT4 levels (by immunoblotting) were not elevated in skeletal muscle from HKII transgenic mice. 3P.-Y. Chang, J. Jensen, R. L. Printz, D. K. Granner, J. L. Ivy, and D. E. Moller, unpublished results However, the observation that acute hyperglycemia can directly promote muscle GLUT4 translocation (42Galante P. Mosthaf L. Kellerer M. Berti L. Tippmer S. Bossenmaier B. Fujiwara T. Okuno A. Horikoshi H. Haring H.U. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 646-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) raises the possibility that slight changes in intracellular glucose metabolite concentrations could affect glucose transporter translocation or intrinsic activity. Finally, it is possible that removal of the muscles for incubation, particularly in the case of the soleus and epitrochlearis, may have caused partial activation of the glucose transport system (via a contraction-stimulated mechanism) with a shift toward glucose phosphorylation as the rate-limiting step. A comparison of data derived from hindlimb perfusion studies versus isolated muscle incubations supports this hypothesis. Thus, rates of muscle glucose uptake measured during hindlimb perfusion in mice are generally lower than when the same muscles are studied by in vitro incubation (43Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2125435786,"9-O-Acetylation of sialic acids shows cell type-specific and developmentally regulated expression in various systems. In a given cell type, O-acetylation can also be specific to a particular type of glycoconjugate. It is assumed that this regulation is achieved by control of expression of specific 9-O-acetyltransferases. However, it has been difficult to test this hypothesis, as these enzymes have so far proven intractable to purification or molecular cloning. During a cloning attempt, we discovered that while polyoma T antigen-positive Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-Tag cells) do not normally express cell-surface 9-O-acetylation, they do so when transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the lactosamine-specific α2-6-sialyltransferase (Galβ1-4GlcNAc:α2-6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I); formerly ST6N). This phenomenon is reproducible by stable expression of ST6Gal I in parental CHO cells, but not upon transfection of the competing lactosamine-specific α2-3-sialyltransferase (Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc:α2-3-sialyltransferase; (ST6Gal III) formerly ST3N) into either cell type. Further analyses of stably transfected parental CHO-K1 cells indicated that expression of the ST6Gal I gene causes selective 9-O-acetylation of α2-6-linked sialic acid residues on N-linked oligosaccharides. In a similar manner, while the α2-3-linked sialic acid residue of the endogenous GM3 ganglioside of CHO cells is not O-acetylated, transfection of an α2-8-sialyltransferase (GM3:α2-8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia I); formerly GD3 synthase) caused expression of 9-O-acetylation of the α2-8-linked sialic acid residues of newly synthesized GD3. These data indicate either that linkage-specific sialic acid O-acetyltransferase(s) are constitutively expressed in CHO cells or that expression of these enzymes is secondarily induced upon expression of certain sialyltransferases. The former explanation is supported by a low level of background 9-O-acetylation found in parental CHO-K1 cells and by the finding that O-acetylation is not induced when the ST6Gal I or ST8Sia I cDNAs are overexpressed in SV40 T antigen-expressing primate (COS) cells. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of sialic acid 9-O-acetylation can be regulated by the action of specific sialyltransferases that alter the predominant linkage of the terminal sialic acids found on specific classes of glycoconjugates. 9-O-Acetylation of sialic acids shows cell type-specific and developmentally regulated expression in various systems. In a given cell type, O-acetylation can also be specific to a particular type of glycoconjugate. It is assumed that this regulation is achieved by control of expression of specific 9-O-acetyltransferases. However, it has been difficult to test this hypothesis, as these enzymes have so far proven intractable to purification or molecular cloning. During a cloning attempt, we discovered that while polyoma T antigen-positive Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-Tag cells) do not normally express cell-surface 9-O-acetylation, they do so when transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the lactosamine-specific α2-6-sialyltransferase (Galβ1-4GlcNAc:α2-6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I); formerly ST6N). This phenomenon is reproducible by stable expression of ST6Gal I in parental CHO cells, but not upon transfection of the competing lactosamine-specific α2-3-sialyltransferase (Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc:α2-3-sialyltransferase; (ST6Gal III) formerly ST3N) into either cell type. Further analyses of stably transfected parental CHO-K1 cells indicated that expression of the ST6Gal I gene causes selective 9-O-acetylation of α2-6-linked sialic acid residues on N-linked oligosaccharides. In a similar manner, while the α2-3-linked sialic acid residue of the endogenous GM3 ganglioside of CHO cells is not O-acetylated, transfection of an α2-8-sialyltransferase (GM3:α2-8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia I); formerly GD3 synthase) caused expression of 9-O-acetylation of the α2-8-linked sialic acid residues of newly synthesized GD3. These data indicate either that linkage-specific sialic acid O-acetyltransferase(s) are constitutively expressed in CHO cells or that expression of these enzymes is secondarily induced upon expression of certain sialyltransferases. The former explanation is supported by a low level of background 9-O-acetylation found in parental CHO-K1 cells and by the finding that O-acetylation is not induced when the ST6Gal I or ST8Sia I cDNAs are overexpressed in SV40 T antigen-expressing primate (COS) cells. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of sialic acid 9-O-acetylation can be regulated by the action of specific sialyltransferases that alter the predominant linkage of the terminal sialic acids found on specific classes of glycoconjugates."

Transcription initiation sites were newly identified in the region downstream of the previously determined sites. Full promoter activity resided within the region from −285 to +129 base pairs with respect to the newly determined major site. Within this region, we found three sequences identical or similar to the DNA replication-related element (DRE), 5′-TATCGATA, which is known as a common promoter-activating element for the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit gene and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene. These sites were located at positions −77 to −70 (DREα-I), −44 to −37 (DREα-II), and +3 to +10 (DREα-III). Footprinting analysis using the recombinant DRE-binding factor (DREF) or Kc cell nuclear extract demonstrated that DREF can bind to all three DRE-related sites. Introduction of mutation in even one of the three DRE-related sequences caused extensive reductions of the promoter activity and also the DREF-binding activity of the promoter-containing fragment. The results indicate that the three DREF-binding sites cooperate to enhance promoter activity of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene.

The results indicate that the three DREF-binding sites cooperate to enhance promoter activity of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene. Five distinct species of DNA polymerases (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) have been isolated from eukaryotes and characterized (1Linn S. Cell. 1991; 66: 185-187Google Scholar, 2Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Google Scholar). Of these, three are thought to be involved in chromosomal DNA replication including the DNA polymerase α-primase, which has been implicated in this process by many lines of evidence (1Linn S. Cell. 1991; 66: 185-187Google Scholar, 2Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Google Scholar, 3Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 534-539Google Scholar, 4Morrison A.

The DNA polymerase α-primase consists of four subunits with molecular masses of 165–182, 68–86, 54–60, and 46–50 kDa (2Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Google Scholar). The largest polypeptide is known to be the DNA polymerase catalytic subunit (6Wong S.W. Paborsky L.R. Fisher P.A. Wang T.S.-F. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7958-7968Google Scholar), and the two smallest subunits are responsible for the primase activity (7Bambara R.A. Jessee C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 11-24Google Scholar). The function of the second largest subunit of 68–86 kDa is not clear yet. cDNA clones for the four subunits of the mouse DNA polymerase α-primase were isolated, and their expressions were examined in mouse cells during the cell cycle (8Miyazawa H. Izumi M. Tada S. Takada R. Masutani M. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8111-8122Google Scholar). When cells at the quiescent state are stimulated to proliferate, levels of mRNAs for all four subunits of the enzyme increase almost simultaneously prior to DNA synthesis (8Miyazawa H. Izumi M. Tada S. Takada R. Masutani M. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8111-8122Google Scholar), and therefore, transcription of these genes is likely regulated by a common mechanism. In budding yeast, promoter regions of many DNA replication-related genes contain a common nucleotide sequence (5′-ACGCGT) named MCB (MluI cell cycle box) (9Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Google Scholar), and the specific transcription factor MBF (MCB-binding factor) is required for the transcription of these genes at the G1-S boundary (10Dirick L. Moll T. Auer H. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 357: 508-513Google Scholar, 11Lowndes N.F. Johnston A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the transcription factor E2F binds to the E2F-recognition site (5′-TTTCGCGC) and positively regulates transcription of a group of genes whose products are required for cell proliferation (12Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Google Scholar, 13Li R. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have isolated Drosophila genes for DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit (18Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Masutani M. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4991-4998Google Scholar) and PCNA (19Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Moriuchi T. Hirose F. Hui C.-C. Suzuki Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 872-879Google Scholar). Promoter regions of these genes contain a common 8-base pair (bp) palindromic sequence (5′-TATCGATA), named DNA replication-related element (DRE) (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). Three DREs are present in the DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit gene at nucleotide positions −217, −86, and −30 with respect to the transcription initiation site and one DRE in the PCNA gene at a position −100 (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). The requirement for DREs for the activities of promoters of these genes has been confirmed both in cultured cells (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar) and in transgenic flies (21Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Nishimoto Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15808-15814Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found a specific DRE-binding factor (DREF) consisting of an 80-kDa polypeptide homodimer (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to determine whether the DRE/DREF transcriptional regulatory system functions in the transcription of genes for other DNA replication enzymes. A cDNA and the genomic regions for the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit have been cloned, and their nucleotide sequences have been determined (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). This sequence apparently contains one DRE sequence and close to that two additional DRE-related sequences. However, all of these are located around the first ATG codon in the transcribed region. In the work presented here, we have carried out a more detailed analysis of the transcription initiation sites in the 73-kDa subunit gene and have determined new sites downstream of those previously identified. The DRE-related sequences are located at −76, −44, and +3 with respect to the most prominent new transcription initiation site. We have therefore examined the role of the DRE-related sequences in the promoter activity. The obtained results suggest that these sites cooperate to activate the promoter of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene. Kc cells derived from Drosophila melanogaster embryos were grown at 25°C in M(3)BF medium (23Cross D.P. Sang J.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 45: 161-172Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5% CO2. For obtaining the fragment containing the promoter by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the following primers were chemically synthesized: B-1, 5′-GACACTCGAGGATTGGGAGT (containing XhoI site), and B-2, 5′-GAGGGATCCTCGTTGTCCTTTCGTTGGGCGTTTA (containing BamHI site). Four oligonucleoties were used as primers for base-substitution mutations in DREαI and DREαII by PCR-aided mutagenesis: 73αIm, 5′-ATGGGCGCGCACAATCACTGGTTACAGATC; 73αImc, 5′-ATTGTGCGCGCCCATCCCCAATCGCAGTGC; 73αIIm, 5′-ACGGTGCGCGCAGCTCGATGGGAGCTGTTA; and 73αIImc, 5′-AGCTGCGCGCACCGTGATCTGTAACCAGTG. To determine the transcription initiation sites, the following fragment was used in primer extension experiments (see Fig. 1): Primer 2, 5′-AACTGCGTCCGCTGGCTCCACGCCCATCTCGTCGAACT. All nucleotide positions of the 73-kDa subunit gene in the following part of this paper were expressed with respect to one of the major transcription initiation sites, which were determined in the present study. Plasmid A contains all of the transcribed region and at least 5 kilobases of the upstream region of the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). Plasmid B contains about 1.2 kilobases of the upstream region from the position +7 of the 73-kDa subunit gene in the vector pBluescript (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). The plasmid pDhsp70-L contains firefly luciferase cDNA combined with the Drosophila hsp70 gene promoter was used for cotransfection with CAT plasmids as an internal control (21Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Nishimoto Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15808-15814Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid that contained the upstream region from the position −302 to the position +129 of the 73-kDa subunit gene, PCR was performed using plasmid A DNA as a template and a combination of primers B-1 and B-2. The PCR product was blunt-ended using T4 phage DNA polymerase, digested with XhoI, and then replaced with the gene fragment between EcoRV and XhoI sites of the plasmid B to create the plasmid pDPOLA73BLU, which contains the gene region from about −1200 to +129. To construct the plasmid used for the CAT transient expression assay, pDPOLA73BLU was digested with KpnI and SacI, and then the DNA fragment that contained the 73-kDa gene fragment was isolated. Then, this DNA fragment was placed between KpnI and SacI sites of the plasmid pSKCAT (24Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishida Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4909-4917Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was named as pDPOLA73CAT. To construct the plasmid p-302DPOLA73CAT, pDPOLA73CAT was digested with XhoI to remove an upstream DNA fragment between two XhoI sites. The remaining part was then self-ligated using T4 DNA ligase. To construct the plasmid p-302DPOLA73CATmutIII containing a mutation in the DRE sequence (DREα-III), p-302DPOLA73CAT was digested at the center of the DRE sequence with ClaI and then blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, followed by self-ligation using T4 DNA ligase. By this treatment, two base pairs, GC, were inserted at the center of the DRE sequence. To construct the plasmids that contained mutations in the DRE-related sequences (DREα-I and DREα-II), a first PCR was performed using pDPOLA73CAT as a template with the following combinations of primers: 1) B-1 and 73αImc, 2) B-2 and 73αIm, 3) B-1 and 73αIImc, and 4) B-2 and 73αIIm. The resultant products were named as Imc, Im, IImc, and IIm, respectively. A second PCR was performed using Imc and Im as templates with primers B-1 and B-2 or IImc and IIm as templates with primers B-1 and B-2. Under these conditions, only the DNA fragment produced depending on hybridization of two templates was amplified, and the hybridized region contains the mutated DRE-related sequence. These products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and then used to replace the region carrying the wild type sequence between BamHI and XhoI sites of p-302DPOLA73CAT to create the plasmids p-302DPOLA73CATmutI and p-302DPOLA73CATmutII. To construct the plasmid p-302DPOLA73CATmutI II, first PCR was performed as described above using p-302DPOLA73CATmutI as a template with primers 73αIImc and 73αIIm, then followed with the second PCR using primers B-1 and B-2. To construct the plasmids with mutation in the DREα-III in addition to mutation(s) in DREα-I, DREα-II, or both, the plasmid carrying the mutation(s) in site I, site II, or both were digested with ClaI and then blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase, followed by self-ligation using T4 DNA ligase. Total cellular RNA was extracted from Drosophila embryos at 0–2 h and 2–4 h old or from Kc cells by the method as described (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). A 38-mer primer (Primer 2) that was complementary to the region downstream of the second ATG codon (see Fig. 1) was chemically synthesized. The 5′-end of the primer was labeled with 32P and hybridized with 50 µg of total RNA for 16 h at 45°C in a solution containing 75% formamide, 62.5 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), 0.5 M NaCl. The RNA and primer were ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in a solution for the primer extension. The primer was extended for 90 min at 45°C in a 25 µl reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM each of dNTP, 1.5 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara), 400 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 µl of 0.5 M EDTA, and 1 µl of RNase A (1 mg/ml) was added to digest RNA. The digestion was carried out for 30 min at 37°C. Glycogen (1 µg) was added to the reaction as a carrier, and then the sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform. The reaction product was ethanol precipitated and redissolved in 4 µl of a sequencing dye mixture. The sample was analyzed by a gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, followed by autoradiography. 35S-Labeled DNA fragments, produced in the dideoxy sequencing reaction with the plasmid pDPOLA73BLU as a template using Primer 2 as a primer, were run in parallel, allowing precise mapping of the cap site. The expression plasmid for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-DREF(16–608) fusion protein was constructed, and the fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (26Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Google Scholar). The specific DRE-binding activity of DREF protein resides within 16–105-amino acid residues (26Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Google Scholar). The E. coli cells were collected and suspended in a solution containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.2 M KCl. The suspension was sonicated and then centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and used for the gel mobility shift assay. Kc cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar) and used for the gel mobility shift analysis. The probes containing a part of the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene were end-labeled with 32P. Gel mobility shift analysis was performed as described (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 32P-Labeled probe (10,000 cpm) was incubated in 14 µl of reaction mixture containing 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 0.5 µg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5 µg of sonicated calf thymus DNA (average size, 0.2 kilobase) on ice for 5 min. When necessary, unlabeled DNA fragments were added as competitors at this step. Then, the E. coli lysate containing GST-DREF(16–608) fusion protein or Kc cell nuclear extract was added, and a reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 50 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA containing 2.5% glycerol at 25°C. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Kc cells (2 × 106/dish) were grown in 60-mm plastic dishes for 24 h and cotransfected with 10 µg of the reporter plasmid DNA and 50 ng of pDhsp70-L DNA by a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described (27Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after DNA transfection. Cell extracts for determination of CAT activities were prepared as described (28Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8773-8787Google Scholar). Radioactivities of spots corresponding to acetylated [14C]chloramphenicols were quantified with the imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film). The luciferase assay was carried out by means of a PicaGene assay kit (Toyo Inc.) as described previously (29Echalier G. Ohanessian A. In Vitro. 1970; 6: 162-172Google Scholar). All assays were performed within the range of linear relation of the activities to incubation time and protein amounts. CAT activities were normalized to luciferase activities. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed essentially as described (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). The DNA fragment obtained from digestion of pDPOLA73BLU with BamHI and XhoI was labeled at 5′-end of the upper or lower strand (1 ng, 1 × 104 cpm) and added to 30 µl of a reaction mixture containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 6.7, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 µg of sonicated calf thymus DNA, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC). E. coli lysate containing GST-DREF(16–242) or Kc cell nuclear extract were added last, and the binding reaction was performed for 15 min on ice. DNase I (2 µl, 100 units/µl) that was freshly diluted in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin was added to each reaction. After 1 min of digestion at 25°C, reactions were terminated by adding 100 µl of a solution containing 40 mM EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 0.3 M NaCl, 40 µg/ml E. coli tRNA, and 100 µg/ml proteinase K. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 45°C and then extracted with phenol-chloroform. The reaction products were precipitated with ethanol and then loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea sequencing gel in parallel with products of Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions using the same DNAs as probes for sequencing controls. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed. cDNA and the gene for the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were determined (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). We found a sequence identical to DRE (5′-TATCGATA) and two sequences similar to DRE around the previously identified ATG translation initiation codon (ATG1 in Fig. 1). These locations are several hundred base pairs downstream from the previously determined multiple transcription initiation sites (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). Because these three sites were found to be bound by DREF as described below, we named these sites as DREα-I, DREα-II, and DREα-III. In our previous studies on the genes for DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit and PCNA, DREs are localized in the adjacent upstream regions of their transcription initiation sites (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). We therefore thought that other transcription initiation sites might be present downstream of those previously identified. We searched this by a primer extension experiment using the new primer (Primer 2 shown in Fig. 1), and several new transcription initiation sites of the 73-kDa subunit gene were identified in addition to those previously determined using Primer 1 (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and 2). The most prominent of the newly determined transcription initiation sites was now defined as the nucleotide position +1 and was mapped 3 bp downstream of the first ATG codon as suggested previously (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both previously and newly identified sites seem to be frequently used in early embryos. The signal of newly identified site was especially prominent with RNA extracted from Kc cells (Fig. 2), and those corresponding to previously determined ones were rather weak. A TFIID target sequence, 5′-TTATTG (30Purnell B.A. Emanuel P.A. Gilmour D.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 830-842Google Scholar), was found 12 bp upstream of the major site of the new transcription initiation sites but not around the previously determined sites. In the region downstream of the newly determined transcription initiation site, the ATG codon (ATG2 in Fig. 1) was found in the position of +130, and its location is 132 bp downstream from the previously determined first ATG (ATG1 in Fig. 1). Thus, the polypeptide coded by the new sequence is 44 amino acids shorter than that coded by the previously determined sequence. Homology searches indicate that amino acid sequence of the N-terminal end of the newly suggested sequence corresponds to that of the mammalian 73-kDa subunit sequence, and therefore, the previously determined coding frame has an extra sequence of 44 amino acid residues that is absent in the mammalian homolog. The fragment spanning positions about −1200 to +129, which contains both previously and newly determined transcription initiation sites, was placed adjacent upstream of the CAT gene (pDPOLA73CAT). Deletions were made unidirectionally from its 5′-end, and then the plasmids carrying various deletions were transfected into Drosophila Kc cells. A deletion from position −1200 to position −508 did not show any significant change in CAT expression (data not shown). Further deletions to position −285 also did not affect CAT activity significantly (Fig. 3). About 60% reduction of CAT expression was observed with a deletion from −285 to −266. Because this region contains a sequence similar to the E2F-binding site, 5′-TTTCGCGG, the transcription factor E2F might play a role for activation of the promoter of this gene as reported with the PCNA gene (31Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Google Scholar). Further deletions resulted in progressive reduction of the CAT expression level. Therefore, the region containing DRE and DRE-related sequences are required for high promoter activity. A deletion construct from the 3′-end was also made. The plasmid carrying the region from −302 to +129 showed high CAT expression. However, the plasmid carrying the region from −302 to +12 showed no detectable level of CAT expression, although it contained the DRE, the DRE-related sequences, and the major transcription initiation site (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the region from +12 to +129 contains an element(s) essential for the promoter activity. Taken together, it is concluded that the promoter region of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene is localized between positions −285 and +129. To examine whether DRE and its related sequences can be recognized by DREF, the DRE-binding factor identified previously (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar), we carried out a gel mobility shift assay using the GST-DREF (16–608) fusion protein (26Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Google Scholar) and Kc cell nuclear extract, in which four DNA fragments from various regions of the gene (Fig. 1) were used as probes. The shifted band was observed with the 430-bp fragment C but not with fragments A, B, and D (Fig. 4A). The shifted band was competed by adding an excess amount of the same fragment (Fig. 4B, lanes d-f) and the 151-bp DNA fragment containing the region from positions −168 to −26 of the Drosophila PCNA gene promoter, which contained a DRE sequence (Fig. 4B, lanes g-i). In contrast, the PCNA gene fragment carrying the 6-base deletion in the DRE sequence did not compete (Fig. 4B, lanes j-l). Similar nucleotide sequence-specific complex formation was observed with the fragment C and the Kc cell nuclear extract (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the addition of the anti-DREF monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody 4) (26Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Google Scholar) to the binding reaction resulted in super-shift of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 4D, lanes d-f). These results indicate that DREF can specifically bind to the fragment C-containing DRE and its related sequences of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene. DNase I footprinting analysis was performed to determine the exact DREF-binding site(s) in the DNA fragment C. 5′-end of either the upper or lower strand of the fragment spanning from position −302 to +129 was 32P-labeled and was used for the analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, GST-DREF (16–242) fusion protein protected three regions of the upper strand corresponding to positions from −78 to −62 (α-I), from −55 to −34 (α-II), and from −4 to +18 (α-III). Similar regions were protected when the lower strand was used as a probe (Fig. 5B). When the Kc cell nuclear extract was added in the reaction (Fig. 5C), three regions of about 22 bp corresponding to positions from −78 to −62, from −55 to −34, and from −4 to +18 were also protected. The region α-III contains the DRE sequence, whereas the regions α-I and α-II contain the DRE-related sequences that matches 5 bp out of the 8-bp DRE sequence almost at the center of each protected region. The results indicate that DREF can bind to the DRE-related sequences as well as the DRE sequence. To examine roles of DREF-binding sequences for promoter activity of the 73-kDa subunit gene, we constructed CAT expression plasmids having mutations in the DRE and its related sequences (Fig. 6A), and CAT transient expression assays in Kc cells were performed. Mutation of either of three DREF-binding sequences resulted in extensive reduction (75–95%) of the CAT expression (Fig. 6B). Mutations in any two DRE-related sequences completely abolished the CAT expression. The results indicate that all of the three DREF-binding sequences are required for the high promoter activity. The above evidence suggests that the three sites cooperate to enhance the promoter activity. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism, we examined the effects of the mutations on the DREF binding to the DNA fragments by a gel mobility shift assays. When GST-DREF fusion protein was incubated with the 32P-labeled fragment C without competitor fragments, the shifted bands were detected (Fig. 7A, lane c). When a fragment containing intact DRE and DRE-related sequences was added to the reaction as a competitor, the shifted band was decreased extensively (Fig. 7A, lanes d-g). In contrast, when any of mutant fragments with mut I, mut II, or mut III was added to the reactions, shifted bands were decreased to only a limited extent. (Fig. 7A, lanes h-k, l-o, and p-s, and quantified results in Fig. 7B). Therefore, the presence of all three DREF-binding sequences in intact forms is required for formation of the strong DNA-protein complex, and an extensive decrease of the promoter activity by mutation in any of three DREF-binding sequences might be due to loss of affinity of DREF to the three DRE sequences. Thus, three DREF-binding sequences appear to cooperate to conduct high promoter activity. In the present study, we have mapped new transcription initiation sites for the Drosophila DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene, which are downstream of those previously reported. The sites in both upstream and downstream regions seem to be utilized in Drosophila early embryos, whereas the newly mapped sites are prominent in the cultured Kc cells. The newly mapped major transcription initiation site was located 3 bp downstream of the first ATG codon that was previously predicted as a translation initiation site (22Cotterill S. Lehman I.R. McLachlan P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4325-4330Google Scholar). These results suggest that the second ATG codon located at 132 bp downstream of the first ATG codon functions as a translation initiation site in the mRNA, which is synthesized from the newly mapped transcription initiation sites. Thus, the previously predicted open reading frame contains 44 additional amino acid residues to the N terminus of the polypeptide started from the second ATG. Comparison of amino acid sequences of these predicted amino acid sequences with that of the mammalian 73-kDa subunit (8Miyazawa H. Izumi M. Tada S. Takada R. Masutani M. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8111-8122Google Scholar) revealed that the N-terminal of mammalian homolog corresponds to that predicted by the second ATG. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Drosophila embryos also contain a 73-kDa subunit with the extra N-terminal sequence. Biological significance of the possible heterogeneity of the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit remains to be clarified. Previously, we reported that an 8-bp palindromic sequence of DRE and not neighboring sequences are responsible for activating promoters of the DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit and PCNA genes in both cultured cell and transgenic fly systems (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar, 21Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Nishimoto Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15808-15814Google Scholar). We also reported that the 2-base substitution within the 8-bp sequence of DRE abolished the binding to DREF (20Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Google Scholar). We found one DRE sequence and two DRE-related sequences in an adjacent region to the newly mapped transcription initiation sites. Although the nucleotide sequence of DRE is identical to that reported previously, two DRE-related sequences match only 5 bp out of the 8-bp DRE sequence. However, gel shift analyses have shown that all these three sites are essential for formation of the stable DNA-protein complex. Furthermore, mutation in any one of these three DREF-binding sites resulted in extensive reduction of the promoter activity. Therefore, they probably cooperate to enhance the promoter activity. Recently, a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian E2F1 was isolated (32Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Google Scholar, 33Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Google Scholar, 34Hao X.F. Alphey L. Bandara L.R. Lam E.W.-F. Glover D. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2945-2954Google Scholar), and E2F-binding sites were found in promoter regions of the DNA polymerase α 180-kDa subunit (32Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Google Scholar) and PCNA (31Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Google Scholar) genes. These sites appeared to function in both cultured Drosophila cells and living flies (31Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25159-25165Google Scholar). A deletion of one of two E2F-recognition sequences in the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit gene promoter remarkably reduced the promoter activity. Our observations therefore suggest that the 73-kDa subunit gene is also regulated by E2F like the 180-kDa subunit and PCNA genes, although further analysis is necessary to clarify this point. In addition, our results suggest that the region between positions +12 and +129 is also important for the promoter activity. However, the precise sequences responsible for the control have yet to be identified. Organizations of transcriptional regulatory elements of Drosophila genes for the DNA polymerase α 73-kDa subunit, 180-kDa subunit, and PCNA are summarized in Fig. 8. DRE(s) and the E2F-binding sites are commonly observed among these genes. A similar organization of DRE and the E2F-binding site most likely represents a common regulatory mechanism for the expression of these three DNA replication-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W1513255990,"Geranylgeranylation of Rab GTPases is an essential post-translational modification that enables Rabs to associate with intracellular membranes where they regulate exocytic and endocytic pathways. Geranylgeranylation is initiated by formation of a stable complex between newly synthesized Rab proteins and Rab escort protein (REP). The complex is recognized by Rab geranylgeranyl (GG) transferase, which transfers two GG groups to Rabs. The geranylgeranylated Rabs regulate vesicular movement by oscillating between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. In this study, I show that the kinetics of geranylgeranylation is influenced by the nucleotide status of nascent Rab. GDP-bound Rab is geranylgeranylated with 10–50-fold higher affinity than GTP-bound Rab (or GTP analog-bound Rab), as indicated by the apparent Km of the reaction. In vitro REP·Rab binding assays demonstrate that REP forms a stable complex only with the GDP-bound form of Rab but not the GTP-bound form, suggesting that the apparent Km effect in the prenylation reaction is due to a discrimination between the two different nucleotide-bound forms of Rab by REP. Inasmuch as Rabs are likely GTP-bound after synthesis and REP does not possess GTPase-activating protein activity, these results raise the possibility that a Rab GTPase-activating protein enhances the REP·Rab interaction prior to prenylation.

INTRODUCTIONPost-translational modification of proteins with lipids is a frequent and important cellular regulatory mechanism that has only recently been appreciated (reviewed in 1Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Google Scholar, 2Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-187Google Scholar, 3Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Google Scholar, 4Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Google Scholar). The lipid moieties, including acyl groups, prenyl groups, or both, are essential for the function of the modified protein, because they serve as determinants for protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions. Two types of prenyl groups have been identified to date: farnesyl or geranylgeranyl (GG). 1The abbreviations used are: GGgeranylgeranylGGPPgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphateREPRab escort proteinGGTasegeranylgeranyl transferaseGMPPNPguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateGDIGDP dissociation inhibitorGAPGTPase-activating protein. Both are attached to carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues via thioether bonds.Protein prenylation is catalyzed by three cytosolic enzymes that can be classified in two groups: the “CAAX” prenyl transferases, which include farnesyl transferase and GG transferase-I, and the Rab GG transferase or GG transferase-II (5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Google Scholar). CAAX prenyl transferases recognize a distinct motif at the carboxyl termini of their intracellular substrates. The motif is designated CAAX, where C is cysteine, A is aliphatic, and X is any amino acid. The CAAX sequence is the primary determinant for binding to the protein substrate. If the last amino acid in the CAAX sequence is a methionine or serine, the protein is a substrate of farnesyl transferase, whereas if it is a leucine it becomes a substrate for GGTase-I (6Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Google Scholar, 7Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Google Scholar, 8Moores S.L.

CAAX-containing proteins include members of the Ras and Rho/Rac family of low molecular weight GTPases, γ-subunits of G-proteins, nuclear lamins, G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, and retinal cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.All proteins belonging to a large subfamily of low molecular weight GTPases, termed Rab in mammals and YPT/SEC4 in yeast, undergo geranylgeranylation even though they lack a classical CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus. Instead, these proteins typically possess a double-cysteine motif, such as CC or CXC, of which both cysteines are modified by GG groups (11Farnsworth C.C. Kawata M. Yoshida Y. Takai Y. Gelb M.H.

An enzyme that digeranylgeranylates Rab proteins has been purified and molecularly cloned from rat brain and characterized in in vitro prenylation assays (12Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H.

This enzyme, called Rab GGTase or GGTase-II (previously designated Component B of Rab GGTase), is a heterodimer composed of an α-subunit and a β-subunit, both homologous to the corresponding α- and β-subunits of the CAAX prenyl transferases (13Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Google Scholar, 16Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12221-12229Google Scholar). However, in contrast with the CAAX prenyl transferases, Rab GGTase does not recognize Rab substrates unless they are complexed with another cytosolic protein, designated Rab Escort Protein (REP), previously designated Component A of Rab GGTase. REP is also known as the choroideremia gene product (see below) (14Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Google Scholar, 15Andres D.A. Seabra M.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Google Scholar).Previous studies suggested that newly synthesized Rabs bind REP, and the complex is then recognized by Rab GGTase. Two consecutive GG additions occur, possibly starting with the cysteine furthest from the carboxyl terminus. The product of the reaction, diGG-Rab·REP complex, likely dissociates after translocation of the diGG-Rab into a specific intracellular membrane (15Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Google Scholar, 18Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Google Scholar, 19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rab GDI) serves as a cytosolic acceptor for diGG-Rabs by promoting the dissociation of the diGG-Rab·REP complex (20Sanford J.C. Yu J. Pan J.Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26904-26909Google Scholar). REP is absolutely required for in vitro prenylation of Rab proteins, and studies in yeast and humans suggest that it is also required in vivo. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the REP homolog MRS6/MSI4 is an essential gene (21Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Schweyer R.J. Boguski M.S. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 193-194Google Scholar, 22Fujimura K. Tanaka K. Nakano A. Toh-e A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9205-9212Google Scholar). In mammals, there are two known REPs, REP-1 and REP-2, and in humans, loss-of-function mutations in the REP-1 gene result in choroideremia, an X-linked form of retinal degeneration (14Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Google Scholar, 23Cremers F.P.M. van de Pol D.J. van Kerkhoff L.P. Wieringa B. Ropers H.H.

Evidence suggests that REP-1 and REP-2 are almost entirely functionally redundant, at least at the level of substrate specificity (15Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Google Scholar, 17Cremers F.P.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Geurts van Kessel A.H. Ropers H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 71-75Google Scholar). In mutant choroideremia lymphoblastoid cells presumably all Rab prenylation is carried out by REP-2; only one Rab protein, Rab27, could be detected in an unprenylated form (25Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Google Scholar). Because Rab27 is expressed in the two retinal cell types that degenerate primarily in choroideremia, the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid, we proposed that the pathogenesis of choroideremia may be related to Rab27 dysfunction (25Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Google Scholar).Once prenylated, Rabs associate with the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane surrounding a nascent transport vesicle. There, Rabs are proposed to regulate the targeting and fusion of transport vesicles to the appropriate acceptor compartments in exocytic and endocytic pathways (27Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Google Scholar, 28Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Google Scholar, 29Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Google Scholar). Like other GTP-binding proteins, Rabs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. Rabs associate with membranes in the GDP-bound form and switch to a GTP-bound conformation in a reaction catalyzed by a GDP/GTP exchange factor (30Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Google Scholar, 31Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Google Scholar, 32Horiuchi H. Giner A. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11257-11262Google Scholar). After fusion has occurred, the GTP is hydrolyzed in a reaction that is stimulated by a Rab-specific GTPase-activating protein (Rab GAP). This reaction forces Rabs into the GDP-bound form, which leads to their removal from the membrane by Rab GDI. In response to subsequent signals, Rab GDI mediates the reassociation of GDP-Rab with the donor membrane, where the cycle resumes. Rab GDI and REP share structural and functional properties, and it has been proposed that REP acts in the delivery of newly synthesized Rabs, whereas Rab GDI acts in their recycling (18Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Google Scholar).The nucleotide status of Rabs is critical to their function, and it is therefore important to study the nucleotide dependence of Rab geranylgeranylation. This issue has been the subject of previous studies that yielded conflicting results. A study of Rab5 prenylation using a cell-free translation and prenylation assay in rabbit reticulocyte lysates suggested that there was a preference for prenylation of GDP-bound Rab (33Sanford J.C. Pan Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23773-23776Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was recently proposed for Rab6 prenylation in insect cells (34Schiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Mayer T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 113-119Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro assays using purified or partially purified components suggested that the nucleotide did not influence Rab prenylation (14Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Google Scholar, 35Beranger F. Cadwallader K. Porfiri E. Powers S. Evans T. de Gunzburg J. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13637-13643Google Scholar).In this study, I analyze the prenylation kinetics of GDP versus GTP-bound forms of Rabs using recombinant purified Rab GGTase and REP and show that there is a clear preference for the GDP-bound form. Furthermore, this effect is shown to be a direct consequence of a higher affinity of REP toward GDP-bound Rab. Inasmuch as Rabs are believed to be GTP-bound after synthesis, these results suggest that a Rab GAP may be involved in presenting newly synthesized Rabs to REP prior to geranylgeranylation.RESULTSIn order to analyze the nucleotide dependence of Rab prenylation, an effective way to load the desired nucleotide after removing all the prebound GDP had to be devised. I adapted a procedure described by Wittinghofer and co-workers (38John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Google Scholar), later modified by Pfeffer and co-workers (39Shapiro A.D. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6925-6931Google Scholar) for the loading of Rab proteins. The procedure involves the exchange of pre-bound GDP for GMPPNP in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase degrades GDP or GTP to guanosine but does not hydrolyze GMPPNP. Rabs will not bind guanosine, and therefore at the end of the exchange reaction, Rabs are efficiently depleted of GDP and loaded with GMPPNP. The latter can later be exchanged with the desired nucleotide owing to its lower affinity for Rabs when compared with GDP or GTP. This procedure was used to load Rabs with GDP, GTP, and the slowly hydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMPPNP. After loading, an aliquot was analyzed for the presence of guanine nucleotides by ion exchange chromatography. Under the conditions used, GDP, GTP, and GMPPNP elute differentially as demonstrated in Fig. 1A. Loading of Rab1a with GDP or GMPPNP resulted in homogenous preparations of GDP-Rab1a (Fig. 1B) and GMPPNP-Rab1a (Fig. 1D), respectively. The GTP-Rab1a preparation contained a small amount of GDP (8%), possibly due to intrinsic hydrolysis during the procedure and some GMPPNP (24%) due to incomplete exchange after the initial exchange of GMPPNP for pre-bound GDP (Fig. 1C).To analyze the effect of the bound nucleotide on the kinetics of Rab prenylation, the loaded Rabs were used as substrates in the in vitro prenylation assay in the presence of recombinant RabGGTase and REP-1. When GDP-loaded Rab1a was used in the assay, an apparent Km of 2.1 µM was obtained (Fig. 2). This result is similar to previously reported Km values obtained with recombinant Rab1a (19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar, 25Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Google Scholar). In contrast, there was a dramatic change in the apparent Km of the reaction when GTP-Rab1a or GMPPNP-Rab1a were used. Because of the low affinity, I was unable to obtain sufficiently concentrated preparations of GTP-Rab1a or GMPPNP-Rab1a to saturate the reaction. However, it is clear that the apparent Km is at least 10-fold higher for GTP-Rab1a and 50-fold for GMPPNP-Rab1a when compared with GDP-Rab1a. To test the generality of this effect, Rab2, Rab3a, and Rab5 were loaded with either GDP and GMPPNP and tested in the in vitro prenylation assay (Fig. 3). In every case, there was a dramatic difference in apparent Km comparable with what was observed in Fig. 2 for Rab1a. The least dramatic change was observed with Rab2, possibly because the GMPPNP-Rab2 preparation was contaminated with 8% of GDP (data not shown).Fig. 3Geranylgeranylation of Rab2, Rab3a, and Rab5: effect of loaded nucleotide. Each reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 50 µl, 5.5 µM [3H]GGPP (3,000 dpm/pmol), 100 ng of RabGGTase, and 100 ng of REP-1, and the indicated concentrations of Rab2 (A), Rab3a (B), or Rab5 (C), loaded with either GDP (closed circles) or GMPPNP (open circles). Duplicate reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37°C, and the amount of [3H]GG transferred to Rab proteins was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A blank value determined in the absence of Rab (0.18 pmol/tube) was subtracted from each point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There are two likely explanations for the observed effect on the prenylation kinetics. One is that REP binds with higher affinity to GDP-Rab, and the second is that REP binds equally well to both forms of nucleotide loaded Rab but that only REP·GDP-Rab is recognized by RabGGTase. To begin to discriminate between these two alternative possibilities, a competition experiment was devised using a mutant Rab1a, designated Rab1aSS. Rab1aSS is unable to serve as a prenyl acceptor because the two cysteine residues that accept geranylgeranyl groups are mutated to serine residues. Rab1aSS retains the ability to bind to REP (19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar), and therefore it is a competitive inhibitor of Rab prenylation (14Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Google Scholar, 19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar). Susceptibility to Rab1aSS inhibition can serve as an indirect measure of REP-Rab binding. Rab1aSS was loaded with either GDP or GMPPNP and tested as an inhibitor of the prenylation of GDP-Rab1a (Rab1aCC). When increasing amounts of GDP-Rab1aSS were added, we observed up to a 70% reduction in the amount of [3H]GG incorporated into GDP-Rab1a-CC when the mutant protein was present at 30-fold higher concentrations (Fig. 4). At the same high concentration in the assay, GMPPNP-Rab1aSS failed to inhibit the reaction. This result suggests that the GTP-bound Rabs are unable to bind REP with high affinity.Fig. 4Geranylgeranylation of Rab1a in the presence of Rab1a-SS mutant. Each reaction mixture containing in a final volume of 50 µl, 5.5 µM [3H]GGPP (3,000 dpm/pmol), 100 ng of RabGGTase, and 100 ng of REP-1, and 1 µM GDP-loaded Rab1a was incubated at 37°C in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Rab1a-SS loaded with either GDP (closed circles) or GMPPNP (open circles). Duplicate reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37°C, and the amount of [3H]GG transferred to Rab1a proteins was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further test the hypothesis that REP has low affinity for GTP-bound Rabs, two distinct direct REP·Rab binding assays were developed. In the first experiment, a gel filtration assay to ascertain REP·Rab complex formation was used (19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar). When GDP-Rab1a was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column, it eluted as a 25-kDa protein as expected of a monomeric protein and as shown previously (19Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3699Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). When GDP-Rab1a was incubated with REP-1 and the mixture was subjected to gel filtration under the same conditions, a significant fraction of the GDP-Rab1a (approximately 50%) was shifted to fractions 7 and 8, co-eluting with REP-1 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when GTP-Rab1a was used only a small amount shifted to fractions 7 and 8 (Fig. 5C), and when GMPPNP-Rab1a was used no significant amount of Rab1a was found eluting in fractions 7 and 8 even after long exposures (Fig. 5D). These results confirm the suggestion derived from the previous experiments that REP has higher affinity for GDP-bound Rabs.Fig. 5Detection of REP·Rab1a complex by gel filtration chromatography. Each reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 50 µl, 2 µM of Rab1a-GDP (A and B), Rab1a-GTP (C), or Rab1a-GMPPNP (D), in the absence (Panel A) or the presence of 2 µM REP-1 (B-D). After incubation for 10 min at 37°C, each sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 3.2/30 column equilibrated and run as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An aliquot (30 µl) of elution fractions 4–12 was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis on 12.5% mini gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with either J905 anti-REP-1 antibody (0.03 µg/ml) or D576 anti-Rab1a antibody (2.5 µg/ml), as indicated, by immunoblot analysis. Horizontal arrows denote the position of migration of REP and Rab1a (left side), and the molecular mass markers (right side) upon SDS gel electrophoresis are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further study the ability of REP to form a stable complex with GTP-bound Rab, I used a different REP·Rab binding assay (15Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P.M. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Google Scholar). This REP·Rab binding assay is based on the selective precipitation of his-tagged REP-1 using nickel-Sepharose. If a stable complex between his-tagged REP-1 and non-His-tagged Rab1a is formed, the nickel-Sepharose pellet will contain detectable amounts of guanine nucleotide associated with Rab in the REP·Rab complex. Non-His-tagged Rab1a was loaded with [α-32P]GTP and incubated with REP-1 in the presence or the absence of Rab GGTase. After precipitation of his-tagged REP-1 with nickel-Sepharose, the nucleotide present in the pellet and supernatant was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. When His-tagged REP-1 was added to the incubation mixture, essentially all of the nucleotide in the nickel-Sepharose pellet was GDP (Fig. 6, lane 2). When His-tagged REP-1 was omitted from the incubation mixture, no nucleotide was present in the pellet (Fig. 6, lane 1). When Rab GGTase was present and prenylation occurred, the nucleotide in the nickel-Sepharose pellet was approximately 75% GDP and 25% GTP (Fig. 6, lane 3). When the supernatant of the reaction was analyzed, the majority of the nucleotide was GTP (80%), as expected because Rab1a was loaded with GTP (Fig. 6, lane 4). This experiment clearly indicates that even in the presence of an excess of GTP-Rab, REP forms a stable complex preferentially with GDP-Rab. A somewhat puzzling finding in this experiment is that the presence of Rab GGTase in the incubation mixture leads to the co-precipitation of some GTP-bound Rab with REP (Fig. 6, lane 3), whereas no GTP-Rab coprecipitates with REP in its absence (Fig. 6, lane 2). There is no obvious explanation for this finding. It is possible that the higher concentration of GTP-Rab in the assay leads to transient complex formation with REP. If the binding of Rab GGTase to the REP·Rab complex is not nucleotide-sensitive, then prenylation will occur and result in the formation of a prenylated GTP-Rab·REP complex. This complex may be sufficiently stable to allow detection in this assay.Fig. 6Detection of Rab-bound nucleotide in the REP·Rab complex by nickel-Sepharose affinity precipitation. Non-His-tagged Rab1a was loaded with [α-32P]GTP and incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of His-REP1 and RabGGTase as indicated and described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation, the samples were subjected to nickel-Sepharose precipitation, and aliquots of the pellet and supernatant were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Brackets indicate the position of migration of GTP and GDP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, the REP·Rab complex contained [32P]GDP even though [32P]GTP was the only nucleotide added in the loading reaction. One source of the [32P]GDP was a small contamination of the [32P]GTP stock with [32P]GDP. It is also possible that some GDP-Rab was derived from GTP-Rab by GTP hydrolysis during the loading and incubation procedures. Rabs have slow intrinsic GTPase activity, and it is possible that REP could stimulate their intrinsic GTPase activity, i.e., REP could act as a GAP. To test this hypothesis, REP was incubated with GDP-, GTP-, or GMPPNP-Rab, in the presence of [3H]GGPP and Rab GGTase, and the initial rate of GG transfer was measured. The reaction rate was extremely fast when GDP-Rab was used (Fig. 7, open squares) and slow in the presence of GTP-Rab (Fig. 7, open squares) or GMPPNP-Rab (Fig. 7, open triangles). The difference in the rate of geranylgeranylation of GDP-Rab versus GTP-Rab provided the basis for an assay that measures the formation of GDP-Rab. If GDP-Rab is generated from GTP-Rab, the rate of the reaction will increase. When REP was preincubated with GTP-Rab for 30 min prior to the addition of GGPP and Rab GGTase, the rate of the reaction did not change when compared with the rate obtained in the absence of preincubation (Fig. 7, compare open and closed circles). It is concluded that the REP-Rab preincubation did not result in the formation of GDP-Rab, suggesting that REP has no GAP activity. We also attempted to measure the ability of REP to induce GTP hydrolysis using a standard GAP assay, where Rab1a was loaded with [α-32P]GTP and the hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide was determined by thin-layer chromatography (40Tavitian A. Zahraoui A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 387-397Google Scholar). Under many different experimental conditions, no significant REP-dependent stimulation of GTP hydrolysis was observed (data not shown).Fig. 7Initial rate of Rab geranylgeranylation: effect of preincubation with REP. Each reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 50 µl, 50 mM sodium Hepes (pH 7.2), 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, in the presence (closed symbols) or the absence (open symbols) of 2 µM REP-1 and 2 µM of GDP-Rab1a (squares), GTP-Rab1a (circles), or GMPPNP-Rab1a (triangles). After 30 min at 37°C, 50 µl of a standard reaction mixture containing 5.5 µM [3H]GGPP (3,000 dpm/pmol) and 0.5 µM RabGGTase in the presence (open symbols) or the absence (filled symbols) of 2 µM REP-1 was added to each tube and incubated at 37°C. At the indicated times, a 20-µl aliquot from each tube was removed, and the amount of [3H]GG transferred to Rab1a proteins was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A blank value determined in the absence of Rab (open diamonds) was obtained for each time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe current study suggests that REP has a strict preference for GDP-bound Rabs. The formation of a stable REP·GDP-Rab complex initiates digeranylgeranylation by Rab GGTase, followed by membrane translocation of digeranylgeranylated GDP-Rab.As discussed in the introduction, the specificity of the nucleotide requirement has been studied previously with conflicting results. A study of Rab5 prenylation using a cell-free translation and prenylation assay in rabbit reticulocyte lysates suggested a preference for GDP-bound Rab (33Sanford J.C. Pan Y. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23773-23776Google Scholar). The authors compared the prenylation kinetics of wild type and mutant Rab5 proteins that alter the affinity for guanine nucleotides. Wild type Rab5 was prenylated faster than mutants believed to assume preferentially the GTP-bound state (Rab5Q79L) or the nucleotide-free state (Rab5N133I). More recently, an analysis of Rab6 revealed that Rab6Q72R, a GTPase-deficient mutant equivalent to Rab5Q79L was also less efficiently prenylated upon expression in insect cells (34Schiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Mayer T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 113-119Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro assays using purified or partially purified components yielded opposite results. In the original study where the purification of Rab GGTase was reported, we found in preliminary experiments that Rab3a prenylation could occur in the presence of either GDP, GTP, or GTP a"

https://openalex.org/W2067827261,"The H2a alternatively spliced variant of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor H2 subunit differs from the H2b variant by an extra pentapeptide, EGHRG, present in the ectodomain next to the membrane-span. This difference causes retention and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of H2a when expressed without the H1 subunit in 3T3 cells (1). In contrast, a significant portion of singly expressed H2b is Golgi-processed and reaches the cell surface. Using a new specific anti-H2a antibody, we found that in HepG2 cells, H2a is rapidly cleaved to a 35-kDa fragment, comprising the entire ectodomain, most of which is secreted into the medium. The cleavage site for the secreted fragment was located at the lumenal end of the membrane span. No membrane-bound H2a exits the ER, indicating that the pentapeptide is a signal for ER retention and degradation of the membrane form but does not hinder secretion of the cleaved soluble form. H2a does not form a membrane receptor complex with H1 as H2b does. H2a is therefore not a subunit of the receptor but a precursor for a secreted form of the protein; signal peptidase is probably responsible for the cleavage to the soluble fragment (2). Therefore, the juxtamembrane sequence regulates the function of the transmembrane domain of a type II membrane protein as either a signal-anchor sequence (H2b) or as a cleaved signal sequence, which generates a secreted product (H2a)."

TFIIIB90, which had been renatured from an SDS gel slice, has been shown, in conjunction with recombinant TBP and BRF1, to reconstitute the activities characteristic of TFIIIB (11Kassavetis G.A.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Google Scholar) were grown to an A600 of 0.7 and induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were lysed by incubation in 700 ml of Buffer A (6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 8) at room temperature for 1 h. The lysate was spun at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was batch-bound to 10 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the resin in binding buffer, BRF1 was eluted in Buffer B (6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 4.5). Fractions containing full-length BRF1 were pooled and an equal volume of buffer M added (4 M guanidine, 4 M urea). This fraction was split into two equal fractions, which were separately loaded to a 1.6-ml Poros R2-10 reverse phase column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 9% acetonitrile and eluted with a 40-column volume gradient from 9% to 90% acetonitrile. BRF1 eluted at about 40% acetonitrile. Fractions containing full-length BRF1 were pooled and dried at room temperature under vacuum. Protein was resuspended in 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1% Brij 58, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, and renatured by dialysis against 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, and 0.1% Brij 58. Approximate yield is 2 mg of ∼90% pure BRF1. 30 liters of yeast strain BJ5626 (13Jones E.W.

Cells (∼400 g) were harvested and resuspended in 500 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mM DTT and incubated at 30°C with gentle shaking for 15 min. Cells were spun at 1600 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 200 ml of YPD/S (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% dextrose, 1 M sorbitol). 150 ml of 2 M sorbitol and 150 ml of recombinant lyticase (∼1 mg/ml) (14Shen S.

Cells were resuspended in 3.5 liters of YPD/S prewarmed to 30°C and incubated 30 min at 30°C with gentle shaking. Cells were harvested, washed once in 3.5 liters of YPD/S at 4°C, and washed once in 3.5 liters of 1 M sorbitol at 4°C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 800 ml of 200 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.31 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin. This suspension was passed two times through a Yamato LH-21 homogenizer at 1000 rpm. The extract was made 0.5 M in ammonium sulfate and incubated 20 min with stirring. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The S100 extract was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. The precipitated protein was resuspended in Buffer D (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 0.31 mg/ml benzamidine). A whole cell extract was made as above from 1.12 kg of cells yielding 27 g of protein. This extract was split into three equal fractions and diluted to a conductivity equivalent to Buffer D + 0.15 M KCl. Each fraction was batch bound for 1 h to 300 ml of BioRex-70 resin equilibrated in Buffer D + 0.15 M KCl. The resin was then loaded to a column and washed with binding buffer. The column was then eluted with steps of 0.25 M, 0.5 M, and 1.0 M KCl. The 0.5 M BioRex fraction contained all factors necessary to reconstitute pol III in vitro transcription activity. The 0.5 M BioRex-70 fractions were pooled from the three columns (1.12 g total) and were diluted to a conductivity equivalent to Buffer D + 0.1 M KCl and bound in batch for 1 h to 65 ml of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow resin. The flow through from this column (780 mg) contained the bulk of TFIIIB90 activity. 40 mg of this material was loaded to a 1.6-ml Poros HS-20 column equilibrated in Buffer D + 0.1 M KCl. This column was eluted with a 20-column volume gradient from 0.1 M to 1.0 M KCl. TFIIIB90 activity eluted at about 0.45 M KCl. The fractionation on HS-20 was repeated multiple times until all the DEAE flow-through fraction was fractionated on HS-20. The peak of TFIIIB90 activity (100 mg) was pooled, concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Amicon), and diluted to a conductivity equivalent to D + 0.1 M KCl. This fraction was split into three equal volumes, and these fractions were bound to a 1.6-ml Poros HE-20 column equilibrated in D + 0.1 M KCl. The column was eluted with a 40-column volume gradient between 0.1 and 1.0 M KCl. TFIIIB90 activity eluted at 0.45 M KCl. Fractions containing TFIIIB90 activity were pooled and an equal volume of Buffer M added. The sample was split into two fractions, and each fraction was loaded to a Poros R2-10 reverse phase column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 9% acetonitrile and eluted with a 40-column volume gradient between 9% and 90% acetonitrile. TFIIIB90 activity eluted at about 36% acetonitrile. Fractions were dried under vacuum and separated by SDS-PAGE. Final yield of TFIIIB90 was ∼4 µg. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. The band corresponding to TFIIIB90 (90 kDa) was excised and submitted to in situ digestion with trypsin (15Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was separated by narrow-bore high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18, 2.1 mm by 150-mm reverse-phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Optimum fractions from the chromatogram were chosen based on differential UV absorbance at 210, 277, and 292 nm, peak symmetry, and resolution. Peaks were further screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 (Hemel, United Kingdom), and selected fractions were submitted to automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer (Foster City, CA). Details of strategies for the selection of peptide fractions and their Edman microsequencing have been described previously (16Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 152-160Google Scholar). Alternatively, tryptic peptide sequences were determined by electrospray ionization/tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan TSQ700 (San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer as described (17Hunt D.F. Henderson R.A. Shabanowitz J. Sakaguchi K. Michel K. Sevilir N. Cox A. Appella E. Engelhard V.H. Science. 1992; 255: 1261-1263Google Scholar). The peptide sequences (see “Results”) were used to design degenerate primers for use in PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides corresponding to peptides 2 and 3 amplified a DNA fragment of 600 bp. The resulting 600-bp fragment was used to probe colonies containing a yeast genomic library constructed in vector YEP24 (18Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Google Scholar). Eight clones were obtained, all of which contained an identical 8-kb insert. After restriction mapping analysis, the 8-kb insert was subcloned as three fragments, a 4-kb ApaI fragment, a central 3-kb ApaI-SalI fragment, and a 2-kb SalI fragment, into corresponding sites in pBluescriptSKII or pBluescriptKSII (Promega), generating plasmids pKS/Apa4, pSK/ApaSal3, and pKS/Sal2, respectively. Restriction mapping analysis identified the 600-bp TFIIIB90 fragment in pSK/ApaSal3. Automated DNA sequencing was performed, extending outward in each direction from the 600-bp region. The TFIIIB90 gene straddled the 3-kb ApaI-SalI fragment and the 4-kb ApaI fragment. 2522 base pairs of the TFIIIB90 gene were sequenced on both strands, which included 580 bp of sequence upstream of the translation start codon, the open reading frame, and 158 bp of sequence downstream of the stop codon. As the TFIIIB90 gene was divided into pKS/Apa4 and pSK/ApaSal3, a Bluescript derivative containing a continuous version of the gene was made prior to construction of expression plasmids. pKS/Apa4 was mutagenized to generate a XhoI site 486 bp upstream of the methionine start codon, and a BamHI site was inserted 108 bp downstream of the stop codon in pSK/ApaSal3. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis were: 3bXho1, 5′-CGAACACTGGCTCACTCGAGATTCTTTCGGAATCGGG; 3bBamHI, 5′-TGAAGCGATGTTCGGAAGGATCCATTGGCAACGAAAACAG.XhoI-ApaI and ApaI-BamHI fragments from the resulting constructs were inserted into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pBluescriptKSII by three-way ligation, to generate pKS/XB-TFIIIB90. In pKS/XB-TFIIIB90, the sequence around the start codon was mutagenized to create an NcoI site with or without a 6-histidine tag at the start of the open reading frame. Oligonucleotides for this mutagenesis were 3bNco6his and 3bNco, respectively. Where the 6-His tag was omitted from the N terminus, it was inserted at the end of the open reading frame immediately upstream of the stop codon, using oligonucleotide 3bC6his. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: 3bNco6his, 5′-CCACTTTTATTAACAATAC(GTG)6ACCCATGGATACCTGGTAATCAGTGGC; 3bNco: 5′-CCACTTTTATTAACAATACTACCCATGGATACCTGGTAATCAGTGGC; 3bC6his: 5′-GTATGCATATAAATGTCTCTTA(GTG)6ATCAATCTCAGGCTCTTC. NcoI-BamHI fragments from the mutagenized derivatives of pKS/XB-TFIIIB90 were subcloned into corresponding sites of the pET11d (Novagen) expression vector, downstream of the T7 promoter to generate expression plasmids pET11d/NcoN6His and pET11d/NcoC6His. 20 liters of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (19Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) harboring the pET11d/NcoN6His and pET11d/NcoC6His expression constructs were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and induced for 150 min with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. Induction of expression of the TFIIIB90 gene was detectable by SDS-PAGE of a crude bacterial lysate, and the recombinant protein was found to be soluble. Cells were harvested, and pellets resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (20Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Google Scholar) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant (150 ml) was incubated with 20 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4°C. The slurry was applied to a column and washed and eluted as described (20Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Google Scholar). Fractions containing peak TFIIIB90 concentrations as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed into a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 100 mM KCl. This material was loaded to a 1.6-ml Poros HS-20 column equilibrated in the dialysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a 30-column volume gradient from 0.1 M to 1.0 M KCl. TFIIIB90 activity eluted at about 0.6 M KCl. The protein was about 40% pure (Fig. 3A) and the final yield was ∼1 mg. The mobility shift experiments in Figs. 3B and 4A were performed as described previously (21Roberts S. Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 832-842Google Scholar), except that for the experiments in this paper BRF1 and TFIIIB90 were prepared as described above, and the gel and running buffers contained 1.5 mM MgOAc. In Figs. 3C and 4B, TFIIIB·DNA and TFIIB·TBP·DNA complexes were detected using the identical binding buffer and overall method as in Fig. 3B, except that magnesium and EDTA were omitted from the gel and running buffers, and the gel and running buffers contained TG (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, pH 8.3) instead of TBE. pol III transcription was performed by the method described for Pol I transcription (22Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S. Cell. 1992; 69: 697-702Google Scholar) except that the templates were unlinearized pGE2wt (23Baker R.B. Camier S. Sentenac A. Hall B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8768-8772Google Scholar) carrying the tRNALeu3 gene and pCH6 (24Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1355Google Scholar) containing the U6 gene, each at 30 µg/ml, and α-amanitin was used at 10 µg/ml. Additionally, transcription was performed with the combination of recombinant proteins and fractions described in the figure legends. Disruption of the gene encoding TFIIIB90 was accomplished by replacing the 1688 base pairs between the Mlu1 and NdeI sites in pKS/XB-TFIIIB90 with a XhoI fragment containing the TRP1 gene, from pSH398. 2S. Hahn, unpublished data. This was done by ligating a SalI linker to blunt-ended MluI and NdeI sites, followed by ligation to the XhoI fragment. The resulting plasmid was linearized with NsiI and BglI and transformed to the diploid yeast strain YPH501 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). The substitution, which resulted in removal of amino acids 1–511, was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. Disruptants were transformed with the URA+ YEP24 derivative isolated from the library screen for the TFIIIB90 gene. Transformants were sporulated, dissected tetrads were found to segregate 2:2 for the TRP+ phenotype, and all TRP+ haploids were also shown to be URA+. Mating tester strains were employed to confirm the haploidy of the cells. The URA3 plasmid was replaced by plasmid shuffle with a LEU2 plasmid carrying the TFIIIB90 gene. Cells in which the LEU2 vector contained the TFIIIB90 gene survived on 5-fluoroorotic acid, while those carrying the vector alone did not. The LEU2 plasmid used to shuffle out the URA3 plasmid was constructed by cloning the XhoI-BamHI fragment from pKS/XB-TFIIIB90 into corresponding sites in pRS315 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) to generate p315/XB-TFIIIB90. TFIIIB90 activity was purified from yeast whole cell extracts as detailed under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1A). Activity was monitored by TFIIIB complex formation in the presence of recombinant TBP and BRF1 at the yeast U6 promoter using a mobility shift assay (Fig. 1C) and by complementation of the 0.5 M heparin fraction for transcription of the SUP4 tRNA gene (data not shown and Fig. 5). A key step in the purification was fractionation by reverse phase chromatography under denaturing conditions. Renaturation of these reverse phase fractions and assay of activity by mobility shift assay showed that a ∼90-kDa polypeptide exactly co-fractionated with TFIIIB90 activity. In addition, elution and renaturation of the 90-kDa polypeptide from SDS gels also reconstituted TFIIIB complex formation (not shown). Chromatography of TFIIIB90 transcription activity exactly paralleled mobility shift activity from both the Poros HS-20 and Poros HE-20 columns. Unexpectedly, complementation of transcription activity at the SUP4 tRNA promoter was not reconstituted with denatured and renatured TFIIIB90 from the reverse phase column, even when activity was normalized to undenatured TFIIIB90 using the mobility shift assay. This is in contrast to an earlier report where TFIIIB90 transcription activity was recovered by renaturation from SDS gels (11Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is unknown but might be due to the difference in purity of components used to reconstitute transcription.Fig. 5Reconstitution of transcription using recombinant TFIIIB90. A run-off transcription experiment is shown in which the tRNALeu3 gene (lanes 1–9) was transcribed with 20 ng of full-length TBP, 25 ng of BRF1, 1 µl of the heparin 0.5 M fraction containing TFIIIC and pol III, and 0.5 µl of the HE-20 fraction containing yeast TFIIIB90 (lane 2). In lanes 3–7, recombinant TFIIIB90 protein containing a C-terminal 6-His tag and purified over Ni-NTA- agarose was added in the following amounts: lane 4, 0.001 µl; lane 5, 0.01 µl; lane 6, 0.05 µl; lane 7, 1 µl. In lanes 8 and 9, the reactions contained 0.4 µl and 2 µl, respectively, of the N-terminally tagged more highly purified rTFIIIB90 preparation shown in Fig. 3A. An analogous experiment in which a yeast U6 template was transcribed in the presence of 0.4 µl of the N-tagged rTFIIIB90 is shown in lanes 10 and 11. The arrow indicates the position of the specific transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After reverse phase chromatography, fractions containing TFIIIB90 activity were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After staining and excision of the 90-kDa polypeptide, TFIIIB90 was subjected to tryptic digestion, HPLC separation, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequence analysis. The sequence of three peptides were determined: 1) ADVIEDNVTLKPAPLQTHR; 2) ALSMWGTDFNLISQLYPYR; 3) EADENENYVISK (Fig. 2). Degenerate primers designed from these sequences were used to PCR amplify a probe that was used to screen a yeast genomic library (see “Materials and Methods”). A clone containing an open reading frame consistent with the peptide sequences was obtained and sequenced (Fig. 2). The open reading frame predicted a protein of 68 kDa, compared with the approximately 90-kDa size of TFIIIB90 on SDS gels. A search of the DNA sequence for the splicing signal of consensus TACTAAC did not reveal potential introns. The protein has a calculated isoelectric point of 6.93, and its middle region contains a stretch of charged amino acids. The tBLASTn computer alignment program (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) was used to search the DNA sequence data bases for similarities with TFIIIB90. The gene encoding TFIIIB90 did not share sequence identity or bear significant homologies with any known sequences. Sequencing also revealed that the TFIIIB90 gene lies in close proximity to the gene IDH1 (encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase) which was previously mapped to chromosome XIV (27Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Google Scholar). IDH1 was present in the antisense orientation to the gene encoding TFIIIB90, with the stop codons of the two genes located approximately 1 kb apart. Recombinant TFIIIB90 protein was produced in E. coli under control of the T7 promoter. For ease of purification, the open reading frame was tagged with a 6-histidine moiety at either the N or C terminus prior to its subcloning into the E. coli PET11d expression vector. The expressed N-terminally tagged protein was purified under native conditions by a combination of nickel affinity chromatography followed by further separation on a cation exchange resin. This N-terminally tagged and purified version of the protein was used in the experiments in this paper except where stated otherwise. For the sake of comparison, we also tested the C-terminally tagged derivative, purified over the nickel affinity column (see Fig. 5). Despite its predicted molecular mass of 68 kDa, recombinant TFIIIB90 migrated aberrantly as 90 kDa using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). To confirm the identity of the cloned gene as encoding a TFIIIB subunit, mobility shift assays were performed in which recombinant TBP, BRF1, and TFIIIB90 were bound to a probe comprising the TATA-containing yeast U6 promoter. The mobility of the ternary complex was compared with that obtained using the highly purified R2-10 native yeast TFIIIB90 fraction (Fig. 1). Successive addition of TBP, BRF1, and native TFIIIB90 to the probe produced complexes of decreasing mobility concurrent with incorporation of each protein into the complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4). For reasons unknown to us, we consistently observed a doublet of bands produced by binding of TBP and BRF1 to this probe. Binding of native TFIIIB90 was dependent on inclusion of TBP and BRF1 in the assay (data not shown). In conjunction with TBP and BRF1, recombinant TFIIIB90 (rTFIIIB90) produced a ternary complex of equivalent mobility to that formed with native TFIIIB90 (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). These results show that TBP, BRF1, and recombinant TFIIIB90 reconstitute the gel shift activity of TFIIIB. Binding of rTFIIIB90 at concentrations sufficient for it to induce the observed mobility shift required inclusion of both TBP and BRF1 (lanes 7 and 8 and data not shown). However, at higher concentrations of rTFIIIB90, a TFIIIB90-TBP-DNA complex was observed in the absence of BRF1 (Fig. 3, B, lane 10, and C, lane 7). This complex was specific for addition of TBP (lanes 7 and 8). Since less than 12 ng of TFIIIB90 was sufficient to induce a mobility shift in the presence of BRF1 (lane 5 and data not shown) and 300 ng was sufficient in the absence of BRF1, this result shows that BRF1 increases the affinity or stability of TFIIIB90 for the complex by at least 25-fold. The interaction between TBP and TFIIIB90 is consistent with our finding that native TFIIIB90 bound specifically to an Affi-Gel TBP affinity column; in an analogous experiment TFIIIB90 did not bind to a BRF1 affinity column. 3S. Miller, unpublished data. Since the pol II factor TFIIB is related to BRF1 (8Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Google Scholar), we explored the specificity of TFIIIB90 by testing whether it could bind to a TATA·TBP·TFIIB complex. As we have shown previously (21Roberts S. Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 832-842Google Scholar), TFIIB bound a TBP·TATA complex assembled on the U6 promoter (Fig. 3C, lane 2). However, as much as 60 ng of recombinant TFIIIB90 did not stably bind the TBP·TFIIB complex, whereas 5-fold less TFIIIB90 was sufficient for the formation of the TFIIIB·DNA complex under the same conditions (lanes 3 and 4 compared with lanes 5 and 6). In other experiments as little as 2.5 ng of TFIIIB90 was sufficient to produce a TFIIIB·DNA mobility shift (not shown). We attempted to identify regions on TBP that interact with the subunits of TFIIIB. We took advantage of the fact that the crystal structures of TBP and TFIIB are solved (28Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Google Scholar, 29Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Google Scholar, 30Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay H.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K.

Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Google Scholar). We tested whether TFIIA or TFIIB can bind to a TFIIIB-DNA complex in a mobility shift experiment. If binding occurs this would suggest that TFIIA and/or TFIIB bind to different surfaces of TBP and DNA than do BRF1 and TFIIIB90. Alternatively, if these proteins bind in a mutually exclusive manner, this would suggest that the TBP and/or DNA contacts made by BRF1 and/or TFIIIB90 lie in regions overlapp"
https://openalex.org/W2099956364,"The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a member of a family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share conserved features in their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. We have used site-specific mutagenesis within the extracellular domain of the EPOR to search for amino acid residues involved in erythropoietin (EPO) binding. Mutant proteins were expressed in bacteria as soluble EPO binding proteins (EBP) and characterized for EPO binding activity in a number of different assays. Substitution of phenylalanine at position 93 (Phe93) with alanine (F93A mutation) resulted in a drastic reduction in EPO binding in the EBP. More conservative tyrosine or tryptophan substitutions at Phe93 resulted in much less dramatic effects on EPO binding. Biophysical studies indicated that the F93A mutation does not result in gross structural alterations in the EBP. Furthermore, the F93A mutation in full-length EPOR expressed in COS cells abolished detectable EPO binding. This was not a result of processing or transport defects, since mutant receptor was present on the surface of the cells. Mutations in the region immediately around Phe93 and in residues homologous to other reported ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. These data indicate that Phe93 is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Furthermore, since Phe93 aligns with critical ligand binding determinants in other receptors of the cytokine receptor family, these data suggest that receptors of this family may use common structural motifs to bind their cognate ligands.

The biology of EPO and its receptor have recently been reviewed (2Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Google Scholar, 4Longmore G.D. Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. J.

In binding studies, EPOR has been detected on purified primary human erythroid progenitor cells with one affinity (Kd = 0.1 nM) or with two affinities (Kd = 0.1 and 0.57 nM) for 125I-EPO (7Broudy V.C.

The biological significance of two affinities of EPOR is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that there is an accessory component of the EPOR that increases EPO binding affinity (9Hermine O. Dong Y.J.

Structurally, the human EPOR is a 484-amino acid glycoprotein having extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of about 225 amino acid residues each and a single membrane spanning domain (16Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar). It is a member of an expanding family of cytokine and growth factor receptors that share homology in a region spanning approximately 200 amino acid residues of their extracellular domains designated the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain. Based on secondary structure predictions, Bazan (17Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar) proposed that CRH domains contain two fibronectin type III-like motifs of seven β-strands each connected by a short “hinge” sequence. Thus, the tertiary fold of CRH domains was predicted to include two globular β-barrel domains of seven β-strands each with homology to fibronectin type III domains (17Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 18Patthy L. Cell. 1990; 61: 13-14Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the extracellular domains of ligand bound human growth hormone receptor (GHR), a member of the cytokine receptor family, and human tissue factor, a more distantly related family member, have confirmed these structural predictions (19de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar, 20Muller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. de Vos A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1565-1572Google Scholar). Overall amino acid identity between CRH domains of members of the cytokine receptor family is generally less than 25%. However, alignment based on the predicted β-strands of the fibronectin type III-like motifs reveals several conserved features (17Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar, 18Patthy L. Cell. 1990; 61: 13-14Google Scholar, 21Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Google Scholar, 22Cosman D. Lyman S.D. Idzerda R.L. Beckman M.P.

These include two pairs of cysteines with conserved spacing in the amino-terminal motif, a WSXWS sequence near the carboxyl-terminal end of the membrane proximal motif, two highly conserved tryptophans, and several conserved tyrosines. Mutational analysis of some or all of these conserved residues in several members of the cytokine receptor family, including the GM-CSFRα (24Ronco L.V. Silverman S.L. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J. Park L.S.

Longmore G. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11619-11625Google Scholar, 13Quelle D.E. Quelle F.W. Wojchowski D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4553-4561Google Scholar, 15Hilton D.J.

Biophys. 1993; 306: 200-208Google Scholar), suggests that these residues are primarily involved in stabilizing tertiary structure and/or in intracellular transport and protein processing for cell surface expression. Amino acid residues important for ligand binding have been reported for a few members of the cytokine receptor family. For example, substitution of Trp104 of the GHR with alanine results in a >2,500-fold reduction in growth hormone (GH) binding (28Bass S.H. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4498-4502Google Scholar). The importance of Trp104 was confirmed in the crystal structure of the GH bound GHR, in which Trp104 forms extensive van der Waals contacts with residues in GH (19de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar). Based on crystallographic analyses, other important ligand binding contacts of the GHR are located in the loop between the B′ and C′β strands (B′-C′ loop) in the membrane proximal motif of the CRH domain. Remarkably, the B′-C′ loops of the human IL-2Rβ and the IL-3 specific second subunit of mouse IL-3R (AIC2A) also contain residues critical for binding their respective ligands (32Imler J.-L. Miyajima A. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2047-2053Google Scholar, 33Wang H.-M. Ogorochi T. Arai K. Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 979-983Google Scholar), and this same loop in the common β chain (βc) of the human GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors contains residues necessary for the formation of high affinity receptors (α chain-βc chain association) for GM-CSF and IL-5 (34Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Tavernier J. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5176-5185Google Scholar). Recently, Arg188 of the human IL-5Rα, which is in a position homologous to Trp104 of the GHR, has been shown to be important for binding IL-5 (35Cornelis S. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Sanderson C.J. Guisez Y. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3395-3402Google Scholar). Thus, from these data, a pattern appears to be emerging in which receptors of the cytokine receptor family utilize different amino acid residues located in structurally homologous regions to bind their cognate ligands. In this study, we have sought to identify EPO binding determinants on the EPOR by alanine replacement mutagenesis. 2Preliminary results from this work were presented at the European Erythropoietin Symposium of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association, European Renal Association, November, 1994, Seville, Spain, and published as meeting proceedings in a supplement to Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (36Jolliffe L.K. Middleton S.A. Barbone F.P. Johnson D.L. McMahon F.J. Lee W.-H. Gruninger R.H. Mulcahy L.S. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1995; 10: 28-34Google Scholar). Amino acid residues in the extracellular domain of the EPOR were chosen for mutagenesis based on their alignment with residues involved in ligand binding in other members of the cytokine receptor family. We have identified one residue, Phe93, that is a critical EPO binding determinant of the EPOR. Mutation of Phe93 to alanine results in an approximately 1,000-fold reduction in EPO binding in a competition binding assay and no detectable EPO binding in full-length mutant receptor expressed in COS cells. Substitution of Phe93 with leucine had a similar effect on EPO binding. More conservative substitutions with tyrosine or tryptophan had much less dramatic effects, suggesting that an aromatic residue is required at this position for high affinity EPO binding. Mutation of residues in the region immediately around Phe93 and residues homologous to other ligand binding determinants of the cytokine receptor family had small to moderate effects on EPO binding. Finally, Phe93 is homologous to Trp104 of the GHR and Arg188 of the IL-5Rα, both of which are involved in binding their cognate ligands (see above). Therefore, these results suggest that residues homologous to Phe93 in additional receptors of the cytokine receptor family are likely to be important for binding their respective ligands. Mutagenesis was performed in a bacterial expression vector designed to produce a soluble EPO receptor (referred to here as an EPO binding protein or EBP) consisting of the 225 amino acid extracellular domain of the human EPOR truncated just prior to the beginning of the transmembrane domain. Construction of this vector and the expression, purification, and characterization of the EBP have been described previously (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Briefly, the sequence encoding the EBP fused to the pelB bacterial signal sequence was cloned into the T7 expression plasmid pET11a (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and the completed construct was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. EBP was produced in an insoluble form, solubilized, re-folded, and purified in yields of 0.6 mg per g of wet cell paste. NH2-terminal sequencing, peptide mapping, and mass spectrometry indicated that the purified EBP exhibited the expected amino terminus (signal sequence was properly cleaved off), disulfide bridging pattern of Cys28-Cys38 and Cys67-Cys83, and molecular mass. The E. coli-expressed EBP exhibited a low nM EPO binding affinity (Kd = 5 nM), in the same range as the 1.5 nM Kd of a human EBP-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expressed in bacteria (38Harris K.W. Mitchell R.A. Winkelmann J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15205-15209Google Scholar) and the 1.1 nM Kd (39Yet M-G. Jones S.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1713-1719Google Scholar) and 17 nM Kd (40Nagao M. Masuda S. Abe S. Ueda M. Sasaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 888-897Google Scholar) reported for the human and mouse EBP, respectively, produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutations were created in the EBP expression vector described above using overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (41Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar). Primers were designed to amplify a 515-base pair (bp) DNA fragment encoding a portion of the EBP from a unique XhoI site at residues 59–60 to a unique BamHI site just 3′ of the stop codon after residue 225. For each mutant construct, two primers, complementary to each other and encoding the desired mutation, were used in combination with the XhoI and BamHI primers to amplify two separate PCR fragments. These two fragments were combined in a second PCR reaction with the XhoI and BamHI primers to amplify the final 515-base pair PCR product containing the desired mutation. Mutant fragments were subsequently cloned into the unique XhoI and BamHI sites of the EBP expression vector and sequenced in entirety to confirm the presence of desired mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations. Mutant EBPs were expressed in E. coli and purified as described for the wild-type EBP (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Some mutant EBPs were purified by a modification of these methods in which the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step was replaced by a preparative high performance-size exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) step. The purity of mutant and wild-type EBP was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical HP-SEC as described (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified mutant and wild-type EBP were estimated using the experimentally determined extinction coefficient for the wild-type EBP of 2.3 absorbance units per mg/ml at 280 nm (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Assays in which mutant EBP was analyzed for the ability to compete for 125I-EPO binding with wild-type EBP immobilized on agarose beads (EBP bead assay) were performed as described (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Analysis of EPO binding to wild-type and mutant EBP by HP-SEC was also performed as described (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar). Inhibition of proliferation assays were performed using FDC-P1-tHER cells, a stably transfected cell line which proliferates in response to EPO. FDC-P1 cells (42Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Google Scholar), a hematopoietic IL-3 and GM-CSF responsive cell line, were made EPO responsive by transfection with a construct encoding a truncated human EPOR (tHER) lacking the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain. This region is involved in down-regulation of EPOR signaling (43Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Google Scholar). The FDC-P1-tHER cell line was generated by methods described previously for FDC-P1 cells stably expressing mouse EPOR (14Carroll M.P. Spivak J.L. McMahon M. Weich N. Rapp U.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14964-14969Google Scholar). The ability of mutant EBPs to inhibit the EPO-dependent proliferation of FDC-P1-tHER cells was assayed by standard methods, except that the assay was performed using a Biomek 1000 robotic workstation (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Briefly, reservoirs were set up containing cells (starved overnight in medium lacking EPO), medium plus EPO, and medium alone and used to prepare 96-well plates for the assay. Each well contained 40,000 cells, 0.25 ng/ml EPO, and a variable concentration of mutant EBP. Plates were incubated for 42 h at 37°C, after which 1 µCi of [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN, Boston, MA) was added per well, and incubation continued for an additional 6 h. Cells were collected onto Filtermat A glass fiber filters (Wallac, Inc., Gaithersberg, MD) using a Harvester 96 model Mach II cell harvester (TOMTEC, Inc., Orange, CT) and counts/min were determined using a BetaPlate, model 1205 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Inc., Gaithersberg, MD). At the concentration of EPO used in the assay, the proliferative response of FDC-P1-tHER cells was just below maximal. For comparison with mutant EBPs, an inhibition of proliferation curve was generated with the wild-type EBP each time the assay was performed. In addition, a FDC-P1-tHER cell EPO response curve was generated each time the assay was run. All assay points were performed in triplicate. The global structure of the wild-type and F93A-EBP was characterized using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectrometers. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV 62DS spectrometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. The path length of the cuvette (Suprasil quartz cuvette, Hellma Cells, Inc., Forest Hills, NY) was 1 mm. Each reported spectrum is baseline subtracted and an average of at least three scans. Fluorescence spectra were recorded employing an AVIV ATF 105 Automated Titrating/Difference Ratio Spectrofluorometer (Aviv Associates) equipped with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. The path length of the cuvette (Suprasil quartz cuvette, Hellma Cells, Inc.) was 10 mm and emission and excitation slits were 5 nm. The DNA sequence encoding the human EPOR and the natural signal sequence (16Jones S.S. D'Andrea A.D. Haines L.L. Wong G.G. Blood. 1990; 76: 31-35Google Scholar) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The F93A mutation created in the EBP expression vector (above) was subcloned into the pSG5-EPOR vector using XhoI and BstEII restriction sites located within the sequence encoding the EBP and flanking Phe93. The presence of the F93A mutation in the pSG5-EPOR was confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersberg, MD) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 1%L-glutamine. All incubations were performed at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine diphosphate method. Prior to transfection, cells were split 1:3 and incubated 24 h. For each DNA construct to be transfected, five 100-mm tissue culture dishes were seeded with 3.5 × 106 cells per dish and incubated 6 h. DNA-DEAE-dextran was prepared by adding, in order, 40 ml of 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5/DMEM (1:5, v/v), 50 µg of the appropriate DNA construct, and 10 ml of 2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran to tubes and incubating 30 min at room temperature with gentle vortexing at 10-min intervals. Cells were washed with DMEM, overlaid with 10 ml of freshly prepared DNA-DEAE-dextran, and incubated overnight. Subsequently, cells were washed with DMEM, incubated 2.5 h with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 100 µM chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma), washed with DMEM again, and incubated 24 h with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Following this, cells were detached from plates by a 5-min incubation with 0.05% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and replated at the same density in DMEM containing 10% FBS (10 ml/dish). This step improved the yield of COS cells at harvest. Following an additional 24-h incubation, cells were harvested for receptor binding assay and/or detection of receptor on the cell surface as described below. Equilibrium binding analyses were performed with 125I-EPO (100 µCi/µg, DuPont NEN) essentially as described (44Eder M. Griffin J.D. Ernst T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1647-1656Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS cells were detached from plates by incubation at 37°C for 20 to 60 min in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide, pelleted, and resuspended in binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide). Duplicate microcentrifuge tubes were set up with between 4 and 5 × 104 transfected cells in 100 µl of binding buffer and a variable concentration of 125I-EPO in 100 µl of PBS. After incubation at 4°C overnight, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 100 µl of binding buffer, layered over 0.7 ml of calf serum, and pelleted again. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the radioactivity in the pellet was determined by clipping the pellets into glass tubes and counting using a Micromedic γ-counter with an efficiency of 75% (ICN Micromedic, Huntsville, AL). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 100-fold or greater excess unlabeled EPO. Specific binding was determined by subtracting counts/min calculated from a linear fit of the nonspecific binding data from the total counts/min obtained. As a control, wild-type EPOR was assayed each time mutant EPOR was assayed. Detection of EPOR on the surface of COS cells was performed using an anti-EBP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in a modification of the receptor binding assay described above. Duplicate microcentrifuge tubes were set up containing between 4 and 5 × 104 transfected cells in 100 µl of binding buffer to which 0, 0.1, or 1 µg of the immunoglobulin (Ig) fraction of anti-EBP mAb number 3 (36Jolliffe L.K. Middleton S.A. Barbone F.P. Johnson D.L. McMahon F.J. Lee W.-H. Gruninger R.H. Mulcahy L.S. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1995; 10: 28-34Google Scholar, see below) in 100 µl of binding buffer was added. As a control, duplicate tubes were set up containing 1 µg of mAb number 3 and an excess of EBP (10 µg), which would be expected to compete with cell surface EPOR for binding to the mAb. After overnight incubation at 4°C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 µl of binding buffer containing 0.1 µg (2 µCi) of 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham). Following a further 3-h incubation at 4°C, cells were pelleted, resuspended in 100 µl of binding buffer, layered on 0.7 ml of calf serum, and pelleted again. The supernatant was removed and radioactivity in the pellet determined as in the receptor binding assay described above. Mice were immunized with purified EBP (50 µg/mouse) emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted twice weekly with EBP (50 µg/mouse) emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antibody reactivity to EBP was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (see below). Hybridomas were prepared by Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc. (Portland, ME) using standard methods. The binding of mAbs to EBP was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format. The Ig fraction of a rabbit anti-EBP polyclonal antiserum (0.1 µg in PBS) raised against purified EBP was adsorbed to microtiter plates and wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. EBP (0.01 µg in PBS) was added and the plates were incubated overnight at 10°C. Following a wash with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, mAb was added, and plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Binding of mAb to the EBP was detected by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and tetramethylbenzidine (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersberg, MD) and measuring the absorbance at 450 nm. We have previously described a system for the overexpression of the extracellular domain of the human EPOR (termed EPO binding protein or EBP) in E. coli (37Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. McMahon F. Barbone F.P. Kroon D. Tsao E. Lee W-H. Mulcahy L.S. Jolliffe L.K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 104-113Google Scholar, see “Experimental Procedures”). The E. coli-expressed EBP can be purified in milligram quantities and binds EPO with a 5 nM affinity, making it suitable for mutagenesis studies. Amino acid residues in the EBP were selected for substitution with alanine based on their alignment with residues known to be involved in ligand binding in related receptors of the cytokine receptor family. In published mutagenesis studies at the time this work was initiated, residues in the E-F loop of the human GHR and in the B′-C′ loops of the human IL-2Rβ and mouse IL-3R (AIC2A) were reported to be involved in binding their respective ligands (see Fig. 1). Therefore, residues in homologous positions in the E-F and B′-C′ loops of the EBP were targeted for mutagenesis. Our strategy was to mutate the selected residues to alanine, express the mutant EBPs in E. coli, and test"

Because of its multiple actions, there is a stringent requirement for calcium homeostasis, and this is achieved in part by a system of transport and storage proteins such as calreticulin located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Calreticulin is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcriptional regulation. It has been reported that calreticulin can inhibit steroid-regulated gene transcription by preventing receptor binding to DNA. Here we report that overexpression of the calreticulin gene in B16 mouse melanoma cells resulted in a decrease in retinoic acid (RA)-stimulated reporter gene expression. Gel shift analysis showed that purified calreticulin inhibited the binding of endogenous RAR to a β-RA response element oligonucleotide, only if added prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide. Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest a physical interaction between RAR and calreticulin. Transfection of the calreticulin gene into B16 cells inhibited the RA induction of protein kinase Cα, a marker of RA-induced differentiation. We also found that cyclic AMP increased the expression of calreticulin. Cyclic AMP may act to antagonize RA action by both decreasing RAR expression (Y. Xiao, D. Desai, T. Quick, and R. M. Niles, J.

RA is thought to achieve its biological action by altering the expression of genes through binding and activating nuclear receptors. These receptors (RAR) are similar to other steroid hormone receptors in that they have a ligand binding domain and a DNA binding domain (3Zelent A. Krust A. Petkovich M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 339: 714-716Google Scholar, 4Krust A. Kastner P. Petkovich M. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5310-5314Google Scholar). Many genes are directly transcriptionally controlled by RA (5Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5527-5535Google Scholar, 6Kontani K. Nishina N.

Johnson A. Goldsmith L.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 225-232Google Scholar). Most of these genes share a common response element (RARE) in their 5′-flanking region consisting of a hexanucleotide direct repeat, usually separated by 5 base pairs. An additional class of retinoid receptors (RXRα, β, and γ), have been cloned (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Google Scholar). However, they are quite divergent from the RARs in the ligand binding domain and specifically bind 9-cis-RA (a naturally occurring metabolite of RA) but not all-trans-RA, whereas the RAR can specifically bind 9-cis-RA as well as all-trans-RA (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Google Scholar, 11Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Google Scholar). The RXRs form heterodimers with the RARs as well as several other receptors including thyroid hormone receptors and vitamin D3 receptors (12Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Suanders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Google Scholar, 13Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 446-449Google Scholar). The heterodimer form appears to be more efficient for gene activation by RA (14Yu V.C. Delsert C. Anderson B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Google Scholar). In addition to forming heterodimers, the RXR can under certain conditions form homodimers that bind to a hexanucleotide repeat separated by 1 or 2 base pairs (15Zhang X.-K. Lehman J.M. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Tran P. Pfhal M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Google Scholar). Also adding to the complexity of these retinoid receptors is the finding that different mRNAs can be produced due to alternate promoter usage and splicing (16Kastner P. Krust A. Menselsohn C. Garnier J.M. Zelent A. Leroy P. Staub A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2700-2704Google Scholar). retinoic acid RA receptor RA response element protein kinase C. Calcium is a second messenger that controls a wide variety of cellular functions. Its actions include the regulation of metabolic pathways, the synthesis and release of hormones, apoptosis, and mitosis (17Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 395-433Google Scholar). Because of its multiple actions there is a stringent requirement for the maintenance of cytosolic calcium by transport and storage proteins. Calreticulin fulfills some of these functions and is localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in a wide variety of cells (18Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Google Scholar, 19Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Google Scholar, 20Tharin S. Dziak E. Michalak M. Opas M.

By immunocytochemistry, calreticulin has also been localized to the nucleus (18Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Google Scholar), which has led to speculation that the protein may influence gene expression. This protein specifically binds to the synthetic peptide KLGFFKR (22Berg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Google Scholar), which is similar to the amino acid sequence in the DNA binding domain of the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors (23Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar, 24Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Google Scholar, 25Laudet V. Hanni C. Coll J. Catzeflis F. Stehelin D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1003-1013Google Scholar). Recently Burns et al. (26Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar) and Dedhar (27Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteljn C.-Y.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matuski R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar) showed that calreticulin inhibited the action of glucocorticoid receptors and androgen receptors, respectively. The amino-terminal region of calreticulin was shown to interact with the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and prevent its binding to glucocorticoid response elements (26Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar). Recombinant calreticulin also inhibited the binding of the androgen receptor to its hormone response element in a sequence specific manner and consequently inhibited ligand-stimulated transcription (27Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteljn C.-Y.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matuski R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that calreticulin inhibits the transcriptional activity of endogenous RARs in B16 melanoma cells, co-immunoprecipitates with RAR, and inhibits RAR DNA binding. Interference with receptor transcriptional activity is accompanied by inhibition of an RA inducible gene. We also show that calreticulin expression is modulated by cyclic AMP. Reagents were of the highest commercial grade available. PKCα monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Saranac Lake, NY); rabbit anti-human calreticulin polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Sontheimer (Department of Dermatology, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). B16-F1 melanoma cells were obtained from Dr. I. J. Fidler (M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Clinic, Houston, TX). Cells under passage 25 were grown as a monolayer in 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with sodium pyruvate and 1000 mg/liter glucose (Irvine Scientific, CA) containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories Inc., Logan, UT), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Routinely dishes were inoculated with 2 × 105 cells unless otherwise indicated. When the cells reached 60–70% confluence, they were treated with the appropriate agents. Cells were treated with retinoic acid (Fluka, NY) at a concentration of 10−5M in ethanol. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP (Sigma) was mixed with 1-methyl,3-isobutylxanthine (Sigma) and applied to cells at the final concentrations indicated in the text. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and applied to cells at a concentration of 1 µM. Control cells were treated with the corresponding amount of appropriate solvent. Full-length cDNA encoding calreticulin was kindly provided by Dr. Sontheimer (28McCauliffe D.P. Lux F.A. Lieu T.S. Sanz I. Hanke J. Newkirk M.M. Bachinski L.L. Itoh Y. Siciliano M.J. Reichlin M. Sontheimer R.D. Capra J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1379-1391Google Scholar) in a eucaryotic expression vector with an SV-40 promoter. The RARE (2×)-thymidine kinase-luciferase was obtained from Dr. Keiko Ozato (Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, NIH, Bethesda, MD). pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid and pSG5 plasmids were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The RAR-β12 cDNA clone was generated by restriction digestion of mouse RARβ1 (provided by Dr. Chambon, Strasbourg, France) cDNA with EcoRI, followed by ligation into pSG5, where its expression is under the control of an SV-40 promoter. The RAR-β12 cDNA lacks 41 amino acids of the COOH terminus. Different amounts of expression vector containing calreticulin cDNA were transfected in B16 mouse melanoma cells through the use of Transfectamin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting for the relative level of various proteins. Transient transfection assays using the luciferase reporter gene were carried out using the standard calcium phosphate method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was corrected by transfection of pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid. In reporter gene assays, the cells were split into 60-mm dishes 24 h after transfection and treated with RA for an additional 24 h before harvesting and determining luciferase activity via the commercial kit supplied by Promega. B16 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation in a microfuge. Cells were disrupted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation (5 min at 500 × g) and washed twice with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in extraction buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01 M monothioglycerol, 0.001 M Na2 EDTA, 0.001 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.6 M KCl, and 2 µg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), sonicated 3 × 10 s, incubated for 2–3 h at 4°C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a soluble nuclear extract. Two 33-base DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to form a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contained a retinoic acid response element corresponding to that found within the human RARβ gene promoter (30Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5398Google Scholar). This βRARE was labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by end-filling of the 5′ protruding termini with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The labeled βRARE was purified using a Qiagen Tip-20, precipitated with 10 mg of glycogen carrier in ethanol/acetone (1:3) at −80°C, and resuspended in dd H2O. Gel shift reactions typically contained B16 nuclear extract (25 µg) or Sf9 cell extracts from recombinant hRARα1 baculovirus-infected cells (1 µg), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 × reaction buffer (0.2 M HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6 M KCl, 0.01 M Na2EDTA, 0.1 M monothioglycerol, and 0.01 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 2.5 µg poly(dI-dC), and 2 × 104 cpm of [32P]βRARE in 20 ml of total volume. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 23–24°C and immediately resolved at 20 mA at 23°C in a 5% nondenaturing gel (60:1 acrylamide/bis) in 0.5 × TBE (0.045 M Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.001 M Na2EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to film between intensifying screens at −80°C. B16 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred on ice to a 15-ml centrifuge tube. Cells were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 200 ml of protein lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 µM NaF, 10 mM Na HPO4, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, 87 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were vortexed and sonicated at power setting 3.5 (Heat Systems Sonifier, NY) for 20 s. The cell lysate was transferred to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Protein was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin was used to construct a standard curve. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then electrophoretically transferred onto nylon membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Corp.) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). The nylon membrane was incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times with TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 5 min each at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with the appropriate antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was washed as described above and further incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Molecular mass standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were phosphorylase b (135,000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (85,000 kDa), ovalbumin (50,000 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (39,000 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (27,000 kDa), and lysozyme (17,000 kDa). RARβ and calreticulin proteins were synthesized in vitro from full-length cDNAs cloned into a vector containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter through the use of the transcription- and translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Co-immunoprecipitation was used to show physical interaction between RARβ and calreticulin. In vitro synthesized [35S]methionine labeled RARβ and calreticulin as well as unlabeled RARβ expressed in SF9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus and purified calreticulin were used for these studies. 5 µl of [35S]methionine-labeled RARβ or calreticulin and 1 µl of purified unlabeled calreticulin or 2 µl of unlabeled SF-9 produced RARβ were mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. At this time 500 µl of NET buffer (0.14 M NaCl, 50 µM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) was added to the tubes. To this mixture was aded 2 µl of calreticulin polyclonal antibody or 2 µl of RARγ IIIB polyclonal antibody, and the tubes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. 50 µl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added to the antibody-antigen complex, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for an additional 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation in a microfuge, and the pellet was washed three times in NET buffer. 50 µl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the pellet, the samples were treated at 100°C for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrohporesis, the gel was treated for fluorography and dried, and signals were visualized by autoradiography. Because calreticulin has been reported to inhibit the function of steroid receptors (26Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar, 27Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteljn C.-Y.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matuski R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar), we determined whether overexpression of this gene in B16 melanoma cells would interfere with RA-dependent expression of a reporter gene containing the β-RARE. B16 cells transfected with a thymidine kinase-luciferase plasmid containing a synthetic β-RARE showed strong stimulation of luciferase activity by RA (Fig. 1). Co-transfection of different amounts of a calreticulin expression plasmid resulted in approximately 70% inhibition of RA-induced luciferase activity at 5 µg of the calreticulin expression plasmid (Fig. 1). This result suggests that calreticulin can inhibit the expression or function of the endogenous RAR. Because it has been reported that calreticulin can inhibit steroid receptor activity by binding to a region within the DNA binding domain, we determined whether purified calreticulin would interfere with the ability of endogenous B16 RAR to bind to a β-RARE oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). Nuclear extracts from B16 cells contain a protein that specifically binds to the β-RARE oligonucleotide. This protein corresponds to RARs as judged by both co-migration with a band corresponding to authentic RARα from recombinant Baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and by a supershift induced by incubation of the extracts with an polyclonal antibody that cross-reacts with all RAR subtypes (31Quick T.C. Traish A.M. Niles R.M. Receptor. 1994; 4: 65-80Google Scholar). The addition of purified calreticulin at a concentration of 2.0 µg to nuclear extract from B16 cells decreased binding compared with control cells. Interestingly, the addition of an antibody to calreticulin reversed the inhibition of binding in the presence of 2 µg of purified calreticulin. The top band in this lane is due to nonspecific binding of the calreticulin antibody. In order to investigate the mechanism by which calreticulin may inhibit RAR binding to DNA, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. The data in Fig. 3 show that antibody to RAR can co-immunoprecipitate radiolabeled calreticulin when the two proteins are incubated prior to antibody addition. Likewise, antibody to calreticulin can co-immunoprecipitate radiolabeled RAR. Normal rabbit serum did not immunoprecipitate either protein, whereas incubation of RAR antibodies with only radiolabeled calreticulin or calreticulin antibody with only radiolabeled RAR did not result in immunoprecipitation of the radioactive protein. Treatment of B16 melanoma cells with RA results in a time-dependent increase in PKCα (Fig. 4, A and B) protein. Because calreticulin decreased RA-dependent reporter gene expression, we tested its ability to inhibit the induction of this marker of RA-induced differentiation described above. Using the Lipofectin reagent we were able to routinely transfect up to 65% of the B16 cells (data not shown); therefore we used this procedure to transiently express the calreticulin gene. Fig. 5 shows that in cells transfected with the carrier plasmid, RA still induces a 6–9-fold increase in PKCα protein. However, transfection of B16 cells with the plasmid containing the calreticulin gene results in a greater than 70% decrease in the induction of PKCα. As a positive control we also transfected cells with RARβ12, a dominant/negative receptor that we have found to inhibit the function of RARα, β, and γ (data not shown). Expression of this dominant/negative receptor also inhibited the induction of PKCα by 70%. The decrease in RA induction of PKCα was proportional to the amount of transfected calreticulin cDNA (Fig. 5, C and D).Fig. 5Transfection of the gene for calreticulin inhibits the RA induction of PKCα. Calreticulin and dominant/negative RARβ12 cDNAs were transfected into B16 cells by the lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following day the cells were treated with RA (10 µM) for 24 h, and then the cells were harvested, and a total cell extract was prepared. 25 µg of protein from the extracts was analyzed for the amount of PKCα by Western blotting. A, autoradiogram of Western blot analysis for PKCα. The arrow indicates the 80,000 MW PKCα protein. Lanes labeled Ctrl were transfected with carrier plasmid not containing the calreticulin gene and were not treated with RA. Lanes labeled RA represent two separate experiments in which cells were transfected with carrier plasmid not containing calreticulin and then treated with 10 µM RA.

Xiao, D. Desai, T. Quick, and R. M. Niles, J. Cell Physiol., in press. We investigated whether cyclic AMP could be achieving some of its effect by increasing calreticulin levels. B16 cells were treated for increasing times with RA, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, or a combination of these compounds (Fig. 6). The amount of calreticulin, as determined by immunoblotting, in control cells increased at 48 h of incubation and then remained constant. RA induced a modest increase in calreticulin at 24 and 48 h but not at 72 h of treatment. 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP increased the amount of calreticulin at every time point examined. The greatest degree of stimulation was 9-fold at 24 h of treatment. There was no consistent pattern of change in calreticulin levels when both agents were incubated with the cells, although in all cases the level was higher than in control cells. The increase in calreticulin was dependent on the concentration of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, with 0.5 mM inducing a 4.2-fold increase in the amount of this protein (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Concentration-dependent effect of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP on the expression of calreticulin protein in B16 melanoma cells. B16 cells were seeded and treated with the indicated concentrations of 8-bromo-cyclic AMP for 48 h.

These cells express RARα and γ constitutively, and RARβ expression is induced by RA.2 Therefore, it is likely that all of these endogenous receptors are affected by calreticulin. We did not definitely prove the mechanism of action of calreticulin in inhibiting RA-dependent reporter gene expression in B16 cells, but the gel shift and co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that inhibition of RAR binding to RARE is a likely explanation. This conclusion would agree with the proposed mechanism for calreticulin action on steroid hormone receptor, i.e., binding to a region in the zinc fingers and thus inhibiting receptor binding to the hormone response element (26Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of calreticulin also decreased the induction of PKCα by RA. The endogenous RAR are involved in mediating the action of RA on the expression of these genes because a dominant/negative RAR (RARβ12) also blocks the RA induction of these genes. Thus it is likely that calreticulin inhibits RA induction of PKCα expression by inhibiting RAR function. The only other report on calreticulin and RA-RAR action is that of Dedhar et al. (27Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Hagesteljn C.-Y.L. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matuski R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar), who established stable transfectants of teratocarcinoma cells expressing sense or antisense calreticulin cDNA. Analysis of these stable transfectants showed that expression of sense calreticulin cDNA inhibited RA-induced differentiation of these cells, whereas expression of antisense calreticulin cDNA enhanced RA-induced differentiation. Previously we had observed that cyclic AMP antagonized RA function in B16 melanoma cells (32Niles R.M. Loewy B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 176-181Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we tested the hypothesis that cyclic AMP might elicit some of its effect by increasing calreticulin expression. Our experiments showed that cyclic AMP increased the amount of calreticulin protein by 9-fold within 24 h of treatment. RA also induced a modest increase at 24 and 48 h of treatment. Calreticulin expression was previously studied in B16 cells where it was referred to as B50 (33Gersten D.M. Bijwaard K.L. Law L.W. Hearing V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 20-25Google Scholar). It was suggested that the expression of this protein could be associated with the proliferation of the melanoma cells. Because we have found that calreticulin can inhibit RA-RAR function and RA induces growth inhibition and differentiation in B16 melanoma, high levels of calreticulin should theoretically enhance growth. Expression of calreticulin in L6 myoblasts has been investigated by Opas et al. (18Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Google Scholar). They found that Ca2+ shock, inhibition of calmodulin, and activation of protein kinase C had no profound effect on calreticulin expression as measured by immunocytochemical techniques. Inhibition of protein kinase C with H-7 resulted in a small decrease in calreticulin, whereas differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes was accompanied by a large decrease in calreticulin staining in myotubes. Recent studies using a reporter gene under the control of calreticulin's promoter indicate that expression of calreticulin is significantly affected by changes in intracellular Ca2+. 3Weser and M. Michalak, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, infection of mammalian cells with bovine papillomavirus type I results in a significant induction of calreticulin, with the 3′ end of the early region of the virus being responsible for this induction (34O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Settleman J. Young D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3427-3434Google Scholar). The studies described in this report appear to be the first discovery of hormonal up-regulation of calreticulin expression. We previously found that 8-bromo-cyclic AMP inhibited the RA induction of PKCα.2 Part of this decrease could be explained by the ability of cyclic AMP to inhibit the expression of the RARs. However, because cyclic AMP increases the amount of calreticulin, this pathway may also contribute to the inhibition of RA-regulated gene expression. Indeed we observed that although cyclic AMP decreased RAR mRNA expression, nuclear extracts from treated cells had an even greater decrease in protein binding to a consensus RARE in gel shift assays. This result might have been due to an increase in calreticulin, which bound to the endogenous RARs and prevented them from interacting with the DNA response element. In summary we have found that calreticulin can negatively regulate RAR function in B16 melanoma cells. We further showed that B16 cells express calreticulin and that its levels can be increased by cyclic AMP. This provides a means by which hormones working through the cyclic AMP signal transduction system can regulate a cell's response to retinoids. Because retinoids play an important role in regulating growth and differentiation (10De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Google Scholar), inappropriate expression of the calreticulin gene either directly through mutation, translocation, etc., or indirectly through the cyclic AMP pathway could have deleterious consequences for the cell.

However, the molecular and biochemical mechanism by which MASH1 acts to determine neurogenesis are still unknown. The myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) is a MADS transcription factor that is essential for the specification and differentiation of the muscle lineage. Here we show that MEF2A and MASH1 are coordinately induced during the differentiation of the teratocarcinoma cell line P19 along a neuronal lineage and that in transient transfection assays, MEF2A and MASH1 cooperatively activate gene expression. This cooperativity appears to be due to a specific physical interaction between MEF2A and MASH1. Taken together, these findings suggest that MASH1 via a cooperative interaction with MEF2A may regulate the expression of specific genes that are critical for neuronal differentiation.

The transcriptional activity of the human HDC promoter was stimulated 3–4-fold by gastrin and 13-fold by PMA, effects that could be blocked by down-regulation or antagonism of protein kinase C. 5′- and 3′-deletion analysis demonstrated that the sequence responsible for gastrin- and PMA-stimulated transactivation (gastrin response element (GAS-RE)) was located in a region (+2 to +24) downstream of the transcriptional start site (+1) in the human HDC promoter and contained a palindrome (5′-AA-3′). When ligated upstream of the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase promoter, a single copy of the GAS-RE was sufficient to confer responsiveness to gastrin and PMA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with specific competitors and factor-specific antibody supershifts showed that the labeled GAS-RE bound a novel nuclear factor(s). In addition, both gastrin and PMA increased binding of this factor to the GAS-RE. Hence, the palindromic GAS-RE site is sufficient to explain the gastrin/PMA responsiveness of the human HDC promoter and appears to bind a novel transcription factor.

To study the mechanism underlying the phenomenon, we have investigated 45Ca2+ uptake by HL-60 cell homogenates. The initial rate of Ca2+ uptake as well as the final amount of stored Ca2+ were a function of the extravesicular Ca2+ concentration. However, Ca2+ uptake stopped independently of the extravesicular Ca2+ concentration after approximately 10 min. Studies using Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors demonstrated that the transient nature of the net uptake was not due to Ca2+ efflux. Monovalent cation ionophores did not influence the Ca2+ uptake curves, excluding a relevant involvement of pH and membrane potential. Together with the observation of a continued Ca2+ uptake in the presence of the intralumenal Ca2+ chelator oxalate, these results strongly suggest a feedback inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ load of intracellular stores. The concentration-inhibition relationship between the Ca2+ load and the rate of Ca2+ uptake was highly supralinear (slope factor ≥ 4). IC50 and maximum of the dose-inhibition curve, but not the slope factor were a function of the extravesicular free Ca2+ concentration. A series of three logistic equations derived from our data allowed an appropriate description of the behavior of Ca2+ uptake. Our results suggest, in addition to its well known activation by cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, a highly supralinear feedback inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ load of intracellular stores.

https://openalex.org/W2011180478,"Steroid and thyroid hormone receptors exhibit striking structural and functional similarity, suggesting that these nuclear receptors may enhance transcription of target genes by similar mechanisms. To address this issue, we studied transcriptional interference between progesterone and thyroid hormone receptors in vivo and in vitro. We observed that transcriptional interference occurred in a ligand-dependent manner between progesterone receptor-B (PR-B) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) α or β in transient transfection experiments. Ligand-occupied TRα or TRβ, but not the unliganded receptor, strongly suppressed transactivation of a progesterone-responsive reporter gene by endogenous PRs in human breast carcinoma T47D cells. Ligand-dependent inhibitory cross-talk also occurred between transfected PR-B and TRα or TRβ and vice versa in CV1 cells. This phenomenon did not require DNA binding by the “interfering” receptor but required it to be hormone-bound, indicating that a transcriptionally active form of the interfering receptor is essential for the interfering effect. To analyze further the mechanism of the ligand-dependent cross-talk, we reproduced transcriptional interference between PR and TR in a cell-free transcription system. We observed that the addition of triiodothyronine-bound recombinant TRβ or a ligand binding domain (LBD) peptide (145–456) inhibited specifically transcriptional activation of a progesterone-responsive gene by endogenous PRs in nuclear extracts of T47D cells, while the basal level of transcription from a minimal TATA-promoter or transcription from an adenovirus major-late promoter remained unaffected. These results indicated that a transactivation function within the LBD of the interfering receptor TRβ was likely to interact with a mediator protein(s), termed coactivator, that is distinct from basal transcription factors and is critical for efficient PR-induced transactivation. This concept was reinforced by biochemical evidence that treatment of T47D extracts with immobilized TRβ LBD depleted the extract of the coactivator function in a triiodothyronine-dependent manner and markedly impaired progesterone-induced transactivation of progesterone response element-linked genes. Deletion of six amino acids (451–456) in the extreme COOH terminus of TRβ resulted in a receptor that retained the ability to bind thyroid hormone but failed to inhibit progesterone-dependent transcription. Interestingly, these six amino acids are present in a region that is highly conserved among various nuclear hormone receptors and contains a ligand-dependent transactivation function, AF-2. Based on these results, we propose that a limiting coactivator protein(s) interacts with the AF-2 of PR or TR and mediates transactivation by the ligand-bound receptor. This regulatory molecule(s) may therefore serve as a common functional link between the pathways of hormone-inducible gene activation by various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.

We have used a mRNA differential display method to identify FGF-1-inducible genes in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Here, we report that one of these genes, FGF-regulated (FR)-19, is predicted to encode a member of the transcriptional enhancer factor (TEF)-1 family of structurally related DNA-binding proteins. Specifically, the deduced FR-19 amino acid sequence has ~89, 77, and 68% overall identity to chicken TEF-1A, mouse TEF-1, and mouse embryonic TEA domain-containing factor, respectively. Gel mobility shift experiments indicate that FR-19, like TEF-1, can bind the GT-IIC motif found in the SV40 enhancer. The FR-19 gene maps in the distal region of mouse chromosome 6, and analysis of several FR-19 cDNA clones indicates that at least two FR-19 isoforms may be expressed from this locus. FGF-1 induction of FR-19 mRNA expression in mouse fibroblasts is first detectable at 4 h after FGF-1 addition and is dependent on de novo RNA and protein synthesis. FGF-2, calf serum, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can also induce FR-19 mRNA levels. We have also found that FR-19 mRNA expression increases during mouse C2C12 myoblast differentiation in vitro. The FR-19 gene is expressed in vivo in a tissue-specific manner, with a relatively high level detected in lung.

In this paper, we report that the murine FR-19 gene is a mitogen-inducible delayed-early response gene predicted to encode a TEF-1-related transcription factor. TEF-1 family members contain a highly conserved DNA-binding motif, the TEA domain (35Burglin T.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The first TEA domain-containing protein identified, human TEF-1, was initially described as a HeLa cell transcriptional activator which could bind the GT-IIC and Sph enhansons of the SV40 enhancer (36Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.-M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 37Hwang J.-J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown to be involved in transactivation of the SV40 late promoter by large T antigen (38Gruda M.C.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that chicken (40Stewart A.F.R. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (41Shimizu N. Smith G. Izumo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) TEF-1 can bind the M-CAT element, suggesting that these proteins may be involved in cardiac- and skeletal muscle-specific gene regulation. The function of FR-19 is presently unknown; however, our results indicate it may play a role in both mammalian cell growth and differentiation. After the original submission of this manuscript, Yockey et al. (42Yockey C.E. Smith G. Izumo S. Shimizu N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3727-3736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported the cDNA cloning and characterization of this same gene product, which they have named TEFR1. Murine NIH 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained, expanded, and serum-starved as described (32Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells were then treated for various lengths of time with either 10 ng/ml FGF-1 (gift of W. Burgess, American Red Cross) in combination with 5 units/ml heparin (Upjohn), 10 ng/ml FGF-2 (Bachem), 10% calf serum, 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (Genzyme), 20 ng/ml EGF (Genzyme), 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), 20 ng/ml IGF-1 (Bachem), or 30 ng/ml PMA (Sigma). In some experiments, cells were treated with 2 µg/ml actinomycin D (Calbiochem) or 10 µg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Murine C2C12 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Mediatech), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), and a 1:100 dilution of an antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Mediatech). Cells were fed every 48 h and expanded by trypsin-EDTA treatment and subculturing at a split ratio of 1:5. To induce differentiation into multinucleated myotubes, C2C12 cells were grown to ~75% confluence and then the growth medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 2.5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) instead of 10% fetal bovine serum. RNA was isolated from cultured cells or mouse tissues as described (32Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. RNA samples (10 µg) were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of intact rRNA and then photographed. RNA was transferred onto Zetabind nylon membranes (Cuno, Inc.) by electroblotting and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). The cDNA probes were as follows: (i) mouse FR-19, 1.4-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment of pBluescript/FR-19; (ii) human myogenin, 1.2-kb EcoRI fragment of Myf-4 (American Type Culture Collection); (iii) human muscle creatine kinase, 1.2-kb HindIII/BamHI fragment of pJN2CK-M (American Type Culture Collection); and (iv) human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.8-kb PstI/XbaI fragment of pHcGAP (American Type Culture Collection). They were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) using a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were prehybridized (~2 h) and hybridized (~18 h) at 65°C in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M EDTA, 0.5 M NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 6.7% SDS, 50 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 20% formamide. They were then washed at the same temperature first in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 5% SDS (2 times, 15 min each); then in 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 1% SDS (2 times, 15 min each); and finally in 0.2 mM EDTA, 36 mM NaCl, 2 mM NaHPO4 (pH 7.2) (2 times, 15 min each). Blots were then air-dried and exposed to film (XAR-5; Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at −80°C. An FR-19B cDNA fragment was initially isolated using an RT-PCR-based approach. RNA (1 µg) isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated cells was converted to cDNA, and PCR was performed using sense SH2 domain and antisense leucine zipper domain primers as described (31Hsu D.K.W. Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Winkles J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each amplification mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. φX174/HaeIII restriction fragments (Clontech Laboratories) were used as size standards. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining and a ~750-bp DNA fragment, termed FR-19, was excised, recovered using the freeze-squeeze method (43Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), reamplified, and ligated into the cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen Corp.). The FR-19A cDNA fragment was also isolated using RT-PCR. RNA (1 µg) isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated cells was converted to cDNA and PCR was performed as described, except that only 30 cycles of amplification were used (44Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2408-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The FR-19B primers were 5′-GACAAGCCCATCGACAATGATGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCACTGTAGCTTGGGCTTGAC-3′ (antisense). Primers specific for FGFR-1, described previously (44Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2408-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), were used as a control to demonstrate that equivalent amounts of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis. An aliquot of each amplification mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The predicted 553-bp fragment and an additional 682-bp DNA fragment (representing an FR-19A cDNA) were recovered, reamplified, and cloned as described above. The relative abundance of the FR-19A and FR-19B mRNA splice variants in C2C12 cells was determined by RT-PCR using this same pair of primers and identical PCR conditions. A mouse Balb/c 3T3 cell cDNA library (gift of T. Lanahan, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) was screened with the PCR-derived FR-19B DNA fragment to obtain longer cDNA clones. The DNA fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described above for the Northern blot hybridization probes. Approximately 2 × 105 phage were plated at a density of 2 × 10 4 plaque-forming units/150-mm dish using Escherichia coli C600 Hfl as host. Duplicate plaque lifts (Colony/Plaque screen, DuPont) were prehybridized, hybridized, washed, and exposed to film as described for Northern blots. Five positive phages were purified by one additional round of screening. PCR assays using oligonucleotide primers to the T7 and T3 promoters flanking the Uni-ZAP XR vector cloning site were performed to estimate the sizes of the various cDNA inserts. The phage clone with the largest insert was purified by one additional round of screening and amplified on E. coli C600 Hfl cells. Plasmid was excised from the phage clone using XL-1 Blue cells and R408 helper phage (Stratagene) as described (45Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment predicted to encode the amino-terminal region of FR-19 was isolated using the 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (Clontech Laboratories). Total RNA (10 µg) isolated from FGF-1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells (4 h of treatment) and the antisense primer 5′-ACCTGGATGTGGCTGGAGACCTGCTT-3′ were used in the cDNA synthesis step. PCR amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA products were then subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Several DNA fragments were recovered, reamplified, and cloned as described above for RT-PCR amplification products. Plasmid DNA was purified using a Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega Corp.) and both strands of the entire ~1.4-kb FR-19B cDNA clone were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Both strands of the RT-PCR-derived FR-19A and FR-19B cDNAs, as well as the FR-19B cDNA fragment isolated by the 5′-RACE technique, were also completely sequenced. Since these were PCR-generated DNA fragments that could have misincorporated nucleotides, sequencing was performed on plasmid DNA isolated from several different bacterial colonies. Sequencing was either done automatically using an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer or manually using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). The nucleic acid and deduced protein sequences were compared to sequences in the data base server at the National Center for Biotechnology using the Blast network service (46Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (66992) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were aligned using the University of Wisconsin GCG package. A BamHI-KpnI fragment of FR-19B cDNA encoding the entire protein except for the first five amino acids was ligated in-frame into the pRSET-B procaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). FR-19B mRNA was then transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The in vitro translation products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The gel was dried and proteins visualized by autoradiography. Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (47Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1989: 12.2.1Google Scholar) using in vitro translated protein and the oligonucleotides described by Yasunami et al. (48Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the double-stranded wild-type GT-IIC oligonucleotide was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) by filling in with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (Boehringer Mannheim). Five µl of each in vitro translation reaction was used in a binding reaction containing gel shift buffer (12% glycerol, 12 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT), 83 µg/ml poly(dI-dC), 333 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and ~4 × 105 cpm (~5 ng) of wild-type GT-IIC oligonucleotide. In some cases, 5 or 50 ng of cold competitor oligonucleotide, either wild-type or mutant (48Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were added. DNA binding reactions were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. Upon addition of the probe, the reactions were incubated for another 10 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis using a 4% polyacrylamide gel and 1 × Tris-glycine buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 38 mM glycine, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.5)). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80°C with intensifying screens. Interspecific backcross progeny were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males as described (49Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the Fr19 locus (see text for details). DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer, and hybridization were performed essentially as described (50Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were prepared with Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham). The ~1.4-kb FR-19 cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) using a nick translation labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim); washing was done to a final stringency of 0.8 × SSCP, 0.1% SDS, 65°C. A major fragment of 11.0-kb was detected in EcoRI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and major fragments of 13.0- and 8.2-kb were detected in EcoRI-digested M. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the 13.0- and 8.2-kb EcoRI M. spretus-specific fragments, which cosegregated, was followed in backcross mice. A description of the probes and restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the loci linked to Fr19 including glucose transporter-3 (Glut3), FGF-6 (Fgf6), and Kirsten rat sarcoma oncogene-2 (Kras2) has been reported previously (51Foroni L. Boehm T. White L. Forster A. Sherrington P. Liao X.B. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recombination distances were calculated as described (52Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981: 77Crossref Google Scholar) using the computer program SPRETUS MADNESS. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. We have been attempting to identify FGF-1-inducible genes that encode particular classes of proteins using a targeted differential display technique (30Winkles J.A. Donohue P.J. Hsu D.K.W. Guo Y.

Briefly, in these experiments, RNA isolated from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells is converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers. PCR is then performed using degenerate oligonucleotide primers, and the products are displayed on agarose gels. A pair of primers designed to anneal to DNA sequences encoding proteins with both an SH2 and a leucine zipper structural domain were used in the present study. Amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and detected by ultraviolet illumination. The pattern of amplified cDNAs obtained using RNA from serum-starved or FGF-1-stimulated cells (for 2 or 12 h) was similar, except for an ~750-bp DNA fragment presen"
https://openalex.org/W1482358181,"Serum amyloid P (SAP), a member of the evolutionarily conserved pentraxin family, is a normal component of a number of basement membranes, including glomerular and alveolar. In vitro SAP binds to a variety of proteins including fibronectin, proteoglycans, and the collagen-like region of the complement component C1q. In these studies, binding of SAP to type IV collagen, a major component of basement membrane, was examined. Purified SAP binds to human and mouse type IV collagen but not type I, II, or III collagens. Binding of SAP to type IV collagen is dependent on the presence of Ca2+. This binding is saturable with a Kd≈ 1.2 × 10−7M based on solid phase binding and 4 × 10−8M based on the IC50 value from fluid phase binding data. Binding of SAP to type IV collagen was inhibited by both SAP and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, a 5-fold molar excess of CRP as compared with SAP was required to inhibit the SAP binding by 50%. Binding of SAP to type IV collagen was inhibited by both collagen IV and C1q but not by phosphatidylethanolamine or bovine serum albumin. The inhibition data indicate that SAP may bind to the triple helical region of type IV collagen via a site distinct from its galactan binding site. The most likely site of SAP involved in its interaction with type IV collagen may be the region spanning amino acid residues 108–120, which shows a great deal of sequence homology (60% strict identity) with the CRP region implicated in its binding to the collagen-like region of the C1q molecule.

INTRODUCTIONSerum amyloid P (SAP) 1The abbreviations used are: SAPserum amyloid PECMextracellular matrixBSAbovine serum albuminCRPC-reactive proteinTBSTris-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is a 10-subunit (two flat pentameric discs stacked face to face) Mr≈ 230,000 glycoprotein coded by a single gene on human and mouse chromosome 1 (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Google Scholar, 2Mantzouranis E.C. Dowton S.B. Whitehead A.S. Edge M.D. Bruns G.A. Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7752-7756Google Scholar). It is a member of the evolutionarily conserved pentraxin family (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Google Scholar). These are proteins that are made up of five identical non-covalently bound subunits arranged in a flat pentameric disc (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Google Scholar, 3Coe J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 730-733Google Scholar). In vitro SAP binds to proteoglycans and fibronectin in a specific Ca2+-dependent manner (4Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1456-1460Google Scholar, 5DeBeer F.C. Baltz M.L. Holford S. Feinstein A. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1134-1139Google Scholar, 6Tseng J. Mortensen R.F. Immunol. Invest. 1986; 15: 749-761Google Scholar). Furthermore, SAP binds to the collagen-like region of complement component C1q (7Ying S.C. Gewurz A.T. Jiang H. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 169-176Google Scholar). SAP is a normal component of a group of basement membranes including glomerular and alveolar basement membranes (8Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Google Scholar, 9Al Mutlaq H. Wheeler J. Robertson H. Watchorn C. Morley A.R. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Google Scholar). It comprises approximately 10% of the protein released from glomerular basement membrane after collagenase treatment (8Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Google Scholar). Association of SAP with glomerular basement membranes is completely disrupted or disturbed in a number of nephritides such as Alport's syndrome (10Melvin T. Kim Y. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 460-464Google Scholar), membranous glomerulonephritis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (11Dyck R.F. Evans D.J. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Turner D. Pepys M.B. Lancet. 1980; ii: 606-609Google Scholar).Basement membranes are multicomponent structures that perform a variety of functions. They are involved in maintenance of the differentiated state and basal and apical polarity of the cells as well as maintenance of the organ structure and filtration functions (12Paulsson M. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 443-461Google Scholar, 13Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 29: 110-112Google Scholar). A number of factors affect the structure and function of basement membranes (e.g. the relative concentration of each component and the affinity of the interaction between components as well as their structure) (14Timpl R.

It is therefore possible that SAP, via its interaction with various components of the extracellular matrix, modifies the structure and function of the basement membranes with which it is associated. In the present study, the binding of SAP to type IV collagen was examined. The data indicate that SAP binding to type IV collagen is Ca2+-dependent, specific and saturable with a Kd≈ 1.2 × 10−7M for immobilized and a Kd≈ 4 × 10−8M (based on the IC50 value of the soluble phase binding assay) for soluble type IV collagen. Furthermore, SAP probably binds via its C1q binding region to the triple helical region of type IV collagen. The interaction of SAP with type IV collagen and other components of the basement membrane may affect the structure of the basement membranes, thereby affecting their function.DISCUSSIONSAP is a component of a number of basement membranes including alveolar, glomerular, and sweat gland basement membranes (8Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Google Scholar, 9Al Mutlaq H. Wheeler J. Robertson H. Watchorn C. Morley A.R. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Google Scholar). The disposition of SAP in the glomerular basement membrane is disrupted or altered in a number of nephritides such as Alport's syndrome (10Melvin T. Kim Y. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 460-464Google Scholar), membranous glomerulonephritis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (11Dyck R.F. Evans D.J. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Turner D. Pepys M.B. Lancet. 1980; ii: 606-609Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SAP binds to fibronectin and proteoglycans such as heparan and dermatan sulfates in vitro (4Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1456-1460Google Scholar, 5DeBeer F.C. Baltz M.L. Holford S. Feinstein A. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1134-1139Google Scholar, 6Tseng J. Mortensen R.F. Immunol. Invest. 1986; 15: 749-761Google Scholar). SAP also binds to C1q via its collagen-like region in vitro (7Ying S.C. Gewurz A.T. Jiang H. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 169-176Google Scholar). Based on the in vivo association of SAP with specific basement membranes, its in vitro binding to proteoglycans, and its interaction with the collagen-like region of the C1q molecule, experiments were conducted to characterize the interaction of SAP with the basement membrane-derived type IV collagen. The data indicate that SAP binding to type IV collagen is Ca2+-dependent and saturable with a Kd≈ 1.2 × 10−7M in the solid phase and 4 × 10−8M (based on the IC50 value obtained in reversible soluble phase binding assay) in the soluble phase. These differences in binding may be due to different conformations assumed by immobilized versus fluid phase collagen. They may also reflect complex molecular interactions in liquid and solid phase as indicated by non-linear Scatchard data. These interactions may include binding of SAP to immobilized collagen or to soluble type IV collagen molecules that may be followed by either binding of the SAP component of the SAP-type IV collagen complex to immobilized type IV collagen or binding of the type IV collagen component of the complex to immobilized collagen. Inhibition studies indicate that SAP binds to the triple helical region of type IV collagen, probably via the region involved in its binding to C1q (amino acid residues 108–120 based on studies examining the CRP region involved in its binding to C1q). Furthermore, the triple helical region motif (Gly-X-TYr) is not the only requirement for this binding since SAP does not bind to collagens I, II, and III.The significance of the binding of SAP to type IV collagen and other components of the basement membrane is not yet understood. The ability of SAP to bind to type IV collagen as well as other ECM components suggests that it may facilitate the formation of the matrix or stabilize this matrix by bridging its components. Type IV collagen binds to a variety of other molecules via its triple helical region (30Tsilibary E.C. Koliakos G.G. Charonis A.S. Vogel A.M. Reger L.A. Furcht L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19112-19118Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that type IV collagen polymerizes to form a lattice via several interactions. These include head to head interactions of non-collagenous domains with one another (dimerization) as well as interaction of the amino-terminal 7 S domains (tetramerization) (27Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Google Scholar). Self-assembly of type IV collagen can also proceed laterally via its triple helical regions or via binding of the non-collagenous domain to the triple helical region of another molecule to form multimers (27Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Google Scholar, 29Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2478-2483Google Scholar). Studies examining the interaction of laminin and heparin with type IV collagen demonstrated that both molecules show significant binding to the triple helical region of type IV collagen (28Charonis A.S. Tsilibary E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1848-1853Google Scholar, 30Tsilibary E.C. Koliakos G.G. Charonis A.S. Vogel A.M. Reger L.A. Furcht L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19112-19118Google Scholar). Since SAP binding to type IV collagen is most likely via type IV collagen's triple helical region, it may modify the assembly of type IV collagen or its interaction with proteoglycans and laminin and alter the structure of the basement membrane and its function.Crystallographic studies of the SAP molecule indicate that it is a very compact and highly structured protein (31Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Google Scholar, 32Kinoshita C.M. Gewurz A.T. Siegel J.N. Ying S.-C. Hugli T.E. Coe J.E. Gupta R.K. Huckman R. Gewurz H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 700-709Google Scholar). Probably due to its highly ordered and compact structure, the SAP molecule is resistant to proteolysis (31Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Google Scholar, 32Kinoshita C.M. Gewurz A.T. Siegel J.N. Ying S.-C. Hugli T.E. Coe J.E. Gupta R.K. Huckman R. Gewurz H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 700-709Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that SAP binds to a number of proteins and protects them from proteolytic digestion (25Tennent G.A. Lovat L.B. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4299-4303Google Scholar). For example, SAP binds to Alzheimer's β-amyloid peptide and amyloid A fibrils and protects them from proteolysis by enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Pronase (25Tennent G.A. Lovat L.B. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4299-4303Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SAP may act by binding to components of the ECM and protect them from digestion by extracellular matrix proteases and by altering the turnover rate and the structure of the basement membrane, thereby affecting its function.Although the role of SAP in the structure and function of the basement membranes with which it is associated is not clear, it has been shown that in a variety of nephritides its association with the glomerular basement membrane is altered. It is possible that SAP via its interaction with type IV collagen and other ECM components may alter the assembly and function of the basement membrane. The absence of SAP or its altered disposition in the basement membrane, probably as a secondary defect to the initial injury, could lead to further changes in basement membrane assembly or turnover. This may partially account for basement membrane abnormalities observed in certain nephritides. The role of SAP in basement membrane structure and function is not clear; however, previous studies and the data presented here indicate that further studies of the effect of SAP on the assembly of ECM components and of the ability of SAP to protect ECM components against extracellular matrix proteases may be important and may help to clarify the biological significance of SAP and its potential role as a structural protein.

Colten H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7752-7756Google Scholar). It is a member of the evolutionarily conserved pentraxin family (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 739-743Google Scholar). These are proteins that are made up of five identical non-covalently bound subunits arranged in a flat pentameric disc (1Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R.H. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc.

In vitro SAP binds to proteoglycans and fibronectin in a specific Ca2+-dependent manner (4Hamazaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1456-1460Google Scholar, 5DeBeer F.C. Baltz M.L. Holford S.

Furthermore, SAP binds to the collagen-like region of complement component C1q (7Ying S.C. Gewurz A.T. Jiang H. Gewurz H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 169-176Google Scholar). SAP is a normal component of a group of basement membranes including glomerular and alveolar basement membranes (8Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Google Scholar, 9Al Mutlaq H. Wheeler J. Robertson H. Watchorn C. Morley A.R. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 219-227Google Scholar). It comprises approximately 10% of the protein released from glomerular basement membrane after collagenase treatment (8Dyck R.F. Lockwood C.M. Kershaw M. McHugh N. Duance V.C. Baltz M.L. Pepys M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1162-1174Google Scholar). Association of SAP with glomerular basement membranes is completely disrupted or disturbed in a number of nephritides such as Alport's syndrome (10Melvin T. Kim Y. Michael A.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 460-464Google Scholar), membranous glomerulonephritis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (11Dyck R.F. Evans D.J. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Turner D. Pepys M.B. Lancet. 1980; ii: 606-609Google Scholar).Basement membranes are multicomponent structures that perform a variety of functions. They are involved in maintenance of the differentiated state and basal and apical polarity of the cells as well as maintenance of the organ structure and filtration functions (12Paulsson M. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 443-461Google Scholar, 13Timpl R. Dziadek M. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1986; 29: 110-112Google Scholar). A number of factors affect the structure and function of basement membranes (e.g. the relative concentration of each component and the affinity of the interaction between components as well as their structure) (14Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Google Scholar, 15Schittny J.C. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1599-1619Google Scholar, 16Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Hassell J.R. Star V.L. Cannon F.B.

https://openalex.org/W2012276401,"Two functional genes encoding phosphoglycerate kinase are differentially expressed during spermatogenesis in the mouse. Expression of the X-linked Pgk-1 gene is repressed coincident with X chromosome inactivation during prophase of meiosis I. At this same stage, expression of the autosomal Pgk-2 gene is initiated by tissue-specific mechanisms. To investigate the role of chromatin structure in these processes, we have examined the appearance and disappearance of DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites in each gene, and correlated this with transcriptional activity as measured by nuclear run-off analysis at specific stages of spermatogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of DH sites is related to periods of active transcription. Results with the Pgk-1 gene indicate that transcriptional inactivation of the X chromosome in spermatogenic cells may not be as complete as that in somatic cells, and that maximum repression may be limited to a very transient period during the pachytene stage of first meiotic prophase. Results with the Pgk-2 gene indicate that DH sites appear coincident with, or just prior to, transcriptional activation of this gene. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to the role of X chromosome inactivation in spermatogenic cells and the developmental order of molecular events that regulate differential gene expression during spermatogenesis.

INTRODUCTIONPhosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1The abbreviations used are: PGKphosphoglycerate kinaseDHDNase I-hypersensitiveXCIX chromosome inactivationTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidkbkilobase pair(s). is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of glucose or fructose during glycolysis. In mammals, PGK is encoded by two functional genes, Pgk-1 and Pgk-2 (1VandeBerg J.L. Isozymes Curr. Top. Biol. Med. Res. 1985; 12: 133-187Google Scholar). Pgk-1 is an X-linked gene, and is ubiquitously expressed at relatively low levels in all somatic cells. The Pgk-2 gene is autosomal and is expressed in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner at relatively high levels during spermatogenesis, specifically in meiotic spermatocytes and postmeiotic round spermatids (1VandeBerg J.L. Isozymes Curr. Top. Biol. Med. Res. 1985; 12: 133-187Google Scholar, 2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar). In mammalian spermatogenic cells, transcriptional repression of the Pgk-1 gene occurs as a result of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) during prophase of meiosis I (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar). At the same time, transcription of the autosomal Pgk-2 gene is initiated (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar).Although the Pgk-1 gene is expressed ubiquitously in somatic cells, tissue-specific differences in levels of Pgk-1 transcript have been noted (4Singer-Sam J. Yang T.P. Mori N. Tanguay R.L. Le Bon J.M. Flores J.C. Riggs A.D. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. New Ser. 1990; 128: 285-298Google Scholar), suggesting the Pgk-1 promoter confers some degree of transcriptional regulation on the active gene. Dramatic differences have been reported for regulatory parameters associated with the Pgk-1 promoter on the transcriptionally active and inactive X chromosomes in mammalian female somatic cells. These include hypomethylation of specific CpG sites (5Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar, 6Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somatic Cell. Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Google Scholar), DNase I-hypersensitive sites (7Riley D.E. Canfield T.K. Gartler S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1829-1845Google Scholar, 8Riley D.E. Goldman M.A. Gartler S.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 73-80Google Scholar), and bound transcription factors (5Pfeifer G.P.

Genet. 1988; 14: 461-472Google Scholar), all of which are associated with the constitutively expressed Pgk-1 gene on the active X, but are absent from the terminally repressed Pgk-1 gene on the inactive X chromosome. However, some of these differences do not distinguish the active and inactive X chromosomes in germ cells. For instance, it has been shown that the inactivated X chromosome in germ cells lacks the repressive hypermethylation associated with the inactivated X chromosome in somatic cells (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 10Grant M. Zuccotti M. Monk M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 161-166Google Scholar, 11Singer-Sam J. Goldstein L. Dai A. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1413-1417Google Scholar). This is probably because unlike the situation in female somatic cells, inactivation of the X chromosome in germ cells is a transient event (reviewed in 12McCarrey J.R. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, Cambridge1993: 58Google Scholar).Differences in the mechanism of XCI in germ cells and somatic cells could reflect a different function provided by this phemonenon in each cell type. In somatic cells, XCI achieves dosage compensation between males and females with respect to expression of X-linked genes. However, in germ cells the dose of X-linked gene expression differs markedly between spermatocytes which possess zero active X chromosomes, and oocytes, in which both X chromosomes are active (reviewed in 12McCarrey J.R. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, Cambridge1993: 58Google Scholar). Thus, the function of differential X chromosome activity during gametogenesis in males and females is not dosage compensation.The tissue-specific occurrence of Pgk-2 mRNA in the testis implies stringent transcriptional control conferred by the Pgk-2 gene promoter. This promoter consists of a core region, defined on the basis of its ability to direct transcription of a reporter gene in a heterologous cell culture system (13Berg W.M. Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Life Sci. Adv. Mol. Biol. 1993; 12: 85-91Google Scholar), plus an upstream enhancer region which is required to direct appropriate tissue- and cell-type specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice (14Robinson M.O. McCarrey J.R. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8437-8441Google Scholar), and in which binding sites reside for testis-specific nuclear factors (15Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Google Scholar). Transcription and protein-binding assays demonstrate the critical role that transcription factors play in regulating gene expression. However, the ability of transcription factors to exert such regulation is dependent upon access of these factors to their cognate binding sites in each gene promoter. This access is associated with changes in the structure of the chromatin in which these sites are embedded. Thus, the presence of an “open” accessible chromatin structure represents a critical corollary to the state of active transcription.Toward the goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the repression of Pgk-1 transcription and the initiation of Pgk-2 transcription during spermatogenesis, we have examined both the occurrence and the relative timing of changes in chromatin structure in relation to transcription factor binding and the actual initiation or cessation of transcription of these genes in specific spermatogenic cell types. Our results suggest that the appearance of DH sites may occur coincident with, or just prior to transcription factor binding and initiation of transcription of the Pgk-2 gene. Our results also indicate that maximum transcriptional repression during spermatogenesis of X-linked genes such as Pgk-1 may be less complete, and more transient than previously thought.DISCUSSIONDH sites found within 1 kb of the 5′-flanking end of an active gene are typically most relevant to the control of gene expression (27Elgin S.C.R. Nature. 1984; 309: 213-214Google Scholar), mapping to core promoters (16Yang T.P. Caskey C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2994-2998Google Scholar, 28Vuorio E. deCrombrugghe B. Annu. Rev.

Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Google Scholar). Of the two DH sites we observed in the active Pgk-1 gene, one (DH site 1) mapped to a 5′-promoter/enhancer region previously defined in transient transfection assays (34McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). A second site (DH site 2) detected in some expressing cell types mapped to the first intron of the Pgk-1 gene. That these hypersensitive sites correspond to protein-binding sites was further indicated by resistance to exonuclease Bal-31 digestion that mapped to similar locations. While detection of DH sites in intronic sequences is not unprecedented (33Dirks R.P. Jansen H.J. Gerritsma J. Onnekink C. Bloemers H.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 509-519Google Scholar, 35Beck K.M. Seekamp A.H. Askew G.R. Mei Z. Farrell C.M. Wang S. Lukens L.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4975-4982Google Scholar, 36Franklin G.C. Donovan M.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 3239-3246Google Scholar), the potential significance of this region for regulation of Pgk-1 gene expression is unclear. McBurney et al. (38McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Jardine K. Sutherland L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 515-528Google Scholar) found that a fragment containing the mouse Pgk-1 promoter/enhancer sequences plus the first exon and part of the first intron gave maximal expression of a reporter gene in transient transfection assays. This fragment spans a region containing both of the DH sites we observed in the expressed Pgk-1 gene in male liver cells. However, they also demonstrated that a fragment lacking the intronic sequences (and hence DH site 2) could still direct transcription, albeit at a slightly reduced level (38McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Jardine K. Sutherland L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 515-528Google Scholar). The apparent absence of Pgk-1 DH site 2 in the expressed Pgk-1 gene in either premeiotic spermatogonia or somatic Sertoli cells suggests it is not critical for expression of this gene, at least in testicular cells.Of the three DH sites we observed in the active Pgk-2 gene, only one (DH site 1) maps to the promoter/enhancer region (Fig. 3), while the other two map to regions within, and immediately 3′ to, the coding sequence. Previous studies with transgenic mice demonstrated that the Pgk-2 promoter plus enhancer region alone are sufficient to direct appropriate tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene (14Robinson M.O. McCarrey J.R. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8437-8441Google Scholar). Thus, we assume that Pgk-2 DH site 1 is the only one associated with a site that is critical for tissue-specific regulation. Previous gel-shift experiments indicated potential tissue-specific enhancer and repressor activities in this same region (15Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Google Scholar). In this respect it is noteworthy that we observed no DH sites in nonexpressing cell types including liver and Sertoli cells (Fig. 5). This indicates there is probably not constitutive binding of a repressor protein to this region of the Pgk-2 promoter in nonexpressing cells in vivo.Pgk-1 DH site 1 was clearly detected in premeiotic spermatogonia and was also evident in early primary spermatocytes, but was only very faintly detectable in pachytene spermatocytes (Fig. 4). This site was again clearly detectable in nuclei from round spermatids, but was absent in testicular spermatozoa. To the extent that the presence of a DH site in the promoter region is indicative of ongoing transcription, these results are surprising in at least three respects. First, they indicate that maximum transcriptional repression of the Pgk-1 gene (and hence maximal XCI) occurs only in the pachytene stage of first meiotic prophase. Previous estimates (including our own) of the timing of XCI during spermatogenesis suggested this event occurs at the very beginning of meiosis (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar, 39Lifschytz E.

While the inactivation process may indeed begin coincident with the initiation of meiosis, our results suggest that it does not reach a point of maximum transcriptional repression until the pachytene stage, which develops approximately 4 days after the initiation of meiotic prophase (41Nebel B.R. Amarose A.P. Hackett E.M. Science. 1961; 134: 832-833Google Scholar).Second, our results indicate that transcriptional inactivation of the X chromosome during spermatogenesis, even at its maximum in pachytene spermatocytes, may never be as complete as that observed in somatic cells. The faint representation of Pgk-1 DH site 1 seen in DNA from pachytene spermatocytes could be due, in part, to the up to 10% contamination of this preparation with other cell types (earlier spermatocytes or later round spermatids) in which we have shown a clearly detectable site is present. However, we believe this result also indicates that while this site becomes maximally reduced at the pachytene stage, it never completely disappears. We (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar) and others (10Grant M. Zuccotti M. Monk M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 161-166Google Scholar) previously showed that XCI in spermatogenic cells is not associated with stabilizing hypermethylation of DNA as it is in somatic cells. Now it appears that the complete disappearance of DH sites that is associated with genes on the inactivated X chromosome in somatic cells (7Riley D.E. Canfield T.K. Gartler S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1829-1845Google Scholar, 8Riley D.E. Goldman M.A. Gartler S.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 73-80Google Scholar, 16Yang T.P. Caskey C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2994-2998Google Scholar) may also fail to accrue during XCI in spermatogenic cells.Finally, these results indicate that the inactivation mechanism becomes relaxed in postmeiotic round spermatids. This suggests that XCI during spermatogenesis is even more transient than previously thought. Recent results with the Ube-1X gene indicate that X-linked genes can indeed reactivate in round spermatids (42Hendriksen P.J.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Themmen A.P.N. Koken M.H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Oostra B.A. van der Lende T. Grootegoed J.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 730-733Google Scholar). 2P. Burgoyne, personal communication. To determine if the Pgk-1 gene undergoes a similar transcriptional reactivation, we used nuclear run-off assays to assay ongoing transcription in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids. Our results indicate that the relaxation of XCI in round spermatids may be associated with a slight increase of Pgk-1 transcription in these cells, but that this reactivation is very limited at most, and never returns to levels similar to those observed in somatic cells (Fig. 6).A complete absence of DH sites was observed in both Pgk genes in spermatozoa, which supports reports that all transcription is totally inactivated in male gametes (43Monesi V. Arch. Anat. Microsc. Morphol. Exp. 1967; 56: 61-74Google Scholar), although some genes are known to retain an open chromatin domain in spermatozoa (44Choudhary S.K. Wykes S.M. Kramer J.S. Mohamed A.N. Koppitch F. Nelson J.E. Krawetz S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8755-8762Google Scholar).The apparent restriction of maximal transcriptional repression of the X-linked Pgk-1 gene to the pachytene stage may provide insight into the role of XCI in spermatogenic cells. Our results indicate XCI becomes maximal at the same stage during meiotic prophase when pairing and genetic exchange occur between transcriptionally active homologous autosomes. Unlike the autosomes, the X and Y sex chromosomes fail to pair or to undergo genetic recombination outside the pseudoautosomal region during male meiosis. This mechanism apparently evolved to avoid disruption of the stable sex determination system in eutherian mammals which relies on the Y-specific Sry gene that maps outside the pseudoautosomal region (45Gubbay J. Collignon J. Koopman P. Capel B. Economou A. Münsterberg A. Vivian N. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1990; 346: 245-250Google Scholar, 46Sinclair A.H. Berta P. Palmer M.S. Hawkins J.R. Griffiths B.L. Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.-M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1990; 346: 240-244Google Scholar). Thus, repression of transcription from the X and Y chromosomes in spermatocytes could reflect the development of a chromatin state required to preclude pairing and recombination (39Lifschytz E. Lindsley D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 182-186Google Scholar, 47McKee B.D. Handel M.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1993; 102: 71-80Google Scholar). This could explain the very transient, and possibly incomplete, nature of XCI during spermatogenesis, since, unlike XCI in somatic cells, the function of this process is apparently not related to the regulation of gene expression per se.Steady-state levels of many X-linked gene transcripts (e.g. Pgk-1, Pdha-1, Phka, Zfx) drop, while others (e.g. Hprt) remain fairly constant throughout spermatogenesis (3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar). Levels of mRNAs from certain other X-linked genes (e.g. Ube1X) are low in pachytene spermatocytes, but rise significantly again in round spermatids (42Hendriksen P.J.M. Hoogerbrugge J.W. Themmen A.P.N. Koken M.H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Oostra B.A. van der Lende T. Grootegoed J.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 730-733Google Scholar). This suggests that expression of most X-linked gene products is probably not deleterious to spermatogenesis as was previously suggested (48Forejt J. Crosignani P.G. Rubin B.L. Genetic Control of Gamete Production and Function. Academic Press, New York1982: 135Google Scholar). Furthermore, the apparently active transcriptional state of the Pgk-1 gene in primary spermatocytes prior to the pachytene stage indicates complete XCI is neither required for, nor associated with, the entry of spermatogenic cells into meiotic prophase.These results correlate with previous results regarding expression of the Xist gene during spermatogenesis. The Xist gene, which is known to be a regulator of XCI in somatic cells (49Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Google Scholar), is also expressed prior to, and during, the period of XCI in spermatogenic cells (50McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 200-203Google Scholar, 51Richler C. Soreq H. Wahrman J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 192-195Google Scholar, 52Salido E.C. Yen P.H. Mohandas T.K. Shapiro L.J. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 196-199Google Scholar). The apparent relaxation of XCI in round spermatids correlates with the previously observed decline in levels of Xist mRNA in these cells (50McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 200-203Google Scholar). Our nuclear run-off results suggest this relaxation does not result in a significant resumption of transcription of the Pgk-1 gene. This could be due to a lack of binding of one or more required transcription factors, and/or it may be related in part to changes in chromatin components that occur during spermiogenesis, as first transitional proteins and then protamines replace histones (53Green G.R. Balhorn R. Poccia D.L. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 255-263Google Scholar).Three DH sites were detected in the Pgk-2 gene in expressing spermatocytes and spermatids. Faint representation of these three sites was also detected in a mixture of type A and type B spermatogonia, but not in a pure population of primitive type A spermatogonia. The occurrence of faint sites in the type A and type B spermatogonia is not likely due to contamination of this preparation with later Pgk-2-expressing spermatocytes, since spermatocytes have not begun to appear in the testes of mice at 8 days of age (18Bellve A.R. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Google Scholar), and our previous attempts to detect Pgk-2 mRNA in these cells were negative, even when the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar). The absence of Pgk-2 DH sites in primitive type A spermatogonia indicates these sites first appear in either type A or type B spermatogonia, up to 2 days prior to the initiation of Pgk-2 transcription in preleptotene spermatocytes (41Nebel B.R. Amarose A.P. Hackett E.M. Science. 1961; 134: 832-833Google Scholar).Our results for the Pgk-2 gene are in agreement with the general observation that DH sites typically appear prior to the actual initiation of transcription (54Burch J.B.E. Weintraub H. Cell. 1983; 33: 65-76Google Scholar). The appearance of these sites also appears to occur just prior to, or at about the same time as, the initial appearance of binding activities of testis-specific nuclear proteins in the Pgk-2 enhancer region, to the extent the timing of these activities can be determined using gel shift experiments with developmentally staged testicular cells (15Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Google Scholar). Thus, we can now order putative regulatory parameters associated with the initiation of transcription of the Pgk-2 gene as follows: 1) demethylation of the 5′ half of the gene occurs in prospermatogonia at 18.5-21.5 days postcoitum (55Ariel M. Cedar H. McCarrey J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Google Scholar); 2) the appearance of DH sites in the Pgk-2 promoter/enhancer (this report) and 3) the appearance of nuclear proteins that bind to the Pgk-2 enhancer (15Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Google Scholar), both occur in either late spermatogonia or the earliest spermatocytes; and 4) the initiation of transcription occurs in primary spermatocytes at the preleptotene stage (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar). Finally, the results from the nuclear run-off assays prove unequivocally that the Pgk-2 gene is actively transcribed at both meiotic and postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis.We conclude that the appearance and disappearance of DH sites in the 5′-flanking region of both Pgk genes correlates closely with their differential expression during spermatogenesis as examined by Northern blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization analyses (2McCarrey J.R.

The only exceptions to this strict correlation may include: 1) the reappearance of DH site 1 in the Pgk-1 gene in round spermatids in which transcription of the this gene was detectable at only minimal levels, and 2) the initial appearance of DH sites in the Pgk-2 gene in type A and/or type B spermatogonia, just prior to the actual activation of transcription of this gene in primary spermatocytes. INTRODUCTIONPhosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1The abbreviations used are: PGKphosphoglycerate kinaseDHDNase I-hypersensitiveXCIX chromosome inactivationTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidkbkilobase pair(s). is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of glucose or fructose during glycolysis. In mammals, PGK is encoded by two functional genes, Pgk-1 and Pgk-2 (1VandeBerg J.L. Isozymes Curr. Top. Biol. Med. Res. 1985; 12: 133-187Google Scholar). Pgk-1 is an X-linked gene, and is ubiquitously expressed at relatively low levels in all somatic cells. The Pgk-2 gene is autosomal and is expressed in a tissue- and cell-type specific manner at relatively high levels during spermatogenesis, specifically in meiotic spermatocytes and postmeiotic round spermatids (1VandeBerg J.L. Isozymes Curr. Top. Biol. Med. Res. 1985; 12: 133-187Google Scholar, 2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar). In mammalian spermatogenic cells, transcriptional repression of the Pgk-1 gene occurs as a result of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) during prophase of meiosis I (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar). At the same time, transcription of the autosomal Pgk-2 gene is initiated (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 3McCarrey J.R. Dilworth D.D. Sharp R.M. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 117-123Google Scholar).Although the Pgk-1 gene is expressed ubiquitously in somatic cells, tissue-specific differences in levels of Pgk-1 transcript have been noted (4Singer-Sam J. Yang T.P. Mori N. Tanguay R.L. Le Bon J.M. Flores J.C. Riggs A.D. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. New Ser. 1990; 128: 285-298Google Scholar), suggesting the Pgk-1 promoter confers some degree of transcriptional regulation on the active gene. Dramatic differences have been reported for regulatory parameters associated with the Pgk-1 promoter on the transcriptionally active and inactive X chromosomes in mammalian female somatic cells. These include hypomethylation of specific CpG sites (5Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar, 6Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somatic Cell. Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Google Scholar), DNase I-hypersensitive sites (7Riley D.E. Canfield T.K. Gartler S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1829-1845Google Scholar, 8Riley D.E. Goldman M.A. Gartler S.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 73-80Google Scholar), and bound transcription factors (5Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar, 9Yang T.P. Singer-Sam J. Flores J.C. Riggs A.D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1988; 14: 461-472Google Scholar), all of which are associated with the constitutively expressed Pgk-1 gene on the active X, but are absent from the terminally repressed Pgk-1 gene on the inactive X chromosome. However, some of these differences do not distinguish the active and inactive X chromosomes in germ cells. For instance, it has been shown that the inactivated X chromosome in germ cells lacks the repressive hypermethylation associated with the inactivated X chromosome in somatic cells (2McCarrey J.R. Berg W.M. Paragioudakis S.J. Zhang P.L. Dilworth D.D. Arnold B.L. Rossi J.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 160-168Google Scholar, 10Grant M. Zuccotti M. Monk M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 161-166Google Scholar, 11Singer-Sam J. Goldstein L. Dai A. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1413-1417Google Scholar). This is probably because unlike the situation in female somatic cells, inactivation of the X chromosome in germ cells is a transient event (reviewed in 12McCarrey J.R. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, Cambridge1993: 58Google Scholar).Differences in the mechanism of XCI in germ cells and somatic cells could reflect a different function provided by this phemonenon in each cell type. In somatic cells, XCI achieves dosage compensation between males and females with respect to expression of X-linked genes. However, in germ cells the dose of X-linked gene expression differs markedly between spermatocytes which possess zero active X chromosomes, and oocytes, in which both X chromosomes are active (reviewed in 12McCarrey J.R. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, Cambridge1993: 58Google Scholar). Thus, the function of differential X chromosome activity during gametogenesis in males and females is not dosage compensation.The tissue-specific occurrence of Pgk-2 mRNA in the testis implies stringent transcriptional control conferred by the Pgk-2 gene promoter. This promoter consists of a core region, defined on the basis of its ability to direct transcription of a reporter gene in a heterologous cell culture system (13Berg W.M. Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Life Sci. Adv. Mol. Biol. 1993; 12: 85-91Google Scholar), plus an upstream enhancer region which is required to direct appropriate tissue- and cell-type specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice (14Robinson M.O. McCarrey J.R. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8437-8441Google Scholar), and in which binding sites reside for testis-specific nuclear factors (15Gebara M.M. McCarrey J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1422-1431Google Scholar). Transcription and protein-binding assays demonstrate the critical role that transcription factors play in regulating gene expression. However, the ability of transcription factors to exert such regulation is dependent upon access of these factors to their cognate binding sites in each gene promoter. This access is associated with changes in the structure of the chromatin in which these sites are embedded. Thus, the presence of an “open” accessible chromatin structure represents a critical corollary to the state of active transcription.Toward the goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the repression of Pgk-1 transcription and the initiation of Pgk-2 transcription during spermatogenesis, we have examined both the occurrence and the relative timing of changes in chromatin structure in relation to transcription factor binding and the actual initiation or cessation of transcription of these genes in specific spermatogenic cell types. Our results suggest that the appearance of DH sites may occur coincident with, or just prior to transcription factor binding and initiation of transcription of the Pgk-2 gene. Our results also indicate that maximum transcriptional repression during spermatogenesis of X-linked genes such as Pgk-1 may be less complete, and more transient than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2062722454,"Abstract 3S-peptide-I is a synthetic tris-sulfotyrosyl dodecapeptide corresponding to the major site of insulin receptor autophosphorylation that potently inhibits dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor in a cell-free system and in digitonin-permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the human insulin receptors (CHO/HIRc cells) (Liotta, A. S., Kole, H. K., Fales, H. M., Roth, J., and Bernier, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 22996-23001). In the present study, we found that 3S-peptide-I was not capable of inhibiting dephosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in digitonin-permeabilized CHO cells that overexpress human EGF receptors (CHO/EGF-R cells). Moreover, the addition of a N-stearyl derivative of 3S-peptide-I to intact CHO/HIRc cells caused a concentration-dependent increase in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, with a maximum effect (∼2.7-fold) at 50 μM. In contrast, ligand-stimulated EGF receptor phosphorylation in CHO/EGF-R cells was not affected by the presence of stearyl 3S-peptide-I. Furthermore, treatment of CHO/HIRc cells with this N-stearyl peptide led to a significant enhancement of the insulin-induced association of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity with insulin receptor substrate 1 and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. However, stearyl 3S-peptide-I had no effect on the EGF-stimulated activation of PI-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase in CHO/EGF-R cells. These data indicate that this tris-sulfotyrosyl dodecapeptide selectively enhances insulin signal transduction by specifically inhibiting dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965934057,"We examined repair of DNA strand breaks induced by the anti-cancer drug bleomycin in both Pol I and Pol II transcribed genes in permeabilized human fibroblasts. The majority of these breaks (>80%) are single strand breaks (SSBs) thought to be repaired by base excision repair enzymes. Repair was examined in each strand of a 7.2-kilobase fragment, completely within the Pol I transcribed region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and an 8.3-kilobase fragment completely within the Pol II transcribed region of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. Bleomycin dose-response studies revealed no bias for SSBs in either strand of the rDNA fragment. Furthermore, repair of SSBs is rapid (~80% resealed in 60 min) in both the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of rDNA. Rapid repair of SSBs is also observed in both strands of the DHFR gene (~60% resealed in 60 min). In contrast, little (or no) repair of UV photodimers occurs in either strand of human rDNA, regardless of whether cells are confluent or actively growing.

Rev. 1987; 87: 1107-1136Crossref Scopus (952) Google Scholar and Povirk and Finley Austen (1991); also see 4Bennett R.A.O. Swedlow P.S. Povirk L.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3188-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlike bulky DNA lesions, repair of these breaks is resistant to aphidicolin, and the average repair patch size is less than 6 nucleotides (13DiGiuseppe J.A. Dresler S.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9515-9520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; 14DiGiuseppe J.A. Hunting D.J. Dresler S.L.

Bleomycin is a glycopeptide that complexes with divalent cations (mainly Fe2+) and O2, and a portion of the molecule intercalates in DNA, particularly at NGC sequences (21Kuwahara J. Sugiura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2459-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It produces strand breaks or apurinic/apyrimidinic sites by abstracting hydrogen from C-4′ of deoxyribose adjoining the guanidyl-3′-phosphate at the site of bleomycin-DNA intercalation (39Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1107-1136Crossref Scopus (952) Google Scholar; Povirk and Finley Austen, 1991). At this point, the resulting free radical can partition into one of two alternate damage pathways. Upon addition of O2, a peroxyl radical is formed, which decomposes to yield a strand break with 5′-phosphate and 3′-phosphoglycolate termini, with release of a base propanal. Alternatively, hydroxylation of the C-4′ radical can occur opening the sugar ring and releasing the base. This pathway yields an apurinic-apyrimidinic site with a chemically modified sugar. In chromatin, however, many of these modified apurinic-apyrimidinic sites undergo spontaneous cleavage, probably by reaction with histone amine groups (4Bennett R.A.O. Swedlow P.S. Povirk L.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3188-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These strand breaks cannot be ligated directly and may be repaired via removal of the modified base (and a few adjacent bases) by a 3′→ 5′ exonuclease and (short patch) repair synthesis (e.g., see 28Mosbaugh D.W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10247-10251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed repair of bleomycin-induced single strand breaks (SSBs) in the individual strands of Pol I-transcribed ribosomal genes (rDNA) and the Pol II-transcribed DHFR gene. Repair in the DHFR gene has been well characterized, and both preferential and strand-specific repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) occurs in this gene (reviewed in 16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In contrast, repair of CPDs in either total rDNA of human and hamster cells (9Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10512-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or the transcriptionally active fraction of rDNA in mouse cells (18Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is very inefficient in both DNA strands. We report here that, in contrast to very inefficient repair of CPDs in rDNA, repair of bleomycin-induced SSBs occurs rapidly in both strands of a human 7.2-kb rDNA fragment and an 8.3-kb fragment in the DHFR gene (Fig. 1). Bleomycin (Blenoxane) was a generous gift from Bristol Myers Laboratories (Syracuse, New York). L-α-Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was purchased from Sigma. Human diploid fibroblasts (strain AG 1518) were split 1:3 and grown in culture as described previously (35Smerdon M.J. Lan S.Y. Calza R.E. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were prelabeled with 5 nCi/ml [14C]deoxythymidine (50 mCi/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 1 week after splitting. Prelabeling medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were grown an additional 2-2.5 weeks until confluent. The medium was changed every 8 days during this period. To obtain actively growing cells used in some experiments, cells were split 1:4 and harvested 3 days after splitting. Cells were permeabilized with LPC as described previously (26Lorenz J.D. Watkins J.F. Smerdon M.J. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (16 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 5 mM KCl, 135 mM NaCl). An 80 µg/ml solution of LPC (dissolved in PBS and 1 mM CaCl2) was added to the cells, which were then kept on ice for 2 min. The effectiveness of cell permeabilization was determined in separate plates by the fraction of cells taking up trypan blue dye (26Lorenz J.D. Watkins J.F. Smerdon M.J. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). The LPC solution was then carefully removed and replaced with repair mixture (35 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM ATP; see 33Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (a): 7501-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50 (b): 1613-1619PubMed Google Scholar). Bleomycin treatment was performed according to 33Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (a): 7501-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50 (b): 1613-1619PubMed Google Scholar. For repair experiments, cells were treated in three groups. Group 1 cells (no bleomycin) were made permeable by LPC treatment followed by addition of repair mixture containing 3 µM dNTPs. The cells were washed and harvested after a 30-min incubation at 37°C without bleomycin. Group 2 cells (damage, no repair) were made permeable by LPC treatment followed by addition of repair mixture with no dNTPs and various concentrations of bleomycin dissolved in 10 mM PIPES buffer. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C prior to harvest. Group 3 cells (damage and repair) were made permeable with LPC, followed by repair mixture containing 3 µM dNTPs. Bleomycin dissolved in PIPES buffer was also added. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Following this incubation, the bleomycin solution was replaced with prewarmed conditioned medium, and the cells were incubated for different repair times. DNA was prepared according to 6Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1988: 347Google Scholar. For repair studies in the DHFR gene, DNA was digested with PstI (5 units/µg of DNA). To assay repair in rDNA, samples were digested with EcoRI (5 units/µg of DNA). Following restriction enzyme digestion, the DNA was isolated on neutral CsCl density gradients (6Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1988: 347Google Scholar), and, after dialysis against TE buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl, 1 mM EDTA), the specific radioactivity was determined (from absorbance scans and liquid scintillation counting). Equal amounts of samples, determined from measured values of specific radioactivity, were electrophoresed in 0.6% or 0.8% alkaline agarose gels at 35 V for 16-17 h, according to 27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar. Samples were then depurinated in the gels by soaking in 0.25 M HCl for 15 min. After acid treatment, gels were neutralized and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham) using the alkaline transfer method (3Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1988Google Scholar). Plasmid pZH-15 was a gift from Drs. C. Allen Smith and Phillip Hanawalt (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). It contains 788 bp of genomic DNA extending from −315 bp into intron 2 of the human DHFR gene (Fig. 1). Plasmid pSPT28S, used to probe rDNA, was a gift from Drs. Jose Sogo (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland) and Antonio Conconi (WSU, Pullman, WA) (Fig. 1). It contains a 137-bp BamHI/SstI fragment from the 28 S region of mouse rDNA (Fig. 1) that is very similar to the human rDNA sequence (17Fritz, L. K., 1994, Differential DNA Repair in Mammalian Ribosomal Genes. Ph.D. thesis, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.Google Scholar). Plasmid pZH111, also a gift from the Hanawalt laboratory and constructed by Dr. L. Lommel, contains a 600-bp insert (into pGEM-3Z) of the human DHFR cDNA from the EcoRI site in exon II to the Sau3A site in exon V. This plasmid was used to probe DHFR mRNA. Radioactively labeled riboprobes were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions in the Riboprobe Gemini II kit (Promega; see 18Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were quantified using a laser scanning densitometer (LKB model 2222 or Molecular Dynamics model PDSI). The integrated intensity of bands resulting from bleomycin treatment was determined using a peak deconvolution program (Peak Fit; Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). These intensities were normalized to the integrated intensities of bands resulting from no treatment to determine the fraction of fragments free of strand breaks (P0). The average strand breaks/fragment was determined using the Poisson expression [−ln(P0)] (6Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1988: 347Google Scholar). Loading variations between lanes were corrected by normalization of band intensities to either an external plasmid band (e.g. see 29Murad A.O. de Cock J. Brown D.W. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3949-3957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or to the total intensity measured in the lane. For many of these experiments, confluent human fibroblasts were reversibly permeabilized with LPC to improve transport of bleomycin into cells (34Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50 (b): 1613-1619PubMed Google Scholar). Using this treatment, bleomycin dose-response measurements were performed to determine the level of strand breaks produced in the 7.2-kb EcoRI rDNA fragment. Total strand breaks were assayed by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, inset). As shown in Fig. 2, at bleomycin doses >0.1 µg/ml, there is approximately a log-linear relationship between strand breaks in the rDNA fragment and bleomycin concentration. There is also a significant number of double strand breaks, or breaks on opposite strands in close proximity, at bleomycin doses >1 µg/ml, as measured by neutral gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B, inset). These breaks account for <20% of the total breaks induced by bleomycin in the rDNA fragment (analysis not shown). Furthermore, there is no bias for bleomycin-induced strand breaks in either strand of this fragment (Fig. 2). A dose of 3 µg/ml was used for most repair experiments where 90-95% of the DNA fragments analyzed contain at least one single strand break. For most repair experiments, permeabilized, confluent human fibroblasts were exposed to 3 µg/ml bleomycin. At this dose, the 7.2-kb rDNA fragment (Fig. 1A) contained 1.8-2.3 strand breaks in each strand, while the 8.3-kb DHFR fragment (Fig. 1B) contained 2.4-2.6 strand breaks in each strand. This dose was chosen to illustrate the dramatic change in strand breaks after even short repair times (see below). Also, as observed for the rDNA fragment, no bias was observed for strand breaks in either strand of the DHFR fragment (not shown). Repair of bleomycin-induced strand breaks in both rDNA and DHFR displayed initial rapid kinetics (Fig. 3). This is illustrated by the rapid return of intact rDNA fragments after only 40 min of repair incubation (Fig. 3A, inset). At least 80% of the strand breaks are repaired in each strand of these genes after only 90 min (Fig. 3). This value approaches 100% after 24 h of repair incubation (data not shown). The “plateau” in repair data at about 80% for rDNA (Fig. 3A) most likely reflects a much slower repair of double strand breaks (12Coquerelle T.M. Weibezahn K.F. Lucke Huhle C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1987; 51: 209-218Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), present at <20% the level of SSBs in rDNA (above). However, regardless of the reason for the plateau in repair kinetics, it is clear that most strand breaks are very rapidly repaired during the first hour in ribosomal genes. It is important to note that the results in Fig. 3 represent repair in total ribosomal genes, which are present in several hundred copies in human cells (25Long E.O. Dawid I.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 727-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Using psoralen cross-linking to separate the transcriptionally active from the inactive fraction, we find that <30% of rRNA genes are in the active chromatin fraction in these cells (data not shown; see 18Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results in Fig. 3 indicate that efficient repair occurs in each strand of both the active and inactive rDNA fractions. It has been established that rDNA transcription is greatly reduced in stationary cells (37Sollner-Webb B. Tower J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 801-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 11Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, we irradiated both confluent and actively growing human fibroblasts with 20 J/m2 UV light (254 nm), and the newly replicated DNA in growing cells was separated from parental DNA using isopycnic centrifugation (see “Materials and Methods”). The yield of CPDs in each strand of the 7.2-kb rDNA fragment was measured using the method of 7Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar. This assay measures the fraction of restriction fragments resistant to cutting by T4 endonuclease V (T4 endo V), which cleaves DNA strands specifically at CPD sites. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, little change occurs in the fraction of T4 endo V-resistant rDNA fragment after 8 h of repair incubation, and there is only a small increase in this band after 24 h of repair. Indeed, quantitation of these results indicates that only 20-30% of the CPDs are removed from each strand after 24 h (Fig. 4, C and D), and repair was inefficient during each growth state. Thus, as previously found for rodent and human cells (9Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10512-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar; 18Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), repair of CPDs is inefficient in each strand of the ribosomal genes of human fibroblasts. Our results indicate that bleomycin-induced SSBs in rDNA are repaired efficiently, but not in a strand-specific manner (Fig. 3). On the other hand, repair of UV-induced CPDs is very inefficient in each strand of rDNA in both growing and confluent human fibroblasts (Fig. 4). This latter observation agrees qualitatively with past studies on repair of total rDNA in human and hamster cells (9Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10512-10520Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 323: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that inefficient repair of CPDs takes place even in the transcribed strand of the transcriptionally active fraction of ribosomal genes (18Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the rapid and extensive repair of bleomycin-induced SSBs is dramatically different from the repair of UV photodimers in rDNA. The differences we observe between the kinetics of repair of SSBs induced by bleomycin and CPDs induced by UV light are striking. 38Stevnsner T. May A. Petersen L.N. Larminat F. Pirsel M. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar also observed differences in repair efficiency in rDNA damaged with various agents in CHO cells. These authors reported inefficient repair of CPDs, and both monoadducts and diadducts induced by nitrogen mustard. However, efficient repair of methyl methanesulfonate adducts and cisplatin interstrand cross-links was observed in rDNA (38Stevnsner T. May A. Petersen L.N. Larminat F. Pirsel M. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although repair of individual rDNA strands was not measured in that study. This report, along with the present one, suggests that the “accessibility” of rDNA may vary between different repair pathways (see below). UV-induced CPDs and bleomycin-induced strand breaks are (presumably) repaired by different repair pathways (e.g. see 16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). DNA polymerase inhibitor studies strongly support the involvement of polymerase β (independent of polymerases α and δ/ε) in the repair of bleomycin-induced damage (13DiGiuseppe J.A. Dresler S.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9515-9520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar; 14DiGiuseppe J.A. Hunting D.J. Dresler S.L. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; 33Sidik K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29 (a): 7501-7511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nucleolus, where rDNA sequences are sequestered, could act as a barrier to the bulky enzyme complex associated with nucleotide excision repair (16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), but allow access to the 39-kDa polymerase β protein (1Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.G. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar; 43Wilson S.H. Abbotts J. Widen S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (Obviously, polymerases α and δ/ε have access to these regions during S-phase; however, these cells represent a small fraction of the total population even in exponentially growing cultures.) Furthermore, because rDNA sequences are reiterated and quite highly conserved (19Gonzales I.L. Chambers C. Gorski J.L. Stambolian D. Schmickel R.D. Sylverster J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), one can speculate that recombinational repair (rather than nucleotide excision repair) of UV-induced CPDs (and perhaps other bulky DNA lesions) would offer a selective advantage in maintaining sequence integrity among the rDNA gene copies (see 10Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 323: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), perhaps involving a different mechanism than used in nonreiterated sequences (30Ozenberger B.A. Roeder G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As a control for our studies, we examined repair in the DHFR gene, which is transcribed by RNA Pol II. As stated earlier, transcription repair coupling appears to require an elongating Pol II complex (23Leadon S.A. Lawrence D.A. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; 8Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1992; 274: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and we were concerned that DHFR might not be actively transcribed in confluent cells. However, Northern analyses with these human fibroblasts showed that equivalent amounts of DHFR mRNA are present in actively growing cells and cells in deep confluence (17Fritz, L. K., 1994, Differential DNA Repair in Mammalian Ribosomal Genes. Ph.D. thesis, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.Google Scholar). Although these studies were not performed on permeabilized cells, the fact that these cells “recuperate” rapidly from LPC permeabilization (26Lorenz J.D. Watkins J.F. Smerdon M.J. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar) and go on to divide normally indicates that the DHFR gene is indeed transcribed following permeabilization. Furthermore, 24Leys E.J. Kellems R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar concluded that the relative rates of DHFR transcription in growing and resting cells is the same. (We note that these authors observed a small increase of DHFR mRNA levels in growing cells, after long times (30 h) of growth stimulation, and concluded this increase is due to increased stability of the DHFR message in growing cells (24Leys E.J. Kellems R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).) In addition, 41Venema J. van Hoffen A. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar reported transcription-coupled repair of CPDs in the DHFR gene in confluent human fibroblasts, which (indirectly) suggests that transcription of DHFR occurs in confluent cells. Finally, a previous study reported efficient repair of bleomycin-induced strand breaks in an amplified c-myc gene in human cells (5Bianchi N.O. Bianchi M.S. Lopez-Larraza D. Alitalo D. de la Chapelle A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2379-2384PubMed Google Scholar). However, as double strand probes were used in that study, it could not be determined if this gene was repaired in a strand specific manner. Furthermore, 22Leadon S.A. Cooper P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10499-10503Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar found more efficient repair of ionizing radiation-induced lesions in the transcribed strand of the active metallothionein IIA gene in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group A) human fibroblasts, while Cockayne's syndrome (group B) cells yielded no strand specific repair of this gene. Since bleomycin is considered a radiomimetic agent (31Povirk L.F. Finley Austin M.J. Mutat. Res. 1991; 257: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar; although see 2Affentranger M.I. Burkart W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), this report suggests that more efficient repair of bleomycin-induced strand breaks may also occur in the transcribed strand of DHFR. Although we observed only a slight difference between the repair efficiency of the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of the DHFR gene (Fig. 3), this distinction could easily be missed due to the rapid repair kinetics in each strand.

At the superhelical density sufficient to locally unwind DNA, an H-y3 isomer of intermolecular triplex likely forms. However, at higher superhelical tension an H-y5 structure forms in the Py·Pu tract, and with increasing supercoiling the local DNA unwinding extends into the abutting TATA box.

In Drosophila, a (GA)n tract is likely involved in gene expression in its B-conformation, representing a protein binding site, rather as an H-DNA structure (23Glaser R.L. Thomas G.H. Siegfried E.S. Elgin S.C.R. Lis J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A similar conclusion has been drawn for the Py·Pu tracts in the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (31Chen A. Reyes A. Akeson R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and c-Ki-ras promoters (26Raghu G. Tevosian S. Anant S. Subramanian K.N. George D.L. Mirkin S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in a promoter of the γ-globin gene, which would reduce the probability of forming H-DNA, led to the expression of the gene when it should be turned off (34Ulrich M.J. Gray W.J. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18649-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the c-myc promoter, H-DNA formation in vitro correlated positively with the potential of the Py·Pu tract to promote the transcription in vivo (35Firulli A.B. Maibenco D.C. Kinniburgh A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms of an influence of H-DNA forming sequences on gene expression are not yet well understood (11Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Therefore, new information on mechanisms of H-DNA formation, its stabilization, and influence on conformations of adjacent regulatory sequences can advance our understanding of the potential involvement of H-DNA in biological processes. Here we have studied structural variation of DNA within the promoter of the human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene (see Fig. 1) which contains a 35-bp Py·Pu tract adjacent to a TATA box (36Shull M.M. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17532-17543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Py·Pu tract contains a 26-bp quasi-mirror repeat sequence with a potential for H-DNA formation. As analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, a plasmid containing a 151-bp fragment of promoter sequence undergoes a supercoil-dependent structural transition under moderately acidic pH. Chemical probe analyses with chloroacetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfate, and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) are consistent with the formation of H-DNA at the Py·Pu tract. Yet, the local DNA unwinding is not limited to the Py·Pu tract; the sequence of the neighboring TATA box becomes unwound as well. Chemical modification experiments with plasmid DNA of different superhelical densities show that at moderate superhelical tension an H-y3 isomer of intramolecular triplex forms. At higher superhelical tension, the H-y5 isomer is predominant, and the TATA box adjoining a single strand in this H-DNA isomer becomes unwound leading to the further relaxation of supercoils. Plasmid pBB151-8, in which a 151-bp fragment of the promoter region of the human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene (36Shull M.M. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17532-17543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned in the BamHI site of plasmid pUC8, was a generous gift from Dr. J. B Lingrel (University of Cincinnati). PvuII (New England Biolabs), Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Stoffel fragment of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) were used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Double-distilled chloroacetaldehyde was a generous gift from Dr. A. Bacolla (Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University). Topoisomers of particular superhelical densities were generated by incubating supercoiled plasmid with a topoisomerase extract from HeLa cells in the presence of varying concentrations of ethidium bromide as described (37Kochel T.J. Sinden R.R. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 532-543PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (4 µg) containing a mixture of topoisomers with a broad distribution of superhelical densities was incubated at 37°C in 10 µl of the first-dimension electrophoresis buffer for 1 h to form H-DNA. After cooling to room temperature and addition of 5 µl of dye mixture, the sample was loaded onto a 1.75% agarose gel (37Kochel T.J. Sinden R.R. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 532-543PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 V/cm using 13.5 mM Tris acetate (pH 4.2 or 5.0), 1 mM magnesium acetate for the first dimension and 40 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA, 30 µg/ml chloroquine for the second dimension. After electrophoresis in the second dimension, the gel was washed extensively to remove the chloroquine, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. In a standard experiment, each sample contained 2.5 µg of plasmid in 40 µl of 13.5 mM Tris acetate (pH 4.2 or 5.0), 1 mM magnesium acetate. To probe DNA in the duplex conformation, plasmid DNA was dissolved in 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl (pH 7). After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, samples were treated with chemicals at room temperature by adding either 2 µl of 2% dimethyl sulfate, 1.6 µl of 50% chloroacetaldehyde, or 2 µl of 20 mM KMnO4. After 10-min dimethyl sulfate or 5-min KMnO4 modification, reactions were stopped by adding 8 µl of 2.5 Mβ-mercaptoethanol. After 2.5-h chloroacetaldehyde modification, the reaction was stopped by extraction with diethyl ether. Following two ethanol precipitations, modified DNAs were digested overnight with PvuII and the reaction mixtures then extracted with phenol-chloroform. After two additional ethanol precipitations, samples were resuspended in 40 µl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA), and 10 µl was used for primer extension analysis of modification products as described (38Ussery D.W. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6206-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14885-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two 23-nucleotide-long primers that hybridized approximately 150 nucleotides away from the Py·Pu tract to different strands were used in primer extension reactions with a Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. Products of primer extension were resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (90 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2.5 mM EDTA) with sequence markers obtained by dideoxy sequencing of the plasmid using Taq DNA polymerase. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager plate for analysis of the radioactivity pattern using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The promoter region of the human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene contains a 35-bp Py·Pu region 2 bp upstream of the TATA box (Fig. 1). There is an imperfect mirror repeat element within this sequence which could participate in the formation of various intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) structures. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is a convenient method of measuring the relaxation of superhelical tension associated with local unwinding of the DNA double helix (40Bowater R. Aboul-Ela F. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Intramolecular triplex formation in a 35-bp Py·Pu tract and partial supercoil relaxation should result in an abrupt change in the mobility of topoisomers containing the triplex. Fig. 2 shows that at pH 4.2 a structural transition began with topoisomer −8 (superhelical density, σtr = −0.030). The observed relaxation was about two and a half supercoils, suggesting an unwound region 26-27 bp long, which may correspond to the length of a quasi-mirror repeat (26 bp). An unusual feature of this transition is that topoisomers −9 through −11 do not show the increase in mobility in the first dimension expected for molecules that relaxed a fixed amount of supercoils. Apparently, additional supercoil relaxation occurred after the initial transition, which suggests an additional structural transformation. At pH 5.0 a structural transition occurred at σtr = −0.049 (data not shown), as expected from the dependence of σtr on pH (21Lyamichev V.I. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1985; 3: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Htun H. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1988; 241: 1791-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). At pH 4.2 the chemical modification patterns (Fig. 3, A and B) for DNA of native superhelical density, as isolated from Escherichia coli (σ = −0.055), were consistent with the local unwinding of the double helix and the subsequent pairing of the 5′ part of the Py strand to the 5′ part of the Pu strand to form an H-y5 isomer of intramolecular triplex. Chloroacetaldehyde, which recognizes unpaired adenines and cytosines, and, to a lesser extent, guanines (42Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and KMnO4, which recognizes unpaired thymines (43Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used to reveal single-stranded regions. Protection from dimethyl sulfate modification indicated specific guanines involved in hydrogen bonding with the incoming third strand upon triplex formation (39Potaman V.N. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14885-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Adenines and guanines in the 3′ part of the Pu-rich strand (sequence −21 to −50) were reactive to chloroacetaldehyde at pH 4.2, indicating that these bases were unpaired (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Guanines in this region of the Pu strand were partially reactive with dimethyl sulfate at pH 4.2 (Fig. 3A, lane 5), consistent with a single-strand character of this sequence. At the same time, guanines were protected from reaction with dimethyl sulfate in the 5′ part of the Pu strand (sequence −52 to −65), indicating that a 5′ part of the Py strand folds back to form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with guanines of the 5′ part of the Pu strand. Probing of the complementary Py strand revealed a single guanine (−51), which interrupts a homopyrimidine sequence, and a cytosine (−44), which is 6 bases away, which were strongly reactive to chloroacetaldehyde (Fig. 3B, lane 3). In addition, cytosines in the central part of this strand (sequence −46 to −50) were weakly reactive toward chloroacetaldehyde. The dimethyl sulfate reactivity for this strand (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) was identical for the triplex-favoring (pH 4.2) and duplex-favoring conditions (pH 7). Note that in addition to the bases that belong to the Py·Pu tract, chloroacetaldehyde reactivity was observed for adenines contained within the TATA box sequence (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3). The H-y5 isomer of intramolecular triplex DNA shown in Fig. 3C can explain the key base modifications and protections. In this structure the entire 35-bp Py·Pu tract participates in a triplex formation rather than only the bases of the quasi-mirror repeat sequence. In addition, the local unwinding extends into the A+T sequence of the TATA box, where unpaired adenines are susceptible to modification with chloroacetaldehyde. Probing of unpaired thymines with KMnO4 (see Figs. 4B and 5C) is consistent with this model. Note that cytosines in the single-stranded loop at the tip of triplex are only partially modified with chloroacetaldehyde, which suggests that they may participate in a structure different from that shown in Fig. 3C (e.g. hydrogen-bonded protonated C·C+ hairpin; Refs. 44Leroy J.L. Guéron M. Mergny J.L. Hélène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1600-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 45Manzini G. Yathindra N. Xodo L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4634-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In three mismatched base triads, interactions between the duplex guanines and third-strand thymines might be partially stabilizing, and a formation of a partially stable C·G*T triad with one Hoogsteen hydrogen bond is indicated by a colon in Fig. 3C, showing a suggested intramolecular triplex structure (see also “Discussion”). To determine what structural transitions occurring in the Py·Pu region correspond to the somewhat unusual two-dimensional electrophoretic pattern, chemical probing was performed on several families of DNA topoisomers with the average superhelical densities covering the transition range. Chemical modification patterns for a Py strand at pH 4.2 are shown in Fig. 4. At the average superhelical density of the transition observed in the two-dimensional gel (σ = −0.030) (Fig. 2), chloroacetaldehyde reactivity maps to several bases in the Py strand. As shown in Fig. 4A (lane 4), reactive sites include 3 bases at positions −50 to −52: two cytosines and a single guanine that interrupts an otherwise Py sequence. A cytosine (−44) in the 5′ part of the Py sequence, adenines (−67 to −69) abutting the 3′ end, and an adenine and guanine (−28 to −29) abutting the 5′ end of Py strand were also reactive. This pattern of reactivity is consistent with the formation of a mixture of H-y3 and H-y5 isomers of intramolecular triplex as discussed below. At a higher superhelical density (σ = −0.041, lane 5), cytosines (−46 to −48) in the middle part of the Py·Pu tract and adenines (−21 to −23) in the TATA box sequence become reactive to chloroacetaldehyde. At this superhelical density, adenine modification at the 3′ end of Py strand (sequence −67 to −69) was still observed. Thus, at intermediate superhelical densities, an H-y3 isomer gives rise to chloroacetaldehyde reactivity at these adenines. However, at higher supercoiling this chloroacetaldehyde reactivity becomes relatively weak, and the H-y5 isomer/open TATA box structure with chloroacetaldehyde reactive bases at 5′ part of the Py strand and in the TATA box sequence becomes predominant. This correlates with observed reactivity of thymines (−22 to −23, −27) which comprise the TATA box (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). Note also that the reactivity of cytosines (−47 to −50) which supposedly occupy positions in the single-stranded tip of triplex are weak, suggesting that this single strand does not have a truly open conformation. Chemical modification patterns for the bases in the Pu-rich strand are shown in Fig. 5. A high background of chloroacetaldehyde reactivity was observed in the Pu strand in linear plasmid and lower density topoisomers. This could be due to a low ionic strength buffer employed in our studies and may be similar to the significant susceptibility of a linear Py·Pu tract to S1 nuclease at low salt (46Htun H. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7288-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This background reactivity was still observed at a higher ionic strength (120 mM Na+); however, the formation of an unwound structure was significantly shifted to higher superhelical densities (data not shown). Another contribution to a high background may come from the guanine-rich sequence itself as the primer extension through this sequence usually results in a higher background compared with other sequences. As shown in Fig. 5A (lane 4), at average superhelical density, σ = −0.030, where the transition occurred in a two-dimensional gel, the 3′ part of the Pu sequence (−30 to −50) was modified with chloroacetaldehyde, suggesting its unpaired character. This is expected for an H-y5 triplex isomer. The 5′ part of this strand (−50 to −65) was also susceptible to chloroacetaldehyde as expected for an H-y3 isomer, although to a lesser extent. Thus, in agreement with the chemical probing data for the Py strand, the chloroacetaldehyde reactivity of bases in the Pu strand shows that the H-y5 and H-y3 isomers of intramolecular triplex coexist at intermediate superhelical densities. At higher superhelical densities (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 6), the H-y5 isomer predominates since the pattern of chloroacetaldehyde reactivity shows that the 5′ part of the Pu strand is hydrogen bonded, and its 3′ part is unpaired. The involvement of the 5′ part of the Pu strand in the triple helix is consistent with the observed protection of guanines (−52 to −65) in this strand from dimethyl sulfate modification (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6). The KMnO4 modification pattern shows that, at the abrupt transition point (Fig. 5C, lane 4), thymines (−67 to −68) adjoining the Pu sequence at its 5′ end and a cytosine interrupting the Pu strand are reactive. At higher superhelical densities (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6), this reactivity is relatively weak; however, a prominent reactivity of thymines (−24 to −26, −28) in the TATA box sequence appears. Thus, the reactivity pattern for the Pu strand is consistent with the presence of a combined H-y5 triplex/open TATA box structure at high superhelical density. As indicated from two-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 2), alternative DNA structures form, with increasing superhelical density, within a 35-bp Py·Pu region from the human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene promoter. Pu·Py sequences with mirror repeat symmetry can form a number of intramolecular structures (10Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 217Crossref Google Scholar, 11Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12Soyfer V.N. Potaman V.N. Triple-helical Nucleic Acids. Springer -Verlag Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). The imperfect nature of a 26-bp mirror repeat in the Na,K-ATPase α2 promoter and the presence of the larger Py·Pu tract provide the opportunity for the formation of many different intramolecular triplex structures. Analysis of this region reveals about 20 Py·Pu*Pu and about 10 Py·Pu*Py triplexes that may form, many of which may have only slight energetic differences. We show that this 35-bp Pu·Py tract, which is 2 bp upstream of the TATA box in this human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene, forms at least two very different intramolecular triplex structures as a function of negative DNA supercoiling. At intermediate levels of supercoiling (σ = −0.02 to −0.03) a H-y3 triplex is formed which may be stabilized, in part, by unusual C·G*T triads. At higher, native negative superhelical densities (σ≤−0.041) a H-y5 intramolecular triplex is formed, and as the negative superhelical density increases the TATA box becomes unwound. Such structural transitions in vivo could have profound implications for the regulation of gene expression from this promoter. At lower superhelical densities, several possible H-y3 intramolecular triplex isomers could form. Since the 26-bp Py·Pu quasi-mirror repeat has an imperfect mirror symmetry, a usually predominant H-y3 isomer (47Htun H. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1989; 243: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) of the intramolecular triplex at this sequence would have nine perfect T·A*T and C·G*C+ triads and two mismatched triads (Fig. 6A). The Py strand would presumably fold into a structure with a 4-nucleotide single-stranded loop. Another possible folding scheme in the 35-bp Py·Pu tract shows that the Py strand might be aligned such that the H-y3 intramolecular triplex would contain 10 perfect triads and three mismatched triads with a 3-nucleotide loop (Fig. 6B). This folding scheme includes a part of pyrimidine sequence beyond the mirror repeat. The chloroacetaldehyde reactivity of adenines at the 3′ side of the Py sequence (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) and KMnO4 reactivity at the 5′ side of the Pu sequence (Fig. 5C, lane 4) indicate the presence of the latter triplex structure at intermediate superhelical densities. However, having three mismatched triads such a structure would not be very stable unless there were an additional stabilizing contribution. It is possible that some of the mismatched triads are less triplex-destabilizing than others. For example, the C·G*T triad was the least destabilizing of the mismatches in some intermolecular triplexes (48Pei D. Ulrich H.D. Schultz P.G. Science. 1991; 253: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 49Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9397-9401Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 50Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was also less destabilizing than other triads in H-DNA (51Belotserkovskii B.P. Veselkov A.G. Filippov S.A. Dobrynin V.N. Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6621-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reason for an intermediate stability of this triad is that G and T may form a single hydrogen-bonded Hoogsteen pair (Fig. 6C). Possible partial hydrogen bonding in the C·G*T triad is indicated with a colon in Fig. 6B. In DNA of native superhelical density (σ = −0.055), an H-y5 intramolecular triplex isomer (Fig. 3C) forms within the entire 35-bp Py·Pu sequence, not just the 26-bp region containing mirror symmetry. In addition, the local DNA unwinding present in the intramolecular triplex expands into the abutting TATA box. Analysis of folding schemes for the H-y5 triplex isomer shows a possibility of forming at least five structures with comparable numbers of perfect base triads, mismatched base triads, and unpaired bases at the tip of triple helix. Our experimental data are best explained by the model shown in Fig. 3C. The absence of strong chloroacetaldehyde reactivity of cytosines in a suggested Py loop is tentatively explained by their participation in a protonated C·C+ hairpin (44Leroy J.L. Guéron M. Mergny J.L. Hélène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1600-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 45Manzini G. Yathindra N. Xodo L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4634-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) at pH 4.2, which is close to the pKa value for protonation of the cytosines. The possibility of forming C·G*T triads is supported by the absence of KMnO4 reactivity of thymines in that part of Py sequence which serves as a third strand in the suggested triple helix. At native superhelical density, the H-y3 and H-r5 isomers are usually preferred in perfect mirror-repeated Py·Pu tracts (47Htun H. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1989; 243: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, a number of factors such as deviation from mirror symmetry and variation in the loop sequence may favor the formation of other isomers (52Dayn A. Samadashwily G.M. Mirkin S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11406-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 53Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20889-20891Google Scholar, 54Shimizu M. Kubo K. Matsumoto U.

The supercoil dependence for the formation of non-B-DNA structure shows that at the superhelical density sufficient to locally unwind DNA, an H-y3 isomer of intermolecular triplex likely forms. At higher superhelical tension the H-y5 triplex/open TATA box combination is predominant. The latter structure might be more favorable since it relaxes more supercoils. The TATA box probably opens because the double helix in the TATA box is relatively unstable, and unwinding relaxes additional DNA supercoils. In addition, the formation of H-DNA provides an unwound region adjacent to the TATA box, which further destabilizes the duplex and thus facilitates the opening of the TATA box. Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein found in the cells of higher eukaryotes. It is responsible for the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane using ATP as an energy source (56Lingrel J.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is composed of two subunits: an α subunit with a molecular mass of 113 kDa, and a glycosylated β subunit in which the protein portion accounts for 35 kDa of the total molecular mass of 55 kDa. A characteristic feature of the Na,K-ATPase is the multiplicity of α and β isoforms that are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific manner. A comparison of the 5′-flanking regions of the three isoforms of α genes of human Na,K-ATPase (36Shull M.M. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17532-17543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Pathak B.G. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. Genomics. 1990; 8: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 58Shull M.M. Pugh D.G. Lingrel J.B. Genomics. 1990; 6: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) shows the differences in potential transcription factor binding sites which may be important in mediating the tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of the three genes. The presence of the relatively long Py·Pu tract in the 5′-flanking region of the α2 gene and its ability to adopt an unusual structure comprised of the H-DNA and an unwound TATA box sequence might be also relevant to the specific expression of this gene. The details of regulation of the gene expression by either transcription factors capable of binding to multiple sites, or local unwound DNA structure are not known. Yet, some suggestions can be made about a biological significance of the above described non-B-DNA structure. The formation of a functional preinitiation complex on eukaryotic promoters requires ordered interaction of general initiation factors in addition to RNA polymerase II (59Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 402-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Recognition and binding of a TATA box-binding protein is the first step in the formation of preinitiation complex. Although TATA box-binding protein significantly distorts a bound DNA site by bending and partly unwinding it, a primary recognition process may require a regular double-helical DNA. Formation of the H-DNA in the promoter of the Na,K-ATPase gene is accompanied by unwinding of double helix in the adjacent TATA box. In such a way this site could be made incompatible with regulatory protein binding. Normal interactions between the proteins in transcription complex would be disturbed and, as a consequence, transcription would be down-regulated. The double-stranded Py·Pu tract might be suitable for binding a duplex DNA-recognizing transcription factor with specificity to oligo(G) sequences (60Clark S.P. Lewis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5119-5126Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 61Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2547-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The formation of H-DNA would make this site inappropriate for specific interaction with the protein that facilitates RNA polymerase binding. As a result, transcription would be inhibited. The promoter sequence of the human Na,K-ATPase α2 gene contains several sites that resemble those for known transcription factors (Sp1, nuclear factor-1, CACCC factors, etc.). However, none of these sites overlaps the Py·Pu tract, and at the present state of knowledge, a direct interference of H-DNA in the sequence studied with transcription factors is unlikely. In another option, the strand unwinding afforded by the formation of the H-y5 structure might stimulate transcription by promoting the assembly of RNA polymerase and associated transcription factors on DNA. DNA supercoiling can alleviate the need for certain transcription factors in reconstituted transcription reactions (62Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the absence of transcription factors that may promote strand unwinding, the latter might be facilitated by using energy from DNA supercoiling. In the case of Na,K-ATPase α2 gene, increasing DNA supercoiling locally unwinds the double helix and results in the formation of the H-y5/open TATA box structure, which may serve as an RNA polymerase entry point (63Lee J.S. Woodsworth M.L. Latimer L.J. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the triplex of H-y type the Pu strand comprises the long single strand. However, in the sequence studied the Py strand is the template strand, and although the long Pu single strand may promote RNA polymerase binding to the region, ultimately RNA polymerase would need to bind to the Py strand for transcription to occur. Thus, of the three options considered above, only one in which transcription might be down-regulated when normal interactions of TATA box-binding protein with the TATA box sequence are disrupted by the formation of a combined H-DNA/open TATA box structure seems possible. The described combined structure might participate in transcriptional regulation provided that there are stabilizing factors that may promote its formation in vivo (for a discussion of triplex-stabilizing factors in the cell, see Refs. 38Ussery D.W.

This presumably is a major evolutionary advantage. This unique extracellular matrix is composed of cellulose and glycoproteins. Previous work has shown that some of these spore coat glycoproteins exist as a preassembled multiprotein complex (the PsB multiprotein complex) which is stored in the prespore vesicles (Watson, N., McGuire, V., and Alexander, S (1994) J. Cell Sci. 107, 2567-2579). Later in development, the complex is synchronously secreted from the prespore vesicles and incorporated into the spore coat. We now have shown that the PsB complex has a specific in vitro cellulose binding activity. The analysis of mutants lacking individual subunits of the PsB complex revealed the relative order of assembly of the subunit proteins and demonstrated that the protein subunits must be assembled for cellulose binding activity.

Developing cells interact with, and are influenced by, neighboring cells and the surrounding environment. These interactions contribute to the determination of cell fate and patterning in developing organisms. Cellular interactions are mediated by both diffusible small molecules and extracellular macromolecules, which can be either components of the cell surface or the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoridemAbmonoclonal antibodyPsAprespore protein APsBprespore protein BPSVsprespore vesiclesPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCBDcellulose binding domain.

These extracellular macromolecules play structural and instructive roles in morphogenesis including cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and induction of cell differentiation (Prochniantz and Theodore, 43Prochniantz A. Theodore L. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 39-44Google Scholar; Ruoslahti and Yamaguchi, 47Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Google Scholar). In plants, the cell wall is the main ECM which functions to control cell shape and cell expansion, both of which are essential to plant morphogenesis (Cassab and Varner, 9Cassab G.I. Varner J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 321-353Google Scholar; Varner, 58Varner J.E. Lin L.-S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Google Scholar). Various models of cell wall structure and assembly have been proposed, but elucidating the basic biochemical activities required for cell wall formation and modification remains a major area of investigation (Carpita and Gibeaut, 8Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Google Scholar). The ECMs of both animal and plant cells are composed of a variety of molecules including glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. In addition to these components, plant cell walls are cellulose based and contain substantial amounts of heteropolysaccharides. extracellular matrix 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride monoclonal antibody prespore protein A prespore protein B prespore vesicles polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cellulose binding domain. At least four different general forms of ECM are produced during Dictyostelium development: 1) an ECM is secreted by aggregating cells which facilitates cell movement (Williams and Joss, 67Williams K.L. Joss G.H. Maini P.K. Othmer H. Murray J.D. Experimental and Theoretical Advances in Biological Pattern Formation. University of Oxford, Plenum Publishing Co., New York1993: 345-354Google Scholar); 2) during slug migration, a well defined sheath is secreted and surrounds the multicellular slug (but not individual cells). The sheath ECM is composed of glycoproteins and cellulose (Freeze and Loomis, 23Freeze H. Loomis W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252 (a): 820-824Google Scholar, 24Freeze H. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1977; 56 (b): 184-194Google Scholar; Grant and Williams, 31Grant W.N. Williams K.L. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 935-940Google Scholar). 3) At culmination, the anterior prestalk cells produce an ECM that surrounds the multicellular stalk. This ECM is also composed of cellulose and proteins (Blanton, 6Blanton R.L. Development. 1993; 119: 703-710Google Scholar; Freeze and Loomis, 25Freeze H. Loomis W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 539: 529-537Google Scholar), two of which are known to be high molecular weight glycoproteins encoded by the ecmA and B genes (McRobbie et al., 39McRobbie S.J. Jermyn K.A. Duffy K. Blight K. Williams J.G. Development. 1988; 104: 275-284Google Scholar). The stalk and slug sheaths have similar general biochemical characteristics (Freeze and Loomis, 25Freeze H. Loomis W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 539: 529-537Google Scholar). 4) Also during culmination, the posterior prespore cells secrete a variety of glycoproteins from the prespore vesicles (PSVs). These secreted glycoproteins combine with cellulose (which is not in the PSVs) to form the environmentally resistant spore coat. Clearly these ECMs play central roles throughout morphogenesis. However, there is only a rudimentary understanding of their composition, biochemical function, and the mechanisms controlling their developmentally regulated secretion and assembly. Our work has focused on the last of these ECMs, the spore coat. We have characterized a family of developmentally regulated glycoproteins that share a common O-linked oligosaccharide modification (Alexander et al., 2Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Google Scholar). Addition of this modification to proteins is dependent on the wild-type modB allele, and the oligosaccharide epitope is recognized by the MUD50 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Alexander et al., 2Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Google Scholar; Murray et al., 40Murray B.A. Niman H.L. Loomis W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 863-870Google Scholar; West and Loomis, 65West C.M. Loomis W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13803-13809Google Scholar). The MUD50 reactive oligosaccharide modification is found on proteins that are expressed at several different stages of morphogenesis but is particularly prominent during the migrating slug stage. The majority of the MUD50 reactive proteins at this developmental stage are expressed in prespore cells. Some of these proteins are membrane bound while others are soluble. Several of these MUD50 reactive proteins have now been shown to localize to ECMs. The sheathin proteins are a component of the sheath that surrounds the migrating slug (Zhou-Chou et al., 69Zhou-Chou T. Wilkins M.R. Vardy P.H. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 332-341Google Scholar), and the polymorphic PsB (prespore protein B) glycoprotein becomes part of the extracellular spore coat (Smith et al., 52Smith E. Gooley A.A. Hudson G.C. Williams K.L. Genetics. 1989; 122: 59-64Google Scholar; Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar; West et al., 66West C.M. Erdos G.W. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 72: 121-140Google Scholar). The PsB glycoprotein is recognized by the mAb MUD102 and is part of a larger specific multiprotein complex 2The PsB complex proteins were defined by their molecular weights on reducing SDS-PAGE. The complex includes four major proteins, p112, PsB (p100), p78, and p58 and two minor proteins, p70 and p63 (Watson et al., 62Watson N. Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar). The detection of the two minor species is dependent on a longer period of radiolabeling indicating they are synthesized at a lower rate. In this study, we have used short periods of labeling and these two proteins are not obvious and are not considered in this analysis. Subsequent work (Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar) identified p112 as the major phosphorylated spore coat protein SP96 identified by Loomis et al. (Devine et al., 14Devine K.M. Bergmann J.E. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 437-446Google Scholar). We also showed that the antibody mAb16.2 (which is reactive with a protein called SP85 (West et al., 66West C.M. Erdos G.W. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 72: 121-140Google Scholar)) recognizes PsB. (Watson et al., 62Watson N. Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar). Of these proteins, only PsB carries the modB oligosaccharide. The p112/SP96 and p78 proteins in the complex are glycosylated with a fucose containing oligosaccharide. Both of these oligosaccharides require the modC and E genes for biosynthesis, but only the fucose containing epitope on p112/SP96 is recognized by the MUD62 mAb (Champion et al., 10Champion A.

Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar). The PsB multiprotein complex is preassembled in PSVs where it is stored awaiting the signal for secretion. During the terminal stage of spore maturation, these PSVs fuse in a developmentally regulated manner with the cell plasma membrane and the PsB complex is secreted. After secretion it becomes part of the spore coat ECM (Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar). Additional proteins, including the fucosylated and phosphorylated SP75, are incorporated at this time (Watson, 61Watson, N., 1994, A Developmentally Regulated Glycoprotein Complex Involved in Spore Formation in Dictyostelium discoideum, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Missouri.Google Scholar; Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar). Within the spore coat, the PsB complex is positioned asymmetrically so that p112/SP96 is detected by immunofluorescence on the outside of the spore coat while the PsB protein is detected only on the inside (Richardson and Loomis, 45Richardson D.L. Loomis W.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1058-1070Google Scholar; Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar). Thus, the complex may span the middle layer of the coat which is known to be composed primarily of cellulose (Hemmes et al., 33Hemmes D.E. Kojima-Buddenhagen E.S. Hohl H.R. J. Ultrastr. Res. 1972; 41: 406-417Google Scholar; West and Erdos, 64West C.M. Erdos G.W. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 492-506Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the developmental signals that control the initiation of secretion or the molecular mechanisms underlying the fusion event. Although our studies demonstrated that the PsB complex is part of the spore coat, a specific biochemical activity that would account for its localization had not been defined. In addition, nothing was known about the specific assembly of the individual protein subunits in the multiprotein complex. Both questions are fundamental to our understanding of the organization and function of ECMs. In this study, we demonstrate that the PsB complex has a specific binding activity for cellulose, which is consistent with its localization in the spore coat. We also demonstrate the order of assembly and relative topology of the PsB complex proteins and show that subunit assembly is required for the cellulose binding activity. Dictyostelium discoideum cells were grown in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on SM plates to late log phase (2–3 × 108 cells/100-mm plate). Development was initiated by scraping the cells from the plates and washing away the remaining bacteria by differential centrifugation in lower pad solution buffer (20 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.5 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) (Sussman, 55Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Google Scholar). The washed cells were plated for development on sterile lower pad solution saturated black paper filters (Thomas Scientific 4740C20) at 108 cells per 40-mm diameter filter (Soll, 53Soll D.R.

The developmental stage for labeling is noted in the text for each experiment. Cells were harvested by transferring the filters to a 15-ml disposable plastic tube containing 5 ml of cold H2O.

Fibrous cellulose from cotton (Sigma C-6288) was used as the affinity matrix. The columns were washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) immediately before use. For experiments using radioactively labeled material, 0.4 g of cellulose were used for each column. 8 × 107 cells were lysed as described above. The extracts were loaded onto the columns at 4°C and allowed to interact with the cellulose for 1 h. The column was then washed with 25 column volumes of wash buffer to remove unbound proteins, followed by washing with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl to remove loosely bound proteins. Ten column volumes of wash buffer were then run through the column to remove any remaining NaCl solution. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of 6 M urea in wash buffer, followed by 10 column volumes of wash buffer, which was all collected as one fraction. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of 1% SDS in wash buffer. The fractions were concentrated using acetone precipitation or lyophilization and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Strain WS380B cells were grown, allowed to develop, and harvested at the slug stage of development as described above. These aggregates were then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing either 0.15 M cellobiose, trehalose, glucose, galactose, or in the absence of any sugars (control). Lysates were then loaded on cellulose columns pre-washed with buffers containing the respective sugars or with buffer alone (control). The columns were then washed with the same buffers. Elutions were carried out with urea as described in the previous section. The proteins in the load and urea elutions from each column were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. Identical blots were reacted with MUD102 or MUD62 to test for the presence of PsB or SP96, respectively (see Table II). Based on our earlier demonstration that the PsB complex localizes to the cellulose containing spore coat (Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the complex may have endogenous cellulose binding activity and that this activity may play a role in spore maturation. We directly tested this idea by assaying for cellulose binding proteins in extracts of migrating slug-stage cells. We rationalized that the cellulose binding activity of proteins might be masked following secretion since the proteins would be already bound to cellulose. To avoid this difficulty, we used extracts from slug-stage cells when the proteins of the complex are sequestered in the prespore vesicles which do not contain cellulose (Erdos and West, 18Erdos G.W. West C.M. Exp. Mycol. 1989; 13: 169-182Google Scholar). To assay for cellulose binding proteins, an extract of slug-stage cells was prepared and chromatographed on a column of cellulose. After loading the extract, the column was washed with 0.5 M NaCl, to remove any loosely bound proteins, followed by further elutions with 6 M urea and 1% SDS. Each elution was concentrated by lyophilization so that protein samples representing equal cell equivalents could be compared by SDS-PAGE. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the fractions showed very few proteins which were retained on the cellulose. Four protein bands at 218, 70, 40, and 30 kDa were bound and eluted with urea. Further elution with 1% SDS released more of each of these proteins, although in later experiments complete elution could be accomplished with urea alone. Silver staining revealed additional minor bands. Interestingly the 218-kDa band visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue is only faintly visible with the silver stain. Together these results confirmed that proteins do bind to cellulose, but they did not identify any of the proteins or answer the primary question of whether the PsB multiprotein complex has cellulose binding activity. To address these two issues, parallel lanes were blotted onto nitrocellulose for staining with antibodies. Staining with the MUD102 mAb demonstrated that PsB is bound to cellulose and is eluted with urea. Apparently, the concentration of the PsB protein is below that required for visualization with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (see above). Previous data indicate that all the PsB protein is in complex form (Watson et al., 62Watson N. Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar), suggesting that the entire complex binds to cellulose. Staining with MUD62 supports this contention. The MUD62 mAb recognizes both p112/SP96 and SP75 via a common fucose containing epitope. p112/SP96 is part of the PsB complex while it resides in the PSVs but SP75 is only recruited to the complex following secretion (Watson, 61Watson, N., 1994, A Developmentally Regulated Glycoprotein Complex Involved in Spore Formation in Dictyostelium discoideum, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Missouri.Google Scholar). The reactivity with MUD62 in Fig. 1 showed that p112/SP96 is bound to cellulose while SP75 did not bind. These data indicate that the entire PsB complex is specifically bound to cellulose, as SP75 is not bound (see below for further confirmation that the entire PsB complex is bound). PsB contains the MUD50 reactive O-linked oligosaccharide. We wished to determine if other proteins with this carbohydrate modification are also bound to cellulose. Studies on plants indicate that there are interactions between carbohydrates and cellulose (Varner, 1989). Therefore, we probed another Western blot with MUD50 and observed that only PsB and two other proteins of molecular masses 34 kDa and 40 kDa are bound to cellulose. These two lower molecular weight proteins are the sheathin proteins which are part of the ECM sheath that surrounds migrating slugs and have been shown to form a complex which colocalizes with cellulose (Zhou-Chou et al., 69Zhou-Chou T. Wilkins M.R. Vardy P.H. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 332-341Google Scholar). We have shown that these bands are reactive with the anti-sheathin antibody MUD51 (data not shown). Importantly, all the other MUD50 reactive glycoproteins are not retained on the cellulose, again emphasizing the specificity of the binding. Antibody JAB2 reacts with two related stalk-specific ECM components ST310 and ST430 (McRobbie et al., 39McRobbie S.J. Jermyn K.A. Duffy K. Blight K. Williams J.G. Development. 1988; 104: 275-284Google Scholar; Wallace et al., 59Wallace J.S. Morrissey J.H. Newell P.C. Cell Differ. 1984; 14: 205Google Scholar). Based on their localization to the cellulose-rich stalk, we thought that these proteins might also have in vitro cellulose binding activity. However, as is evident in Fig. 1, neither ST310 nor ST430 was bound to cellulose. The discoidin proteins are a family of cytoplasmic proteins with carbohydrate-binding (lectin) activity that are expressed during aggregation but are extremely stable and persist throughout the remainder of development (Alexander et al., 3Alexander S. Leone S. Ostermeyer E. Sydow L.M. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 418-424Google Scholar, 5Alexander S. Sydow L.M. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Differentiation. 1992; 51: 149-161Google Scholar). The discoidin proteins preferentially bind to galactose residues, but also bind to a lesser extent to other hexoses including glucose (Rosen et al., 46Rosen S.D. Kafka J.A. Simpson D.L. Barondes S.H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2554-2557Google Scholar). As expected, the discoidin proteins bind to cellulose in our assay. The discoidin proteins are most likely the 30-kDa band seen by Coomassie Brilliant Blue and silver staining as they constitute 1–2% of the cellular protein at this stage of development. The Western analyses of PsB and SP96 described above suggested that the entire PsB complex binds to cellulose. We have directly demonstrated this by pulse labeling developing WS380B cells at hourly intervals throughout morphogenesis with [35S]methionine. The labeled cells were harvested, lysed, and divided into three fractions for analysis. Part of each sample was fractionated directly by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, panel A) to show the entire spectrum of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins at each developmental stage. As in previous work (Watson et al., 62Watson N. Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar), there is a major increase in protein synthesis when the cells enter aggregates as reflected by [35S]methionine incorporation. A second aliquot of each sample was immunoprecipitated with MUD102 and panel B shows that the entire PsB complex was being synthesized at the expected developmental times. A third aliquot of each sample was affinity chromatographed on cellulose. It is clear from panel C that the entire PsB complex (i.e. all the protein subunits) is bound to cellulose. In addition, recovery of the radiolabeled proteins is essentially complete after elution with urea (compare to the corresponding MUD102 immunoprecipitations in panel B). The data show the specificity of the binding and indicate that the complex has the cellulose binding activity while residing in the PSVs prior to secretion. Having established that the PsB multiprotein complex did have cellulose binding activity, we investigated the nature of this binding. We tested the possibility that the interaction was lectin-like and could be abrogated with an exogenously added sugar hapten (Sharon, 49Sharon N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 221-226Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that this is not the case. None of the mono- and disaccharides including cellobiose (the disaccharide prepared from cellulose) were able to block the binding of the PsB complex to cellulose. As shown by staining with MUD102 and MUD62, neither the binding of PsB nor p112/SP96 to cellulose was affected by the added sugars. Again, little SP75 is bound to the cellulose demonstrating the binding specificity of the PsB complex. In contrast, the binding of the discoidin lectin proteins was inhibited by its specific hapten galactose as well as cellobiose (data not shown). Consistent with these data, we never observed PsB complex binding to other polysaccharide matrices including Sepharose and Sephadex (Watson et al., 62Watson N. Williams K.L. Alexander S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22634-22641Google Scholar). Our previous localization studies showed that the PsB protein was localized to the inner layer of the spore coat and that an associated protein, p112, was identical to an outer spore-coat protein called SP96 (Watson et al., 63Watson N. McGuire V. Alexander S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Google Scholar). The genes for SP96 as well as two other spore-coat proteins, SP70 and SP60, have been cloned and used to make a series of single, double and triple gene disruption mutants (Fosnaugh et al., 22Fosnaugh K.L. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 823-825Google Scholar). The cotA, B-, and -C genes encode SP"

https://openalex.org/W2061512163,"Bovine somatotropin was studied with respect to thermal stability, quantitative thermal denaturation kinetics, and refolding potential following thermal denaturation using a panel of 6 monoclonal antibodies and the Conformation-Sensitive Immunoassay (CSI). The antibody panel consisted of 4 conformation-dependent and 2 sequence-specific antibodies. Each of the antibodies revealed unique thermal stability profiles for their respective epitopes suggesting that they each recognize different antigenic determinants. Comparing the thermal stability profiles generated with these antibodies allowed the stability of bovine somatotropin to be “dissected” based on individual structural features. The degree to which bovine somatotropin is stabilized by disulfide bonds was examined using CSI-based quantitative thermal denaturation kinetics profiles generated under reducing and nonreducing conditions. All of the conformational epitopes unfolded faster under reducing conditions indicating that the two disulfide bonds within the somatotropin molecule impart some degree of global stabilization. The ability of bovine somatotropin to refold after reducing or nonreducing thermal denaturation was also examined using the antibody panel and the CSI. The results show that, although significant refolding was evident for some epitopes, bovine somatotropin cannot refold to the native state following thermal denaturation under either reducing or nonreducing conditions.

Conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies are becoming popular tools for investigating protein structure. Such antibodies are specific for defined conformational features and therefore allow structural studies to be focused on relatively small, defined areas of an antigen molecule. The specificity and sensitivity of conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody probes has been demonstrated repeatedly. For example, the ability of conformation-specific antibodies to detect nearly native conformational features during refolding studies at times before spectroscopic probes are able to detect native structures has been demonstrated (1Murry-Brelier A. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7633-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Likewise, the ability of monoclonal antibodies to detect conformational details that are too small to be observed with conventional spectroscopic probes has been documented (2Allen M.J. Jemmerson R. Nall B.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3967-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Collawn J.F. Wallace C.J.A. Proudfoot A.E.I. Patterson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8625-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies have also been used to study the folding of nascent peptides on ribosomes during protein synthesis, demonstrating the utility of these versatile probes in situations where spectroscopic probes are not applicable due to low analyte concentrations or the heterogeneous nature of the samples being examined (4Fedorov A.N.

Bovine somatotropin (bSt) is a protein hormone consisting of 191 amino acids and two disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues at positions 53/164 and 181/189 (5Santomé J.A. Dellacha J.M.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8520-8525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although, detailed x-ray structure of this protein is currently unavailable. Therefore, analysis of the conformational structure of bSt has generally been limited to spectroscopic measurements obtained from denaturation studies (8Brems D.N. Plaisted S.M. Havel H.A.

These studies have all provided valuable information regarding the structure of bSt on a “global” level; however, little information has been revealed regarding individual conformational features of bSt. In addition, these studies have yielded little information regarding thermal denaturation of bSt since the molecule precipitates from solution readily at elevated temperatures (15Davio S.R.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 59Google Scholar). bovine somatotropin monoclonal antibody Conformation-Sensitive Immunoassay Immobilon™-AV affinity membrane phosphate buffered saline. A panel of monoclonal antibodies to bovine somatotropin has been developed and characterized with respect to structural specificity using the Conformation-Sensitive Immunoassay (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Some of the antibodies in this panel recognize determinants (epitopes) present only on native bSt, while others demonstrate a preference for denatured bSt. Here we describe the use of the Conformation-Sensitive Immunoassay and the antibody panel to study the conformational structure of bSt via measurements of individual epitope thermal stability, denaturation kinetics, and refolding potential. The methods described in this report are generally applicable to the study of protein structure with monoclonal antibodies and may also be applied to study thermal effects on other protein-protein interactions. Bovine somatotropin was obtained from Dr. A. F. Parlow of the University of California at Los Angeles. The protein was solubilized in 30 mM NaHCO3, 150 mM NaCl (pH 10.8) to yield a 10 mg/ml solution and then diluted to working concentrations (see text) in PBS (10 mM KPO4 buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.3). Production and preliminary characterization of the six bSt-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been described previously (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Qualitative CSI analyses of these antibodies has shown that Anti-bSt mAbs 1–3 recognize only native bSt while Anti-bSt-4 is capable of binding native and denatured bSt. Anti-bSt-7 is able to recognize native bSt and bSt denatured under nonreducing conditions, but fails to bind to bSt denatured under reducing conditions. Anti-bSt-16 was shown to exhibit significant reactivity with denatured bSt only. Analysis of bSt was performed as outlined in Fig. 1 using a modification of the CSI procedure previously reported (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immobilon™-AV affinity membranes (IAV), with a pore size of 0.65 µm, were obtained from Millipore. The membranes were prewet in PBS, and bSt samples (40 µl) were spotted onto membranes using a Bio-Dot™ vacuum filtration manifold (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then incubated at 25°C for 16–18 h between two sheets of blotting paper prewet in PBS to maximize the amount of protein in covalent complexes with IAV. Unbound IAV reactive sites were capped with 10% monoethanolamine in 1 M NaHCO3 for 20 min (and rinsed with distilled H2O) either before (reversible mode) or after (irreversible mode) the conformation of IAV-bound bSt was altered via thermal denaturation (±0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol). The denaturation times and temperatures used in each study are detailed in the figure legends. In all cases, IAV-bSt complexes were cooled to ambient temperature and rinsed 3 times in distilled H20 before the effects of denaturation were determined with mAbs using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods as described previously (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Under irreversible denaturing conditions, antigen was covalently bound to IAV and thermally denatured (±0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol) before capping the membrane reactive sites, thereby allowing the free reactive sites on the membrane to trap the antigen in a non-native configuration upon unfolding. Reversible denaturation was performed to examine antigen refolding following thermal denaturation by covalently binding the antigen to IAV and capping the membrane reactive sites with 10% monoethanolamine in 1 M NaHCO3 prior to antigen denaturation. Antigen titrations (standard curves) were prepared using each antibody to identify bSt concentrations that yielded a linear relationship between bSt concentration and spot optical density. All of the titrations were performed under native CSI conditions with the exception of that for Anti-bSt-16 which employed bSt that was denatured under irreversible reducing CSI conditions (100°C, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. All denaturation studies were performed using bSt concentrations within the linear range determined for each antibody. Quantitative relative reactivity values were calculated by interpolating optical densities of test spots from the standard curves. These quantitative values were expressed as a percent of the reactivity observed with native bSt (“% native”), or in the case of Anti-bSt-16, as a percent of the reactivity observed with denatured/reduced bSt (“% denatured”). Bovine somatotropin was applied to IAV (40-µl spots at 1.6 mg/ml) and treated under reducing conditions at 45°C using the irreversible and reversible CSI modes. The degree of disulfide bond reduction was determined after various denaturation times by incubating the bSt-IAV complexes for 10 min in lucifer yellow iodoacetamide dipotassium salt (Molecular Probes) at 0.1 mg/ml in PBS. The membranes were rinsed with distilled H20, dried, and photographed under UV light (254 nm). The photograph was scanned via reflectance densitometry, and results were normalized with respect to a standard curve of varying bSt concentrations processed under irreversible reducing conditions at 100°C for 5 min (100% free SH). Samples for NMR analysis were prepared by dissolving bSt as described above and diluting in PBS to obtain a solution with a concentration of 1 mg/ml and a pH of 9.7. The solution was then lyophilized to a dry cake and dissolved in D2O (Isotec 99.96% D) to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml and was adjusted with 1 M DCl to a final pD of 7.4. The pD measurement was not corrected for possible isotope effects on the glass electrode. The 1H spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 operating at 500.13 MHz using an inverse 5-mm Bruker triple resonance z-axis gradient probe. Each spectrum was collected using 600 µl of the protein solution, 64 transients, 16K data points, a spectral width of 6 kHz, an acquisition time of 1.3 s, and a HDO presaturation delay of 2 s. An exponential multiplication of 2 Hz was used prior to Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts are expressed relative to the internal standard, sodium-3-trimethylsilyl propionate 2,2,3,3-d4 (0.0 ppm). Optimization of the original (qualitative) CSI method was accomplished for each antibody by establishing a fixed concentration of antibody (0.5 µg/ml) and determining antigen concentrations that allowed for a linear relationship between antigen concentration and spot density. The antigen concentrations yielding linear response for each antibody are shown in Table I, and typical standard curves prepared for two mAbs are shown in Fig. 2. In most cases, native antigen was used for preparing standard curves. However, quantitative analysis with Anti-bSt-16 (specific for a sequence exposed only upon denaturation) could only be performed by preparing a standard curve using denatured/reduced antigen. Initial attempts to measure conformational alterations of bSt using our panel of mAbs focused on the stability of the respective epitopes at various temperatures. Thermal stability profiles of each bSt epitope probed by the mAbs were prepared by performing the CSI at varying temperatures for a fixed period of time (Fig. 3). All six of the epitopes examined demonstrated unique thermal stabilities, suggesting that each antibody recognizes a unique determinant. The unique nature of each epitope was subsequently confirmed by competitive sandwich immunoassays and assays involving bSt analogs (data not shown). The epitope corresponding to Anti-bSt-1 demonstrated the lowest thermal stability with significant epitope modifications detected at temperatures as low as 45°C and almost total loss of reactivity at or above 50°C. In contrast, Anti-bSt-16 was capable of detecting significant changes in bSt structure only at temperatures above 70°C. The epitope for Anti-bSt-7 remained intact across the entire range of temperatures examined. However, a temperature-dependant loss of reactivity was observed for this epitope when a similar thermal stability experiment was carried out under reducing conditions (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous studies which showed that Anti-bSt-7 loses reactivity with bSt only after the antigen is denatured under reducing conditions (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The thermal stability profile generated for the Anti-bSt-4 epitope is initially consistent with that of a partially buried sequence epitope (enhanced reactivity at elevated temperatures), but reactivity was found to decrease at temperatures above 75°C. Evidence from kinetic studies (below) indicates that the decrease in Anti-bSt-4 epitope reactivity noted after the initial enhancement is not due to epitope denaturation or degradation, but is instead the result of an as yet unexplained assay artifact. Comparing thermal stability profiles of bSt prepared using different denaturation times indicates that the temperature at which conformational alterations occur for each epitope is inversely proportional to the denaturation time used (data not shown). This observation indicates that heat-induced unfolding of bSt is kinetically controlled and does not reflect a temperature-dependent equilibrium. Therefore, denaturation kinetics of the epitopes probed by the mAb panel were investigated. Denaturation kinetics profiles were prepared under reducing and nonreducing conditions for each epitope (Fig. 4). The temperatures used for this analysis were tailored to each epitope based on the thermal stabilities described above. Since different temperatures were used to prepare the denaturation kinetics profiles for different epitopes, the unfolding kinetics for the various epitopes cannot be compared directly. However, the effect of different denaturation conditions (such as reducing versus nonreducing conditions) can be compared for each individual epitope. The rate of unfolding for the epitope corresponding to Anti-bSt-1 was accelerated in the presence of reducing agent. Similar accelerated denaturation kinetics were noted under reducing conditions for Anti-bSt mAbs 2, 3, and 7. The unfolding of bSt to reveal the buried epitope of Anti-bSt-16 was likewise accelerated under reducing conditions. The denaturation kinetics profiles generated for the Anti-bSt-4 epitope were more complicated than those generated for the other epitopes examined. Under nonreducing conditions, this epitope exhibited a rapid increase in reactivity, presumably due to improved surface accessibility of the partially buried epitope, followed by a slower loss of reactivity to levels below that noted on native bSt. These data agree (qualitatively) with the thermal stability profile described for the Anti-bSt-4 epitope under nonreducing conditions above (Fig. 3). Under reducing conditions, the initial enhancement of reactivity observed for this mAb is greater in magnitude, but the subsequent loss of reactivity does not fall below the reactivity noted with native bSt. Failure of this epitope to reveal a significant loss of reactivity under reducing conditions indicates that the loss noted under the less harsh nonreducing conditions is not a result of denatured or degraded epitope structure. Instead, these results may be indicative of different unfolding pathways under different denaturation conditions resulting in potential differences in antigen/membrane association or covering of the epitope by other regions of the molecule as it unfolds. The ability of bSt to refold following thermal denaturation in the presence or absence of reducing agent was examined by repeating the denaturation kinetics studies using the reversible CSI mode (Fig. 5). Anti-bSt mAbs 1 and 2 failed to detect any significant refolding of their respective epitopes following thermal denaturation under reducing conditions. Anti-bSt mAbs 3, 4, 7, and 16 indicate that a significant amount of refolding occurs in some areas of the molecule after reducing denaturation, although refolding is less than complete after “long” denaturation times as indicated by Anti-bSt mAbs 3 and 7. The refolding potential of bSt after nonreducing thermal denaturation was good in the areas of the Anti-bSt-4 and Anti-bSt-16 epitopes. However, the reactivity of the Anti-bSt-1 and Anti-bSt-2 epitopes was actually lower on “refolded” bSt than on bSt trapped in the denatured form using the irreversible CSI mode under the same time and temperature conditions. Similar results were obtained for the Anti-bSt-3 epitope after short denaturation times. These decreased reactivities noted with refolded bSt are statistically significant and suggest that some conformational features of the refolded protein are formed incorrectly. The results from CSI analysis of bSt suggest that significant conformational modifications are imparted on the bSt molecule in the temperature range of 45–50°C. In order to confirm that the mAbs were detecting “real” conformational alterations at these low temperatures, we probed the structure of bSt at various temperatures in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Even at these relatively low temperatures, analysis of the NMR spectra is hampered by the solution stability of bSt. A 2 mg/ml solution of bSt is clear at room temperature, slightly cloudy at 37°C, and heavily precipitated at 55°C. This behavior alone suggests that significant conformational changes, leading to aggregation and precipitation of bSt, are occurring across this temperature range. The 1H spectrum of bSt at 27°C contains broad regions of overlapping resonances consistent with a folded protein in the 20-kDa molecular mass range. The aromatic region of the 1H spectrum, at several temperatures, is shown in Fig. 6. Spectra obtained at increased temperatures, (Fig. 6, B → D), illustrate that the protein still contains secondary/tertiary structure at elevated temperatures, but that the structure has changed somewhat from the native structure observed at room temperature. This is illustrated by the resonances labeled I and II (Fig. 6D), which have been assigned previously to the six tyrosine 2′,6′ and 3′,5′ aromatic protons, respectively (17Holzman T.F. Dougherty J.J. Brems D.N. MacKenzie N.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At 50°C, the average chemical shifts for these resonances are 7.70 and 6.95 ppm, which is consistent with those observed for random coil tyrosine residues (18Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. WileyInterscience, New York1986: 17Google Scholar). While the tyrosine resonances may experience a microenvironment more similar to a denatured protein, the chemical shifts of at least two other residues are not affected by this temperature range. The resonances labeled H and P have been assigned previously to the histidine C2H and phenylalanine aromatic protons, respectively (17Holzman T.F. Dougherty J.J. Brems D.N. MacKenzie N.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19MacKenzie N.E. Plaisted S.M. Brems D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 99: 166-171Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Each of these resonances experience a temperature-induced line narrowing, but do not experience a deviation in chemical shift. This suggests that the microenvironment surrounding these residues has not been altered significantly by temperature. Together, these results support the CSI data, suggesting that bSt exists in a partially unfolded state after incubation at 45–50°C for 4–5 min. Experiments designed to examine the kinetics of bSt disulfide bond reduction (under irreversible CSI conditions) and the potential for reoxidation of the disulfide bonds in bSt following reducing denaturation (reversible CSI), were performed to further validate the results described above for CSI analysis of bSt. Under irreversible CSI conditions, reduction of the two disulfide bridges in bSt was rapid and complete at 45°C (Fig. 7), and the rate of reduction was accelerated at higher temperatures (data not shown). No apparent reoxidation was observed following reduction under irreversible CSI conditions since the denatured and reduced protein was restrained by covalent interactions with the IAV support. The loss of disulfide bond structure under irreversible conditions appears to proceed faster than denaturation of the Anti-bSt-7 epitope which is directly stabilized by the disulfide bond formed between cysteine residues at positions 181 and 189 (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of disulfide bonds following reversible reducing CSI treatments revealed a multiphasic reoxidation profile indicating that some disulfide reoxidation is possible when the molecule is not constrained by covalent interactions with IAV. After short reducing denaturation incubations at 45°C, approximately 50% of the disulfide structures had reformed (Fig. 7). The potential for disulfide bond reoxidation was found to diminish as the denaturation incubation was extended. This diminished reoxidation potential appears to parallel a similar decrease in Anti-bSt-7 epitope refolding potential. The Conformation-Sensitive Immunoassay (CSI) has been applied to investigate bovine somatotropin (bSt) structure using a panel of bSt-specific antibodies. The CSI is ideally suited for this application because it allows one to: 1) measure quantitative thermal denaturation kinetics of individual epitopes; 2) limit refolding of the test protein after thermal denaturation by covalently trapping regions of the protein as they unfold (irreversible mode); and, 3) characterize conformational features with respect to refolding potential after thermal denaturation (reversible mode). The CSI also eliminates potential aggregation and precipitation commonly observed in solution-based thermal denaturation studies by immobilizing the test protein on a hydrophilic membrane support that minimizes surface denaturation commonly observed with other solid phase immunoassays. CSI-based thermal stability analysis of bSt revealed a wide range of stabilities for different epitopes. These results suggest that different antibodies are best suited for investigating specific stages of bSt denaturation. The Anti-bSt-1 epitope is the most thermally labile of all the epitopes studied here. This epitope exhibited significant structural modification after incubating bSt at temperatures as low as 45°C for periods as short as 4 min and showed a total loss of reactivity after a 4-min incubation at 50°C. These results contrast with those from a previous study where conformation-sensitive mAbs were unable to detect denaturation of bSt after the hormone was incubated for 30 min at 50°C (20Secchi C. Berrini A. Borromeo V. Gamba D. Brocchi E. Hybridoma. 1991; 10: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These differences may suggest that the mAbs used in each investigation demonstrate specificity to different epitopes, or, alternatively, these differences may be related to the different assay formats used in the two studies. The previous study (20Secchi C. Berrini A. Borromeo V. Gamba D. Brocchi E. Hybridoma. 1991; 10: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) involved heating bSt in solution and subsequently applying the heat-treated protein into the wells of a microtiter plate where it was probed with conformation-sensitive antibodies. It is possible that the conformational epitopes being probed in that study refolded when the partially denatured protein was cooled (prior to incubation with antibody), since no mechanism was used to maintain the denatured state of the hormone upon cooling. In contrast, however, the irreversible mode of the CSI prevents potential antigen renaturation by trapping the antigen in a denatured state prior to cooling and subsequent analysis with antibodies (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of bSt at 45–50°C by NMR supports the data obtained with the CSI by revealing changes in bSt structure at these low temperatures. Total loss of binding exhibited by a conformation-specific antibody such as Anti-bSt-1 upon antigen denaturation cannot be interpreted as an indication of complete antigen denaturation. Instead, such results can only be viewed as an indication that the conformational modifications that have occurred are significant enough to disrupt specific spatial arrangement necessary for antibody binding. Because of this limitation, the CSI is unable to distinguish the difference between complete and partial denaturation of some epitopes on bSt. The exact binding sites of the antibodies in the panel of mAbs used here have not yet been determined. However, the thermal stability profiles generated by these antibodies do offer some clues as to the types of structures recognized by each antibody and the intramolecular forces that stabilize them. For example, it is likely Anti-bSt mAbs 1 and 2 recognize conformational features that are not stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the epitopes for these mAbs are altered by temperatures of only 45–50°C, but that temperatures in excess of 60°C are necessary for disrupting hydrophobic interactions (21Volkin D.B. Middaugh C.R. Ahern T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 215-247Google Scholar). The epitope corresponding to Anti-bSt-3, on the other hand, may be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions since it is stable (at least for several minutes) at somewhat higher temperatures. Previous analysis of the Anti-bSt-7 epitope suggested that this epitope is directly stabilized by the disulfide bond between the cysteine residues at positions 181 and 189 (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The effects of this stabilization are clearly observed when denaturation kinetics of this epitope under reducing and nonreducing conditions are compared. None of the other conformational epitopes examined with the panel of mAbs were found to be stabilized directly by disulfide bonds since each conformation-specific mAb detected epitope denaturation under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. However, the fact that all of the conformation-specific mAbs, as well as the denatured-specific mAb (Anti-bSt-16), revealed accelerated denaturation kinetics under reducing conditions suggests that the two disulfide bridges of bSt impart some degree of indirect global stabilization to the entire hormone molecule. A simple exponential decay of bSt disulfide bond structure was observed using lucifer yellow iodoacetamide to probe bSt denaturation under irreversible reducing conditions. However, a biphasic profile would be expected if reduction of the two bonds occurred sequentially. These data suggest, therefore, that reduction of the two bonds occurs concurrently under these conditions. In contrast, reversible CSI analysis of disulfide bond structure did result in a biphasic profile, with approximately 50% of the bonds reforming after relatively short reducing denaturation incubations at 45°C. This observation suggests that either: 1) both disulfide bridges of bSt reoxidize to some degree and that the combined total reoxidation equals 50% of the disulfide bonds in the IAV-bound protein, or 2) one of the two bonds reforms in all of the IAV-bound molecules while the other bridge remains reduced in essentially all molecules. We favor the latter explanation because the Anti-bSt-7 epitope exhibits complete refolding under identical conditions, suggesting that the 181/189 disulfide bridge reoxidizes in essentially all bSt molecules while the 53/164 bond remains reduced. Further support of this explanation is provided by the fact that the loss of reoxidation potential after longer denaturation times correlates with a similar loss of refolding potential for the Anti-bSt-7 epitope (181/189 disulfide bridge). Analysis of bSt denaturation using Anti-bSt-16 and the reversible CSI mode indicates that significant refolding of bSt is possible after thermal denaturation under reducing and nonreducing conditions. However, several of the epitopes examined in this study failed to exhibit complete refolding under the same conditions. Failure to regain native structure following thermal denaturation was most evident for the epitopes recognized by Anti-bSt mAbs 1 and 2. These epitopes showed little difference between irreversible and reversible denaturation profiles after denaturing under reducing conditions. While these results appear to indicate that no refolding occurred in the areas of these epitopes, it is also likely that some degree of refolding did occur, but that the refolding was not sufficient to restore the specific spatial orientation of antigen domains necessary for antibody binding. Similarly, the elimination of Anti-bSt-16 epitope reactivity following reversible CSI treatment does not imply that the antigen has regained native structure. Rather, these results only indicate that the refolding that has occurred was sufficient to cover the Anti-bSt-16 epitope making it inaccessible for antibody binding. The reasons that bSt fails to refold completely following thermal denaturation are not known. Previous studies have demonstrated that disulfide bond “scrambling” may play a role in irreversible thermal denaturation of some proteins (22Zale S.E. Klibanov A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5432-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that this is a significant factor in the irreversibility of bSt thermal denaturation since the Anti-bSt-7 epitope, which is dependent on the 181/189 disulfide bridge, demonstrates good reactivity after reversible CSI analysis. Chemical modifications induced at elevated temperatures have also been identified as possible causes for irreversible denaturation of proteins (21Volkin D.B. Middaugh C.R. Ahern T.J. Manning M.C. Stability of Protein Pharmaceuticals. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992: 215-247Google Scholar). These modifications generally occur at temperatures higher than those used for denaturation of conformational features in the CSI and also generally require longer incubations than those employed here. Therefore, it is unlikely that chemical alterations of bSt are responsible for the refolding problems. Likewise, the aggregation of proteins that commonly occurs during thermal denaturation studies also cannot explain the irreversible thermal denaturation of bSt since the test protein was immobilized on a solid support during denaturation. A more plausible explanation of the irreversible thermal denaturation of proteins such as bSt has been offered by Klibanov and Mozhaev (23Klibanov A.M. Mozhaev V.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1012-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) after investigating thermal denaturation of immobilized trypsin. Their data support the theory that non-native intramolecular interactions occur during refolding of thermally denatured proteins and that these interactions remain after the protein is cooled to ambient temperatures. Once cooled, the presence of these non-native interactions may prevent the protein from forming its native structure spontaneously. The presence of such non-native interactions may explain the apparently incorrect refolding of bSt detected in the areas of the Anti-bSt-1 and Anti-bSt-2 epitopes when the reversible CSI was performed under nonreducing conditions. The data presented in this report enhance our understanding of bSt structure by probing the denaturation and renaturation behavior of specific conformational features of the molecule. We have previously reported the ability of the CSI to correctly characterize conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies to proteins other than bSt (16Pfund W.P. Bourdage J.S. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that the methods described here may be generally applicable to the study of denaturation and renaturation behavior of globular proteins. In particular, however, we have demonstrated the utility of these techniques for the analysis of proteins, like bSt, that demonstrate poor solubility upon denaturation.
