https://openalex.org/W2058396154,"The prefrontal cortex is involved in the cognitive process of working memory. Local injections of SCH23390 and SCH39166, selective antagonists of the D1 dopamine receptor, into the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys induced errors and increased latency in performance on an oculomotor task that required memory-guided saccades. The deficit was dose-dependent and sensitive to the duration of the delay period. These D1 antagonists had no effect on performance in a control task requiring visually guided saccades, indicating that sensory and motor functions were unaltered. Thus, D1 dopamine receptors play a selective role in the mnemonic, predictive functions of the primate prefrontal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1979341555,"As a prerequisite for the activation of MPF, the cdc2 protein kinase must undergo tyrosine dephosphorylation. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the cdc25 protein activates the cdc2 protein kinase once DNA replication has been completed. We have produced the cdc25 protein in bacteria and shown that it activates MPF in Xenopus extracts. In extracts that normally cannot enter mitosis owing to inhibition of DNA synthesis, the addition of active cdc25 protein efficiently elicits the mitotic state by inducing premature dephosphorylation of tyrosine on the cdc2 protein. The cdc25-dependent activation reaction can be reconstituted in a partially purified system lacking ATP. These biochemical experiments demonstrate that the cdc25 protein actively drives tyrosine dephosphorylation of the cdc2 protein and offer the prospect for characterizing the individual factors that regulate the activation of MPF during the progression from S phase to mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2073075045,"Preprotein translocation in E. coli requires ATP, the membrane electrochemical potential ΔμH+, and translocase, an enzyme with an ATPase domain (SecA) and the membrane-embedded . Studies of translocase and proOmpA reveal a five-step catalytic cycle: First, proOmpA binds to the SecA domain. Second, SecA binds ATP. Third, ATP-binding energy permits translocation of ∼20 residues of proOmpA. Fourth, ATP hydrolysis releases proOmpA. ProOmpA may then rebind to SecA and reenter this cycle, allowing progress through a series of transmembrane intermediates. In the absence of ΔμH+ or association with SecA, proOmpA passes backward through the membrane, but moves forward when either ATP and SecA or a membrane electrochemical potential is supplied. However, in the presence of ΔμH+ (fifth step), proOmpA rapidly completes translocation. ΔμH+ — driven translocation is blocked by SecA plus nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, indicating that ΔμH+ drives translocation when ATP and proOmpA are not bound to SecA."
https://openalex.org/W1497298414,"Despite antibiotic therapy, the septic shock syndrome continues to have a high mortality. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL 1), two polypeptide cytokines produced during sepsis, are thought to mediate the hypotension and tissue damage of shock. In the present studies, rabbits were infused with Escherichia coli organisms to produce shock. The IL 1 receptor antagonist (IL 1ra), which competes with IL 1 for occupancy of the IL 1 cell-surface receptors without agonist properties, was given 15 min before the bacterial infusion and during the subsequent 4 h. In saline-treated controls, hypotension was sustained for 4 h and death occurred for two of five rabbits; in rabbits treated with the IL 1ra, however, blood pressure was only transiently decreased, returned to pre-E. coli levels, and no deaths occurred. The associated leukopenia was also reduced by treatment with the antagonist (P < 0.05). Histological examination of lung tissues showed reduced infiltrating neutrophils in the IL 1ra treatment group. Despite the attenuated responses in animals treated with the IL 1ra, circulating TNF and IL 1 levels were nearly identical in both groups. We conclude that specific blockade of IL 1 at the receptor level demonstrates an essential role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of septic shock.—Wakabayashi, G.; Gelfand, J. A.; Burke, J. F.; Thompson, R. C.; Dinarello, C. A. A specific receptor antagonist for interleukin 1 prevents Escherichia coli-induced shock in rabbits. FASEB J. 5: 338–343; 1991."

https://openalex.org/W2063627391,"We have studied the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43 after injury to the axons of adult rat retinal ganglion cells (CNS neurons that do not normally regenerate injured axons). Both the biosynthetic labeling of GAP-43 and the GAP-43 immunoreactivity of the retina increased after axotomy, but only when the injury was within 3 mm of the eye. These results suggest the following conclusions: First, axon injury is sufficient to alter GAP-43 expression in CNS neurons, even in the absence of regeneration. Second, mechanisms that regulate GAP-43 expression are sensitive to the length of uninterrupted axon remaining after injury. Finally, the conditions that favor increased GAP-43 are similar to those that favor regrowth of injured CNS axons into grafts of peripheral nerve, suggesting that GAP-43 induction is accompanied by an increased potential of injured CNS neurons to regenerate."
https://openalex.org/W1996061686,"The in vivo function of the microtubule motor protein kinesin was examined in Drosophila using genetics and immunolocalization. Kinesin heavy chain mutations (khc) cause abnormal behavior and lethality. Mutant larvae exhibit loss of mobility and tactile responsiveness in the most posterior segments, followed by general paralysis and death during larval or pupal development. Adults homozygous for a temperature-sensitive allele also exhibit a loss in mobility and sensory responses. The data indicate that kinesin function is essential and suggest that kinesin has an important role in the neuromuscular system, perhaps as a motor for axonal transport. The possibility of more general cellular functions remains open, but observation of embryogenesis and morphogenesis in khc mutants suggests that mitosis and the cell cycle can proceed in spite of impaired kinesin function. Immunolocalization suggests that kinesin may have some general cellular functions but that it is not a major component of mitotic spindles."
https://openalex.org/W2069252364,"Cellular factors controlling alternative splicing of precursor messenger RNA are largely unknown, even though this process plays a central role in specifying the diversity of proteins in the eukaryotic cell. For the identification of such factors, a segment of the rat preprotachykinin gene was used in which differential expression of neuropeptides gamma and K is dependent on alternative splicing of the fourth exon (E4). Sequence variants of the three-exon segment, (E3-E4-E5) were created, resulting in a sensitive assay for factors mediating the splicing switch between E4-skipping and E4-inclusion. A dinucleotide mutation in the 5' splice site of E4 that increase base-pairing of this site to U1 small nuclear RNA resulted in uniform selection of E4, whereas a control mutation that destroyed base-pairing resulted in uniform E4-skipping. Affinity selection of spliceosomes formed on these functionally distinct substrates revealed that the extreme difference in splicing was mediated by differential binding of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) to the 5' splice site of E4. These data show that, apart from its established role in selecting 5' splice sites, U1 snRNP plays a fundamental role in 3' exon selection and provides insight into possible mechanisms of alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1518065087,"Cyclophilins are a class of ubiquitous proteins with yet unknown function. They were originally discovered as the major binding proteins for the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. The only known catalytic function of these proteins in vitro is the cis/trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds in oligopeptides. This became clear after the discovery that bovine cyclophilin is identical with porcine prolyl isomerase. This enzyme accelerates slow, proline-limited steps in the refolding of several proteins. Here we demonstrate that the cyclophilins from man, pig, Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli are all active as prolyl isomerases and as catalysts of protein folding. This evolutionary conservation suggests that catalysis of prolyl peptide bond isomerization may be an important function of the cyclophilins. It could be related with de novo protein folding or be involved in regulatory processes. Catalysis of folding is very efficient in the presence of the high cellular concentrations of prolyl isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1671872449,"The ability of metal ions to damage DNA and cause mutagenesis has been analyzed with reversion and forward mutation assays using single-stranded DNA templates. We previously reported that incubation of phi X174 am3 DNA with Fe2+ in vitro results in mutagenesis when the treated DNA is transfected into Escherichia coli spheroplasts (Loeb, L. A., James, E. A., Waltersdorph, A. M., and Klebanoff, S. J. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 3918-3922, 1988). We now extend these studies to other metal ions. Of the metal ions tested, copper ions were the most mutagenic; the frequency of mutants produced was equal to or greater than that produced by Fe2+. Mutagenesis by Cu+ was diminished by catalase, mannitol, and superoxide dismutase suggesting the involvement of H2O2, hydroxyl ions, and superoxide, respectively. However, the findings that Cu+ and Cu2+ are nearly equally mutagenic and that the mutagenic activities are not completely inhibited by oxygen free radical scavengers make it unlikely that the mechanism for mutagenesis is simply the production of hydroxyl free radicals. The spectra of mutations produced by either copper ion using the lacZ gene as a target are very similar and differ from those reported with other agents. The predominant mutagenic sequence changes are single-base substitutions, the most frequent being replacement of a template C by a T. This transition presumably results from mispairing of an altered C with deoxyadenosine. Copper-induced mutations are not randomly distributed. Instead, they are found predominantly in clusters suggesting direct interaction of copper ions with specific nucleotide sequences in DNA. Evidence is considered that the high frequency of C—-T transitions may be a common manifestation of DNA damage by oxygen radicals."
https://openalex.org/W2046694802,"Chimeric gene fusions between 4.4 kb of rod opsin 5' flanking sequence fused to a diphtheria toxin gene and 4.4 kb or 500 bp of rod opsin 5' flanking sequence fused to the E. coli IacZ gene were used to generate transgenic mice for analysis of cell type-specific expression and temporal and spatial distribution of reporter gene product during retinal development. Opsin-diphtheria toxin transgene expression evoked photoreceptor-specific cell death. The 4.4 kb opsin-IacZ transgene followed temporal and spatial gradients of expression that approximate opsin expression. The 500 bp opsin fragment targeted expression to photoreceptors, but expression was weaker and nonuniform, suggesting that elements located upstream may be required for enhanced and uniform spatial expression."
https://openalex.org/W1491701960,"Studies were initiated to investigate whether mechanisms exist within mitochondria to repair damage incurred by mitochondrial DNA after exposure to alkylating toxins. A clonal isolate from a rat insulinoma cell line was utilized to measure the formation and repair of alkali-labile sites within the mitochondrial genome after exposure to the alkylating antibiotic streptozotocin. Alkali-labile sites were formed in mitochondrial DNA in a dose-dependent fashion. Eight hours after exposure to the toxin, 55% of the lesions were removed. The level of repair increased to 70% after 24 h. In comparison, only 46% of N7-methylguanines were removed across the entire cellular genome. These studies demonstrate that streptozotocin causes appreciable mitochondrial DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner and provide the first evidence that a repair mechanism for alkali-labile sites is present within the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1989575075,"The mos proto-oncogene product, pp39mos, is a protein kinase and has been equated with cytostatic factor (CSF), an activity in unfertilized eggs that is thought to be responsible for the arrest of meiosis at metaphase II. The biochemical properties and potential substrates of pp39mos were examined in unfertilized eggs and in transformed cells in order to study how the protein functions both as CSF and in transformation. The pp39mos protein associated with polymers under conditions that favor tubulin oligomerization and was present in an approximately 500-kilodalton ""core"" complex under conditions that favor depolymerization. β-Tubulin was preferentially coprecipitated in pp39mos immunoprecipitates and was the major phosphorylated product in a pp39mos-dependent immune complex kinase assay. Immunofluorescence analysis of NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Xenopus c-mos showed that pp39mos colocalizes with tubulin in the spindle during metaphase and in the midbody and asters during telophase. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole affected tubulin and pp39mos organization in the same way. It therefore appears that pp39mos is a tubulin-associated protein kinase and may thus participate in the modification of microtubules and contribute to the formation of the spindle. This activity expressed during interphase in somatic cells may be responsible for the transforming activity of pp39mos."
https://openalex.org/W1666626663,"SecA interacts with presecretory proteins through recognition of the positive charge at the amino terminus of the signal peptide (Akita, M., Sasaki, S., Matsuyama, S., and Mizushima, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8164-8169). A large variety of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments of SecA were prepared in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. SecA analogues were then reconstituted from them and examined for their ability to cross-link with [35S]proOmpF-Lpp, a presecretory protein, in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. The reconstituted SecA analogues were active in the cross-linking with proOmpF-Lpp when the SecA fragments used were large enough to structurally complement each other. The cross-linking was signal peptide-dependent and suppressed in the presence of other presecretory proteins. The cross-linking was enhanced in the presence of ATP. The SecA fragments that cross-linked with proOmpF-Lpp were then analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The cross-linking preferentially took place on fragments possessing the amino terminus of SecA. Weak cross-linking was also observed with carboxyl-terminal fragments when they were large enough. The smallest amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments with which the cross-linking was observed were 39 and 72 kDa, respectively. From these results, the region responsible for the cross-linking with presecretory proteins was deduced to be located between amino acid residues 267 and 340 from the amino terminus of SecA. These results are discussed in relation to the structure and function of SecA."
https://openalex.org/W2005363350,"9-O-acetylation of sialic acids is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. We have selectively destroyed these O-acetyl groups during murine embryogenesis by expressing the 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid-specific esterase of influenza C. DNA constructs driven by the metallothionein promoter arrested development at the 2-cell stage and gave a markedly decreased yield of live mice. A similar construct driven by the phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase promoter did not cause this block, but gave transgenic mice with selective expression of esterase in the retina and the adrenal gland. These organs showed variable abnormalities in organization, while all other tissues examined appeared normal. The ganglioside 9-O-acetyl-GD3 was selectively destroyed in target tissues. Thus, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids may play an role in murine development at the 2-cell stage and in certain differentiated tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1536336106,"In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa the biosynthesis of carotenoids is regulated by blue light. Here we report the characterization of the albino-3 (al-3) gene of N. crassa, which encodes the carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthetase. This is the first geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthetase gene isolated. Nucleotide sequence comparison of al-3 genomic and cDNA clones revealed that the al-3 gene is not interrupted by introns. Transcription of the al-3 gene has been examined in dark-grown and light-induced mycelia. The analysis revealed that the al-3 gene is not expressed in the dark and that its transcription is induced by blue light (Nelson, M. A., Morelli, G., Carattoli, A., Romano, N., and Macino, G. (1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1271-1276). The al-3 gene encodes a polypeptide of 428 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of al-3 with the sequences of prenyltransferases of other species, from bacteria to humans, showed three highly conserved homologous regions. These homologous regions may be involved in the formation of the catalytic site of the prenyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1598963691,"In this study the effects of A23187 and thapsigargin on the degradation of T-cell antigen receptor-beta (TCR-beta) and CD3-delta in the endoplasmic reticulum have been studied. Preliminary experiments showed that these drugs had different effects on the secretory pathway. Depletion of cellular calcium pools by incubation of cells with A23187 in calcium-free medium blocked transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus whereas thapsigargin caused a modest increase in transport. When added to cells transfected with TCR-beta or CD3-delta the drugs caused an immediate stimulation of proteolysis of presynthesized protein and at maximum effective concentrations caused a 3-fold increase in the rate of degradation. They did not affect the lag period of 1 h which precedes degradation of newly synthesized proteins. Chelation of cytosolic calcium also accelerated degradation, suggesting that depletion of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum was the main stimulus of proteolysis and that increased degradation was not caused by a transient increase in cytosolic calcium levels. The selectivity of degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum was maintained. A23187 had no effect on the stability of CD3-gamma nor co-transfected epsilon-beta dimers. Calcium depletion increased the overall rate of degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum and increased the rate of proteolysis of an anchor minus beta chain. The results suggested that proteolysis within the endoplasmic reticulum may be regulated by the high concentrations of Ca2+ which are stored in the organelle. Ca2+ may be required for protein folding. Calcium depletion may have caused the beta and delta chains to adopt a conformation that was more susceptible to proteolysis. Alternatively, calcium depletion may have disrupted the lumenal content of the endoplasmic reticulum and increased the access of proteases to potential substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1998303008,"A mathematical model of cell cycle progression is presented, which integrates recent biochemical information on the interaction of the maturation promotion factor (MPF) and cyclin. The model retrieves the dynamics observed in early embryos and explains how multiple cycles of MPF activity can be produced and how the internal clock that determines durations and number of cycles can be adjusted by modulating the rate of change in MPF or cyclin concentrations. Experiments are suggested for verifying the role of MPF activity in determining the length of the somatic cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1515069540,"Interactions between SecA and cellular components involved in the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli were studied by examining changes in the sensitivity of SecA to staphylococcal protease V8. In the presence of ATP, the amino-terminal 95-kDa portion of the SecA molecule became highly resistant to V8 digestion. Adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (ATP gamma S) and ADP were as effective as ATP. For the effect, ATP could be partly replaced by CTP and UTP, but not GTP, as in the case of the protein translocation reaction. In the presence of proOmpA, a presecretory protein, on the other hand, SecA became more sensitive to V8 digestion. The signal peptide region was involved in this effect. The V8-digestion profile in the presence of both proOmpA and ATP or ADP was the same as that in the presence of proOmpA alone. Consistently, proOmpA-induced discharge of ADP or ATP gamma S from SecA was observed by means of flow dialysis. SecA-deprived everted membrane vesicles and an E. coli phospholipid mixture were also effective in making SecA more sensitive to V8 digestion. Among the phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were effective, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine was not. It is suggested that SecA directly interacts with these cellular components and the interactions result in changes in the conformation of SecA. The physiological significance of such interactions in protein secretion is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551177506,"Effects of troponin phosphorylation on Ca2(+)-stimulated MgATPase activity of bovine cardiac actomyosin were examined. Phosphorylation by protein kinase C of troponin I and troponin T subunits in troponin or troponin-tropomyosin complex resulted in a decreased Ca2(+)-stimulated MgATPase activity in reconstituted actomyosin, and this effect was reversed by subsequent dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1. It was further observed that protein kinase C phosphorylation of either troponin I or troponin T subunits led to a similar inhibition of Ca2(+)-stimulated actomyosin MgATPase activity. In all cases, EC50 values (concentrations causing 50% stimulation) for Ca2+ were not appreciably affected by troponin phosphorylation by protein kinase C. Data from phosphorylation site analysis suggests that phosphorylation of threonine 144 in troponin I and possibly threonine 280 or threonine 199 in troponin T might be important for the observed decrease of Ca2(+)-stimulated actomyosin MgATPase. It is suggested that inhibition of actomyosin MgATPase caused by protein kinase C phosphorylation of troponin I and/or troponin T represents a new mechanism that can account for in part the reported negative inotropic effect of phorbol esters on various cardiac preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1547374970,"Primer recognition proteins (PRP) stimulate the activity of DNA polymerase alpha on DNA substrates with long single-stranded template containing few primers. Purified PRP from HeLa cells and human placenta are composed of two subunits of 36,000 (PRP 1) and 41,000 (PRP 2) daltons. By amino acid sequence homology, we have identified PRP 2 as the glycolytic enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Here we present data that establishes PRP 1 to be the protein-tyrosine kinase substrate, calpactin I heavy chain. Amino acid sequence analysis of six tryptic peptides of PRP 1 followed by homology search in a protein sequence data base revealed 100% identity of all six peptides with the deduced amino acid sequence of human calpactin I heavy chain. The activities of PRP and calpactin I coelute on gel filtration columns, and a high correlation of PRP and calpactin I activities was seen at different stages of purification. A rabbit polyclonal anti-chicken calpactin I antibody was shown to cross-react with PRP 1 polypeptide at various stages of PRP purification, and the homogeneous preparation of PRP exhibits 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PRP 2) and calpactin I (PRP 1) activities. PRP activity is neutralized by a mouse monoclonal anti-calpactin II antibody although having no effect on the polymerase alpha activity itself. Calpactin II has a 50% amino acid sequence homology with calpactin I. However, PRP 1 is not calpactin II as shown by lack of cross-reaction to a monoclonal anti-calpactin II antibody on Western blots. Calpactin I and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, purified independently, cannot be efficiently reconstituted into the PRP complex, indicating that their association in the PRP complex involves specific protein-protein interactions that remain to be elucidated. The biochemical and immunological data presented here revealing the identity of PRP 1 as calpactin I provide evidence for one physiological role of calpactin I in the cell."

Zuber and co-workers have proposed that the N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of neuromodulin is sufficient to target proteins to growth cones. We demonstrate that a neuromodulin(β-galactosidase fusion protein is transported to growth cones of cultured rat neurons, whereas a fusion protein containing the N-terminal 10 amino acids of neuromodulin and (β-galactosidase is not. A mutant neuromodulin lacking cysteines 3 and 4, the palmitylation sites required for membrane attachment, does not target β-galactosi-dase to growth cones. We conclude that membrane attachment is required for growth cone accumulation and that structural elements, in addition to the first 10 amino acids of neuromodulin, may be required for growth cone targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2150943197,"Translation of the bacteriophage Mu mom gene is positively regulated by the phage Com protein. We report here that purified Com protein specifically stimulates mom gene expression in vitro. Furthermore, Com is shown to bind a site in the mom translational initiation region (TIR) in a sequence-specific manner. In vitro RNA footprint experiments have been used to define the Com-binding site and to study mRNA secondary structure in the mom TIR. Com binding is shown to correlate with a conformational change in the mom TIR both in vivo and in vitro. The role of secondary structure was further examined by testing the effects of mutations in the TIR on translation and stimulation. The results support a model for translational stimulation in which Com binding induces a conformational change in the mom mRNA, thereby enhancing ribosome binding."

https://openalex.org/W1598340423,"The potential role of degradative mechanisms in controlling the level of the dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 required for protein N-glycosylation has been explored in thyroid slices and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicles, focusing on cleavage of the oligosaccharide from its lipid attachment and on the enzymatic removal of peripheral monosaccharide residues. Vesicle incubations demonstrated a substantial release of free Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (at 30 min approximately 35% of that transferred to protein) which was inhibited in the presence of exogenous peptide acceptor and was sensitive to disruption of membrane integrity by detergent. In thyroid slices glucosylated oligosaccharides terminating in the di-N-acetylchitobiose sequence were also noted and these continued to be formed even during inhibition by puromycin of both protein synthesis and the attendant N-glycosylation. These observations indicated that the oligosaccharide originated from the lipid donor and suggested, together with previously reported similarities in substrate specificity and cofactor requirements, that the oligosaccharyltransferase can carry out in vivo both the hydrolytic and transfer functions. In addition to the release of the intact Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, we also obtained evidence that the lipid-linked oligosaccharide can be modified by the in vivo action of ER glycosidases. Since radiolabeling of the oligosaccharide-lipid in thyroid slices indicated a preferential turnover of the glucose residues, the possible existence of a glucosyltransferase-glucosidase shuttle was explored with the use of castanospermine. In the presence of this glucosidase inhibitor, the formation of under-glucosylated and nonglucosylated oligosaccharides was not observed, even under conditions of energy deprivation in which they accumulate. Glucosidase inhibition in ER vesicle incubations likewise prevented the appearance of incompletely glucosylated oligosaccharide-lipids. Studies employing the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin in thyroid slices furthermore indicated that in vivo removal of at least one mannose residue from the dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharide can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1599931789,"Abstract Several synexin (annexin VII) mRNAs have been identified by screening a human fibroblast cDNA library. One type of message contained an alternatively spliced cassette exon, predicting two isoforms of synexin differing in the N-terminal domain. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of synexin mRNA from various fetal and adult tissues, from human and monkey, revealed that the alternative splicing event is tissue-regulated; synexin mRNA containing the cassette exon is prevalent in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. This is supported by Western blot analysis showing that muscle synexin (annexin VIIb) is larger than synexin from lung (annexin VIIa). The muscle and lung isoforms have the same molecular mass as the recombinant synexins expressed in Escherichia coli using cDNAs containing or lacking the cassette exon, respectively. The difference in size is consistent with the molecular masses predicted from the proteins encoded by the alternatively spliced synexin mRNAs. Another type of synexin mRNA contained a longer 3'-noncoding region generated by the selection of an alternate poly(A) signal. Northern analysis of human fibroblast RNA showed the presence of two bands (2.0- and 2.4-kilobase) when hybridized to a cDNA fragment of the coding region of synexin, but only the 2.4-kilobase band hybridized to a probe made from the longer 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W1580223847,"The catalytic site of Escherichia coli F1 was probed using a reactive ATP analogue, adenosine triphosphopyridoxal (AP3-PL). For complete loss of enzyme activity, about 1 mol of AP3-PL bound to 1 mol of F1 was estimated to be required in the presence or absence of Mg2+. About 70% of the label was bound to the alpha subunit and the rest to the beta subunit in the absence of Mg2+, and the alpha Lys-201 and beta Lys-155 residues, respectively, were the major target residues (Tagaya, M., Noumi, T., Nakano, K., Futai, M., and Fukui, T. (1988) FEBS Lett. 233, 347-351). Addition of Mg2+ decreased the AP3-PL concentration required for half-maximal inhibition, and predominant labeling of the beta subunit (beta Lys-155 and beta Lys-201) with the reagent. ATP and ADP were protective ligands in the presence and absence of Mg2+. The alpha subunit mutation (alpha Lys-201—-Gln or alpha Lys-201 deletion) were active in oxidative phosphorylation. However, purified mutant F1s showed impaired low multi-site activity, although their uni-site catalyses were essentially normal. Thus alpha Lys-201 is not a catalytic residue, but may be important for catalytic cooperativity. Mutant F1s were inhibited less by AP3-PL in the absence of Mg2+, and consistent with this, modifications of their alpha subunits by AP3-PL were reduced. AP3-PL was more inhibitory to the mutant enzymes in the presence of Mg2+, and bound to the beta Lys-155 and beta Lys-201 residues of mutant F1 (alpha Lys-201—-Gln). These results strongly suggest that alpha Lys-201, beta Lys-155, and beta Lys-201 are located close together near the gamma-phosphate group of ATP bound to the catalytic site, and that the two beta residues and the gamma-phosphate group become closer to each other in the presence of Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1574736576,"cDNAs of fibrinogen A alpha and gamma chains were individually subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector by using the polymerase chain reaction. Triple cotransfection into COS cells of the two plasmids together with a B beta chain expression plasmid, constructed as described previously (Danishefsky, K.J., Hartwig, R., Banerjee, D., and Redman, C. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1048, 202-208), resulted in the secretion of complete fibrinogen into the media and the formation of four additional intracellular complexes which we also showed to be present in the hepatocyte cell line Hep 3B. The complexes, which have Mr = 232, 150, 135, and 128 (x 10(-3) conform with the Mr expected for A alpha B beta gamma 2, B beta gamma 2 and gamma 3, respectively. A A mechanism of assembly is proposed based on the assumption that all these complexes are precursors of complete fibrinogen. Each of the expressed fibrinogen chains in transfected COS cells interacts noncovalently with binding protein (BiP, GRP 78), but not to the same extent; gamma chain binds less BiP than the A alpha and B beta chains. Assembly of fibrinogen is not absolutely required for its secretion. In addition to complete fibrinogen, the conditioned media of hepatocytes and of transfected COS cells contained free A alpha, free gamma, and two of the above-mentioned complexes, A alpha gamma 2 and A alpha B beta gamma 2."
https://openalex.org/W1548650385,"The DNA strand-transfer reaction of bacteriophage Mu requires Mu B protein and ATP for high efficiency. These factors facilitate the capture of target DNA by the donor protein-DNA complex. To understand the mechanism of the Mu B ATPase cycle in the Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction, we undertook a steady-state kinetic analysis of Mu B ATPase. The results reveal complex properties of the ATPase activity; Mu B protein oligomerizes in the presence of ATP, and ATP hydrolysis by the Mu B ATPase is stimulated by the protein oligomerization and shows a positive cooperativity with respect to ATP concentration. Mu B ATPase activity is also modulated by DNA and Mu A protein. DNA alone suppresses the catalytic activity of Mu B ATPase, whereas DNA enhances the apparent binding affinity for ATP. In the presence of Mu A protein together with DNA, however, the catalytic activity is greatly stimulated. Based on these results, we propose a working hypothesis in which oligomerization of Mu B protein plays a key role in its ATPase cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1559955919,"Abstract Nucleotide-depleted mitochondrial F1-ATPase (F1[0,0]) is inhibited by the diadenosine oligophosphate compounds, AP4A, AP5A, and AP6A (where APxA stands for 5',5'-diadenosine oligophosphates having a chain of x phosphoryl groups linking the two adenosine moieties). When F1[0,0] is preincubated with these compounds and then assayed for ATP hydrolysis activity under conditions that normally allow turnover at all three catalytic sites, the maximal level of inhibition observed is 80%. However, when assayed at lower ATP concentrations under conditions that allow simultaneous turnover at only two of the three sites, no inhibition is observed. A decrease in the number of phosphoryl groups that links the adenosine moieties to less than 4 (AP3A, AP2A) converts the compound to an activator of ATP hydrolysis, similar in effect to that obtained when one mol of ADP or 2-azido-ADP binds at a catalytic site on F1[0,0]. Inhibition by the compounds requires the presence of at least one vacant noncatalytic site. Evidence is provided that the probes also interact with a catalytic site. The stoichiometry for maximal inhibition by AP4A is 0.94 mol/mol of F1. The data presented support a model for the structure of nucleotide-binding sites on F1 that places catalytic and noncatalytic sites in close proximity in an orientation analogous to the ATP and AMP binding sites on adenylate kinase. Inhibition of the enzyme by the dinucleotide compounds can be explained by the cross-bridging of one of the catalytic sites to a noncatalytic site in analogy to the inhibition of adenylate kinase by AP5A. The residual capacity for bi-site catalysis indicates that the second and third catalytic sites remain catalytically active."
https://openalex.org/W1522309084,"The kinetics of N-linked oligosaccharide processing and the structures of the processing intermediates have been examined in normal parental BW5147 mouse lymphoma cells and the alpha-glucosidase II-deficient PHAR2.7 mutant cells. The mutant cells accumulated glucosylated intermediates but were able to deglucosylate and process about 40% of their oligosaccharides to complex-type. This processing was not due to residual alpha-glucosidase II activity since the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and N-butyl-DNJ did not prevent it. Parent cells also showed alpha-glucosidase II-independent processing in the presence of DNJ and N-butyl-DNJ. Membrane preparations from both parent and mutant cells had endo alpha-mannosidase activity, that is, split Glc1,2Man9GlcNAc to Glc1,2Man plus Man8GlcNAc, indicating that this was a candidate for an alternate route to complex oligosaccharide formation in the mutant cells. A balance study in which the cellular glycoproteins, intracellular water soluble saccharides, and saccharides secreted into the medium were isolated and analyzed from [2-3H]mannose-labeled mutant cells showed that the cells formed the di- and trisaccharides Glc1Man and Glc2Man in amounts equivalent to the deglucosylated oligosaccharides found in the cellular glycoproteins. This result shows unequivocally that the alpha-glucosidase II-deficient mutant cells use endo alpha-mannosidase as a bypass route for N-linked oligosaccharide processing."
https://openalex.org/W1542453477,"Abstract We have examined the properties of the four tight nucleotide binding sites of reductively activated chloroplast coupling factor 1. Tight sites are here defined as those which retain bound nucleotides after passage of the chloroplast coupling factor 1 through Sephadex gel filtration centrifuge columns. Two of the sites, here called sites 4 and 5, have not been characterized in detail before. Site 4 has properties similar to those of site 1. It binds to ADP, ATP, and adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) tightly in the presence or absence of Mg2+. Bound ADP exchanges rapidly with medium ADP, but rapid exchange with ATP or AMP-PNP requires Mg2+. Site 4 may slowly hydrolyze bound ATP in the absence of medium nucleotides. Site 5 has properties similar to those of site 2. Tight binding of ATP and AMP-PNP requires Mg2+, but Mg29+)-ADP is not tightly bound. Site 5 does not hydrolyze bound ATP in the absence of medium nucleotides. Complete filling of all four tight nucleotide binding sites requires about one millimolar nucleotide, suggesting that low affinity binding sites are converted to tight binding via a nucleotide binding-induced conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W2095686962,"Mutations have been made in the exposed region of the avian troponin C central helix, the D/E linker, which change its length and the orientation of the Ca2(+)-binding domains relative to each other. The region 87Glu-Asp-Ala-Lys-Gly-Lys-Ser-Glu-Glu-Glu97 has been altered in five deletion (d) mutants: dEDA, dKG, dKGK, dSEEE, and dKEDAKGK. The recombinant troponin Cs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and assayed for function. All mutants retained basic troponin C function. They all bound Ca2+ to the low and high affinity sites, and they all were able to confer Ca2+ sensitivity on the regulated actomyosin ATPase. However, the regulatory function of all mutants except dSEEE was defective in one part of the Ca2+ switch or the other. In certain conditions dKGK and dKEDAKGK failed to inhibit fully whereas dEDA and dKG failed to activate the regulated actomyosin ATPase fully. The following general conclusions have been made. (a) The length of the D/E linker per se (assuming the linker is helical) and the orientation of the two Ca2(+)-binding domains relative to each other are not crucial for regulation. (b) The conserved charge cluster 95Glu-Glu-Glu97, in a region of troponin C known to bind to troponin I and postulated to be required for regulation, appears to be unimportant for function. (c) Deletion of 88Glu-Asp-Ala90 resulted in a troponin C that could not activate the actomyosin (or S1) ATPase over the level of actomyosin alone, thus defining a role for troponin C in this aspect of thin filament regulation. The results have been interpreted in terms of the crystallographic structure of troponin C and related to results with analogous calmodulin mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1532653845,"The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase of skeletal muscle has two high affinity calcium sites, one of fast access (f site) and one of slow access (s site). In addition to Ca2+ these sites are able to interact with other cations like Mg2+ or K+. We have studied with a stopped-flow method the modifications produced by Mg2+ and K+ on the kinetics of the intrinsic fluorescence changes produced by Ca2+ binding to and dissociation from the Ca2(+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The presence of Mg2+ ions (K1/2 = 0.5 mM at pH 7.2) leads to the appearance of a rapid phase in the Ca2+ binding, which represents half of the signal amplitude at optimal Mg2+. The presence of K+ greatly accelerates both the Ca2+ binding and the Ca2+ dissociation reactions, giving, respectively, a 4- and 8-fold increase of the rate constant of the induced fluorescence change. K+ ions also increase the rate of the 45Ca/40Ca exchange reaction at the s site measured by rapid filtration. These results lead us to build up a model for the Ca2(+)-binding mechanism of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase in which Mg2+ and K+ participate at particular steps of the reaction. Moreover, we propose that, in the absence of Ca2+, this enzyme may be the pathway for monovalent ion fluxes across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2101470643,"The apparent DNA site size obtained from an assay monitoring the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli recA protein (n = 3.5) differs from that determined from a direct DNA binding assay (n = 7) done under identical conditions. Investigation of this discrepancy indicates that at a DNA:protein ratio of 3.5:1, one-half of the recA protein population is less sensitive to ATPase activity inhibition by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), suggesting that the recA protein filament is asymmetric with respect to NTP affinity. This asymmetry does not depend on the presence of ATP gamma S since the apparent Km for ATP derived from single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity is dependent on the DNA:protein ratio. Three models are proposed to account for the observed site size discrepancy and the NTP binding affinity asymmetry. They differ mainly in the intrinsic site size for each recA protein monomer and in the number of DNA-binding sites/recA molecule. Gel filtration of recA-single-stranded DNA complexes at different DNA:protein ratios complements the enzymological data and provides an additional method of distinguishing among the proposed models. The phenomenon of subunit nonequivalence within the recA protein presynaptic filament may provide a molecular basis for understanding how recA protein can discriminate between different DNA molecules during homologous pairing."
https://openalex.org/W1541276365,"Abstract We report on the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences encoding a chicken cardiac phospholamban. Three mRNAs, 0.6, 1.1, and 3.3 kilobase pairs in size, were detected in cardiac and slow-tonic muscle RNAs on Northern blots. We determined that these mRNAs differ in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions, perhaps because they utilize alternative polyadenylation signals. We studied the developmental and tissue-specific expression of phospholamban mRNA using nuclease mapping analysis. There appeared to be considerable homology between coding and 3'-untranslated regions of phospholamban mRNAs from cardiac and slow-tonic muscles during development, strongly suggesting that these mRNAs are encoded by the same gene. The phospholamban gene, which is present as a single copy in the chicken genome, is about 10 kilobase pairs long, with approximately 6.5 kilobase pairs representing the intron sequences. Primer extension and nuclease mapping analyses of the 5' end of the phospholamban mRNA showed that the three transcripts are initiated from the same initiation site. Analysis of the putative promoter region revealed TATA box and CAAT box sequences, putative muscle-specific elements, and a cyclic AMP-responsive element."
https://openalex.org/W1545307120,"Investigation of the properties of Ca2(+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum cross-linked at the active site with glutaraldehyde showed that ATP binding affinity and rate of ATP-dependent phosphorylation and Ca2+ occlusion were decreased 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with the native enzyme. Cross-linkage had little effect on or marginally increased the rate of acetyl phosphate- and p-nitrophenyl phosphate-supported Ca2+ occlusion. Ca2+ binding or Ca2(+)-induced changes in tryptophan fluorescence were unaffected. High levels of phosphoenzyme (up to 4 nmol/mg of protein) were obtained, with 2 mol of Ca2+ occluded/mol of E-P. Dephosphorylation and deocclusion occurred together at a slow rate (k = 0.01 s-1) and were stimulated in a monophasic manner up to 20-fold by ADP. Cross-linking inhibited E2-P formation from Pi in 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide by more than 95%. Induction of turnover of the native ATPase, under conditions designed to yield high steady state levels of E1 approximately P(2Ca), results in a 3-4-fold increase in reactivity of active site residues to glutaraldehyde. The results show that cross-linkage sterically impairs nucleotide binding, changing ATP and ADP into relatively poor substrates, slowing nucleotide-dependent phosphoryl transfer and Ca2+ occlusion and deocclusion. The forward reaction with smaller substrates is unaffected. Another major effect of the cross-link is to inhibit E2-P formation, causing accumulation of E1 approximately P(2Ca) during enzyme turnover and preventing phosphorylation by Pi in the reverse direction. We suggest that occlusion and deocclusion of cations at the transport site of the native enzyme are linked to a two-step cleft closure movement at the active site and that the crosslink stabilizes occluded forms of the pump because it blocks part of this tertiary structural change. The latter could normally be propagated through linking helices to the distal side of the pump to destabilize the cations and open the transport sites to the lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1535444319,"We have investigated in intact chromaffin secretory vesicles the kinetics, specificity, and mechanism of intragranular ascorbic acid regeneration by extragranular ascorbic acid. The apparent Km of internal ascorbic acid regeneration for external ascorbic acid was 280 microM by Lineweaver-Burk analysis and 287 microM by Eadie-Hofstee analysis. Intragranular ascorbic acid regeneration was specifically mediated by extragranular ascorbic acid or its isomer isoascorbic acid; the reducing agents glutathione, thiourea, homocysteine, NADH, and NADPH did not support regeneration. The structural analog D-glucose did not inhibit regeneration by external ascorbic acid, suggesting specificity at the membrane site of electron transfer. The driving force for regeneration of intragranular ascorbic acid was independent of membrane potential, absolute intragranular and extragranular pH, and ATPase activity, but might be coupled to the pH difference across the chromaffin granule membrane. Since the apparent Km of regeneration was approximately 10-fold below the cytosolic concentration of ascorbic acid, the reaction may proceed at Vmax in situ."

The BL7B1 epitope is localized between the methionine residues that occupy positions 148 and 259 in human lipocortin IV. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies showed that in the rabbit enterocytes, lipocortin IV is specifically associated with the basolateral membranes. When these membranes are solubilized by Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM of Ca2+ the lipocortin IV, like the cytoskeleton, remained insoluble suggesting that it might be associated with this structure in vivo. No lipocortin IV was detected in the brush border using immunofluorescence techniques and less than 10% of the amount present in the purified basolateral membranes was detected in the brush border membrane fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1504906650,"An important unresolved issue in antifolate pharmacology is the basis for the observation that the major portion of cellular tetrahydrofolate cofactors is preserved after dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished by antifolates despite the fact that tetrahydrofolate cofactor-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis ceases. This has been attributed to feedback inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate polyglutamates that accumulate in the presence of antifolates. This report combines network thermodynamic modeling and experimental observations to evaluate the effects of direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase at the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate binding site with a potent lipophilic quinazoline antifolate PD130883 on folate oxidation in cells. Computer simulations predict and the data indicate that marked PD130883 suppression of thymidylate synthase only slows the rate but not the extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate upon complete suppression of dihydrofolate reductase with trimetrexate. These observations are consistent with earlier studies from this laboratory with fluorodeoxyuridine inhibition at the deoxyuridylate binding site. Hence, the much weaker inhibition by dihydrofolate polyglutamates at the level of thymidylate synthase cannot account for the apparent preservation of tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools in cells and has virtually no pharmacologic significance under conditions in which antifolates completely suppress dihydrofolate reductase. The extent of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate is strongly influenced by residual dihydrofolate reductase catalytic activity. Exposure of cells to 0.1 microM trimetrexate results in only approximately 60% of maximum dihydrofolate levels achieved when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished. Network thermodynamic simulations predict, and experiments verify, that inhibition of thymidylate synthase at the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate site by PD130883, when dihydrofolate reductase is only partially suppressed (approximately 85%) with 0.1 microM trimetrexate, substantially decreases (31-47%) the net level of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate. Further computer simulations predict that under conditions in which residual dihydrofolate reductase activity persists within the cells (more than about 5%), feedback inhibitory effects of dihydrofolate polyglutamates as well as other weak inhibitors of thymidylate synthase can significantly limit the extent of net interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate and produce an apparent “compartmentation phenomenon” in which tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools are preserved within the cell in the presence of antifolates. Residual dihydrofolate reductase activity cannot, however, account for the partial interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate after exposure to high trimetrexate or methotrexate levels. This is more likely attributed to tetrahydrofolate cofactors in a fraction of the cell population (i.e. in some cells out of S-phase) and a physical compartment (i.e. mitochondrial) and in a physical state within the cytosol which makes them unavailable for oxidation to dihydrofolate when dihydrofolate reductasies blocked by antifolates."

https://openalex.org/W90426973,"Abstract The current study was done to test the hypotheses that parafollicular granules contain a vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) similar to that found in chromaffin granules, that the transport of H+ into granules mediated by this enzyme drives the granular uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and that secretagogues stimulate both the acidification of parafollicular granules and their ability to take up 5-HT by opening an anion channel in the granular membrane. Our studies indicate that parafollicular granules contain a V-ATPase that is antigenically similar to that of the V-ATPase of adrenal chromaffin granules; however, the parafollicular granular membrane differs from that of chromaffin granules in permeability to Cl- and K+. The membranes of granules derived from resting parafollicular cells appear to be relatively impermeable to Cl- but permeable to K+. Parafollicular granules (and ghosts derived from them) manifest ATP-dependent transmembrane transport of 5-HT. This transport is more dependent on the pH difference (delta pH) than on the membrane potential component of the proton electrochemical gradient across the granular membrane. Transport of 5-HT is thus inhibited more by exposure of parafollicular granules to agents, such as nigericin, that collapse delta pH than by those, such as valinomycin, that decrease transmembrane difference in potential. ATP-dependent uptake of 5-HT by granules isolated from secretagogue-stimulated parafollicular cells is greater than that into granules isolated from unstimulated cells. Since secretagogues open a Cl- channel in parafollicular granule membranes, which enhances acidification of the granules, the facilitation of 5-HT uptake by secretagogues is probably due to an increase in delta pH."

https://openalex.org/W1578670070,"Brain (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) have been identified which may represent endogenous agonists of kidney receptor subtypes. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to investigate the regional distribution of receptor subpopulations and the competitive inhibition of 125I porcine BNP1-26 (pBNP1-26) and 125I rat alpha-ANP1-28 (rANP1-28) renal binding sites. Specific, high affinity binding (Kd 0.2-1.37 nM range) was localized to glomeruli, inner medulla, interlobar and arcuate arteries, vasa recta bundles, and smooth muscle in the renal pelvis. pBNP1-26 competed for the same sites as rANP1-28 but displayed a lower potency and was less selective for nonclearance sites. Clearance binding sites were discriminated by competitive inhibition with C-ANP4-23 and comprised some 65% of glomerular sites as well as the vast majority of sites in the renal pelvis. Nonclearance sites predominated in the inner medulla and intrarenal arteries. C-terminal changes in amino acid sequence induced a significant loss of inhibitory potency. Immunohistochemical studies identified a distinct population of BNP-like immunoreactive renal nerve fibers, associated with intra-renal arteries. Circulating natriuretic peptides and BNP sequences derived from renal nerves may influence renal function by interacting with specific receptor subpopulations in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1489457330,"Previous studies from this laboratory established that the rapid but partial interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate after exposure of L1210 leukemia cells to antifolates cannot be due to direct feedback inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate or any other endogenous folylpolyglutamates when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished by antifolates. Rather, the data suggested this preservation of tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools is likely due to a fraction of cellular folates unavailable for oxidation to dihydrofolate. This paper explores the role of cell cycle phase in L1210 leukemia cells in logarithmic versus stationary phase growth as a factor in the rate and extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate after exposure of cells to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimetrexate. The S phase fraction was reduced by inoculating L1210 leukemia cells at high density to achieve a stationary state. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content indicated that log phase cultures were 53.0% S phase; this decreased to 42.1% at 24 h and 24.1% at 48 h in stationary phase cultures. 5-Bromo-2‘-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA decreased 80 and 96%, while [3H]dUrd incorporation into DNA declined 70 and 95% for stationary cultures at 24 and 48 h, respectively, as compared with the log phase rates. Log phase cells interconverted 28.0% of the total pool of radiolabeled folates to dihydrofolate with a half-time of approximately 30 s. Stationary cells at 24 h interconverted 20.4% of the total folate pool with a t1/2 of approximately 3 min, and at 48 h, net interconversion to dihydrofolate decreased further to 12.1% with a t1/2 of approximately 6 min. The decrease in the extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate in stationary phase cells was directly proportional to the decrease in the S phase fraction determined by total DNA content. This suggests that tetrahydrofolate cofactor depletion occurs only in S phase cells. The much larger drop in [3H]dUrd and 5-bromo-2‘-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA in comparison with the decline in the S phase fraction measured by DNA content along with the reduced rate of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate indicates that the rate of DNA synthesis is decreased in S phase cells in stationary cultures. Network thermodynamic simulations suggest that a reduction in the number of S phase cells and their thymidylate synthase catalytic activity would account for the observed decrease in the rate and extent of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate after trimetrexate in stationary phase cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
