https://openalex.org/W2021235665,"Alterations in proto-oncogene expression after stimulation of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) have been investigated. A specific stimulation of c-fos messenger RNA and protein was detected 30 minutes after treatment. This induction was enhanced more than 100-fold in the presence of peripherally active benzodiazepines. The effect was specific as very little change was observed in the levels of c-rasHa, c-rasKi, c-myc, and N-myc messenger RNA's. Under the conditions used here, NGF treatment ultimately results in neurite outgrowth, with a reduction or cessation of cell division. Thus, stimulation of the c-fos gene in this system appeared to be associated with differentiation and not with cellular proliferation. The effect of benzodiazepines was stereospecific and represents a novel action of these compounds at the level of gene expression."

Attractive forces measured between such surfaces are 10 to 100 times stronger than expected from van der Waals theory over distances D up to about 10 nanometers. The forces decay exponentially [with a force proportional to exp(-D/1.4)] instead of following the power-law behavior of continuum theory. The results of these and earlier experiments indicate that the strength of these attractive forces depends critically on the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface and is due to the long-range influence of the surface on the structure of water. In addition, for very hydrophobic surfaces, the cavitation effects on pulling the surfaces apart are described."

https://openalex.org/W2008998885,"In the fish retina the interplexiform cells contain dopamine and provide a centrifugal pathway from the inner plexiform layer to horizontal cells of the outer plexiform layer. Dopamine application reduced the responsiveness and receptive field size of cone horizontal cells, as did a prolonged period of complete darkness. Other results suggest that the interplexiform cells may release dopamine after a prolonged period in the dark. The interplexiform-horizontal cell system may modify the strength of the antagonistic surrounds of retinal neurons as a function of time in the dark."
https://openalex.org/W1547309371,"Faithful transcription of human mitochondrial DNA has been reproduced in vitro, using a fraction of mitochondrial proteins capable of accurate initiation at both the heavy- and light-strand promoters. Here we report the initial dissection of this system into two nonfunctional components which, upon mixing, reconstitute promoter-specific transcriptional capacity in vitro. One of these components copurifies with the major nonspecific RNA polymerase activity, suggesting its identity. The other component lacks significant polymerase activity, but contains a protein or proteins required for accurate initiation at the two individual promoters by isolated mitochondrial RNA polymerase. This factor facilitates specific transcription, but has little or no effect on nonspecific transcription of a synthetic copolymer (poly(dA-dT)), indicating a positive role in proper promoter recognition. The transcription factor markedly stimulates light-strand transcription, but only moderately enhances transcription initiation at the heavy-strand promoter, suggesting different or additional factor requirements for heavy-strand transcription. These requirements may reflect the functional differences between heavy- and light-strand transcription in vivo and, in particular, the role of the light-strand promoter in priming of heavy-strand DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W1605646428,"Addition of 0.4-25 microM extracellular ATP results in transient, dose-dependent increases in cytosolic free calcium measured in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. In cells incubated with 1 mM extracellular Ca2+, ATP induces a triphasic Ca2+ transient: an initial rapid increase (2-3 s), a second, slower phase of increase (60-90 s), and, finally, a gradual return to near resting [Ca2+]i (4-5 min). Several findings demonstrate that the initial, rapid phase of Ca2+ transient results from a mobilization of Ca2+ from a non-mitochondrial intracellular store, while the second, slow phase of increase is produced by enhanced influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. Successive additions of extracellular ATP can elicit repetitive Ca2+ transients if the initially added ATP is removed either through the action of native ecto-ATPase activity or exogenous hexokinase. Other adenine nucleotides, including non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, neither alter cytosolic [Ca2+] nor antagonize the ATP-induced effects. Conversely, other nucleotide triphosphates (ITP, UTP, and GTP) induce Ca2+ transients which are identical to those produced by ATP. A variety of experimental results indicate that these actions of ATP and other nucleotide triphosphates are not due to a generalized increase in plasma membrane permeability. The results suggest that, in these transformed cells, ATP may act in a manner similar to other Ca2+ mobilizing hormones and growth factors."

https://openalex.org/W1769638950,"Sonic oscillation of mitochondria usually leads to the release of a number of Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. These enzymes have, therefore, been referred to as soluble matrix enzymes. In the present report, we show that gentle sonic or osmotic disruption can be used to obtain a mitochondrial preparation where these enzymes appear to be organized in a large complex of proteins. Using citrate synthase as a marker for these enzymes, we show that the proposed complex is easily sedimented at 32,000 X g in 30 min. The exposed citrate synthase in these complexes can be inhibited by its antibody, indicating that the enzymes are not merely entrapped in substrate-permeable vesicles. The effects of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and several metabolites on the ability to obtain the sedimentable citrate synthase have been tested. These studies indicate that the complex is stable at conditions presumed to exist in situ. Electron microscopic studies show that gentle sonic oscillation gives rise to an efflux of mitochondrial matrix contents which tend to remain attached to the original membranes. The sedimentable fraction also contained four other presumably soluble Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes: aconitase, NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1509683120,"Ribonuclease A has been used as a model protein for studying the specificity of glycation of amino groups in protein under physiological conditions (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). Incubation of RNase with glucose led to an enhanced rate of inactivation of the enzyme relative to the rate of modification of lysine residues, suggesting preferential modification of active site lysine residues. Sites of glycation of RNase were identified by amino acid analysis of tryptic peptides isolated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and phenylboronate affinity chromatography. Schiff base adducts were trapped with Na-BH3CN and the alpha-amino group of Lys-1 was identified as the primary site (80-90%) of initial Schiff base formation on RNase. In contrast, Lys-41 and Lys-7 in the active site accounted for about 38 and 29%, respectively, of ketoamine adducts formed via the Amadori rearrangement. Other sites reactive in ketoamine formation included N alpha-Lys-1 (15%), N epsilon-Lys-1 (9%), and Lys-37 (9%) which are adjacent to acidic amino acids. The remaining six lysine residues in RNase, which are located on the surface of the protein, were relatively inactive in forming either the Schiff base or Amadori adduct. Both the equilibrium Schiff base concentration and the rate of the Amadori rearrangement at each site were found to be important in determining the specificity of glycation of RNase."

https://openalex.org/W1968102552,"Amastigotes (tissue forms) of Leishmania donovani isolated from infected hamster spleens carried out several physiological activities (respiration, catabolism of energy substrates, and incorporation of precursors into macromolecules) optimally at pH 4.0 to 5.5. All metabolic activities that were examined decreased sharply above the optimal pH. Promastigotes (culture forms), on the other hand, carried out the same metabolic activities optimally at or near neutral pH. This adaptation to an acid environment may account in part for the unusual ability of amastigotes to survive and multiply within the acidic environment of the phagolysosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1530706436,"We have previously shown that microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Tau, two major microtubule-associated proteins, interact with actin differently as measured by low-shear viscosity and that their activities are modified by phosphorylation (Nishida, E., Kotani, S., Kuwaki, T., and Sakai, H. (1982 in Biological Functions of Microtubules and Related Structures (Sakai, H., Mohri, H., and Borisy, G. G., eds) pp. 297-309, Academic Press, Japan). In the present study we further examined their interaction using turbidimetry, electron microscopy, low- and high-shear viscometry. MAP2 increased the low-shear viscosity of actin filament but had weaker effect on high-shear viscosity and turbidity of actin filaments. In contrast, Tau reduced high-shear viscosity of actin filaments and enhanced the turbidity which were due to formation of actin filament bundles as shown by electron microscopy. We conclude that MAP2 is a gelation factor, while Tau is a bundling factor. A well-known Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein, calmodulin, inhibited both MAP2-actin and Tau-actin interaction in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The calmodulin-dependent inhibition was canceled by higher concentrations of MAP2 or Tau, and calmodulin had no effect on the viscosity of actin filament alone, indicating that this inhibition is based on the stoichiometric interaction of calmodulin with MAP2 or Tau."

https://openalex.org/W1556707430,"Poly(D-lysine) is taken up avidly by cultured cells through adsorptive endocytosis and can serve as a carrier to increase cellular uptake of other molecules. While direct conjugation of methotrexate to poly(D-lysine) yields a conjugate devoid of cytotoxic effects because poly(D-lysine) is not digested in lysosomes, the indirect conjugation using a triglycine spacer or a disulfide spacer strongly inhibits the growth of both the wild type and the methotrexate transport-defective Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cell treatment with 3 mM NH4Cl or 50 micrograms/ml leupeptin prevents the effect of conjugate with the triglycine spacer, but not of conjugate with the disulfide spacer. On the other hand, preincubation with 2-mercaptoethanol abolishes the effect of the drug-disulfide conjugate in the methotrexate transport-defective mutant, but not the effect of the drug-triglycine conjugate. The disulfide conjugate shows an identical cytotoxic effect in alpha-minimal essential medium and RPMI 1640 media, even though cells grown in the latter have only half the glutathione content as cells grown in the former medium. We conclude that the reductive process through which methotrexate is released from the disulfide spacer (a) occurs inside cells and not at the cell surface, (b) requires neither acid pH nor lysosomal enzymes, and (c) is not mediated by a glutathione-disulfide exchange reaction requiring high glutathione concentrations. Although the cellular compartment in which this reductive process occurs is not yet identified, there are reasons to assume that it is prelysosomal."

https://openalex.org/W1608324899,"Fatty acid synthetase of chicken liver is rapidly and reversibly inactivated by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) at a rate (k2 = 132 mM-1 S-1 in 3 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees C) up to 2200 times higher than the reaction of this reagent with simple thiol compounds. The inactivation is caused by the reaction of the phosphopantetheine SH group, since it is protected competitively by either acetyl- or malonyl-CoA, and since the inactivated enzyme is unreactive with the phosphopantetheine label chloroacetyl-CoA but reactive with the cysteine reagent 1,3-dibromopropanone. Moreover, chloroacetyl-CoA prevents the modification of the rapidly reacting essential SH group by DTNB. The number of SH groups involved in inactivation was determined by correlating activity loss with the extent of reaction and by stopped-flow analysis of substrate (or chloroacetyl-CoA) protection. Values between 0.91 and 1.15 SH groups/dimer were obtained, indicating the presence of substoichiometric amounts of the prosthetic group in the fatty acid synthetase preparations used in this study. Inactivation of the synthetase by DTNB is strongly inhibited by increasing salt concentration and protected noncompetitively by NADP+ and NADPH. Treatment of the enzyme inactivated at low salt by salt, NADP+, or NADPH also effectively reduced cross-linking between enzyme subunits. The parallel effects of these treatments on the reaction with DTNB and subsequent dimerization are consistent with a minimum model of two discreet conformation states for fatty acid synthetase. In the low salt conformer, the phosphopantetheine and cysteine SH groups are juxtaposed, and the DTNB reaction (k2 approximately 132 mM-1 S-1) and dimerization are both facilitated. Transition to the high salt conformer by the above treatments is accompanied by an approximately 20-fold reduction of reactivity with DTNB (k2 = 6.8 mM-1 S-1) and reduced dimerization, due to spatial separation of the SH groups. During palmitate synthesis, the enzyme may oscillate between these conformation states to permit the reaction of intermediates at different active sites. Results obtained by studies on the effect of pH on DTNB inactivation implicate a pK of 5.9-6.1 for the essential SH group independent of salt concentration. This value is 1.5-1.8 pH units lower than the pK of 7.6-7.7 for CoA and may explain the 23-fold increase of the rate constant from a value of 0.3 mM-1 S-1 for CoA to that of the high salt conformer."
https://openalex.org/W1584783488,"Human lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase were purified to homogeneity from post-heparin plasma. These enzymes were purified 250,000- and 100,000-fold with yields of 27 +/- 15 and 19 +/- 6%, respectively. Molecular weight determination by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and reducing agents yielded Mr of 60,500 +/- 1,800 and 65,200 +/- 400, respectively, for lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase. These lipase preparations were shown to be free of detectable antithrombin by measuring its activity and by probing of Western blots of lipases with a monospecific antibody against antithrombin. In additions, probing of Western blots with concanavalin A revealed no glycoproteins corresponding to the molecular weight of antithrombin. Four stable hybridoma-producing distinct monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to hepatic triglyceride lipase were isolated. The specificity of one mAb, HL3-5, was established by its ability to immunoprecipitate hepatic triglyceride lipase catalytic activity. Interaction of HL3-5 with this lipase did not inhibit catalytic activity. The three other mAb interacted with hepatic triglyceride lipase only after denaturation of the enzyme with detergents. The relatedness of these two enzymes was examined by comparing under the same conditions the thermal inactivation, the sensitivity to sulfhydryl and reducing agents, amino acid composition, and the mobility of peptide fragments generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage. The results of these studies strongly support the view that the two enzymes are different proteins. Immunological studies confirm this conclusion. Four mAb to hepatic triglyceride lipase did not interact with lipoprotein lipase in Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunoprecipitation experiments. These immunological studies demonstrate that several epitopes of the hepatic triglyceride lipase protein moiety are not present in the lipoprotein lipase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1593884332,"The low-shear viscosity of 5-30 microM F-actin was greatly increased by the addition of 0.1-0.5 microM unphosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB. The increase in viscosity was about the same in 2 mM ADP as in the absence of free nucleotide but was much less in 2 mM ATP. The single-headed monomolecular Acanthamoeba myosins were as effective as an equal molar concentration of two-headed muscle heavy meromyosin and much more effective than single-headed muscle myosin subfragment-1. These results suggest that Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB can cross-link actin filaments as proposed in the accompanying paper (Albanesi, J. P., Fujisaki, H., and Korn, E. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11174-11179) to explain the actin-dependent cooperative increase in actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity as a function of the concentration of myosin I. Superprecipitation occurred when phosphorylated myosin IA or IB was mixed with F-actin. In addition to myosin I heavy chain phosphorylation, superprecipitation required Mg2+ and ATP. ATP hydrolysis was linear during the time course of the superprecipitation, and inhibitors of ATP hydrolysis inhibited superprecipitation. A small, dense contracted gel was formed when the reaction was carried out in a cuvette, and a birefringent actomyosin thread resulted from superprecipitation in a microcapillary. The rate and extent of superprecipitation depended on the actin and myosin I concentrations with maximum superprecipitation occurring at an actin:myosin ratio of 7:1. These results provide strong evidence for the ability of Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB to perform contractile and motile functions."
https://openalex.org/W1569970243,"An acid DNase (DNase II) from porcine spleen was purified by sequential chromatography over carboxymethyl-cellulose, blue dextran-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and sulfoxyethyl-cellulose. The purified enzyme shows two polypeptide bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at Mr 35,000 (alpha chain) and 10,000 (beta chain). The sum of the two molecular weights is that of the native enzyme (45,000). Thus, the DNase II molecule is an alpha,beta dimer. The two polypeptides are not joined by disulfide bonds, but can be cross-linked chemically with dimethyl suberimidate. They are dissociable in 8 M urea, after which they can be isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, eluting with 1 M acetic acid. Once dissociated, the two polypeptides cannot be reassociated to regenerate DNase II activity. The sum of the amino acid compositions of the two polypeptides is that of the native enzyme, and both contain carbohydrate. The beta chain is devoid of histidine, half-cystine, valine, and methionine. The NH2-terminal amino acid of the alpha chain is leucine, while that of the beta chain cannot be identified by either dansylation or Edman degradation. Alkylation of an essential histidine residue of DNase II occurs on incubation of the enzyme with [2-14C] ICH2COOH (Oshima, R. G., and Price, P. A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7522-7526). Radioactivity is found only in the alpha chain. After hydrolysis of the alpha chain with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and thermolysin, radioactive peptides were isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analyses of the radioactive peptides show alkylation of 1 of 9 histidines in the entire amino acid sequence of DNase II. The sequence around this histidine, determined by manual microsequencing and by the release of amino acids with carboxypeptidases A and B, is Ala-Thr-Glu-Asp-His-Ser-Lys-Trp."
https://openalex.org/W1538393523,"Interaction between cartilage proteoglycan and the collagen(s) composed of 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha chains was studied in vitro. Most of the collagen was insoluble under the conditions of assay (0.15 M NaCl, 0.008 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 4 degrees C) and was in the form of fibrils 20 nm in diameter or thinner. The larger fibrils had 60-70 nm periodicity, characteristic of native collagens. Proteoglycan monomers which had been labeled by incubating cartilage slices in vitro with Na2 35SO4 were used to assay the interaction. The insoluble collagen fraction bound proteoglycan from solution. At proteoglycan:collagen ratios lower than 1:2, binding was rapid and linear, and the dissociation constant was 1.7 X 10(-9) M. At higher proteoglycan:collagen ratios, more proteoglycan was bound, but at a slower rate. Binding of proteoglycan to collagen did not require fibrils, since soluble 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha containing collagen also bound to proteoglycan and formed an insoluble complex. Denatured collagens did not bind proteoglycan or compete for binding with normal collagen. Optimum binding occurred with intact proteoglycan, but proteoglycan which had been treated with protease was also bound at low levels. Both protease-treated proteoglycan and free chondroitin sulfate competed with intact proteoglycan in the binding assays, but neither chondroitinase ABC-treated proteoglycan nor the oligosaccharides produced by digestion of chondroitin sulfate with testicular hyaluronidase altered the binding of proteoglycan to collagen. Hyaluronic acid did not compete with radioactive proteoglycan, but heparin and dextran sulfate were extremely effective inhibitors of binding. These data suggest a relatively nonspecific interaction between sulfated polyanions and 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha containing collagens. However, given the location of these collagens near the chondrocyte surface, the interaction of fibrillar 1 alpha, 2 alpha, 3 alpha collagen with proteoglycan is likely to occur and to be of biological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1521198514,"Prolonged incubation of native bovine brain calmodulin with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine and protein carboxyl methyltransferase results in maximal methylation of only 1-2% of the calmodulin molecules. In contrast, calmodulin which has been subjected to a prior alkaline treatment (0.1 M NH4OH, 37 degrees C for 3 h) can be methylated to a level of 30-50%. This treatment is known to be effective in deamidating certain asparagine residues which lie in unstable sequences, particularly -Asn-Gly- sequences. Bovine brain calmodulin has three such sequences (Watterson, D. M., Sharief, F., and Vanaman, T. C. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 962-975). The enhancement of methylation by alkaline treatment is substantially reduced if calmodulin is first reacted with bis-(I,I-trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene, a reagent which converts the carboxamide group of asparagine and glutamine residues to the corresponding primary amines. Thus, protein carboxyl methyltransferase selectively modifies an abnormal form of calmodulin that is probably deamidated. These findings suggest that protein carboxyl methylation may play a role in the disposition of abnormal proteins which contain atypical, isomerized aspartyl residues arising via spontaneous deamidation of unstable asparagines."
https://openalex.org/W39387605,"Multivesicular bodies (MVB), prelysosomal organelles in the endocytic pathway, were prepared from estrogen-treated rat livers and examined for the presence of ATP-dependent proton transport. Vesicle acidification, assessed by acridine orange fluorescence quenching, was ATP dependent (ATP much greater than GTP, UTP), was enriched 25-fold over homogenate, was abolished by pretreatment with protonophores or a nonionic detergent, exhibited a pH optimum of 7.5, was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (IC50 approximately 5 microM) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (IC50 approximately 5 microM), and was resistant to inhibition by vanadate, ouabain, and oligomycin. Acidification exhibited no specific cation requirement; however, maximal rates of acidification depended upon the presence of Cl- (Km approximately 20 mM). Other anions were less effective in supporting acidification (Cl- greater than Br- greater than much greater than gluconate, NO-3, SO2-4, and mannitol), and indeed NO-3 inhibited acidification even in the presence of 150 mM Cl-. The proton transport mechanism appeared to be electrogenic based on: (a) enhancement of acidification by valinomycin in the presence of K gluconate, and (b) ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching of bis(3-phenyl-5-oxoisoxasol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol, a membrane potential-sensitive anionic dye. Furthermore, the magnitude of the pH and electrical gradients generated by the proton transport mechanism appeared to vary inversely in the presence and absence of Cl-. Finally, MVB exhibited ATPase activity that was resistant to ouabain and oligomycin, but was inhibited 32.3% by 1 mM NEM, 33.7% by 200 microM dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and 18.7% by KNO3. In isolated MVB, therefore, the NEM-sensitive ATPase activity may represent the enzymatic equivalent of a proton pump. These studies identify and characterize an ATP-dependent electrogenic proton transport process in rat liver MVB which shares many of the properties of the proton pump described in clathrin-coated vesicles, endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum from liver and other tissues. Acidification of MVB differed somewhat from that of rat liver clathrin-coated vesicles in response to Br- and NO-3, suggesting that membrane properties of these two organelles might differ."

As a starting point for studying structure/function relationships in RII-B and investigating the extent of homology and diversity between RII-B and RII-H, a peptide containing the autophosphorylation site of RII-B has been characterized. The phosphopeptide was rapidly (36 h) purified to homogeneity (yield = 40%) from a tryptic digest of RII-B using three consecutive reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography steps. A combination of gas-phase microsequencing and solid-phase Edman degradation was used to determine the sequence and to identify the phosphorylated site: Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Cys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Asn-Pro-Asp-Glu-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-A la-Glu. RII-B contains a classical phosphorylation site for the catalytic subunit, and the phosphopeptide sequence is homologous to the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site of RII-H. Fourteen amino acids are identical in the two sequences, and the high net negative charge on the peptide is conserved. However, the peptide from RII-B is alanine-rich and more hydrophobic. Furthermore, five differences between the two functionally related sequences provide direct evidence for the idea that RII-B and RII-H are the products of related but distinct genes."
https://openalex.org/W1700872444,"A glycolipid-specific lipid transfer protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from pig brain post-mitochondrial supernatant. The purified protein was obtained after about 6,000-fold purification at a yield of 19%. Evidence for the homogeneity of the purified protein includes the following: (i) a single band in acidic gel electrophoresis, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, (ii) a single band in analytical gel isoelectric focusing, (iii) exact correspondence between the glycolipid transfer activity and stained protein absorbance in the acidic gel electrophoresis, and (iv) coincidence between the transfer activity and protein absorption at 280 nm in gel filtration through Ultrogel AcA 54. The protein has an isoelectric point of about 8.3 and a molecular weight of 22,000, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A molecular weight of 15,000 was calculated from AcA 54 gel filtration. The amino acid composition has been determined. The protein binds [3H]galactosylceramide but not [3H]phosphatidylcholine. Under the conditions used, 1 mol of the transfer protein bound about 0.13 mol of [3H]galactosylceramide. The glycolipid transfer protein-[3H]galactosylceramide complex was isolated by a Sephadex G-75 chromatography. An incubation of the complex with liposomes resulted in the transfer of [3H]galactosylceramide from the complex to the acceptor liposomes. The result indicates that the complex functions as an intermediate in the glycolipid transfer reaction. The protein facilitates the transfer of [3H]galactosylceramide from donor liposomes to acceptor liposomes lacking in glycolipid as well as to acceptor liposomes containing galactosylceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1592195833,"Previous work (Yanagishita, M., and Hascall, V. C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10270-10283) has indicated that heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans in rat ovarian granulosa cells are degraded by two kinetically distinct pathways. Pathway 1 degrades proteoglycans rapidly with a t 1/2 approximately 25 min without generating appreciable degradative intermediates. Pathway 2 degrades proteoglycans more slowly with a t 1/2 approximately 4 h, generating distinct degradative intermediates: single HS chains of Mr = approximately 10,000 and approximately 5,000. Effects of leupeptin, an inhibitor of thiol proteases, on the intracellular degradation of proteoglycans in the rat ovarian granulosa cell culture were examined using various chase protocols after labeling cells with [35S]sulfate. The presence of leupeptin at 100 micrograms/ml in the culture medium inhibited the intracellular degradation of proteoglycans by approximately 80% during a 7-h chase period after a 20-h labeling. Leupeptin affected neither the cellular content nor the in vitro activities of beta-hexosaminidase and arylsulfatase. Structural analyses of heparan sulfate species in leupeptin-treated cells demonstrated that the drug inhibited the degradation of HS proteoglycans at two distinct points. First, degradation of the core protein was partially inhibited and delayed before the start of glycosaminoglycan degradation. This resulted in the accumulation of degradative intermediates with partially degraded core proteins bearing intact glycosaminoglycan chains. This establishes the initial sequence for HS proteoglycan degradation, with proteolysis preceding endoglycosidase digestion, and suggests that these two degradation steps may occur in physically separate compartments. Second, the final depolymerization of HS fragments through pathway 2 was totally inhibited, resulting in the continuous accumulation of Mr = 5,000 HS chains. This is not due to the direct inhibition of the lysosomal exoglycosidase and sulfatase enzymes responsible for the complete depolymerization of HS chains, since pathway 1, while slowed, continued to completely depolymerize the HS chains in the presence of leupeptin. The results suggest that the intracellular compartment which completely degrades heparan sulfate chains is separate from those containing partially, endoglycosidically processed heparan sulfate chains and that leupeptin interfered with the translocation of glycosaminoglycans to the final degradation site."

The number of binding sites for nocodazole was shown to be one per tubulin monomer of 50,000 as a result of equilibrium binding studies by gel filtration and spectroscopic techniques. The presence of microtubule-associated proteins did not significantly affect the binding of nocodazole to tubulin. The apparent equilibrium constant measured at 25 degrees C was (4 +/- 1) X 10(5) M-1. Temperature does not significantly affect the apparent equilibrium constant; hence, the binding of nocodazole to tubulin is apparently entropy driven. Stopped flow spectroscopy was employed to monitor the rate of nocodazole binding under pseudo first order conditions. The effects of temperature and nocodazole concentration were studied. The apparent rate constants were dependent on the concentration of nocodazole in a nonlinear manner. In conjunction with results from structural and thermodynamic studies the kinetic results were interpreted to suggest a mechanism of T + N in equilibrium with TN in equilibrium with T* N, where T and N are tubulin and nocodazole, respectively. T and T* represent two conformational states of tubulin. Furthermore, the kinetic data are consistent with the thermodynamic data only if a model of two parallel similar reactions were considered, one rapid and the other slow. The initial binding step for both the rapid and slow phases was characterized by identical binding constants; however, there was a significant difference in the rates of isomerization. Hence, nocodazole is potentially a useful probe for amplifying differences in solution properties of tubulin subspecies."
https://openalex.org/W1485985179,"Attack of O2 on the phenoxy radical derived from butylated hydroxytoluene resulted in the formation of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroperoxy-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (BOOH). This hydroperoxide was rapidly consumed when incubated with rat liver microsomes in the absence of NADPH. The destruction of BOOH was accompanied by formation of the corresponding alcohol (BOH) and a derivative of the alcohol (B(OH)2) in which a t-butyl methyl group was hydroxylated. This diol was produced also when BOH was incubated with microsomes and NADPH, but at a slower rate. Mass spectral analyses of B(OH)2 formed from substrates labeled with either 2H or 18O, showed that oxygen was transferred from the peroxy group to a t-butyl group (via the heme iron of P-450) without migration of the intermediate alcohol from the enzyme active site. The results support a mechanism involving heterolytic O-O bond cleavage during isomerization of the hydroperoxide to B(OH)2. The chiral diol was produced from BOOH nonstereoselectively, but the NADPH/O2-supported hydroxylation of BOH resulted in the formation of a 20% excess of one enantiomer of B(OH)2. Analyses of products formed from the interaction of cumene hydroperoxide with cytochrome P-450 showed that this substrate undergoes rearrangement also; 2-phenyl-1,2-propanediol was produced, together with cumyl alcohol and acetophenone. These results indicate that isomerization competes with other pathways of hydroperoxide destruction by cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W175285166,"The biosynthesis and post-translocational processing of the murine erythrocyte sialoglycoproteins gp2 and gp3 have been studied on splenic erythroblasts obtained from mice rendered anemic by treatment with phenylhydrazine. A putative precursor-product relationship has been established between gp3 and a peptide (gp3pr) of apparent Mr = 22,000. No precursor to gp2 has been found. gp3pr was selectively and efficiently converted to gp3 in pulse-chase experiments after a 45-60-min chase. [3H]Palmitate labeled a series of splenic cell proteins, including gp2, gp3, and gp3pr. Chemical analyses indicated that the fatty acid is covalently linked to protein by an ester bond. Splenic cells incorporated [3H]galactose in both gp2 and gp3 but not in gp3pr. The results indicate that the murine sialoglycoproteins are modified in succession by fatty acid acylation and terminal glycosylation. [3H]Palmitate labeling appears to be an early modification that affects concomitantly gp3pr and gp3, suggesting that fatty acid acylation is a cytosolic event not obligatorily coupled to translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1547686986,"Abstract Xenopus laevis serum contains a lectin which binds alpha- and beta-galactosides. It was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and consists of a single subunit with Mr approximately 69,000, associated in a multimer. The lectin is synthesized and secreted by hepatic parenchymal cells, and its synthesis is increased about 2-fold by estrogen treatment, both in vivo and in primary cell cultures. The serum lectin has the same carbohydrate binding properties as an oocyte lectin from X. laevis described previously, is immunologically cross-reactive, and shows similarities in its peptide map. However, marked differences in amino acid composition preclude the possibility that the serum lectin is a precursor of the oocyte lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1583421526,"Bovine alpha-lactalbumin contains one strong Ca2+-binding site. The free energy (delta G0), enthalpy (delta H0), and entropy (delta S0) of binding of Ca2+ to this site have been calculated from microcalorimetric experiments. The enthalpy of binding was dependent on the metal-free bovine alpha-lactalbumin concentration. At 0.8 mg ml-1, metal-free bovine alpha-lactalbumin delta H0 was -110 +/- 6 kJ mol-1. At this concentration the binding constant was estimated from a mathematical analysis of the titration curves to be greater than 10(7) M-1. This means that delta G0 is smaller than -40 kJ mol-1 and delta S0 is less negative than -235 J.K-1 mol-1. The binding of Ca2+ is therefore enthalpy-driven. From binding experiments as a function of temperature, a delta Cp value of -4.1 kJ.K-1 mol-1 was calculated. This value is dependent on the protein concentration. A tentative explanation for this large value is given."
https://openalex.org/W2100585641,"Reserpic acid, a derivative of the antihypertensive drug reserpine, inhibits catecholamine transport into adrenal medullary chromaffin vesicles. Since it does not affect the membrane potential generated by the H+-translocating adenosine triphosphatase but inhibits ATP-dependent norepinephrine uptake with a Ki of about 10 microM, reserpic acid must block the H+/monoamine translocator. Because reserpic acid is much more polar than reserpine, it does not permeate the chromaffin vesicle membrane, nor is it transported into chromaffin vesicle ghosts in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. Although it inhibits norepinephrine transport when added externally, reserpic acid does not inhibit when trapped inside chromaffin vesicle ghosts. Therefore, reserpic acid must bind to the external face of the monoamine translocator and should be a good probe of the translocator's structural asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1804311205,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (L8S8) from Alcaligenes eutrophus has been crystallized by equilibrium vapor diffusion techniques with ammonium sulfate as precipitant. Crystals thus obtained either as the ternary complex with CO2 and Mg2+ or as the quaternary complex with CO2, Mg2+, and 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, a transition state analogue, diffract at least to 2.8-A resolution. Both are essentially isomorphous to each other, having orthorhombic space group C222(1) with cell dimensions a = 159 A, b = 159 A, and c = 200 A, and there is half a molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the ternary complex are sometimes twinned about the c axis so that the space group appears to be tetragonal. In this light, our earlier report (Bowien, B., Mayer, F., Spiess, E., Pahler, A., Englisch, U., and Saenger, W. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 106, 405-410) on a tetragonal space group P4(2)2(1)2 with crystals obtained from the same enzyme with Mg2+ and CO2 but without 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate might be incorrect."
https://openalex.org/W1597786032,"L-myo-Inositol-1-phosphate synthase has been found to have at least a 5-fold preference for the beta-anomer of its natural substrate D-Glc-6-P. The alpha-anomer appears to be an inhibitor of the reaction and may be converted to product as well. As well as showing an enzymatic preference for the equatorial C-1 hydroxyl of D-Glc-6-P, our results suggest that it is the pyranose form of D-Glc-6-P that binds to the enzyme and that ring-opening is an enzymatic step. We have also found D-2-dGlc-6-P, D-2-F-2-dGlc-6-P, and D-Man-6-P each to be both competitive inhibitors and substrates that are converted to inositol phosphates by the synthase. D-Allose-6-P is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, but not a substrate. D-Gal-6-P is neither substrate nor inhibitor. Thus the specificity of the synthase with respect to single position epimers of D-Glc-6-P increases in the order C1 less than C2 much less than C3 less than C4."
