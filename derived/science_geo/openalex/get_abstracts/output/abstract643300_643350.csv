https://openalex.org/W2990562645,"Mixed signals at tumor margins The Hippo signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor growth, sparking interest in the pathway as a potential therapeutic target. In a study of liver cancer in genetically manipulated mice, Moya et al. discovered that the role of this pathway in tumorigenesis is more complex than previously appreciated. They confirmed that activation of the Hippo pathway within tumor cells drives tumor growth; however, they also found that activation of the pathway in adjacent healthy cells has the opposite effect, suppressing tumor growth. Whether tumor cells survive or are eliminated thus appears to depend on competing signals produced by the tumor and surrounding tissue. Science , this issue p. 1029"

Despite advances in protein design, creating a protein-based sense-and-respond system remains challenging. Glasgow et al. designed binding sites at the interface of protein heterodimers (see the Perspective by Chica). By fusing each monomer to one half of a split reporter, they linked ligand-driven dimerization to the reporter output. The computational design strategy provides a generalizable approach to create synthetic sensing systems with different outputs. Science , this issue p. 1024 ; see also p. 952"
https://openalex.org/W2990398323,"Osteomyelitis, or bone infection, is often induced by antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains of bacteria. Although debridement and long-term administration of antibiotics are the gold standard for osteomyelitis treatment, the increase in prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains limits the ability of clinicians to effectively treat infection. Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that in a lytic state can effectively kill bacteria, have gained recent attention for their high specificity, abundance in nature, and minimal risk of host toxicity. Previously, we have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing techniques could be utilized to expand temperate bacteriophage host range and enhance bactericidal activity through modification of the tail fiber protein. In a dermal infection study, these CRISPR-Cas9 phages reduced bacterial load relative to unmodified phage. Thus we hypothesized this temperate bacteriophage, equipped with the CRISPR-Cas9 bactericidal machinery, would be effective at mitigating infection from a biofilm forming S. aureus strain in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, qualitative fluorescent imaging demonstrated superiority of phage to conventional vancomycin and fosfomycin antibiotics against S. aureus biofilm. Quantitative antibiofilm effects increased over time, at least partially, for all fosfomycin, phage, and fosfomycin-phage (dual) therapeutics delivered via alginate hydrogel. We developed an in vivo rat model of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection that was reproducible and challenging and enabled longitudinal monitoring of infection progression. Using this model, phage (with and without fosfomycin) delivered via alginate hydrogel were successful in reducing soft tissue infection but not bone infection, based on bacteriological, histological, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Notably, the efficacy of phage at mitigating soft tissue infection was equal to that of high dose fosfomycin. Future research may utilize this model as a platform for evaluation of therapeutic type and dose, and alternate delivery vehicles for osteomyelitis mitigation."

One of the primary sites of accumulation and potential damage from HMs is bone, and we therefore examined the acute effects of lead and cadmium on human bone osteoblasts in vitro over a concentration range of 0.1 μM to 1mM, and for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hour exposures. Incubation of osteoblasts with either lead or cadmium reduced cell viability in a concentrations and exposure durations dependent manner, as measured using MTT and LDH assays. Cytotoxicity was significant from 0.1 μM concentrations after 48 hour exposures. Both HMs damaged cellular bioenergetics with reductions of ATP production, mitochondrial complex activities, and aerobic respiration. There was a concomitant elevation of reactive oxygen species, with induction of redox stress measured as increased lipid peroxidation, and depleted cellular redox defense systems via reduced superoxide dismutase and catalase activity and cellular glutathione levels. Both HMs induced nuclear activation of Nrf2, presumably to increase transcription of antioxidant responsive genes to combat oxidative stress. Incubation of osteoblasts with HMs also compromised the secretion of procollagen type 1, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase. Pre-incubation of osteoblasts with reduced glutathione prior to challenge with HMs lessened the cytotoxicity of the HMs, indicative that antioxidants may be a beneficial treatment adjunct in cases of acute lead or cadmium poisoning."
https://openalex.org/W2989691968,"Background Most studies regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) address selected populations (i.e., neonates with low birth weight or extremely preterm neonates). Studying all age groups is more suitable to assess the burden of single pathogens and their clinical relevance. Methods This is a retrospective regional study involving paediatric departments and NICUs in Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Regional laboratory databases were searched from 2009 to 2012. Records of infants (aged 4 to 90 days) with a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture were retrospectively reviewed and analysed according to acquisition mode (whether hospital- or community-acquired). Results During the study period, there were 146,682 live births (LBs), with 296 patients experiencing 331 episodes of LOS (incidence rate: 2.3/1000 LBs). Brain lesions upon discharge from the hospital were found in 12.3% (40/296) of cases, with death occurring in 7.1% (23/296; 0.14/1000 LBs). With respect to full-term neonates, extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight neonates had very high risk of LOS and related mortality (> 100- and > 800-fold higher respectively). Hospital-acquired LOS (n = 209) was significantly associated with very low birth weight, extremely preterm birth, pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and death (p< 0.01). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, catecholamine support (OR = 3.2), central venous line before LOS (OR = 14.9), and meningitis (OR = 44.7) were associated with brain lesions or death in hospital-acquired LOS (area under the ROC curve 0.81, H-L p = 0.41). Commonly identified pathogens included coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS n = 71, 21.4%), Escherichia coli (n = 50, 15.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 41, 12.4%) and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 41, 12.4%). Group B streptococcus was the predominant cause of meningitis (16 of 38 cases, 42%). Most pathogens were sensitive to first line antibiotics. Conclusions This study provides the first Italian data regarding late-onset sepsis (LOS) in all gestational age groups. Compared to full-term neonates, very high rates of LOS and mortality occurred in neonates with a lower birth weight and gestational age. Group B streptococcus was the leading cause of meningitis. Excluding CoNS, the predominant pathogens were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with hospital-acquired LOS had a worse outcome. Antibiotic associations, recommended for empirical treatment of hospital- or community-acquired LOS, were adequate."
https://openalex.org/W2989725661,"Educational researchers, psychologists, social, epidemiological and medical scientists are often dealing with multilevel data. Sometimes, the response variable in multilevel data is categorical in nature and needs to be analyzed through Multilevel Logistic Regression Models. The main theme of this paper is to provide guidelines for the analysts to select an appropriate sample size while fitting multilevel logistic regression models for different threshold parameters and different estimation methods. Simulation studies have been performed to obtain optimum sample size for Penalized Quasi-likelihood (PQL) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) Methods of estimation. Our results suggest that Maximum Likelihood Method performs better than Penalized Quasi-likelihood Method and requires relatively small sample under chosen conditions. To achieve sufficient accuracy of fixed and random effects under ML method, we established ‘‘50/50” and ‘‘120/50” rule respectively. On the basis our findings, a ‘‘50/60” and ‘‘120/70” rules under PQL method of estimation have also been recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2989758651,"Background To understand how to reduce antibiotic use, greater knowledge is needed about the complexities of access in countries with loose regulation or enforcement. This study aimed to explore how households in Bangladesh were accessing antimicrobials for themselves and their domestic animals. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 48 households in one urban and one rural area. Households were purposively sampled from two lower income strata, prioritising those with under 5-year olds, older adults, household animals and minority groups. Households where someone was currently ill with a suspected infection (13 households) were invited for a follow-up interview. Framework analysis was used to explore access to healthcare and medicines. Findings People accessed medicines for themselves through five pathways: drugs shops, private clinics, government/charitable hospitals, community/family planning clinics, and specialised/private hospitals. Drug shops provided direct access to medicines for common, less serious and acute illnesses. For persistent or serious illnesses, the healthcare pathway may include contacts with several of these settings, but often relied on medicines provided by drug shops. In the 13 households with an unwell family member, most received at least one course of antibiotics for this illness. Multiple and incomplete dosing were common even when prescribed by a qualified doctor. Antibiotics were identified by their high cost compared to other medicines. Cost was a reported barrier to purchasing full courses of antibiotics. Few households in the urban area kept household animals. In this rural area, government animal health workers provided most care for large household animals (cows), but drug shops were also important. Conclusions In Bangladesh, unregulated drug shops provide an essential route to medicines including those prescribed in the formal sector. Wherever licensed suppliers are scarce and expensive, regulations which prohibit this supply risk removing access entirely for many people."

https://openalex.org/W2989983419,"Urbanization is driving the transformation of natural and rural ecosystems worldwide by affecting both the abiotic environment and the biota. This raises the question whether urban ecosystems are able to provide services in a comparable way to their non-urban counterparts. In urban grasslands, the effects of urbanization-driven ecological novelty and the role of plant diversity in modulating ecosystem functioning have received little attention. In this study, we assessed the influence of biodiversity, abiotic and biotic novelty on ecosystem functioning based on in situ measurements in non-manipulated grasslands along an urbanization gradient in Berlin (Germany). We focused on plant aboveground biomass (AGB), intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and 15N enrichment factor (Δδ15N) as proxies for biomass production, water and N cycling, respectively, within grassland communities, and tested how they change with plant biogeographic status (native vs alien), functional group and species identity. Approximately one third of the forb species were alien to Berlin and they were responsible for 13.1% of community AGB. Community AGB was positively correlated with plant-species richness. In contrast, iWUE and Δδ15N were mostly determined by light availability (depicted by sky view factor) and urban parameters like the percentage of impervious surface or human population density. We found that abiotic novelty potentially favors aliens in Berlin, mainly by enhancing their dispersal and fitness under drought. Mainly urban parameters indicating abiotic novelty were significantly correlated to both alien and native Δδ15N, but to AGB and iWUE of alien plants only, pointing to a stronger impact of abiotic novelty on N cycling compared to C and water cycling. At the species level, sky view factor appeared to be the prevailing driver of photosynthetic performance and resource-use efficiency. Although we identified a significant impact of abiotic novelty on AGB, iWUE and Δδ15N at different levels, the relationship between species richness and community AGB found in the urban grasslands studied in Berlin was comparable to that described in non-urban experimental grasslands in Europe. Hence, our results indicate that conserving and enhancing biodiversity in urban ecosystems is essential to preserve ecosystem services related to AGB production. For ensuring the provision of ecosystem services associated to water and N use, however, changes in urban abiotic parameters seem necessary."

Similar measurements were performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from rabbits submitted to an injurious ventilatory regimen, and from patients with ARDS.Mitochondrial DNA was released by A549 cells during cell stretching, and was found elevated in BAL fluids from rabbits during VILI, and from ARDS patients. Cyclic stretch-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) of A549 cells could be inhibited by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) blockade. ATP concentrations were increased in conditioned supernatants from A549 cells, and in rabbit BAL fluids during VILI. Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by A549 cells conditioned supernatants was essentially dependent on fMLP rather than IL-8. A synergy between cyclic stretch-induced alarmins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found in monocyte-derived macrophages in the production of IL-1ß.Mitochondrial alarmins are released during cyclic stretch of human epithelial cells, as well as in BAL fluids from rabbits ventilated with an injurious ventilatory regimen, and found in BAL fluids from ARDS patients, particularly in those with high alveolar inflammation. These alarmins are likely to represent the proximal endogenous mediators of VILI and ARDS, released by injured pulmonary cells."
https://openalex.org/W2990850232,"Studies on the willingness to receive institutional eldercare among the rural elderly are scarce. This study aims to explore factors associated with the willingness to receive institutional eldercare and community-based eldercare among the rural elderly. A cross-sectional study was conducted in three rural villages of Changde City, Hunan Province, China. A total of 517 elderly were recruited through multistage sampling from these villages. The dependent variable is the willingness to receive eldercare from family (as reference), institution, and community. The independent variables includes sociodemographic characteristics: having physical disease, depression, anxiety, and daily living activities, and concerns toward home-based, institutional, and community-based care, respectively. Results show that 78.3% of the elderly are willing to receive home-based eldercare, 10.8% institutional eldercare, and 8.5% community-based eldercare. The factors associated with the willingness to receive institutional eldercare are having concerns toward home-based (OR = 4.85, P<0.001) and institutional eldercare (OR = 5.51, P<0.001). The factors associated with community-based care is living alone (OR = 2.18, P = 0.034). Finally, the major concerns toward home-based eldercare are lack of care ability and separation of family members, whereas those toward institutional eldercare are unaffordable services and fear of being abandoned by the children. The major concerns toward community-based eldercare includes affordability and lack of necessary services. In summary, elderly having concerns toward home-based care and having no concerns about institutional care are willing to accept institutional eldercare. Elderly who are living alone is tend to accept community-based care. Unaffordable services and loss of contact with family members are the major concerns of institutional eldercare. Aside from the cost, the lack of necessary care services is also a serious concern of community-based eldercare."
https://openalex.org/W2991247859,"The timing and magnitude of sex differences in athletic performance during early human development, prior to adulthood, is unknown.To compare swimming velocity of boys and girls for all Olympic-length freestyle swimming events to determine the age of divergence in swimming performance.We collected the all-time top 100 U.S. freestyle swimming performance times of boys and girls age 5 to 18 years for the 50m to 1500m events.Swimming performance improved with increasing age for boys and girls (p<0.001) until reaching a plateau, which initiated at a younger age for girls (15 years) than boys (17 years; sex×age; p<0.001). Prior to age 10, the top 5 swimming records for girls were 3% faster than the top boys (p<0.001). For the 10th-50th places, however, there were no sex-related differences in swimming performance prior to age 10 (p = 0.227). For both the top 5 and 10th-50th places, the sex difference in performance increased from age 10 (top 5, 2.5%; 10th-50th places, 1.0%) until age 17 (top 5, 7.6%; 10th-50th places, 8.0%). For all places, the sex difference in performance at age 18 was larger for sprint events (9.6%; 50-200m) than endurance events (7.1%; 400-1500m; p<0.001). Additionally, the sex-related difference in performance increased across age and US ranking from 2.4% for 1st place to 4.3% for 100th place (p<0.001), indicating less depth of performance in girls than boys. However, annual participation was ~20% higher in girls than boys for all ages (p<0.001).The top 5 girls demonstrated faster swimming velocities and the 10th-50th place girls demonstrated similar swimming velocities than boys (until ~10 years). After age 10, however, boys demonstrated increasingly faster swimming velocities than girls until 17 years. Collectively, these data suggest girls are faster, or at least not slower, than boys prior to the performance-enhancing effects of puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2990715170,"Reliable identification of Inflammatory biomarkers from metagenomics data is a promising direction for developing non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid clinical tests for early diagnosis of IBD. We present an integrative approach to Network-Based Biomarker Discovery (NBBD) which integrates network analyses methods for prioritizing potential biomarkers and machine learning techniques for assessing the discriminative power of the prioritized biomarkers. Using a large dataset of new-onset pediatric IBD metagenomics biopsy samples, we compare the performance of Random Forest (RF) classifiers trained on features selected using a representative set of traditional feature selection methods against NBBD framework, configured using five different tools for inferring networks from metagenomics data, and nine different methods for prioritizing biomarkers as well as a hybrid approach combining best traditional and NBBD based feature selection. We also examine how the performance of the predictive models for IBD diagnosis varies as a function of the size of the data used for biomarker identification. Our results show that (i) NBBD is competitive with some of the state-of-the-art feature selection methods including Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) scores; and (ii) NBBD is especially effective in reliably identifying IBD biomarkers when the number of data samples available for biomarker discovery is small."
https://openalex.org/W2991457576,"The goal of the present study was the evaluation of the fatty acid (FA) profile of lipid fraction from dry common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (CBO) harvested from North-East (NE) and South-West (SW) of Romania and to protect against thermal and oxidative degradation of the contained omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) glycerides by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) nanoencapsulation, using kneading method. The most abundant FAs in the CBO samples were PUFAs, according to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Linoleic acid (methyl ester) was the main constituent, having relative concentrations of 43.4 (±1.95) % and 35.23 (±0.68) % for the lipid fractions separated from the common beans harvested from the NE and SW of Romania, respectively. Higher relative concentrations were obtained for the omega-3 α-linolenic acid methyl ester at values of 13.13 (±0.59) % and 15.72 (±0.30) % for NE and SW Romanian samples, respectively. The omega-3/omega-6 ratio consistently exceeds the lower limit value of 0.2, from where the PUFA glyceride mixture is valuable for the human health. This value was 0.32 (±0.02) for the NE samples and significantly higher for the CBO-SW samples, 0.51 (±0.01). These highly hydrophobic mixtures especially consisting of PUFA triglycerides provide β-CD complexes having higher thermal and oxidative stability. Kneading method allowed obtaining β-CD/CBO powder-like complexes with higher recovery yields of >70%. Thermal analyses of complexes revealed a lower content of hydration water (3.3–5.8% up to 110°C in thermogravimetry (TG) analysis and 154–347 J/g endothermal effect in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis) in comparison with the β-CD hydrate (12.1% and 479.5–480 J/g, respectively). These findings support the molecular inclusion process of FA moieties into the β-CD cavity. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis reveals the formation of the β-CD/CBO inclusion complexes by restricting the vibration and bending of some bonds from the host and guest molecules. Moreover, powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD) analysis confirm the formation of the host-guest complexes by modifying the diffractograms for β-CD/CBO complexes in comparison with the β-CD and β-CD + CBO physical mixtures. A significant reduction of the level of crystallinity from 93.3 (±5.3) % for β-CD to 60–60.9% for the corresponding β-CD/CBO complexes have been determined. The encapsulation efficiency (EE), the profile of FAs, as well as the controlled release of the encapsulated oil have also been evaluated. The EE was >40% in all cases, the highest value being obtained for β-CD/CBO-SW complex. The SFA content increased, while the unsaturated FA glycerides had lower relative concentrations in the encapsulated CBO samples. It can be emphasized that the main omega-3 FA (namely α-linolenic acid glycerides) had close concentrations in the encapsulated and raw CBOs (13.13 (±0.59) % and 14.04 (±1.54) % for non-encapsulated and encapsulated CBO-NE samples, 15.72 (±0.30) % and 12.41 (±1.95) % for the corresponding CBO-SW samples, respectively). The overall unsaturated FA content significantly decreased after complexation (from 19.03–19.16% for the raw CBOs to 17.3–17.7% for encapsulated oils in the case of MUFAs, and from 55.7–58.8% to 35.13–43.36% for PUFAs). On the other hand, the omega-3/omega-6 ratio increased by β-CD nanoencapsulation to 0.51 (±0.07) and 0.76 (0.26) for β-CD/CBO-NE and β-CD/CBO-SW complexes, respectively. As a conclusion, the lipid fractions of the Romanian common beans are good candidates for β-CD complexation and they can be protected against thermal and oxidative degradation in common beans based food products such as functional foods or food supplements using natural CDs."
https://openalex.org/W2990337573,"There is high risk of metastasis and recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, especially for patient who received definitive surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Aberrant activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling occurs in approximately 80% of HNSCC, which has been indicated to serve as prognostic biomarkers for patients suffer from recurrence or metastasis. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the relationship between the expression level of signaling factors in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and recurrence tumor from HNSCC patients. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from 54 cases of HNSCC patients who received definitive surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, are followed more than 5 years, and with no previous malignancy and synchronous tumor. Slides were scored and dichotomized by two pathologists and scores. Based on the TMA block with IHC staining, the results showed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling was highly activated both in recurrence and non-recurrence patients. Particularly, in the recurrence population, the results showed the low expression phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (p-eIF4E) or high expression eIF4E, phospho-eIF4E binding protein 1 (p-4EBP1), phospho-ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p-S6K1) and phospho-40S ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6R) exhibited worse overall survival. The expression level of eIF4E and p-4EBP1 were significantly associated with tumor recurrence and recurrence-free survival. Furthermore, high expression level of eIF4E and p-4EBP1 had worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, the expression of eIF4E and p-4EBP1 should be considered as predictive biomarkers for the HNSCC patients. This may contribute to potential predictive biomarkers for HNSCC patient who receive adjuvant radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2990445312,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human cancer, characterized by aberrant activation of the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway resulting from mutations in the patched 1 (PTCH1) or smoothened (SMO) genes. In the present study, to uncover the expression profile of HH signaling-related molecules, we thoroughly examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of six molecules including GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, PTCH2, SHH, and SMO in BCC and various other cutaneous tumors. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that BCC showed remarkably enhanced mRNA expression of all HH molecules, except SMO compared to other skin tumors. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that only GLI1 protein was specifically upregulated in BCC, while the other HH-related proteins did not show any significant differences between the tumors. Notably, other skin malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and malignant melanoma showed no GLI1 expression and there was no difference in GLI1 expression between the BCC subtypes. In addition, GLI1 and GLI2 expression were strongly associated with the hair follicle stem cell markers, LGR4 and LGR5, which are known target genes of the Wnt pathway. Our results suggest that GLI1 has the potential to be a diagnostically useful marker for differentiating BCC from other skin malignancies and an interaction between the HH and Wnt signaling pathways may be involved in the development of BCCs."

N1-methylguanosine-37 and N1-methylinosine-37 in tRNAs, both located at the 3’-adjacent to the anticodon, are formed by Trm5. Here we describe Arabidopsis thaliana AtTRM5 (At3g56120) as a Trm5 ortholog. Attrm5 mutant plants have overall slower growth as observed by slower leaf initiation rate, delayed flowering and reduced primary root length. In Attrm5 mutants, mRNAs of flowering time genes are less abundant and correlated with delayed flowering. We show that AtTRM5 complements the yeast trm5 mutant, and in vitro methylates tRNA guanosine-37 to produce N1-methylguanosine (m1G). We also show in vitro that AtTRM5 methylates tRNA inosine-37 to produce N1-methylinosine (m1I) and in Attrm5 mutant plants, we show a reduction of both N1-methylguanosine and N1-methylinosine. We also show that AtTRM5 is localized to the nucleus in plant cells. Proteomics data showed that photosynthetic protein abundance is affected in Attrm5 mutant plants. Finally, we show tRNA-Ala aminoacylation is not affected in Attrm5 mutants. However the abundance of tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Asp 5’ half cleavage products are deduced. Our findings highlight the bifunctionality of AtTRM5 and the importance of the post-transcriptional tRNA modifications m1G and m1I at tRNA position 37 in general plant growth and development."

Objective To investigate the repercussion of periodontal disease (PD) in the pregnant woman health and the complications during pregnancy and delivery, as well as negative outcomes for the newborn (as infections, prematurity, low birth weight and fetal growth restriction). Method Retrospective cohort study, based on medical records of 142 pregnant women assisted at a prenatal service of usual risk between 2012–2014, with a dental evaluation for PD. Maternal variables, along with labor and newborn variables, were analyzed. The newborns were stratified into two groups: offspring of mothers with PD (subdivided into Severe Periodontal Disease—SPD) and offspring of mothers without PD. Each outcome was adjusted by a multiple logistic regression model, with significance for p-value <0.05, considering all potential confounding factors. Results Among women diagnosed with SPD, the odds ratio for vulvovaginitis was 3.45 times greater (OR = 3.45, p-value = 0.050) and 5.59 times higher for premature rupture of membranes (OR = 5.59; p-value = 0.017). For neonates, the chance of fetal growth restriction was 11.53 times higher for pregnant women with SPD (OR = 11.53, p = 0.041). Conclusion The periodontal disease increased the chance of neonatal and maternal negative outcomes, being the fetal growth restriction, vulvovaginitis and premature rupture of the membrane (PROM) the main results driven by the presence of Severe Periodontal Disease."

Methods This retrospective cohort study used the US IBM MarketScan database (2012–2017) and the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) (2004–2015) database to describe treatment patterns in incident PD cases. Patients fulfilling the case definition of PD, ≥30 years, with a 2-year baseline period prior to the index date (date of PD diagnosis), and ≥90 days of follow-up were included in the study. Treatment was classified as monotherapy (one PD medication for ≥60 continuous days), polytherapy (at least two PD medications concurrently for ≥60 days), or untreated (no PD medication prescription). Treatment patterns described included type of medication, duration and outcome of treatment. Results There were 11,280 patients in IBM MarketScan and 7775 patients in CPRD who fulfilled the study criteria. The proportion of treated patients was 62.4% (US) and 78.6% (UK). The majority of patients were prescribed monotherapy as first-line treatment (US: 85.2%, UK: 68.5%). Levodopa was the most frequently prescribed first-line medication (US: 70.1%, UK: 29.0%). There were 57.9% in the US and 23.8% in the UK who remained on the first monotherapy treatment till the end of the study. Conclusion The study has highlighted the current treatment practices in the US and UK, and underscored differences in the two regions impacted by treatment policies and guidelines."

Due to tissue limitation and variable disease progression, stage-specific miRNAs changes in prostate cancer is unknown. Using chip-based microarray, we investigated global miRNA expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP, PC3, DU145 and 22Rv1 cells representing early-stage, advanced-stage and castration resistant prostate cancer in comparison with normal prostate epithelial cells. A total of 292 miRNAs were differentially expressed with 125 upregulated and 167 downregulated. These miRNAs were involved in pathways including drug resistance drug-efflux, adipogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, bone metamorphosis, and Th1/Th2 signaling. Regulation of miRNAs were interlinked with upstream regulators such as Argonaut 2 (AGO2), Double-Stranded RNA-Specific Endoribonuclease (DICER1), Sjogren syndrome antigen B (SSB), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA), activated during stage-specific disease progression. Candidate target genes and pathways dysregulated in stage-specific prostate cancer were identified using CS-miRTar database and confirmed in clinical specimens. Integrative network analysis suggested some genes targeted by miRNAs include miR-17, let7g, miR-146, miR-204, miR-205, miR-221, miR-301 and miR-520 having a major effect on their dysregulation in prostate cancer. MiRNA-microarray analysis further identified miR-130a, miR-181, miR-328, miR146 and miR-200 as a panel of novel miRNAs associated with drug resistance drug-efflux and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.

We previously reported that the AM-RAMP2 system is involved in tumor angiogenesis, but the function of the AM-RAMP3 system remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the actions of the AM-RAMP2 and 3 systems in the tumor microenvironment and their impact on metastasis. PAN02 pancreatic cancer cells were injected into the spleens of mice, leading to spontaneous liver metastasis. Tumor metastasis was enhanced in vascular endothelial cell-specific RAMP2 knockout mice (DI-E-RAMP2-/-). By contrast, metastasis was suppressed in RAMP3-/- mice, where the number of podoplanin (PDPN)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was reduced in the periphery of tumors at metastatic sites. Because PDPN-positive CAFs are a hallmark of tumor malignancy, we assessed the regulation of PDPN and found that Src/Cas/PDPN signaling is mediated by RAMP3. In fact, RAMP3 deficiency CAFs suppressed migration, proliferation, and metastasis in co-cultures with tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the activation of RAMP2 in RAMP3-/- mice suppressed both tumor growth and metastasis. Based on these results, we suggest that the upregulation of PDPN in DI-E-RAMP2-/- mice increases malignancy, while the downregulation of PDPN in RAMP3-/- mice reduces it. Selective activation of RAMP2 and inhibition of RAMP3 would therefore be expected to suppress tumor metastasis. This study provides the first evidence that understanding and targeting to AM-RAMP systems could contribute to the development of novel therapeutics against metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2990970459,"Background Providing high-quality kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a strategy proven to improve outcomes in premature babies. However, whether KMC is consistently and appropriately provided in Ethiopia is unclear. This study assesses the quality of KMC services in Ethiopia and the factors associated with its appropriate initiation among low birth weight neonates. Methods We used data from the 2016 national Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) assessment which contains data on all health facilities providing delivery care services in Ethiopia (N = 3,804). We described the quality of KMC services provided to low-birth weight (LBW) babies in terms of infrastructure, processes and outcomes (survival status at discharge). We also explored the factors associated with appropriate KMC initiation using multivariable logistic regression models. Results The quality of KMC services in Ethiopia was poor. The facilities included scored only 59.0% on average on a basic index of service readiness. KMC was initiated for only 46.4% of all LBW babies included in the sample. Among those who received KMC, 66.7% survived, 13.3% died and 20.4% had no data on survival status at discharge. LBW babies born in health centers were twice more likely to receive KMC compared to those born in hospitals (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3–3.0). Public facilities, those with a staff rotation policy in place for newborn care, and those with separate newborn corners were also more likely to initiate KMC for LBW babies. Conclusions We found low levels of appropriate KMC initiation, inadequate infrastructure and staffing, and poor survival among LBW babies in Ethiopia. Efforts must be made to improve the adoption of this life saving technique, particularly in hospitals and in the private sector where KMC remains underutilized. Facilities should also dedicate specific spaces for newborn care that enables mothers to provide KMC. In addition, improving record keeping and data quality for routine health data is a priority."
https://openalex.org/W2991320789,"Because poor sanitation is hypothesized as a major direct and indirect pathway of exposure to antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), we sought to determine a) the prevalence of and b) environmental risk factors for gut carriage of key ARGs in a pediatric cohort at high risk of enteric infections due to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions. We investigated ARGs in stool from young children in crowded, low-income settlements of Maputo, Mozambique, and explored potential associations with concurrent enteric pathogen carriage, diarrhea, and environmental risk factors, including WASH. We collected stool from 120 children <14 months old and tested specimens via quantal, multiplex molecular assays for common bacterial, viral, and protozoan enteric pathogens and 84 ARGs encoding potential resistance to 7 antibiotic classes. We estimated associations between ARG detection (number and diversity detected) and concurrently-measured enteric pathogen carriage, recently-reported diarrhea, and risk factors in the child’s living environment. The most commonly-detected ARGs encoded resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins (100% of children); tetracyclines (98%); β-lactams (94%), aminoglycosides (84%); fluoroquinolones (48%); and vancomycin (38%). Neither concurrent diarrhea nor measured environmental (including WASH) conditions were associated with ARG detection in adjusted models. Enteric pathogen carriage and ARG detection were associated: on average, 18% more ARGs were detected in stool from children carrying bacterial pathogens than those without (adjusted risk ratio (RR): 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.37), with 16% fewer ARGs detected in children carrying parasitic pathogens (protozoans, adjusted RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.99). We observed gut ARGs conferring potential resistance to a range of antibiotics in this at-risk cohort that had high rates of enteric infection, even among children <14 months-old. Gut ARGs did not appear closely correlated with WASH, though environmental conditions were generally poor. ARG carriage may be associated with concurrent carriage of bacterial enteric pathogens, suggesting indirect linkages to WASH that merit further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2990799823,"Recent technical advancements in neural engineering allow for precise recording and control of neural circuits simultaneously, opening up new opportunities for closed-loop neural control. In this work, a rapid spike sorting system was developed based on template matching to rapidly calculate instantaneous firing rates for each neuron in a multi-unit extracellular recording setting. Cluster templates were first generated by a desktop computer using a non-parameter spike sorting algorithm (Super-paramagnetic clustering) and then transferred to a field-programmable gate array digital circuit for rapid sorting through template matching. Two different matching techniques–Euclidean distance (ED) and correlational matching (CM)–were compared for the accuracy of sorting and the performance of calculating firing rates. The performance of the system was first verified using publicly available artificial data and was further confirmed with pre-recorded neural spikes from an anesthetized Mongolian gerbil. Real-time recording and sorting from an awake mouse were also conducted to confirm the system performance in a typical behavioral neuroscience experimental setting. Experimental results indicated that high sorting accuracies were achieved for both template-matching methods, but CM can better handle spikes with non-Gaussian spike distributions, making it more robust for in vivo recording. The technique was also compared to several other off-line spike sorting algorithms and the results indicated that the sorting accuracy is comparable but sorting time is significantly shorter than these other techniques. A low sorting latency of under 2 ms and a maximum spike sorting rate of 941 spikes/second have been achieved with our hybrid hardware/software system. The low sorting latency and fast sorting rate allow future system developments of neural circuit modulation through analyzing neural activities in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W2990570629,"The aim of this work was to investigate radiomic analysis of contrast and non-contrast enhanced planning CT images of oesophageal cancer (OC) patients in terms of stability, dimensionality and contrast agent dependency. The prognostic significance of CT-based radiomic features was also evaluated. Different 2D and 3D radiomic features were extracted from contrast and non-contrast enhanced CT images of 213 patients from the multi-centre SCOPE1 randomised controlled trial (RCT) in OC. Feature stability was evaluated by randomly dividing patients into three groups and identifying textures with similar distributions among groups with a Kruskal-Wallis analysis. A paired two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess for significant differences in the remaining corresponding 2D and 3D stable features. A prognostic model was constructed using clinical characteristics and remaining filtered features. The discriminative ability of significant variables was tested using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A total of 238 2D and 3D radiomic features were computed from oesophageal CT images. More than 75 features were stable if extracted from homogeneous cohort (contrast or non-contrast enhanced CT images) and inhomogeneous cohort (contrast and non-contrast enhanced CT images). Among the remaining corresponding stable features computed from both cohorts, only 4 features did not show a statistically significant difference if obtained in 2D or in 3D (p-value < 0.05). A Cox regression model constructed using 5 clinical variables (age, sex, tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) stage, WHO performance status and contrast administration) and 4 radiomic variables (inverse varianceGLCM, large distance emphasisGLDZM, zone distance non uniformity normGLDZM, zone distance varianceGLDZM), identified one radiomic feature (zone distance varianceGLDZM) that was significantly associated with overall survival (p-value = 0.032, HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02-1.52). A significant difference in overall survival between groups was found when considering a threshold of zone distance varianceGLDZM equals to 1.70 (X2 = 7.692, df = 1, p-value = 0.006). Zone distance varianceGLDZM was identified as the only stable CT radiomic feature statistically correlated with overall survival, independent of dimensionality and contrast administration. This feature was able to identify high-risk patients and if validated, could be the subject of a future clinical trial aiming to improve clinical decision making and personalise OC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2991036965,"Background Antibiotic use is a major driver of antibiotic resistance. Although delayed antibiotic prescription is a recommended strategy to reduce antibiotic use, practices vary; it appears less commonly used in southern European countries where antibiotic consumption is highest. Despite these variations, few qualitative studies have explored general practitioners’ perceptions of delayed antibiotic prescription. We therefore aimed to explore and describe the perceptions of delayed antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections among general practitioners in Malta. Methods This qualitative phenomenographic study was conducted in Malta. A semi-structured interview guide was developed in English, pilot tested and revised accordingly. Interview topics included views on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic use and delayed antibiotic prescription for respiratory tract infections, and barriers and facilitators to antibiotic prescription. Individual, face-to-face interviews were held in 2014 with a quota sample of 20 general practitioners and transcribed verbatim. Data were subsequently analysed using a phenomenographic approach. Findings General practitioners perceived delayed antibiotic prescription in five qualitatively different ways: (A) “The Service Provider”–maintaining a good general practitioner-patient relationship to retain patients and avoid doctor-shopping, (B) “The Uncertainty Avoider”–reaching a compromise and providing treatment just in case, (C) “The Comforter”–providing the patient comfort and reassurance, (D) “The Conscientious Practitioner”–empowering and educating patients, and limiting antibiotic use, and (E) “The Holder of Professional Power”–retaining general practitioner responsibility by employing a wait-and-see approach. Although general practitioners were largely positive towards delayed antibiotic prescription, not all supported the strategy; some preferred a wait-and-see approach with follow-up. Many delayed antibiotic prescription users selectively practiced delayed prescription with patients they trusted or who they believed had a certain level of knowledge and understanding. They also preferred a patient-led approach with a one to three day delay; post-dating delayed antibiotic prescriptions was uncommon. Conclusions In this study we have shown that general practitioners hold varying perceptions about delayed antibiotic prescription and that there is variation in the way delayed antibiotic prescription is employed in Malta. Whilst delayed antibiotic prescription is utilised in Malta, not all general practitioners support the strategy, and motivations and practices differ. In high consumption settings, formal and standardised implementation of delayed antibiotic prescription could help curb antibiotic overuse. Diagnosis-specific delayed antibiotic prescription recommendations should also be incorporated into guidelines. Finally, further investigation into patients’ and pharmacists’ views on delayed antibiotic prescription is required. Trial registration number NCT03218930"
https://openalex.org/W2991392102,"Our analysis of thousands of movies and books reveals how these cultural products weave stereotypical gender roles into morality tales and perpetuate gender inequality through storytelling. Using the word embedding techniques, we reveal the constructed emotional dependency of female characters on male characters in stories. We call this narrative structure “Cinderella complex”, which assumes that women depend on men in the pursuit of a happy, fulfilling life. Our analysis covers a substantial portion of narratives that shape the modern collective memory, including 7,226 books, 6,087 movie synopses, and 1,109 movie scripts. The “Cinderella complex” is observed to exist widely across periods and contexts, reminding how gender stereotypes are deeply rooted in our society. Our analysis of the words surrounding female and male characters shows that the lives of males are adventure-oriented, whereas the lives of females are romantic-relationship oriented. Finally, we demonstrate the social endorsement of gender stereotypes by showing that gender-stereotypical movies are voted more frequently and rated higher."
https://openalex.org/W2991495371,"The realms of parenting have long belonged to females. In many cultures it has been a female who has predominantly cared for and raised children. For many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander male parents this has resulted in them being largely overlooked from contributing to the parenting conversation. Predictably, such a dominant discourse has led to an inadequate distribution of opportunities available and a societal perception that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander male parents are disinterested in and/or disengaged from their parental roles and responsibilities, however, this is far from the truth.This study is entrenched in an Indigenist research approach which privileges Indigenous lives, Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous voices, and utilised the Research Topic Yarning method to capture participants stories.Four yarning groups were conducted across South Australia in Coober Pedy, Yalata, Port Lincoln and metropolitan Adelaide. In total, 46 Aboriginal men contributed their experiences and stories of their roles and responsibilities as parents to this study. Men described being a dad as a privilege, emotionally fulfilling and rewarding and although at times it can be challenging, neglecting their roles and responsibilities are not considered options. Lack of employment and therefore financial security were described as a challenge to fatherhood especially for fathers who live in remote communities. Aboriginal culture, connection to country and family were identified as critical elements and strengths for Aboriginal male parents. Furthermore, Aboriginal male parents are yearning for opportunities to participate in parenting programs including men's parenting groups.Consideration of and concern for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men's involvement and experiences prior to conception, prenatal and postpartum has slowly gained momentum in recent years, yet there has been little improvement in the overall provision of appropriate parenting support services and/or programs for these men."
https://openalex.org/W2989863004,"The purpose of the study was to examine the role of objective and subjective measures of neighborhood crime and disorder on substance use among a nationally representative sample of 4525 Jamaicans aged 12–65 years. Log-Poisson models with generalized estimating equations were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A test of interaction was used to determine presence of effect modification by sex. Approximately 39% of the study population reported past-month alcohol use; 10% past-month tobacco use; and 15% past-month marijuana use. In fully adjusted models, past-month alcohol and tobacco use were associated with perceived neighborhood disorder (p<0.05). The likelihood of alcohol use was 1.12 (95%CI:1.04, 1.20) times greater among participants who perceived higher neighborhood disorder. The likelihood of tobacco use was 1.22 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.46) times greater among participants who perceived higher neighborhood disorder. A significant test for interaction in adjusted models (P<0.2) suggested that the associations between substance use and perceived neighborhood disorder varied by sex. Examination of stratified models indicated that the role of perceived neighborhood disorder on alcohol and tobacco consumption varied among females, but not males. Females who perceived higher levels of neighborhood disorder had an increased likelihood of past-month alcohol and tobacco use (RRa:1.25 95%CI:1,07, 1.45; RRa:1.73 95%CI: 1.10, 2.67). Objective neighborhood crime measures were not associated with alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use. The study findings provide evidence for the importance of considering subjective and objective neighborhood measures when examining relations with health outcome and demonstrate that perceptions of context and contextual exposures are not uniform across populations within neighborhoods. Interventions focused on building community trust and social cohesion (e.g. neighborhood community watch groups) and greening of blighted or abandoned spaces may help increase the sense of safety and order, reducing stress and maladaptive coping such as substance use."
https://openalex.org/W2990036290,"Many studies show that keeping cats and dogs has a positive impact on humans’ physical and mental health and quality of life. The existence of this “pet phenomenon” is now widely discussed because other studies performed recently have demonstrated a negative impact of owning pets or no impact at all. The main problem of many studies was the autoselection–participants were informed about the aims of the study during recruitment and later likely described their health and wellbeing according to their personal beliefs and wishes, not according to their real status. To avoid this source of bias, we did not mention pets during participant recruitment and hid the pet-related questions among many hundreds of questions in an 80-minute Internet questionnaire. Results of our explorative study performed on a sample of 10,858 subjects showed that liking dogs has a weak positive association with quality of life. However, keeping pets, especially cats, and even more being injured by pets, were strongly negatively associated with many facets of quality of life. Our data also confirmed that infection by the cat parasite Toxoplasma had a very strong negative effect on quality of life, especially on mental health. However, the infection was not responsible for the observed negative effects of keeping pets, as these effects were much stronger in 1,527 Toxoplasma-free subjects than in the whole population. Any cross-sectional study cannot discriminate between a cause and an effect. However, because of the large and still growing popularity of keeping pets, the existence and nature of the reverse pet phenomenon deserve the outmost attention."
https://openalex.org/W2990579835,"Research question From gridlock in lawmaking to shortened holiday family dinners, partisan polarization pervades social and political life in the United States. We study the degree to which the dynamics of partisan polarization can be observed in patterns of county-to-county migration in the U.S. Specifically, we ask whether migration follows patterns that would lead individuals to homogeneous or heterogeneous partisan exposure, using annual county-to-county migration networks from 2002 to 2015. Adjusting for a host of factors, including geographic distance, population, and economic variables, we test the degree to which migration flows connect counties with similar political preferences. Findings Our central finding is that over the period studied, county-to-county migration flows connect counties with similar partisan voting profiles. Moreover, partisan sorting is most pronounced among the most politically extreme counties. The implication of this finding in the context of partisanship is that U.S. migration patterns reinforce partisan sorting, limiting the degree to which individuals will experience cross-the-aisle local social contacts through spatial interaction. This finding builds on existing research that has documented (1) that individuals prefer to move to and live in locations inhabited by co-partisans, and (2) that local geographic areas have become more polarized in recent decades. Our results indicate that large scale patterns of polarized migration flows serve as a potential mechanism that contributes to geographic partisan polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2990854514,"Background Firearm-related death rates and years of potential life lost (YPLL) vary widely between population subgroups and states. However, changes or inflections in temporal trends within subgroups and states are not fully documented. We assessed temporal patterns and inflections in the rates of firearm deaths and %YPLL due to firearms for overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, intent, and states in the United States between 1999 and 2016. Methods We extracted age-adjusted firearm mortality and YPLL rates per 100,000, and %YPLL from 1999 to 2016 by using the WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. We used Joinpoint Regression to assess temporal trends, the inflection points, and annual percentage change (APC) from 1999 to 2016. Results National firearm mortality rates were 10.3 and 11.8 per 100,000 in 1999 and 2016, with two distinct segments; a plateau until 2014 followed by an increase of APC = 7.2% (95% CI 3.1, 11.4). YPLL rates were from 304.7 and 338.2 in 1999 and 2016 with a steady APC increase in %YPLL of 0.65% (95% CI 0.43, 0.87) from 1999 to an inflection point in 2014, followed by a larger APC in %YPLL of 5.1% (95% CI 0.1, 10.4). The upward trend in firearm mortality and YPLL rates starting in 2014 was observed in subgroups of male, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanic whites and for firearm assaults. The inflection points for firearm mortality and YPLL rates also varied across states. Conclusions Within the United States, firearm mortality rates and YPLL remained constant between 1999 and 2014 and has been increasing subsequently. There was, however, an increase in firearm mortality rates in several subgroups and individual states earlier than 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2990945627,"In this study, two anoxic-oxic membrane bioreactor (A/O-MBR) systems, i.e. conventional and biofilm anoxic-oxic-membrane bioreactors (C-A/O-MBR and BF-A/O-MBR, respectively), were operated in parallel under conditions of complete sludge retention for the purposes of comparing system performance and microbial community composition. Moreover, with the microbial communities, comparisons were made between the adhesive stage and the suspended stage. High average removal of COD, NH4+-N and TN was achieved in both systems. However, TP removal efficiency was remarkably higher in BF-A/O-MBR when compared with C-A/O-MBR. TP mass balance analysis suggested that under complete sludge retention, polyurethane sponges that were added into the anoxic tank played a key role in both phosphorus release and accumulation. The qPCR analysis showed that sponge biomass could maintain a higher level of abundance of total bacteria than the suspended sludge. Meanwhile, AOB and denitrifiers were enriched in the suspended sludge but not in the sponge biomass. Results of illumina sequencing reveal that the compacted sponge in BF-A/O-MBR could promote the growth of bacteria involved in nutrient removal and reduce the amount of filamentous and bacterial growth that is related to membrane fouling in the suspended sludge."
https://openalex.org/W2991380622,"Low oxygen delivery during cardiopulmonary bypass is related to a range of adverse outcomes. Previous research specified certain critical oxygen delivery levels associated with acute kidney injury. However, a single universal critical oxygen delivery value is not sensible, as oxygen consumption has to be considered when determining critical delivery values. This study examined the associations between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption and between oxygen delivery and kidney function in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.Oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and kidney function decrease were retrospectively studied in 65 adult patients.Mean oxygen consumption was 56 ± 8 ml/min/m2, mean oxygen delivery was 281 ± 39 ml/min/m2. Twenty-seven patients (42%) had an oxygen delivery lower than the previously mentioned critical value of 272 ml/min/m2. None of the patients developed acute kidney injury according to RIFLE criteria. However, in 10 patients (15%) a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate of more than 10% was noted, which was not associated with oxygen delivery lower than 272 ml/min/m2. Eighteen patients had a strong correlation (r >0.500) between DO2 and VO2, but this was not related to low oxygen delivery. Central venous oxygen saturation (77 ± 3%), oxygen extraction ratio (21 ± 3%) and blood lactate levels at the end of surgery (1.2 ± 0.3 mmol/l) showed not to be indicative of insufficient oxygen delivery either.This study could not confirm an evident correlation between O2 delivery and O2 consumption or kidney function decrease, even at values below previously specified critical levels. The variability in O2 consumption however, is an indication that every patient has individual O2 needs, advocating for an individualized O2 delivery goal."
https://openalex.org/W2991507991,"In veterinary medicine, abdominal ultrasonography is used to rank the differential diagnosis of renal lesions. However, a conventional sonographic examination may show nonspecific findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the computed tomography (CT) findings of canine renal tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lymphoma, and hemangiosarcoma (HSA). In this retrospective study, the following CT parameters were recorded for each dog: 1) extent of renal involvement of tumors, 2) enhancement pattern, 3) number of renal tumors, 4) renal tumor vessel enhancement in the corticomedullary phase, 5) presence of lymphadenopathy and lung metastasis, and 6) attenuation values of the renal tumors on the pre- and post-contrast corticomedullary, nephrographic, and excretory phase images. Fifteen dogs met the inclusion criteria, of which nine had RCCs, four had lymphomas, and two had HSAs. RCCs tended to show heterogeneous enhancement and unilateral renal involvement, and vessel enhancement was detected in the corticomedullary phase in dogs with RCC. Conversely, renal lymphomas showed homogeneous enhancement, bilateral renal involvement, and multiple masses; in these dogs, no vessel enhancement was detected in the corticomedullary phase, and the incidence of lymphadenopathy was low. However, in dogs with lymphadenopathy, the renal lymphoma was associated with regionally severe lymphadenopathy. Finally, renal HSAs tended to show heterogeneous enhancement with a non-enhanced area and unilateral renal involvement; in these dogs, vessel enhancement was detected in the nephrographic phase, with the enhancement expanding around the vessel. These findings had no significant differences. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to examine the association between CT and histopathological findings."
https://openalex.org/W2990444076,"Objectives This study sought to investigate the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO). Background PCI of a CTO is associated with improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction and possibly associated with reduced mortality. However, benefits of CTO-PCI must be weighed against a higher risk of procedure-related complications. The incidence of new-onset ventricular tachycardia after a successful CTO-PCI has not been investigated so far. In this retrospective registry we seek to describe characteristics and predictors of occurrence of post-procedural ventricular tachycardias. Methods and results Between 2010 and 2015, 485 patients underwent successful CTO-PCI at Heart Center Leipzig. Of them, 342 had complete follow-up and were further analyzed. Ventricular tachycardias were detected in 9 (2.6%) patients. All of them were monomorphic ventricular tachycardias occurring in median 1 day (interquartile range [IQR] 0.25–4.75 days) after PCI and caused prolongation of the hospital stay. Patients with ventricular tachycardia were older, had worse left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 33.1%, SD 5.9%) and more frequently a CTO of an infarct-related artery. The target vessel was not associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. In multivariable analysis, only impaired left ventricular systolic function was an independent predictor for procedure-related ventricular tachycardia. Mortality rates were not different between patients with or without ventricular tachycardia. Conclusion Ventricular tachycardia can occur early after CTO-PCI as possible reperfusion arrhythmia and poorer left ventricular ejection fraction is the only independent predictor for onset. Although the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia after CTO-PCI seems not to influence mortality, awareness of this possible complication and longer monitoring may be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2991207910,"Objectives It is still not clear why impaction of third molars occurs. Craniofacial morphology and facial parameters have been discussed to be strong predictors for third molar impaction. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of craniofacial morphology on erupted or impacted third molars in a German population sample. Materials and methods Erupted and impacted third molars in 2,484 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania were assessed by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Markers of facial morphology were determined in 619 individuals of those participants in whose 421 participants (16.7%) had at least one impacted third molar. Craniofacial morphology was estimated as linear measurements and was associated in a cross-sectional study design with impacted and erupted third molars by multinomial logistic regression models. Erupted third molars were used as reference outcome category and regression models were adjusted for age and sex. Results Maximum Cranial Width (Eurion-Eurion distance) was significantly associated with impacted third molars (RR: 1.079; 95% confidence interval 1.028–1.132). This association was even more pronounced in the mandible. Individuals with a lower total anterior facial height (Nasion-Menton distance) and a lower facial index also have an increased risk for impacted third molars in the mandible (RR 0.953; 95% confidence interval 0.913–0.996 and RR: 0.943; 95% confidence interval 0.894–0.995). No significant associations of third molar status with facial width (Zygion-Zygion distance), and sagittal cranial dimension (Nasion-Sella distance; Sella-Basion distance) were observed. Conclusion Individuals with an increased maximal cranial width have a higher risk for impaction of third molars in the mandible and in the maxilla. Individuals with a lower anterior total anterior facial height and lower facial index also have an increased risk for third molars impaction in the mandible. These findings could help orthodontic dentists, oral surgeons and oral and maxillofacial surgeons in decision-making for third molars removal in their treatment. These findings highlight the necessity of an additional analysis of the maximal cranial width by the Eurion- Eurion distance."
https://openalex.org/W2989884483,"Documenting effects of climate change is an important step towards designing mitigation and adaptation responses. Impacts of climate change on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems have been well-documented in the Northern Hemisphere, but long-term data to detect change in the Southern Hemisphere are limited, and some types of change are generally difficult to measure. Here we present a novel approach using local ecological knowledge to facilitate a continent-scale view of climate change impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems that people have perceived in Australia. We sought local knowledge using a national web-based survey, targeting respondents with close links to the environment (e.g. farmers, ecologists), and using a custom-built mapping tool to ask respondents to describe and attribute recent changes they had observed within an area they knew well. Results drawn from 326 respondents showed that people are already perceiving simple and complex climate change impacts on hundreds of species and ecosystems across Australia, significantly extending the detail previously reported for the continent. While most perceived trends and attributions remain unsubstantiated, >35 reported anecdotes concurred with examples in the literature, and >20 were reported more than once. More generally, anecdotes were compatible with expectations from global climate change impact frameworks, including examples across the spectrum from organisms (e.g. increased mortality in >75 species), populations (e.g. changes in recruitment or abundance in >100 species, phenological change in >50 species), and species (e.g. >80 species newly arriving or disappearing), to communities and landscapes (e.g. >50 examples of altered ecological interactions). The overarching pattern indicated by the anecdotes suggests that people are more often noticing climate change losers (typically native species) than winners in their local areas, but with observations of potential ‘adaptation in action’ via compositional and phenological change and through arrivals and range shifts (particularly for native birds and exotic plants). A high proportion of climate change-related anecdotes also involved cumulative or interactive effects of land use. We conclude that targeted elicitation of local ecological knowledge about climate change impacts can provide a valuable complement to data-derived knowledge, substantially extending the volume of explicit examples and offering a foundation for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2989962255,"Signal Detection Theory is the standard method used in psychophysics to estimate person ability in m-alternative forced choice tasks where stimuli are typically generated with known physical properties (e.g., size, frequency, contrast, etc …) and lie at known locations on a physical measurement axis. In contrast, variants of Item Response Theory are preferred in fields such as medical research and educational testing where the axis locations of items on questionnaires or multiple choice tests are not defined by any observable physical property and are instead defined by a latent (or unobservable) variable. We provide an extension of Signal Detection Theory to latent variables that employs the same strategy used in Item Response Theory and demonstrate the practical utility of our method by applying it to a set of clinically relevant face perception tasks with visually impaired individuals as subjects. A key advantage of our approach is that Signal Detection Theory explicitly models the m-alternative forced choice task while Item Response Theory does not. We show that Item Response Theory is inconsistent with key assumptions of the m-alternative forced choice task and is not a valid model for this paradigm. However, the simplest Item Response Theory model–the dichotomous Rasch model–is found to be a special case of SDT and provides a good approximation as long as the number of response alternatives m is small and remains fixed for all items."

Given their well-known multifunctional role in forest ecosystems, ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM) may also contribute to urban tree health and thus ecosystem service provisioning. Yet, no studies so far have directly related in situ EcM community composition to urban tree health indicators. Here, two previously collected datasets were combined: i) tree health data of 175 Tilia tomentosa trees from three European cities (Leuven, Strasbourg and Porto) estimated using a range of reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence and physical leaf indicators, and ii) ectomycorrhizal diversity of these trees as characterized by next-generation sequencing. Tree health indicators were related to soil characteristics and EcM diversity using canonical redundancy analysis. Soil organic matter significantly explained variation in tree health indicators whereas no significant relation between mycorrhizal diversity variables and the tree health indicators was found. We conclude that mainly soil organic matter, through promoting soil aggregate formation and porosity, and thus indirectly tree water availability, positively affects the health of trees in urban areas. Our results suggest that urban planners should not overlook the importance of soil quality and its water holding capacity for the health of urban trees and potentially also for the ecosystem services they deliver. Further research should also study other soil microbiota which may independently, or in interaction with ectomycorrhiza, mediate tree performance in urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W2991491852,"Schools and organized sports both offer great chances to promote physical activity among children. Full-day schools particularly allow for extensive participation in extra-curricular physical activities. However, due to time reasons, full-day schools may also prevent children from engagement in organized sports outside school. There is only little national and international research addressing the possible competition of full-day schools and providers of organized sports outside school and the potential effects on children's physical activity behavior. In Germany's educational system, a transformation towards more full-day schools is currently taking place. The existence of both, half-day and full-day schools, gave occasion to the following research question: Do students attending half-day and full-day school differ with respect to a) sports club membership rate and b) weekly amount of sports club training?Data were collected in eleven German primary schools. Selected schools offered both half-day and full-day (minimum three days/week with at least seven hours) care. 372 students' data (grades 1-4; N = 153 half-day, N = 219 full-day; 47.4% male, 8.8±1.2y) were eligible for analyses. We assessed sports club membership and weekly training duration via questionnaire. Statistical analyses included Chi-square and Mann-Whitney-U-Tests.83% of half-day school students and 67% of full-day school students were sports club members (χ2(1) = 12.31, p<.001). Weekly duration of training in sports clubs among sports club members (N = 266) also differed between the groups (mdn = 150 min in half-day, mdn = 120 min in full-day school students; z = -2.37, p = .018). Additional analyses stratified for age and gender showed similar results.Primary school students attending full-day schools engage less in organized sports outside school than half-day school students, regardless of age and gender. Future studies should examine if the detected lower engagement in sports club physical activity is compensated by physical activities in other settings such as school or non-organized leisure time."
https://openalex.org/W2990174851,"Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affecting around 8 million people worldwide. After host cell invasion, the infective trypomastigote form remains 2–4 hours inside acidic phagolysosomes to differentiate into replicative amastigote form. In vitro acidic-pH-induced axenic amastigogenesis was used here to study this step of the parasite life cycle. After three hours of trypomastigote incubation in amastigogenesis promoting acidic medium (pH 5.0) or control physiological pH (7.4) medium samples were subjected to three rounds of centrifugation followed by ultrafiltration of the supernatants. The resulting exoproteome samples were trypsin digested and analysed by nano flow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Computational protein identification searches yielded 271 and 483 protein groups in the exoproteome at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0, respectively, with 180 common proteins between both conditions. The total amount and diversity of proteins released by parasites almost doubled upon acidic incubation compared to control. Overall, 76.5% of proteins were predicted to be secreted by classical or non-classical pathways and 35.1% of these proteins have predicted transmembrane domains. Classical secretory pathway analysis showed an increased number of mucins and mucin-associated surface proteins after acidic incubation. However, the number of released trans-sialidases and surface GP63 peptidases was higher at pH 7.4. Trans-sialidases and mucins are anchored to the membrane and exhibit an enzyme-substrate relationship. In general, mucins are glycoproteins with immunomodulatory functions in Chagas disease, present mainly in the epimastigote and trypomastigote surfaces and could be enzymatically cleaved and released in the phagolysosome during amastigogenesis. Moreover, evidence for flagella discard during amastigogenesis are addressed. This study provides the first comparative analysis of the exoproteome during amastigogenesis, and the presented data evidence the dynamism of its profile in response to acidic pH-induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2989692738,"Telomeric repeat-containing RNAs (TERRAs) are long noncoding RNAs transcribed from subtelomeres toward telomeric repeat tracts, which have been implicated in telomere protection and heterochromatin formation. Genotoxic stress leads to upregulation of TERRAs. However, the mechanism of DNA damage-mediated TERRA induction remains elusive. Here, we treated HeLa cells with etoposide, a DNA double-strand break-generating agent, for various times and monitored the levels of TERRAs. Etoposide treatment led to a gradual time-dependent increase in TERRAs. Etoposide-mediated induction was evident in many TERRAs arising from various chromosome loci, including 20q and XpYp. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed no significant changes in the occupancy of RNA polymerase II at telomeres upon etoposide treatment. Interestingly, TERRAs arising from 20q, XpYp, 10q, and 13q degraded at slower rates in cells treated with etoposide, while degradation rates of TERRAs from many loci tested were nearly identical in both etoposide- and mock-treated cells. Telomere damage occurred from early time points of etoposide treatment, but telomere lengths and abundance of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) at telomeres remained unchanged. In summary, etoposide treatment led to telomere damage and TERRA accumulation, but telomere lengths and TRF2-mediated telomere integrity were maintained. Etoposide-mediated TERRA accumulation could be attributed partly to RNA stabilization. These findings may provide insight into the post-transcriptional regulation of TERRAs in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2989741203,"Background One of the most common reasons for poor medication adherence and associated treatment failure of triple therapy is adverse drug effect (ADEs) of medications. Objective Assessment of ADEs and associated factors during H. pylori eradication therapy. Method Consented H. pylori positive adult outpatients on standard triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin and clarithromycin) were involved in this facility based follow up study from May 2016 to April 2018 at Bahir Dar city in Ethiopia. Pre-developed questionnaire and formats were used to collect sociodemographic, medical information, and patient practice data before, during, and after therapy. Bivariate and backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze data. P-value < 0.05 at 95%CI was considered as significant. Result A total of 421 patients were involved in the study. Almost 80% of the patients were urban residents. Mean (±SD) age and body weight of patients were 30.63 (± 10.74) years and 56.79 (± 10.17) kg, respectively. ADE was reported from 26.1% of the patients and of all the reported ADEs, more than 85% was manifested with gastrointestinal symptoms which include gastrointestinal discomfort(39.1%), nausea (13.6%), constipation(12.7%), diarrhea(12.9%) and anorexia(10%). Determinants of self-reported ADEs among patients in the present study were body mass index above 25 (AOR: 2.55; 95%CI (1.21–5.38), p = 0.014), duration of acid-pepsin disorder more than 3weeks (AOR: 3.57; 95%CI (1.63–7.81), p = 0.001), pain feeling during long interval between meals (AOR: 2.14; 95%CI (1.19–3.84), p = 0.011), and residence in urban area (AOR: 1.95; 95% CI (1.04–3.67), p = 0.038). Conclusion Significant proportion of patients reported ADEs which commonly manifested with gastrointestinal symptoms. Consideration of patients’ body mass index, duration of the disorder, period of the day when patients feel pain, and patients’ area of residence could help to reduce ADEs experienced during H. pylori eradication therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2990829191,"I sat down at my desk to read the student evaluations for my undergraduate biology courses. “Please leave politics out of it. Not all Republicans deny science,” one student wrote. “I didn't pay to take this class to hear him bash Republicans,” wrote another. I had received similar comments in previous years, implying that my lectures about Earth's climate—and how it's changing—were unfairly infused with politics. But they still made me think. How can I teach controversial topics such as climate change at a state university in Arkansas, where denial of climate change is rampant, without sounding partisan to some students?

> “To open my students' minds to the science, I need to find common ground with them.” 

I teach climate science in my biology classes because I think it's important to lay out how the climate is changing before I talk about how those changes may impact plants and animals. Some of my students aren't science majors, so it may be the only time they hear about climate science in a university lecture.

Recognizing that science doesn't exist in a vacuum, I also try to make connections between the topics I'm teaching and the wider world. To do that, I set aside a few minutes at the beginning of lectures to talk about science in the news.

Earlier in the semester, I had started off a lecture by discussing a tweet by President Donald Trump. “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?” it read. I used it as a teachable moment to explain to the class that a cold spell doesn't mean global temperatures aren't trending upward.

Later, I brought up Trump again when he revoked California's authority to set stricter auto emissions rules. In response, a student raised a common talking point for climate change deniers. “But hasn't the climate always changed in the past?” he asked, implying that any discussion of auto emissions is moot if this is all part of a natural phenomenon. I answered his question—explaining why scientists are confident that humans have contributed to the recent warming—but I also wondered whether I'd triggered his defensiveness by bringing up politics.

A turning point came the following semester when I received a message from my dean, who regularly reads student evaluations. He had circled a comment from one of my students, writing, “Be careful here.” After thinking it through more carefully, I came to realize that in a polarized political landscape, talking about politicians and the decisions they make is counterproductive. Students may put their guard up, thinking that I'm partisan, and tune me out when I'm lecturing about other things, such as climate modeling. So, I made a conscious decision to change my approach to teaching the subject.

As part of my modified strategy, I joined a local bipartisan group that aims to bring people together by emphasizing the potential consequences, rather than causes, of climate change. The group taught me about tactful, nonconfrontational ways to discuss climate science.

Over the past year, I have experimented with my teaching methods, and I have learned that to open my students' minds to the science, I need to find common ground with them. Now, when I discuss climate science news, I focus on things that all of us care about and choose examples that illustrate how climate change might affect their lives. For instance, this summer Arkansas and neighboring states were devastated by catastrophic flooding. It was a topic that hit close to home for all of us, and it gave me the chance to tell my students that major floods are now happening more often than they did in the past.

Since I altered my teaching strategy, I've noticed a shift in my student evaluations. I still get the occasional comment that I'm a “climate doomsdayer,” but overall the evaluations have been much more positive.

As teachers, we strive to make connections with our students. I've learned that delving into the quagmire of politics hinders those connections. But when I instead highlight the ways in which climate change may affect our shared experience on this planet, it's easier to communicate and connect with all of my students, regardless of their political affiliation.

https://openalex.org/W2990210838,"One of many aspects of musical notation is that of a graphical language which strives to be totally precise, but falls short because it has been defined by historical evolution, cultural construction and de-central ramification. This article applies standard techniques for computer languages to reconstruct a precise model for the syntax and semantics of the historically grown notation systems, taking the conventional way of notating musical dynamics as a simple example. It turns out that no single such model is possible, but a multitude of incompatibles: some have fundamentally different evaluation algorithms, others only slightly different parameter settings. Musical practice is allowed to switch between these models without even noticing their existence, but science may need distinctness. This article constructs and demonstrates an extensible mathematical framework for their precise description and proposes an extensible nomenclature system as a basis for their application and discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2990264569,"Operating a body-powered prosthesis can be painful and tiring due to high cable operation forces, illustrating that low cable operation forces are a desirable design property for body-powered prostheses. However, lower operation forces might negatively affect controllability and force perception, which is plausible but not known. This study aims to quantify the accuracy of cable force perception and control for body-powered prostheses in a low cable operation force range by utilizing isometric and dynamic force reproduction experiments. Twenty-five subjects with trans-radial absence conducted two force reproduction tasks; first an isometric task of reproducing 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40 N and second a force reproduction task of 10 and 20 N, for cable excursions of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm. Task performance was quantified by the force reproduction error and the variability in the generated force. The results of the isometric experiment demonstrated that increasing force levels enlarge the force variability, but do not influence the force reproduction error for the tested force range. The second experiment showed that increased cable excursions resulted in a decreased force reproduction error, for both tested force levels, whereas the force variability remained unchanged. In conclusion, the design recommendations for voluntary closing body-powered prostheses suggested by this study are to minimize cable operation forces: this does not affect force reproduction error but does reduce force variability. Furthermore, increased cable excursions facilitate users with additional information to meet a target force more accurately."
