https://openalex.org/W2070023258,"The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein Ras functions in regulating growth and differentiation; however, little is known about the protein interactions that bring about its biological activity. Wild-type Ras or mutant forms of Ras were covalently attached to an insoluble matrix and then used to examine the interaction of signaling proteins with Ras. Forms of Ras activated either by mutation (Gly12Val) or by binding of the GTP analog, guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GMP-PNP) interacted specifically with Raf-1 whereas an effector domain mutant, Ile36Ala, failed to interact with Raf-1. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activity was only associated with activated forms of Ras. The specific interaction of activated Ras with active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) was confirmed by direct assays. Thus the forming of complexes containing MAPKK activity and Raf-1 protein are dependent upon the activity of Ras."

Measurements of biochemical and reproductive divergence for seven closely related, transisthmian pairs of snapping shrimps (Alpheus) indicate, however, that isolation was staggered rather than simultaneous. The four least divergent pairs provide the best estimate for rates of molecular divergence and speciation. Ecological, genetic, and geological data suggest that gene flow was disrupted for the remaining three pairs by environmental change several million years before the land barrier was complete."
https://openalex.org/W2026600362,"The propensity of an amino acid to form an alpha helix in a protein was determined by multiple amino substitutions at positions 44 and 131 in T4 lysozyme. These positions are solvent-exposed sites within the alpha helices that comprise, respectively, residues 39 to 50 and 126 to 134. Except for two acidic substitutions that may be involved in salt bridges, the changes in stability at the two sites agree well. The stability values also agree with those observed for corresponding amino acid substitutions in some model peptides. Thus, helix propensity values derived from model peptides can be applicable to proteins. Among the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, proline, glycine, and alanine each have a structurally unique feature that helps to explain their low or high helix propensities. For the remaining 17 amino acids, it appears that the side chain hydrophobic surface buried against the side of the helix contributes substantially to alpha helix propensity."
https://openalex.org/W2104512614,"In mammals, the hydroperoxidation of arachidonic acid by lipoxygenases leads to the formation of leukotrienes and lipoxins, compounds that mediate inflammatory responses. Lipoxygenases are dioxygenases that contain a nonheme iron and are present in many animal cells. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 is a single-chain, 839-residue protein closely related to mammalian lipoxygenases. The structure of soybean lipoxygenase-1 solved to 2.6 angstrom resolution shows that the enzyme has two domains: a 146-residue beta barrel and a 693-residue helical bundle. The iron atom is in the center of the larger domain and is coordinated by three histidines and the COO- of the carboxyl terminus. The coordination geometry is nonregular and appears to be a distorted octahedron in which two adjacent positions are not occupied by ligands. Two cavities, in the shapes of a bent cylinder and a frustum, connect the unoccupied positions to the surface of the enzyme. The iron, with two adjacent and unoccupied positions, is poised to interact with the 1,4-diene system of the substrate and with molecular oxygen during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1992933392,"Recent theoretical developments permit the prediction of 1H, 13C, 15N, and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in proteins and offer new ways of analyzing secondary and tertiary structure as well as for probing protein electrostatics. For 13C, phi, psi torsion angles dominate shielding for C alpha and C beta, but the addition of hydrogen bonding and electrostatics gives even better accord with experiment. For 15NH, side chain (chi 1) torsion angles are also important, as are nearest neighbor sequence effects, whereas for 1HN, hydrogen bonding is particularly significant. For 19F, weak or long-range electrostatic fields dominate 19F shielding nonequivalencies. The ability to predict chemical shifts in proteins from known or test structures opens new avenues to structure refinement or determination, especially for condensed systems."
https://openalex.org/W2045476844,"Pectate lyases are secreted by pathogens and initiate soft-rot diseases in plants by cleaving polygalacturonate, a major component of the plant cell wall. The three-dimensional structure of pectate lyase C from Erwinia chrysanthemi has been solved and refined to a resolution of 2.2 angstroms. The enzyme folds into a unique motif of parallel β strands coiled into a large helix. Within the core, the amino acids form linear stacks and include a novel asparagine ladder. The sequence similarities that pectate lyases share with pectin lyases, pollen and style proteins, and tubulins suggest that the parallel β helix motif may occur in a broad spectrum of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1983055162,"Elevated blood concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and its constituent, apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], constitute a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, but their physiological activities remain obscure. Lp(a) and purified apo(a) stimulated the growth of human smooth muscle cells in culture. This effect resulted from inhibition of plasminogen activation, and consequently the activation by plasmin of latent transforming growth factor-beta, which is an inhibitor of smooth muscle cell growth. Because smooth muscle proliferation is one of the hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions, these results point to a plausible mechanism for the atherogenic activity of Lp(a)."

https://openalex.org/W1665206156,"The insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is a protein that is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine by the activated insulin receptor. Syp is a recently discovered, broadly expressed phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) phosphatase that contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. We have found that insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes leads to complex formation between IRS1 and Syp. Syp was detected in immunoadsorbates of IRS1 from extracts of insulin-treated but not basal cells by both immunoblotting and Tyr(P) phosphatase activity. The association of Syp with IRS1 apparently occurs between the SH2 domains of Syp and Tyr(P)-containing sequences of IRS1, since a fusion protein containing only the SH2 domains of Syp bound the Tyr(P) form of IRS1. Unlike the receptors for epidermal and platelet-derived growth factors, which in their activated state bind to the SH2 domains of Syp and elicit phosphorylation of Syp on tyrosine in intact cells, the Tyr(P) form of the insulin receptor did not bind to the SH2 domains of Syp, and no phosphorylation of Syp on tyrosine was detected in insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In combination with other findings these results indicate that IRS1 functions as a docking protein for SH2 domain-containing proteins participating in signaling from the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2009479133,"A nonpeptidyl secretagogue for growth hormone of the structure 3-amino-3-methyl-N-(2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5 -yl) (1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl]methyl)-1H-1-benzazepin-3(R)-yl)-butanamid e (L-692,429) has been identified. L-692,429 synergizes with the natural growth hormone secretagogue growth hormone-releasing hormone and acts through an alternative signal transduction pathway. The mechanism of action of L-692,429 and studies with peptidyl and nonpeptidyl antagonists suggest that this molecule is a mimic of the growth hormone-releasing hexapeptide His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 (GHRP-6). L-692,429 is an example of a nonpeptidyl specific secretagogue for growth hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1603105681,"Visual arrestin plays an important role in regulating light responsiveness via its ability to specifically bind to the phosphorylated and light-activated form of rhodopsin. Previously, we utilized an in vitro translation system to express and characterize the full-length (404 amino acids) and two truncated forms of visual arrestin. Here we have extended these studies to include a total of 33 different truncation and deletion mutants of arrestin, ranging from 69 to 391 amino acids in length. Mutants were produced by cutting within the open reading frame of the bovine arrestin cDNA with selective restriction enzymes followed by in vitro translation of the transcribed truncated mRNAs. Mutant arrestin binding to dark, light-activated, dark phosphorylated, and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin as well as to opsin, phosphoopsin, and truncated rhodopsin was then extensively characterized. In addition, the sensitivity of arrestin/rhodopsin interactions to conditions of increasing ionic strength was measured. These studies suggest the localization of multiple functional domains within the arrestin molecule that include: 1) a phosphorylation recognition domain, which interacts with the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin, was localized predominately between residues 158-185; 2) an activation recognition domain, which interacts with those portions of the rhodopsin molecule that change conformation upon light activation, was found to consist of at least three regions within the first 191 residues of the arrestin molecule; 3) a hydrophobic interaction domain, localized between residues 191 and 365, appears to be mobilized upon binding of arrestin to activated phosphorylated rhodopsin; 4) a regulatory domain, localized in the COOH-terminal region of arrestin (residues 365-391), was found to play a role in controlling the conformational change in arrestin necessary for mobilization of the hydrophobic interaction domain; and 5) The NH2 terminus of arrestin (residues 2-16) was found to be important for interacting with the regulatory COOH-terminal region as well as maintaining the conformation of the NH2-terminal half of arrestin. A mechanism which ensures strict arrestin binding selectivity toward phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1518308338,"A reaction between enzyme renin and its only natural substrate angiotensinogen is the initial and rate-limiting step for producing a potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II as the final product of the renin-angiotensin system, a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In order to assess the role of the interaction of human renin with human angiotensinogen in the development of high blood pressure, we have constructed the chimeric renin-angiotensin cascade in mice comprising both human renin and human angiotensinogen as well as the endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor by cross-mating separate lines of transgenic mice carrying either the human renin or human angiotensinogen genes. Although each single gene carrier did not develop hypertension despite the observed normal tissue-specific expression of the transgenes, dual gene strains exhibited a chronically sustained increase in blood pressure. Administration of a human renin-specific inhibitor (ES-8891) was effective in reducing the elevated blood pressure only against the cross-mated hybrid mice, but treatment of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) and a selective antagonist (DuP 753) directed at the angiotensin II receptor decreased the basal level of blood pressure even in single gene carriers as well as in dual gene mice. These results clearly demonstrated that the sustained increase in blood pressure of the hybrid mice was initiated by the interaction between the products of the two human genes."
https://openalex.org/W2093558340,"Biological variability of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is involved in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 variants emerge in 50 percent of infected individuals during infection, preceding accelerated CD4+ T cell loss and rapid progression to AIDS. The V1 to V2 and V3 region of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 contained the major determinants of SI capacity. The configuration of a hypervariable locus in the V2 domain appeared to be predictive for non-SI to SI phenotype conversion. Early prediction of HIV-1 phenotype evolution may be useful for clinical monitoring and treatment of asymptomatic infection."
https://openalex.org/W2021729201,"The concept of sequencing by hybridization (SBH) makes use of an array of all possible n-nucleotide oligomers (n-mers) to identify n-mers present in an unknown DNA sequence. Computational approaches can then be used to assemble the complete sequence. As a validation of this concept, the sequences of three DNA fragments, 343 base pairs in length, were determined with octamer oligonucleotides. Possible applications of SBH include physical mapping (ordering) of overlapping DNA clones, sequence checking, DNA fingerprinting comparisons of normal and disease-causing genes, and the identification of DNA fragments with particular sequence motifs in complementary DNA and genomic libraries. The SBH techniques may accelerate the mapping and sequencing phases of the human genome project."
https://openalex.org/W2072556211,Complexes of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with DNA containing the lambda PL promoter have been deposited on mica and imaged in air with a scanning force microscope. The topographic images reveal the gross spatial relations of the polymerase relative to the DNA template. The DNA appears bent in open promoter complexes containing RNA polymerase bound to the promoter and appears more severely bent in elongation complexes in which RNA polymerase has synthesized a 15-nucleotide transcript. This difference could be related to the conformational changes that accompany the maturation of open promoter complexes into elongation complexes and suggests that formation of the elongation complex involves a considerable modification of the spatial relations between the polymerase and the DNA template.
https://openalex.org/W1558785883,"Serine/threonine protein kinases are important regulators of diverse cellular processes including metabolism, proliferation, and differentiation. We have previously identified the cDNA for a 49-kDa serine/threonine kinase, designated sgk, which is transcriptionally responsive to glucocorticoid hormones and serum in epithelial cells. We report here that sgk expression is also rapidly induced by dexamethasone or serum in Rat2 fibroblasts. Nuclear run-on and Northern blot analysis revealed that the induction of sgk mRNA is an immediate-early transcriptional response to serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts, which occurs just after the peak in c-jun transcription. In contrast to the glucocorticoid-stimulated sgk expression in Rat2 fibroblasts, the transcriptional induction of sgk by serum was transient and sgk transcripts decayed with a particularly rapid half-life of 20 min. The rapid turnover of sgk, in combination with its immediate-early transcriptional response to serum, suggests a novel mechanism for responding to mitogenic signals during G0 to S transition and entry into the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2051380872,"Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase I, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), is subject to feedback inhibition by BH4, a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. Inhibition was found to depend specifically on BH4 and the presence of another protein (p35). The inhibition occurred through BH4-dependent complex formation between p35 protein and GTP cyclohydrolase I. Furthermore, the inhibition was specifically reversed by phenylalanine, and, in conjunction with p35, phenylalanine reduced the cooperativity of GTP cyclohydrolase I. These findings also provide a molecular basis for high plasma BH4 concentrations observed in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1492909811,"Na+-Ca2+ exchange is the major pathway of Ca2+ efflux during excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is present in cardiac transverse tubules with an apparent high density (Frank, J.S., Mottino, G., Reid, D., Molday, R. S., and Philipson, K.D. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 117, 337-345). The mechanism for this localization is unknown but may involve interactions with the cytoskeleton. In the present study, we examined the interaction of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin. On immunoblots of isolated canine cardiac sarcolemma, an antibody raised against purified rabbit red blood cell-ankyrin (RBC-ankyrin) recognized a 220-kDa protein, which is the same size as RBC-ankyrin. Alkaline extraction of sarcolemma removed this protein. The Na+-Ca2+ exchange protein, purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells, bound 125I-labeled-RBC-ankyrin with a KD of 42 +/- 3 nm. 125I-RBC-ankyrin was co-precipitated by antibodies to the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger after preincubation with solubilized cardiac sarcolemma. Myocardial ankyrin could be localized to both surface and T-tubular sarcolemma by immunofluorescence techniques. These results demonstrate that the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger binds ankyrin with high affinity. This interaction may be important for localizing the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger to specific domains of the sarcolemma."

https://openalex.org/W2091349388,"Homologous recombination was used to introduce a nominally transforming mutation into an endogenous H-ras1 gene in Rat1 fibroblasts. Although both the mutant and the remaining normal allele were expressed equally, the heterozygous cells were not neoplastically transformed. Instead, spontaneously transformed cells arose from the heterozygotes at a low frequency, and the majority of these cells had amplified the mutant allele. Thus, the activated H-ras1 allele was not by itself dominant over the normal allele but predisposed cells to transformation by independent events, such as amplification of the mutant allele."
https://openalex.org/W1488519169,"Cardiomyopathies are a diverse group of primary cardiac diseases, most of which have a poorly understood etiology. One type of hereditary cardiomyopathy is caused by defects in the dystrophin gene in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy patients. Our laboratory has identified a complex of dystrophin-associated proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscle which span the sarcolemma, linking the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The absence of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients leads to the loss of dystrophin-associated proteins in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, suggesting that a primary loss of one or more dystrophin-associated proteins might lead to other forms of cardiomyopathy. Here we report the specific deficiency of the 50-kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein in cardiac and skeletal muscles of the BIO 14.6 strain of cardiomyopathic hamsters, which experience both autosomal recessive cardiomyopathy and myopathy. Other dystrophin-associated proteins are well preserved in myopathic hamster skeletal muscle, but the link between dystrophin and dystroglycan is disrupted. All dystrophin-associated proteins are decreased in abundance in the cardiomyopathic hamster heart, perhaps explaining why the cardiomyopathy is more severe than the myopathy. Thus, the disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex may play a role in skeletal and cardiac myocyte necrosis of the cardiomyopathic hamster."
https://openalex.org/W2016185246,"Aminoglycoside inhibitors of translation have been shown previously to inhibit in vitro self-splicing by group I introns. Chemical probing of the phage T4-derived sunY intron shows that neomycin, streptomycin, and related antibiotics protected the N-7 position of G96, a universally conserved guanine in the binding site for the guanosine cofactor in the splicing reaction. The antibiotics also disrupted structural contacts that have been proposed to bring the 5' cleavage site of the intron into proximity to the catalytic core. In contrast, the strictly competitive inhibitors deoxyguanosine and arginine protected only the N-7 position of G96. Parallels between these results and previously observed protection of 16S ribosomal RNA by aminoglycosides raise the possibility that group I intron splicing and transfer RNA selection by ribosomes involve similar RNA structural motifs."

https://openalex.org/W1497892723,"The glucose transporter (IIBCGlc/IIAGlc complex) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system couples vectorial translocation to phosphorylation of the transported sugar. The IIAGlc subunit transfers the phosphoryl group from the phosphoryl carrier protein P-HPr to the IIBCGlc subunit. IIBCGlc translocates and phosphorylates glucose. The site of IIBCGlc phosphorylation is cysteine 421 as shown by mass spectrometric and biochemical analyses of phosphorylated peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys421 (C421S) afforded a stable but completely inactive protein (Nuoffer, C., Zanolari, B., and Erni, B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6647-6655). Cys421 is located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the IIBCGlc subunit in a sequence context (LDACITRL) which is well conserved in other transporters of the bacterial phosphotransferase system. Phosphocysteine has been shown previously to be the catalytic intermediate of the mannitol transporter (Pas, H. H., Meyer, G. H., Kruizinga, W. H., Tamminga, K. S., van Weeghel, R. P., and Robillard, G. T."

https://openalex.org/W1544282409,"Membrane-bound enzymatic systems obtained from maize embryos that catalyze the oxidative C4-monodemethylation of 4,4-dimethyl- and 4 alpha-methylsterols have been investigated. Enzymatic assay conditions have been developed for the first time to detect the C4-monodemethylated products formed. The properties of the microsomal systems have been established for co-factor requirements and kinetics. The demethylation process has been interrupted to demonstrate the formation of stable, oxygenated intermediates. In addition to the 3-keto and 3 beta-hydroxy-4-monodemethylated products formed, three new sterols have been identified. 3 beta-Hydroxy-4 beta,14 alpha-dimethyl-5 alpha-ergosta-9 beta,19-cyclo-24(24(1))-en-4 alpha-hydroxy methyl was identified for the first time as the immediate metabolite of 24-methylenecycloartanol by 4 alpha-methyl oxidase in addition to 3 beta-hydroxy-4 beta,14 alpha-dimethyl-5 alpha-ergosta-9 beta,19-cyclo- 24(24(1))-en-4 alpha-carboxylic-acid and 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-stigmasta-7,24(24(1))-dien-4 alpha-carboxylic-acid, intermediates involved respectively in the oxidative demethylation of 24-methylenecycloartanol and 24-ethylidenelophenol. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies of enzymatically produced 3 beta-hydroxy-4 beta,14 alpha-dimethyl-5 alpha-ergosta-9 beta,19-cyclo-24(24(1))en-4 alpha-carboxylic acid indicate that the 4 alpha-methyl group of 24-methylenecycloartanol is oxidized and subsequently removed during its enzymatic conversion to cycloeucalenol. From a series of incubations with 25 natural or synthetic 4,4-dimethyl and 4 alpha-methylsterols, a high degree of substrate specificity for the oxidation at C4 of 4,4-dimethyl- and 4 alpha-methylsterols was determined. Our results indicate that oxidation of the 4 alpha-methyl group of the 4,4-geminal dimethylsterols requires the more flexible and presumably bent conformation of 9 beta,19-cyclopropylsterols and the absence of a delta 24(25) unsaturation, whereas the rigid planar conformation of delta 7-unsaturated sterols favors oxidation of 4 alpha-methylsterols. Distinct strict structural requirements for the oxidation of 4,4-dimethyl- and 4 alpha-methylsterols and different sensitivity toward cyanide ions and 3 beta,5 alpha,6 alpha-stigmastatriol, a novel inhibitor of 4 alpha-methylsterol C4 oxidase activity, are consistent with the conclusion that two distinct oxidative systems are involved in the removal of the first and second C4-methyl group of phytosterol precursors. Moreover, the present study directly establishes that during the conversion of cycloartenol to phytosterol one C4 dealkylation occurs before the removal of the 14 alpha-methyl group."

https://openalex.org/W1480190526,"The molecular components of the surface of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been identified by surface-specific radioiodination. Four compartments were defined by fractionation of labeled wild type (N2 strain) adult hermaphrodites. Organic solvents extracted cuticular lipids. Homogenization in detergents released a single, non-collagenous, hydrophobic protein. This is not glycosylated and is a heterodimer of 6.5- and 12-kDa subunits. The third compartment, proteins solubilized by reducing agents, included both the cuticular collagens and the heterodimer. Residual material corresponds to the cuticlin fraction. Larval stages showed a similar pattern, except that the dauer larva had an additional 37-kDa detergent-soluble protein. Other species of rhabditid nematodes displayed similar profiles, and comparison with parasitic species suggests that this simple pattern may be primitive in the Nematoda. A C. elegans strain mutant in cuticular collagen (rol-6) had a pattern identical to that of wild type, but another morphological mutant (dpy-3) [corrected] and several mutants that differ in surface reactivity to antibody and lectins (srf mutants) also had striking differences in surface labeling patterns."

https://openalex.org/W1488055363,"We have used sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from AT-1 cardiomyocytes to examine the mechanism of phospholamban (PLB) inhibition of the Ca2+ pump of cardiac SR. By immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies, we observed that these SR vesicles contained a normal amount of the cardiac isoform of the Ca2+ pump (SERCA 2) but only a trace level of PLB. A monoclonal antibody that recognized amino acid residues 9-17 of PLB had no significant effect on Ca2+ transport by AT-1 SR vesicles, but it increased Ca2+ transport into mouse ventricular SR vesicles greater than 10-fold by reversing PLB inhibition of SERCA 2 at low ionized Ca2+ concentration. To further explore the domains of PLB responsible for SERCA 2 inhibition, we examined the effect of a PLB synthetic peptide consisting of amino acid residues 2-25 on Ca2+ uptake by AT-1 SR vesicles. Even at concentrations as high as 0.44 mM, no significant effect of the peptide was observed. Based on these results, we conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of PLB, containing the phosphorylation sites, by itself is insufficient to inhibit the Ca2+ pump and that the transmembrane region, which stabilizes the pentamer, is also essential for Ca2+ transport regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1924978730,"The transient expression of human interferon (IFN-beta) gene in response to viral induction is regulated both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The decrease in levels of IFN-beta mRNA, which requires protein synthesis, is due to transcriptional repression as well as a rapid turnover of beta mRNA. Previous studies have shown the presence of two destabilizing sequences, one in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and the other in the coding region. We have shown in this study that the coding region destabilizing element resides in the 3' end of the coding region (+538 to +637) and that the degradation does not require the translation of IFN-beta mRNA through its coding region. In addition, we have identified three domains of 19, 20, and 29 nucleotides long that specifically bind a 65-kilodalton (kDa) cytoplasmic protein. One of the binding sites is in the 3' end of the coding region and the other two in the 3' UTR. All these regions are AU-rich and show considerable homology to each other. Interestingly, the levels of the 65-kDa protein was increased after poly rI.rC induction. We suggest that this 65-kDa protein is a component of the IFN-beta mRNA destabilizing complex or plays a role in the degradation of IFN-beta mRNA."
