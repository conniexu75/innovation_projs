https://openalex.org/W2037114077,"Abstract We have used the rabbit β-globin DNA plasmid PβG1 (Maniatis et al., 1976) labeled with 32 P as a filter hybridization probe for DNA fragments containing the β-globin gene in restriction endonuclease digests of rabbit liver DNA. The β-globin DNA fragments we detect appear to contain the gene, present in PβG1 DNA, which codes for adult rabbit β-globin. These fragments have been ordered into a physical map of cleavage sites within and neighboring the structural gene in the rabbit genome (Jeffreys and Flavell, 1977). A detailed analysis of β-globin DNA fragments produced by cleavage with restriction endonucleases which are known to cut the β-globin gene has now shown that the β-globin structural gene is not contiguous in rabbit liver DNA, but is interrupted by a 600 base pair DNA segment inserted somewhere within the coding sequence for amino acid residues 101–120 of the 146 residue β-globin chain. Otherwise, the map of cleavage sites within the gene is co-linear with that deduced from the sequence of rabbit β-globin messenger RNA. Preliminary analysis indicates that this insert is also present in the β-globin gene in rabbit brain, kidney, spleen, bone marrow and sperm, and in erythroid cells isolated from the marrow of an anemic rabbit. The insert appears, therefore, to be a general property of the rabbit β-globin gene, even in tissues in which this gene is active, which suggests that the insert is not involved in inactivating the gene in nonerythroid tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2079597045,"Abstract We have studied the expression of the maternally derived X chromosome (X m ) and the paternally derived X chromosome (X p ) in female mouse conceptuses on the fourteenth day of gestation. We used an X-linked electrophoretic variant for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK-1) to estimate the relative proportions of the expression of X m and X p in the fetus and in the yolk sac. Our results support the cytological observations of Takagi and Sasaki (1976) and suggest that X m is preferentially expressed in the mouse yolk sac. Further analysis strongly suggests that the paternally derived Pgk-1 allele (and therefore probably the whole of X p ) is not expressed in the mouse yolk sac endoderm. We have demonstrated that this effect is not caused by a selection pressure exerted by the phenotype of the maternal reproductive tract against cells which express X p . We therefore, conclude that the parental origin of X m and X p marks them as different from one another. Possible causes for the failure of the expression of X p in the yolk sac endoderm and the tissue specificity of the effect are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2003850643,"Adenovirus 2 (Ad2)-infected KB cells were exposed to a 2.5 min pulse of 3H-thymidine at 19 hr after infection. The labeled DNA molecules were separated from cell DNA and mature Ad2 DNA by sucrose gradient sedimentation and CsCI equilibrium centrifugation under conditions designed to minimize branch migration and hybridization of single strands. Electron microscopy-of fractions containing radioactivity revealed two basic types of putative replicating molecules: Ad2 length duplex DNA molecules with one or more single-stranded branches (type I) and Ad2 length linear DNA molecules with a single-stranded region extending a variable distance from one end (type II). Length measurements, partial denaturation studies and 3′ terminal labeling experiments were consistent with the following model for Ad2 DNA replication. Initiation of DNA synthesis occurs at or near an end of the Ad2 duplex. Following initiation, a daughter strand is synthesized in the 5′ to 3′ direction, displacing the parental strand with the same polarity. This results in the formation of a branched replicating molecule (type I). Initiations at the right and left molecular ends are approximately equal in frequency, and multiple initiations on the same replicating molecule are common. At any given displacement fork in a type I molecule, only one of the two parental strands is replicated. Two nonexclusive mechanisms are proposed to account for the replication of the other parental strand. In some cases, before completion of a round of displacement synthesis initiated at one end of the Ad2 duplex, a second initiation will occur at the opposite end. In these doubly initiated molecules, both parental strands serve as templates for displacement synthesis. Two type II molecules are generated when the oppositely moving displacement forks meet. Alternatively, displacement synthesis may proceed to the end of the Ad2 duplex, resulting in the formation of a daughter duplex and a parental single strand. Replication of the displaced parental strand is then initiated at or near its 3′ terminus, producing a type II molecule. Daughter strand synthesis proceeds in the 5′ to 3′ direction in type II molecules generated by either mechanism, and completion of synthesis results in the formation of a daughter duplex."

https://openalex.org/W2019197460,"cdc 17-K42 was isolated as a temperature-sensitive cdc− mutant of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe after nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. The temperature-sensitive phenotype segregrates 2:2 in tetrad analyses, and it is recessive to the wild-type allele. The pattern of cell division in this mutant on temperature shift implies that its defective function is usually completed by the end of S phase. Cells of cdc 17-K42 enter S phase and undergo a complete round of DNA synthesis at the restrictive temperature, but mitosis does not follow. The nascent DNA accumulated at the restrictive temperature is exclusively composed of short (Okazaki) fragments. After a 20 min pulse label, the main peak of labeled DNA is from 70–450 nucleotides long. DNA ligase assays, involving the formation of covalently closed λ DNA circles, show that the mutant has low levels of DNA ligase activity (<20%) when assayed at the permissive temperature and none detectable when assayed at the restrictive temperature. This implies that the cdc 17 locus codes for the structural gene for DNA ligase. cdc 17-K42 also has a temperature-enhanced ultraviolet sensitivity, suggesting that the same enzyme is involved in DNA repair. Two other independent mutant alleles in the same gene have also been isolated (M75 and L16). They share many of the above properties."

https://openalex.org/W2137854193,"A fetal-to-adult switch in the proportion of the mouse minor hemoglobin is described. Although mice have no fetal hemoglobin per se, the timing of this switch in the mouse suggests that the mechanism of its control may directly parallel that of the human switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin expression. The mouse minor hemoglobin is expressed only in strains with the “diffuse” allele for the β chain complex locus. Fetal liver cells of these mice synthesize a much greater proportion of the βminor globin chain than do adult hematopoietic cells. Consequently, circulating fetal erythrocytes carry a high level of the minor hemoglobin containing it. By the time of birth, a lowered proportion of βminor is synthesized in the liver. This low proportion continues to be expressed during early erythroid maturation in the adult. The fetal-to-adult switch is the first indication that in normal mice, the two β chain loci can be expressed noncoordinately. The similarity between the patterns of the decline of the minor hemoglobin in mice and of the disappearance of fetal hemoglobin in humans suggests that the minor hemoglobin in the “diffuse” mouse may function to some degree as a fetal hemoglobin in the period between the disappearance of the embryonic hemoglobins and the time of birth."

https://openalex.org/W2002782303,"THE discovery that blood clots in the absence of its cellular components has suggested that coagulation is independent of blood cells1. This view has been modified by the demonstration of procoagulant factors in the platelets2 and anticoagulant heparin in basophils3. Procoagulant activity has also been found in extracts of leukocytes4,5, showing that coagulation is a cell-regulated phenomenon. We report here the direct observation of focal clotting induced by specifically activated monocytes."
