https://openalex.org/W2097255042,"Human breast tumours are diverse in their natural history and in their responsiveness to treatments. Variation in transcriptional programs accounts for much of the biological diversity of human cells and tumours. In each cell, signal transduction and regulatory systems transduce information from the cell's identity to its environmental status, thereby controlling the level of expression of every gene in the genome. Here we have characterized variation in gene expression patterns in a set of 65 surgical specimens of human breast tumours from 42 different individuals, using complementary DNA microarrays representing 8,102 human genes. These patterns provided a distinctive molecular portrait of each tumour. Twenty of the tumours were sampled twice, before and after a 16-week course of doxorubicin chemotherapy, and two tumours were paired with a lymph node metastasis from the same patient. Gene expression patterns in two tumour samples from the same individual were almost always more similar to each other than either was to any other sample. Sets of co-expressed genes were identified for which variation in messenger RNA levels could be related to specific features of physiological variation. The tumours could be classified into subtypes distinguished by pervasive differences in their gene expression patterns."

https://openalex.org/W1561430338,"In the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, the configuration of whiskers and sinus hairs on the snout and of receptor-dense zones on the paws is topographically represented as discrete modules of layer IV granule cells (barrels) and thalamocortical afferent terminals. The role of neural activity, particularly activity mediated by NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors), in patterning of the somatosensory cortex has been a subject of debate. We have generated mice in which deletion of the NMDAR1 (NR1) gene is restricted to excitatory cortical neurons, and here we show that sensory periphery-related patterns develop normally in the brainstem and thalamic somatosensory relay stations of these mice. In the somatosensory cortex, thalamocortical afferents corresponding to large whiskers form patterns and display critical period plasticity, but their patterning is not as distinct as that seen in the cortex of normal mice. Other thalamocortical patterns corresponding to sinus hairs and digits are mostly absent. The cellular aggregates known as barrels and barrel boundaries do not develop even at sites where thalamocortical afferents cluster. Our findings indicate that cortical NMDARs are essential for the aggregation of layer IV cells into barrels and for development of the full complement of thalamocortical patterns."

https://openalex.org/W1589948634,"Vaccines against a variety of infectious diseases represent one of the great triumphs of medicine. The immune correlates of protection induced by most current vaccines seem to be mediated by long-lived humoral immune responses. By contrast, there are no currently available vaccines that are uniformly effective for diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, in which the cellular immune response might be crucial in mediating protection. Here we examine the mechanisms by which long-lived cellular immune responses are generated and maintained in vivo. We then discuss current approaches for vaccination against diseases in which cellular immune responses are important for protection."

https://openalex.org/W1554632349,"The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) regulates genes important for tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. Normally, NF-kappaB remains sequestered in an inactive state by cytoplasmic inhibitor-of-kappaB (IkappaB) proteins. NF-kappaB translocates to nucleus and activates gene expression upon exposure of cells to growth factors and cytokines. We and others have shown previously that NF-kappaB is constitutively active in a subset of breast cancers. In this study, we show that constitutive activation of NF-kappaB leads to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic genes c-inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (c-IAP2) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, expression of the anti-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 1 (TRAF1) and defender-against cell death (DAD-1) is regulated by NF-kappaB in certain breast cancer cells. We also demonstrate that NF-kappaB-inducible genes protect cancer cells against paclitaxel as MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells modified to overexpress IkappaBalpha required lower concentrations of paclitaxel to arrest at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and undergo apoptosis when compared to parental cells. The effect of NF-kappaB on paclitaxel-sensitivity appears to be specific to cancer cells because normal fibroblasts derived from embryos lacking p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and wild type littermate embryos were insensitive to paclitaxel-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Parthenolide, an active ingredient of herbal remedies such as feverfew (tanacetum parthenium), mimicked the effects of IkappaBalpha by inhibiting NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and Mn-SOD expression, and increasing paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that active ingredients of herbs with anti-inflammatory properties may be useful in increasing the sensitivity of cancers with constitutively active NF-kappaB to chemotherapeutic drugs.

https://openalex.org/W1970392870,"A number of molecular therapeutic agents, derived from exploiting our knowledge of the oncogenic pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer, are now entering clinical trials. One of these is the novel agent 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin that acts to inhibit the hsp90 molecular chaperone. Treatment of four human colon cancer cell lines with iso-effective concentrations of this agent resulted in depletion of c-raf-1 and akt and inhibition of signal transduction. We have used gene expression array analysis to identify genes responsive to treatment with this drug. The expression of hsp90 client protein genes was not affected, but hsc hsp70, hsp90beta, keratin 8, keratin 18 and caveolin-1 were deregulated following treatment. These observations were consistent with inhibition of signal transduction and suggested a possible mechanism of resistance or recovery from 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin treatment. The results shed light on the molecular mode of action of the hsp90 inhibitors, and suggest possible molecular markers of drug action for use in hypothesis testing clinical trials.

Consider two ways to deploy attention: it can be commanded from place to place by a deliberate act of will, or it can run freely without specific instruction. Here we use a visual search task to show that deliberate movement of attention is significantly slower because of an internal limit on the speed of volitional commands."

The physiological function of CIRLs is unknown because neither extracellular ligands nor intracellular coupling proteins (G-proteins) have been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a novel interaction between the C termini of CIRL1 and -2 and the PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain of a recently discovered multidomain protein family (ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank) present in human and rat brain. In vitro, CIRL1 and CIRL2 interacted strongly with the PDZ domain of ProSAP1. The specificity of this interaction has been verified by in vivo experiments using solubilized rat brain membrane fractions and ProSAP1 antibodies; only CIRL1, but not CIRL2, was co-immunoprecipitated with ProSAP1. In situhybridization revealed that ProSAP1 and CIRL1 are co-expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Colocalization was also observed at the subcellular level, as both CIRL1 and ProSAP1 are enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain. Expression of all three CIRL isoforms is highly regulated during postnatal brain development, with CIRL3 exhibiting its highest expression levels immediately after birth, followed by CIRL2 and finally CIRL1 in aged rats.

A protein module frequently involved in this type of interaction is the PDZ1 domain, which can specifically contact the intracellular C terminus of distinct membrane proteins (e.g. Ref. 1Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that this type of interaction serves a function in anchoring receptors to the cytoskeleton, thus leading to the targeting of receptors to their presumed site of action, e.g. in the postsynaptic specializations of neurons. In addition, the interaction with PDZ domains may be important for the recruitment of receptors to specific signal transduction pathways, as exemplified by the interaction of β-adrenergic receptors with the Na+-/H+-exchanger regulatory protein (11Hall R.A.

A characteristic feature of this new family is the very large N-terminal, extracellular part, which may contain several domains usually found in cell adhesion molecules. A prototype of this group of receptors is the calcium-independent receptor for α-latrotoxin (CIRL). Together with neurexin 1a, CIRL is present on axon terminals, where it is thought to tether the toxin from black widow spider venom to presynaptic structures; this facilitates insertion of α-latrotoxin into the plasma membrane which then leads to massive exocytosis of neurotransmitter (12Hlubek M.D. Stuenkel E.L.

However, the physiological function of CIRLs remains enigmatic, particularly because neither the physiological ligands nor intracellular signal transducing proteins are known. To shed more light on the function of CIRLs, it will be necessary to determine their cellular and subcellular distribution. In addition, the identification of intracellularly associated proteins may help to delineate the signal transduction pathway in which CIRLs are involved.Here, we show that the intracellular C terminus of CIRLs binds with high affinity to the PDZ domains of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank 2Because of the fact that the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank protein family has been discovered independently by several groups, the terminology for the three members existing thus far varies as follows: SSTRIP/Shank1/Synamon (4Zitzer H.

The data reported here suggest that members of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank protein family are also involved in the synaptic targeting of CIRLs and thus may contribute to signal transduction events mediated by the so far unknown physiological ligands of these receptors.DISCUSSIONThe data shown here provide evidence for a novel interaction between the PDZ domain of ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank proteins and the seven transmembrane-spanning, putative G-protein-coupled receptors for α-latrotoxin, CIRL1. The interaction is presumably driven by the very C terminus of the CIRL protein, which carries a typical recognition motif for the PDZ domain. Data previously obtained with the PDZ domains of ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank (4Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol.

Thus, a larger hydrophobic residue (isoleucine or leucine) in the last position of the consensus sequence is required for binding (see Fig. 1), whereas valine (which is required for the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor/PSD-95/SAP102 interactions (1Kornau H.C.

On the other hand, specificity may not exclusively be determined by the PDZ recognition motif; CIRL1–3 carry identical PDZ consensus sequences at their C termini (last five amino acid residues), and yet only CIRL1 has been found to interact specifically in vitro and in vivo with ProSAP1.An important question remains as to the actual location in neurons where CIRL1 and ProSAP1 interact. Because of the toxic principle of α-latrotoxin, which induces neurotransmitter release after binding to CIRL and neurexin (12Hlubek M.D. Stuenkel E.L. Krasnoperov V.G. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), CIRL has been assumed to be a presynaptic receptor. ProSAP1 and other members of this protein family, however, have been shown to be highly enriched in the postsynaptic density of neurons (4Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J.

The CIRL antibodies available to us were not suitable for ultrastructural analysis, 3T. M. Böckers, data not shown. which could ultimately solve this question. We show here the presence of CIRL1 in the postsynaptic membrane fraction derived from rat brain. Additionally, it appears possible that isoforms of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank family are also present in presynaptic compartments of neurons. Because of the unique extracellular domain structure of CIRL, which includes several motifs otherwise found in cell adhesion molecules, it has been suggested that CIRLs and related receptors function as such and not as G-protein-coupled receptors that bind to soluble, secreted ligands. In this respect, our data indicate that CIRLs are involved in neuronal cell adhesion events, possibly during synaptogenesis, by acting on presynaptic, axonal elements as well as the postsynaptic, dendritic structures. In agreement with a role in synaptogenesis, CIRL expression is highly regulated during development. CIRL3 expression peaks very early in development, with the highest levels observed immediately after birth. CIRL2 mRNA is also present during early postnatal development, reaching its peak expression level a few days later. During later stages, the roles of CIRL2 and -3 may be taken over by CIRL1, which shows an increase in expression concomitant with the loss of CIRL3 and especially CIRL2, which is hardly detectable in the aged rat. CIRL3 expression remains strong in the cerebellum, where it partially matches that of ProSAP1. It appears possible that an interaction occurs between these two proteins in the cerebellum, as the C-terminal sequence of CIRL3 (-HLVTSL-Stop) is similar to that of the other CIRLs. However, as no CIRL3 clone was detected in our yeast two-hybrid screen, and because no CIRL3 specific antibodies were available to us, we were unable to verify this possibility.Taken together, the presence of CIRL on pre- and postsynaptic elements of synapses, the highly regulated pattern of CIRL isoform expression, and the domain structure of its extracellular region suggest a role for CIRL proteins as cell adhesion molecules during synaptogenesis, which may be mediated in part through interactions of the C terminus with synaptic scaffolding molecules of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank multidomain protein family. Most neuronal cell surface receptors are attached to intracellular proteins via specific protein/protein interactions; this has been demonstrated in a number of cases involving ligand gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as cell adhesion molecules (e.g. Refs. 1Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 2Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A protein module frequently involved in this type of interaction is the PDZ1 domain, which can specifically contact the intracellular C terminus of distinct membrane proteins (e.g. Ref. 1Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that this type of interaction serves a function in anchoring receptors to the cytoskeleton, thus leading to the targeting of receptors to their presumed site of action, e.g. in the postsynaptic specializations of neurons. In addition, the interaction with PDZ domains may be important for the recruitment of receptors to specific signal transduction pathways, as exemplified by the interaction of β-adrenergic receptors with the Na+-/H+-exchanger regulatory protein (11Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel group of cell surface receptors has been described that resembles the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily because it shares the typical pattern of seven hydrophobic transmembrane regions. A characteristic feature of this new family is the very large N-terminal, extracellular part, which may contain several domains usually found in cell adhesion molecules. A prototype of this group of receptors is the calcium-independent receptor for α-latrotoxin (CIRL). Together with neurexin 1a, CIRL is present on axon terminals, where it is thought to tether the toxin from black widow spider venom to presynaptic structures; this facilitates insertion of α-latrotoxin into the plasma membrane which then leads to massive exocytosis of neurotransmitter (12Hlubek M.D. Stuenkel E.L.

However, the physiological function of CIRLs remains enigmatic, particularly because neither the physiological ligands nor intracellular signal transducing proteins are known. To shed more light on the function of CIRLs, it will be necessary to determine their cellular and subcellular distribution. In addition, the identification of intracellularly associated proteins may help to delineate the signal transduction pathway in which CIRLs are involved. Here, we show that the intracellular C terminus of CIRLs binds with high affinity to the PDZ domains of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank 2Because of the fact that the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank protein family has been discovered independently by several groups, the terminology for the three members existing thus far varies as follows: SSTRIP/Shank1/Synamon (4Zitzer H.

In agreement with the data obtained by Naisbitt et al. (5Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), a negative charge is not tolerated in the −2 position, as seen here for BAI-2, which interacts only with low affinity (see Table I and Fig. 1). On the other hand, specificity may not exclusively be determined by the PDZ recognition motif; CIRL1–3 carry identical PDZ consensus sequences at their C termini (last five amino acid residues), and yet only CIRL1 has been found to interact specifically in vitro and in vivo with ProSAP1. An important question remains as to the actual location in neurons where CIRL1 and ProSAP1 interact. Because of the toxic principle of α-latrotoxin, which induces neurotransmitter release after binding to CIRL and neurexin (12Hlubek M.D. Stuenkel E.L. Krasnoperov V.G. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. Mol.

ProSAP1 and other members of this protein family, however, have been shown to be highly enriched in the postsynaptic density of neurons (4Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J.

The CIRL antibodies available to us were not suitable for ultrastructural analysis, 3T. M. Böckers, data not shown. which could ultimately solve this question. We show here the presence of CIRL1 in the postsynaptic membrane fraction derived from rat brain. Additionally, it appears possible that isoforms of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank family are also present in presynaptic compartments of neurons. Because of the unique extracellular domain structure of CIRL, which includes several motifs otherwise found in cell adhesion molecules, it has been suggested that CIRLs and related receptors function as such and not as G-protein-coupled receptors that bind to soluble, secreted ligands. In this respect, our data indicate that CIRLs are involved in neuronal cell adhesion events, possibly during synaptogenesis, by acting on presynaptic, axonal elements as well as the postsynaptic, dendritic structures. In agreement with a role in synaptogenesis, CIRL expression is highly regulated during development. CIRL3 expression peaks very early in development, with the highest levels observed immediately after birth. CIRL2 mRNA is also present during early postnatal development, reaching its peak expression level a few days later. During later stages, the roles of CIRL2 and -3 may be taken over by CIRL1, which shows an increase in expression concomitant with the loss of CIRL3 and especially CIRL2, which is hardly detectable in the aged rat. CIRL3 expression remains strong in the cerebellum, where it partially matches that of ProSAP1. It appears possible that an interaction occurs between these two proteins in the cerebellum, as the C-terminal sequence of CIRL3 (-HLVTSL-Stop) is similar to that of the other CIRLs. However, as no CIRL3 clone was detected in our yeast two-hybrid screen, and because no CIRL3 specific antibodies were available to us, we were unable to verify this possibility. Taken together, the presence of CIRL on pre- and postsynaptic elements of synapses, the highly regulated pattern of CIRL isoform expression, and the domain structure of its extracellular region suggest a role for CIRL proteins as cell adhesion molecules during synaptogenesis, which may be mediated in part through interactions of the C terminus with synaptic scaffolding molecules of the ProSAP/SSTRIP/Shank multidomain protein family.

https://openalex.org/W1524136793,"Modern birds have markedly foreshortened tails and their body mass is centred anteriorly, near the wings. To provide stability during powered flight, the avian centre of mass is far from the pelvis, which poses potential balance problems for cursorial birds. To compensate, avians adapted to running maintain the femur subhorizontally, with its distal end situated anteriorly, close to the animal's centre of mass; stride generation stems largely from parasagittal rotation of the lower leg about the knee joint. In contrast, bipedal dinosaurs had a centre of mass near the hip joint and rotated the entire hindlimb during stride generation. Here we show that these contrasting styles of cursoriality are tightly linked to longer relative total hindlimb length in cursorial birds than in bipedal dinosaurs. Surprisingly, Caudipteryx, described as a theropod dinosaur, possessed an anterior centre of mass and hindlimb proportions resembling those of cursorial birds. Accordingly, Caudipteryx probably used a running mechanism more similar to that of modern cursorial birds than to that of all other bipedal dinosaurs. These observations provide valuable clues about cursoriality in Caudipteryx, but may also have implications for interpreting the locomotory status of its ancestors."

We have investigated the role of Smad4 in the TGF-beta1 cell responses of transformed PDV keratinocytes, which contain a Ras oncogene, and of non-tumorigenic MCA3D keratinocytes, by transfecting both cell lines with a dominant-negative Smad4 construct. Smad4 mediates TGF-beta1-induced up-regulation of p21Cip1 and growth arrest in MCA3D cells. However, in PDV keratinocytes, Smad4 is only partially involved in TGF-beta1-induced growth inhibition, and does not mediate enhancement of p21Cip1 levels by the growth factor. TGF-beta1 activates Ras/Erk signalling activity in both cell lines. PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, disminishes TGF-beta1-induced p21Cip1 levels in PDV but not in MCA3D cells, suggesting an involvement of Erk in up-regulation of p21Cip1 by TGF-beta1 in PDV cells. PDV dominant-negative Smad4 cell transfectants, but not MCA3D transfectants, showed constitutive hyperactivation of the Ras/Erk signalling pathway, increased secretion of urokinase, higher motility properties, and a change to a fibroblastoid cell morphology associated in vivo with the transition from a well differentiated to a poorly differentiated tumour phenotype. Infection of MCA3D control and dominant negative Smad4 cell transfectants with retroviruses carrying a Ras oncogene led to enhanced p21Cip1 and urokinase secreted levels, independently of TGF-beta1 stimulation, that were reduced by PD098059. These results suggest that Smad4 acts inhibiting Ras-dependent Erk signalling activity in Ras-transformed keratinocytes. Loss of Smad4 function in these cells results in hyperactivation of Erk signalling and progression to undifferentiated carcinomas. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4134 - 4145"

https://openalex.org/W2335120005,"Biochemical abnormalities associated with the development of multiple myeloma have been difficult to define especially in terms of demonstrating an in vivo effect of suspected lesions. Herein, we have identified such a defect associated with lack of expression of PTEN, a cellular phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIP's). In myeloma cells, PIP's are required for phosphorylation of Akt, a key event leading to inhibition of apoptosis. Loss of PTEN results in a failure to de-phosphorylate PIP's and a corresponding increase in Akt phosphorylation. OPM-2 cells lacking PTEN expression have the highest level of Akt phosphorylation of eight lines examined. Loss of PTEN was found to be associated with a 630 bp deletion corresponding to amino acids 56 - 267. Ectopic expression of wild type PTEN in OPM-2 cells inhibited Akt phosphorylation which was correlated with an increase in apoptosis. The in vivo relevance of loss of PTEN expression was demonstrated by injecting control and wild type PTEN transfected OPM-2 cells into SCID mice. Tumors arose at an incidence of 100% in controls, but only 50% (and of smaller size and longer latency) in low PTEN expressing clones. Importantly, clones expressing high levels of PTEN failed to produce tumors even at five times the latency period of controls. These results demonstrate that PTEN deletion/mutation is responsible for in vivo growth of this tumor and suggests that PTEN regulation may play an important role in tumor development in a subset of multiple myeloma patients.

In contrast to the related p16INK4a tumour suppressor, expression patterns of 19INK4d in human tissues and tumours remain unknown. As the RB pathway is commonly targeted in cancer, and mouse models suggest a role for p19INK4d in spermatogenesis, we examined the abundance and localization of p19INK4d in the human testis, both during normal development and at various stages of germ-cell tumour pathogenesis. Our data show that the p19INK4d protein is abundant in spermatocytes of normal human adult testes, whereas virtually no p19INK4d is detectable in testicular cancer, including the preinvasive carcinoma in situ stage. Together with the lack of p19INK4d in human foetal germ cells, these results support the concept of foetal origin of the testicular germ-cell tumours, and help better understand the emerging role of the RB pathway in spermatogenesis and tumorigenesis in the human testis.

The Bmx tyrosine kinase, a member of the Tec family, is expressed in hematopoietic cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages. Here we show that Bmx is catalytically activated by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors. Activation of Bmx required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) as demonstrated by the ability of PI-3K inhibitors to block the activation signal. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged Bmx was translocated to cellular membranes upon co-expression of a constitutively active form of PI-3K, further indicating a role for PI-3K in signaling upstream of Bmx. The expression of wild type Bmx in 32D myeloid progenitor cells resulted in apoptosis in the presence of G-CSF, while cells expressing a kinase dead mutant of Bmx differentiated into mature granulocytes. However, Bmx did not modulate IL-3-dependent proliferation of the cells. These results demonstrate distinct effects of Bmx in cytokine induced proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells, and suggest that the stage specific expression of Bmx is critical for the differentiation of myeloid cells.

We identified genomic DNA fragments to which mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) could be cross-linked in vivo. Purified recombinant mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) was able to bind specifically to such elements in PCR-EMSA in vitro, supporting the idea that this mut p53 protein interacts with genomic DNA in vivo. The genomic DNA fragments identified are vastly different in sequence, but display as a common feature a high likelihood to adopt a non B-DNA conformation.

We show here that the defect in activation of PI-3k/Akt by BCR/ABL DeltaSH2 mutant (SH2 domain deleted) and of STAT5 by BCR/ABL DeltaSH3+DeltaSH2 mutant (SH3 and SH2 domains deleted) is not permanent and both Akt and STAT5 could be 're-activated' by in vitro culture. This phenomenon was responsible for increased resistance to apoptosis, growth factor-independent proliferation and leukemogenesis in SCID mice. Incubation of cells with BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 abrogated the 're-activation' of Akt or STAT5 by BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 mutants in some clones, in the others Akt and STAT5 activation became independent on BCR/ABL kinase activity. The immediate upstream activators of Akt and STAT5 such as PI-3k and Jak-2 were also activated. In addition, the common beta subunit of IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated in the clones in which 're-activation' was dependent on the BCR/ABL kinase activity. These results suggested that 're-activation' of Akt and STAT5, in the absence of functional BCR/ABL SH3+SH2 domains, may be achieved by two different mechanisms: (i) BCR/ABL kinase-dependent activation of alternative pathway(s) and (ii) additional genetic changes stimulating Akt and STAT5 independently of BCR/ABL.

https://openalex.org/W2156932717,"Previous studies have examined lipoprotein metabolism by macrophages following prolonged exposure (>24 h) to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Because M-CSF activates several signaling pathways that could rapidly affect lipoprotein metabolism, we examined whether acute exposure of macrophages to M-CSF alters the metabolism of either native or modified lipoproteins. Acute incubation of cultured J774 macrophages and resident mouse peritoneal macrophages with M-CSF markedly enhanced low density lipoproteins (LDL) and β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) stimulated cholesteryl [3H]oleate deposition. In parallel, M-CSF treatment increased the association and degradation of 125I-labeled LDL or β-VLDL without altering the amount of lipoprotein bound to the cell surface. The increase in LDL and β-VLDL metabolism did not reflect a generalized effect on lipoprotein endocytosis and metabolism because M-CSF did not alter cholesterol deposition during incubation with acetylated LDL. Moreover, M-CSF did not augment β-VLDL cholesterol deposition in macrophages from LDL receptor (−/−) mice, indicating that the effect of M-CSF was mediated by the LDL receptor. Incubation of macrophages with pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi/o protein signaling, had no effect on cholesterol deposition during incubation with β-VLDL alone, but completely blocked the augmented response promoted by M-CSF. In addition, incubation of macrophages with the direct Gi/o protein activator, mastoparan, mimicked the effect of M-CSF by enhancing cholesterol deposition in cells incubated with β-VLDL, but not acetylated LDL.

Specifically, we found that M-CSF treatment enhanced the uptake of both LDL and β-VLDL, obtained from cholesterol-fed rabbits, but did not affect the uptake of AcLDL. In addition, we have shown that enhanced β-VLDL metabolism following M-CSF treatment involves activation of a Gi/o protein signaling pathway that regulates LDL receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) withl-glutamine and high glucose, DMEM with 25 mmHEPES but without sodium bicarbonate, and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant murine M-CSF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and was solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma). Pertussis toxin (Bordetella pertussis) and mastoparan were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and were both solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA. Wortmannin was purchased from Sigma and solubilized as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Na125I and [3H]oleate were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (28Havel R. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) of EDTA-anticoagulated plasma obtained from healthy normolipidemic volunteers. LDL was dialyzed against saline containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). AcLDL was prepared by chemical modification of the LDL with acetic anhydride as described by Basu et al. (29Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and confirmed by comparing the relative electrophoretic mobility of AcLDL to native LDL on an agarose gel. β-VLDL (d = 1.006–1.019 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of EDTA-anticoagulated plasma obtained from 12-h fasted male New Zealand White rabbits (Myrtles) maintained on a cholesterol-enriched diet (1% w/w cholesterol; test diet 9456, Purina, Richmond, IN). Lipoprotein preparations were sterilized by passage through 0.22-μm filters and stored at 4 °C. Lipoprotein samples were analyzed for protein content as described by Lowry (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-VLDL and LDL were radiolabeled using an indirect labeling method with Na125I using IODO-GEN® pre-coated tubes (Pierce) following manufacturer's instructions; in this method, the scavenging wash step was omitted and the radioiodination reaction was terminated by passing the sample over two desalting columns (Bio-Gel P6DG, Pierce). J774A.1 cells, a murine macrophage cell line, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in DMEM containing penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), and 10% FBS. Resident macrophages were collected from both male and female inbred C57BL/6 wild type and LDL receptor-deficient mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and male outbred Cr:NIH (S) Swiss mice (National Cancer Institute, Charles River Laboratories, Frederick, MD) by peritoneal lavage with ice-cold sterile saline. Cells were resuspended in DMEM containing antibiotics and FBS. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, non-adherent peritoneal cells were removed by gently washing cells three times with serum-free DMEM. Adherent peritoneal macrophages were then cultured in medium with FBS. The incorporation of [3H]oleic acid into cholesterol esters was used as a measure of macrophage-mediated uptake of lipoproteins. Lipoproteins were added to either J774A.1 or peritoneal macrophages and incubated for 5 h in DMEM plus antibiotics but no serum. Prior to the addition of lipoproteins, macrophages were treated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, with wortmannin (100 nm) for 45 min and with M-CSF (1–100 ng/ml) or mastoparan (10 μm) for 15 min. In addition, each well of cells received 0.9 μCi [3H]oleic acid complexed with fatty acid-free BSA in a molar ratio of 5:1. The cholesterol ester assays were analyzed as described previously (15Whitman S.C. Daugherty A. Post S.R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 807-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify lipoprotein association and degradation, J774A.1 macrophages were cultured in 12-well plates in the presence of DMEM plus antibiotics and serum. When the cells were 80% confluent, the medium was changed to 0.5 ml/well of serum-free DMEM plus antibiotics and 0.5% BSA, and the macrophages were cultured for an additional 5 h in the absence or presence of M-CSF (25 ng/ml) and 50 μg 125I-β-VLDL. Culture plates were put on ice and the incubation medium was transferred to disposable glass 12 × 75-mm tubes containing 55 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold buffer A (154 mm NaCl, 42 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm Tris, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4) and twice with BSA-free buffer A. Cellular protein was solubilized for 16 h at room temperature in 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH. Tubes containing the medium-trichloroacetic acid solution were vortexed, placed on ice for a minimum of 30 min, and subjected to centrifugation (1500 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Radioactivity in the supernatant of the media following trichloroacetic acid precipitation and in the protein extract were determined using a CliniGamma 1272 [gamma- counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland); cell protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with BSA used to generate a standard curve. The amount of associated 125I-β-VLDL and degradation products generated in the absence of cells was also measured and subtracted from the corresponding samples incubated with cells. Degraded and cell-associated 125I-β-VLDL was expressed as nanograms of 125I-β-VLDL/mg of cell protein/5 h. To quantify lipoprotein binding, J774A.1 macrophages were cultured in 12-well plates in the presence of DMEM plus antibiotics and serum. When the cells were 80% confluent, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM plus antibiotics, and the macrophages were cultured for an additional 5 h in the absence or presence of M-CSF (25 ng/ml). Prior to beginning the binding study, the cell media was replaced with ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 25 mm HEPES; pH 7.4. Following an additional 0.5 h at 4 °C, either 125I-β-VLDL (0.25–20 μg/ml) or125I-LDL (0.25–80 μg/ml) was added to the cells in the absence or presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled β-VLDL or LDL, respectively, and the cells were then incubated for an additional 2.5 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold buffer A plus 0.2% BSA and twice with BSA-free buffer A. Cellular protein was solubilized for 16 h at room temperature in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity in the protein extract was determined as stated above; cell protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The amount of specific binding was calculated by subtracting the amount of 125I-lipoprotein bound in the presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled lipoprotein from the total amount of 125I-lipoprotein bound. The results are expressed as nanograms of 125I-β-VLDL or 125I-LDL bound/mg of cell protein. Data analysis was performed using SigmaStat 2.03 software (SPSS Inc.). For each parameter, the mean and standard error of mean (S.E.) were calculated. Differences between a control and single experimental group were evaluated by ttest. In those experiments where more than one experimental group existed (Figs. 1, 7, and 8 A), differences were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance with all pairwise multiple comparison procedures conducted using the Tukey test. Values withp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Figure 7Cholesterol esterification was determined in mouse peritoneal macrophages that were untreated (openand solid bars) or treated (diagonal and hatched bars) with a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (100 nm), for 30 min and then incubated for 15 min in the absence (open and diagonal bars) or presence (solid andhatched bars) of recombinant mouse M-CSF (25 ng/ml). β-VLDL (25 μg of protein/ml) and a [3H]oleic acid-albumin complex was added and incubations continued for 5 h.

Acta. 1994; 1212: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined whether acute treatment of macrophages with M-CSF would differ from that of prolonged M-CSF exposure by having a significant affect on the metabolism of β-VLDL. Using incorporation of [3H]oleic acid into cholesterol esters as a measure of macrophage-mediated lipoprotein metabolism, we found that acute exposure of peritoneal macrophages to M-CSF (10–100 ng/ml) significantly enhanced β-VLDL-induced cholesterol ester deposition (268.2 ± 12.3versus 372.2 ± 13.7 nmol/mg of protein/5 h at 100 ng/ml of M-CSF; p < 0.001, n = 3, Fig.1). Maximal enhancement of β-VLDL metabolism by M-CSF treatment occurred at a concentration of approximately 25 ng/ml (Fig. 1). Similarly, M-CSF, in a concentration dependent manner, enhanced the metabolism of β-VLDL by the murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 (data not shown). Metabolism of β-VLDL by peritoneal and J774A.1 macrophages, in either the absence or presence of M-CSF, saturated at a concentration of 25 μg of lipoprotein/ml of medium, indicating that accumulation of this lipoprotein (± M-CSF) involved a specific receptor-mediated uptake process (Fig. 2, A andB). Similar to β-VLDL, native LDL-induced cholesterol ester deposition was significantly enhanced by acute M-CSF treatment of J774A.1 macrophages (Fig. 2 C). To examine whether cytokine treatment directly enhancing internalization and degradation of β-VLDL, association and degradation studies were conducted at 37 °C using125I-β-VLDL and J774A.1 macrophages incubated in the absence or presence of M-CSF (25 ng/ml). Compared with non-treated cells, M-CSF treatment significantly enhanced the specific degradation of β-VLDL by macrophages at 37 °C (2392.3 ± 473.2versus 3785.9 ± 358.2 ng/mg of protein/5 h; at 50 μg of protein/ml, p = 0.018, n = 5) (Fig.3 A). In parallel, cell association of 125I-β-VLDL was also enhanced by M-CSF treatment (212.5 ± 14.1 versus 296.1 ± 37.7 ng/mg of protein/5 h; at 50 μg of protein/ml, p = 0.047, n = 5) (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether the effect of M-CSF was specific for β-VLDL, mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with AcLDL to examine scavenger receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. In the absence of M-CSF, incubation of macrophages with AcLDL caused significant cholesterol ester deposition compared with control cells (245 ± 16versus 12 ± 3 nmol/mg of protein/5 h;p = 0.0001, n = 3, Fig.4). In contrast to β-VLDL, addition of M-CSF (25 ng/ml) did not alter cholesterol ester deposition during incubation with AcLDL (249 ± 6 nmol/mg of protein/5 h;p = non-significant versus incubation with AcLDL alone, n = 3, Fig. 4). This result suggests that the enhanced uptake of β-VLDL observed in the presence of M-CSF did not result from a generalized effect on lipoprotein uptake and metabolism. β-VLDL has the potential to be internalized by all members of the LDL receptor family (32Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). However, β-VLDL, either in the presence or absence of M-CSF, failed to simulate cholesterol ester deposition in peritoneal macrophages isolated from LDL receptor (−/−) mice (Fig. 5). These results indicate that M-CSF enhances β-VLDL metabolism via a process that specifically involves the LDL receptor. To examine whether M-CSF treatment enhanced the number of β-VLDL binding sites at the cell surface, binding studies were conducted at 4 °C (to prevent ligand internalization) using 125I-β-VLDL and J774A.1 macrophages incubated in the absence or presence of M-CSF (25 ng/ml). M-CSF treatment did not enhance the specific binding of β-VLDL by macrophages at 4 °C (Fig.6 A). Similarly, M-CSF treatment did not increase the binding of native 125I-LDL to its receptor at 4 °C (Fig. 6 B). In contrast to both125I-β-VLDL and 125I-LDL binding at 4 °C, M-CSF treatment of J774A.1 macrophages at 37 °C significantly enhanced the metabolism of both β-VLDL (263.4 ± 20.4versus 369.9 ± 9.3 nmol/mg of protein/5 h; at 50 μg of protein/ml, p = 0.009, n = 3) and LDL (42.9 ± 4.6 versus 65.2 ± 4.8 nmol/mg of protein/5 h; at 50 μg of protein/ml, p = 0.0057,n = 2) (Fig. 2, B and C). Binding of M-CSF to its receptor initiates a number of specific signaling cascades, including activation of PI 3-kinase, the non-receptor Src family of tyrosine kinases, and Gi/oproteins (11Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of PI 3-kinase activation in M-CSF-enhanced β-VLDL uptake, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, was added prior to the addition of β-VLDL alone or β-VLDL plus M-CSF. Wortmannin irreversibly inhibits the catalytic subunit of mammalian PI 3-kinase with an IC50 = 3 nm (33Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 34Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1995; 312: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of this kinase signaling pathway with wortmannin up to 100 nm did not affect the enhanced metabolism of β-VLDL following M-CSF-treatment (Fig.7). Similarly, the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitors 4-amino-5-(-4-cholorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo 3,4-d-pyrimidine (PP2; 100 nm) and herbimycin A (1 μm) did not affect the enhanced metabolism of β-VLDL mediated by M-CSF treatment (data not shown). To examine the role of heterotrimeric G proteins, peritoneal macrophages were treated with either a specific inhibitor of Gi/o protein signaling, pertussis toxin (36Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3129-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), or a direct Gi/o protein activator, mastoparan (38Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prior to the addition of β-VLDL alone or β-VLDL plus M-CSF. As shown previously (15Whitman S.C. Daugherty A. Post S.R. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 807-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pertussis toxin treatment did not affect cholesterol ester deposition during incubation with β-VLDL alone (183.0 ± 16.7 versus 169.2 ± 28.7 nmol/mg of protein/5 h;p = non-significant, n = 3) (Fig.8 A). However, pre-treatment with toxin completely attenuated the augmented cholesterol ester deposition promoted by M-CSF (352.0 ± 55.0 versus177.4 ± 22.5 nmol/mg of protein/5 h; β-VLDL+M-CSFversus β-VLDL + M-CSF + toxin, p = 0.014,n = 3) (Fig. 8 A). Treatment of peritoneal macrophages with mastoparan was found to mimic the effect of M-CSF; metabolism of β-VLDL was significantly enhanced in the presence of mastoparan (130.9 ± 14.8 versus 295.5 ± 51.4 nmol/mg of protein/5 h; p = 0.015, n = 5), whereas AcLDL metabolism was not affected (105.3 ± 5.5versus 115.1 ± 5.4 nmol/mg of protein/5 h;p = non-significant, n = 3) (Fig.8 B). We examined whether β-VLDL metabolism by macrophages would be affected by a brief exposure of the cells to M-CSF. Acute M-CSF treatment of both primary isolates and cultured murine macrophages significantly enhanced cholesterol ester deposition upon incubation of cells with either LDL or β-VLDL. In contrast to its effect on metabolism of LDL receptor ligands, M-CSF did not alter cholesterol ester deposition in macrophages treated with AcLDL. Thus, the effect of M-CSF-treatment on β-VLDL- and LDL-mediated cholesterol ester deposition was not the result of a nonspecific affect on lipoprotein uptake and metabolism. To further address this issue, we performed uptake and degradation experiments at 37 °C using125I-β-VLDL. M-CSF treatment significantly enhanced degradation of 125I-β-VLDL consistent with the notion that the cytokine was specifically enhancing lipoprotein uptake rather than affecting cholesterol metabolism downstream of lysosomal degradation of the lipoprotein. Enhanced metabolism of both β-VLDL and LDL induced by M-CSF treatment was found to be saturable, indicating that accumulation of these lipoproteins involved a specific uptake process. However, 4 °C binding studies using both125I-LDL and 125I-β-VLDL indicated that M-CSF did not enhance lipoprotein metabolism via increasing cell surface lipoprotein receptor (LDL receptor) expression. In contrast to our findings, prolonged exposure (4 days) of a human monocyte-derived macrophage cell line (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-treated THP-1cells) to M-CSF had no affect on β-VLDL-induced cholesterol ester deposition (31Ishii I. Yanagimachi M. Shirai K. Saito Y. Hirose S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Possible explanations to account for this discrepancy may include desensitization of an M-CSF signaling pathway in response to prolonged incubation with the cytokine, or changes in an M-CSF signaling pathway following prolonged exposure to the phorbol ester used to differentiate THP-1 monocytes. A number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure of macrophages to M-CSF will lead to an enhanced uptake of modified LDL via both nonspecific (24Jessup W. Squires B. Kritharides L. Hume D.A. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and specific pathways; the latter involving enhanced SR-A expression (25Ishibashi S. Inaba T.

Hughes D.A. Doyle A.G. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27de Villiers W.J.S. Fraser I.P. Gordon S. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that acute treatment of peritoneal macrophages with M-CSF did not affect the uptake of AcLDL, which binds to SR-A but not the LDL receptor, suggesting that the effect of M-CSF did not reflect generalized enhancement of lipoprotein uptake and metabolism. A likely explanation to account for the contrast between our findings and those of previous studies is that 5 h of M-CSF exposure is not sufficient to significantly alter SR-A receptor expression and function. Incubation of peritoneal macrophages derived from LDL receptor (−/−) mice with β-VLDL did not increase cholesterol ester deposition over basal concentrations. Furthermore, treatment of LDL receptor (−/−) peritoneal macrophages with M-CSF did not augment β-VLDL uptake. These results strongly implicate the LDL receptor in mediating β-VLDL metabolism by peritoneal macrophages and that M-CSF enhances β-VLDL metabolism by affecting LDL receptor activity. Despite the fact that uptake of β-VLDL was found to occur via the LDL receptor, M-CSF treatment of LDL receptor (+/+) macrophages did not increase binding of either 125I-β-VLDL or 125I-LDL to the cell surface. Consistent with our finding, Stopeck et al. (39Stopeck A.T. Nicholson A.C. Mancini F.P. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17489-17494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that 24-h pretreatment of the human hepatic cell line, HepG2, with M-CSF did not affect binding of125I-LDL to the LDL receptor at 4 °C. Together, these data indicate that the increase in β-VLDL metabolism observed in M-CSF-treated cells does not result from increased expression or changes in the number of cell surface receptors for β-VLDL or LDL. Pinocytosis is an active endocytic process that is important in the uptake of extracellular fluid (fluid phase pinocytosis) and macromolecules (receptor-mediated endocytosis), and in the turnover of the plasma membrane and its components (40Silverstein S.C. Steinman R.M. Cohn Z.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 669-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 41Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Unlike receptor-mediated endocytosis, which exclusively involves internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles, fluid phase pinocytosis, which includes both macro- and micro-pinocytosis, can occur through either clathrin-coated or uncoated vesicles (42Swanson J.A. Baer S.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 89-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). M-CSF treatment has been shown to rapidly stimulate fluid-phase pinocytosis in murine bone marrow derived macrophages via activation of PI 3-kinase (43Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 44Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to its effect on fluid phase pinocytosis, M-CSF treatment did not enhance receptor-mediated endocytosis of either transferrin or AcLDL via the transferrin receptor or SR-A, respectively (44Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 prevented enhancement of fluid phase pinocytosis, but had little effect on receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (44Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and AcLDL (44Racoosin E.L. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 867-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Our findings that pre-treatment of peritoneal macrophages with wortmannin did not inhibit the enhanced uptake of β-VLDL mediated by M-CSF is in agreement with earlier studies, which showed that M-CSF does not affect receptor-mediated endocytosis, and argues strongly in favor of the idea that M-CSF enhances uptake of β-VLDL via a receptor-mediated endocytic process and not via activation of a PI 3-kinase-mediated macropinocytic process. Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi/o protein signaling (36Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Katada T. Ui M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Haematol. 1993; 84: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gi/o proteins are involved in M-CSF-mediated signal transduction. Subsequent to these earlier findings, Corre and Hermouet (51Corre I. Hermouet S. Blood. 1995; 86: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Gαi2 is the G protein subtype responsible for the effects of pertussis toxin on M-CSF stimulated cellular proliferation of BAC 1.2F5 cells, a murine macrophage cell line that is dependent on M-CSF for its survival and proliferation. Our results present strong evidence showing that enhanced uptake of β-VLDL upon M-CSF treatment is mediated by Gi/o protein signaling. First, pre-treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect cholesterol ester deposition during incubation with β-VLDL alone; however, pre-treatment with toxin completely attenuated the augmented cholesterol ester deposition promoted by M-CSF. Second, acute treatment with mastoparan, a direct activator of Gi/o proteins (38Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mimicked M-CSF by enhancing the metabolism of β-VLDL, but not that of AcLDL. In summary, acute incubation of peritoneal macrophages with M-CSF has pronounced effects on the metabolism of β-VLDL and native LDL. The findings from this study describe a novel regulatory pathway linking Gi/o protein-mediated signaling and LDL receptor-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. Furthermore, by showing that signaling via the M-CSF receptor promotes rapid cholesterol ester accumulation, this study defines a potentially important control mechanism for regulating lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis.

Tramtrack residues cross-linkable to the partially depurinated DNA were identified by direct sequencing. The N-terminal α-amino group of the protein DNA-binding domain was found to be the major product of cross-linking. The location of the N terminus on the DNA was determined by identification of the DNA bases that were cross-linked to the protein α-amino group. We conclude that accessory N-terminal peptide preceding the first zinc finger of Tramtrack directly interacts with DNA, both in specific and nonspecific DNA-protein complexes. Our finding explains the role in the protein binding of the DNA bases outside of the direct interaction with the zinc fingers.

D. melanogaster Tramtrack protein Tramtrack DNA-binding domain, PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid base pair Cys2–His2 zinc fingers consist of a 30-amino acid residue sequence, which is folded around a zinc ion to form a stable structure (1Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Zinc fingers are DNA-binding motifs and occur repeated in tandem. At least two adjacent zinc fingers appear to be necessary for binding (2Jacobs G.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The zinc finger is an independent folding motif (3Nakaseko Y. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) consisting of a small β-sheet and an α-helix stabilized in a compact globular structure by the bound zinc (4Pavletich N.P.

Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Base-specific contacts are made in the major groove of DNA and are mediated by amino acids in positions −1, 2, 3 and 6 of the α-helical “reading head” (4Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The role of the linkers between finger domains is not as clear; linkers may make no contacts with DNA and do not affect the relative orientation of adjacent fingers (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but in some cases they appear to participate in DNA-protein interactions (6Wuttke D.S. Foster M.P. Case D.A. Gottesfeld J.M. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the case of at least three zinc finger proteins, several amino acids N-terminal to the first finger are necessary for specific DNA binding. For the yeast transcription factor ADR1, containing two zinc finger motifs, it was demonstrated that residues outside zinc finger motif are important for DNA binding (7Thukral S.K. Eisen A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1566-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Hyre D.E. Klevit R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Eleven residues N-terminal to the formal start of the first finger motif of yeast SWI5 protein are essential for stabilizing the folded form of finger 1 and for DNA binding (3Nakaseko Y. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, seven residues N-terminal to the first finger were shown to be required for sequence-specific DNA binding of Tramtrack protein (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of the N-terminal peptide preceding the zinc finger domain, we have studied the Tramtrack protein (Ttk)1 from Drosophila melanogaster. Ttk is involved in the regulation ofDrosophila embryonic development, and it binds to at least four DNA-binding sites (11Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Brown J.L. Sonoda S. Ueda H. Scott M.P. Wu C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ttk is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, which contains two adjacent zinc fingers. The 66-residue DNA-binding domain (TTK DBD) is able to bind DNA specifically (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Seven residues N-terminal to the first finger motif of TTK DBD are essential for DNA binding (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the domain complexed with DNA is known (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure of the Ttk zinc fingers is the same as that of other zinc finger proteins. In this structure three residues N-terminal to the conventional finger motif fold to form a third strand to the β-sheet, although they lie too distant from the DNA to interact directly with DNA bases (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The goal of our study was to investigate Ttk binding to DNA in solution and to compare the results with the crystallographic data. This was accomplished by cross-linking of TTK DBD with DNA, which was activated by partial depurination. Covalent adduct formation between activated DNA and the protein implied that the amino acid residue was in close proximity to the individual apurinic DNA site (13Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D.

It emerged that the TTK DBD N terminus cross-linked to the DNA base pairs corresponding to both specific and nonspecific binding. Thus, Ttk accessory peptide N-terminal to the first zinc finger is involved in the direct interaction with DNA like ADR1 (8Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Hyre D.E. Klevit R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 66-residue DNA-binding domain of the Tramtrack protein was kindly supplied by Louise Fairall (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 0.5 mm PMSF, 50% glycerol at −20 °C. As the Ttk DNA-binding site we used a 22-bp fragment of the number 16-binding site from the ftz promoter upstream element (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar,10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol.

The Ttk DNA-binding site was prepared by annealing of the gel-purified complementary strands. Mild depurination of DNA includes DNA methylation by dimethyl sulfate and spontaneous elimination of methylated purines. Double-stranded DNA in 100 μl of 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA was methylated with 25 μl of dimethyl sulfate freshly dissolved in 500 mm HEPES. A final concentration of dimethyl sulfate was 35 mm, and reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 30 min. DNA was precipitated to remove dimethyl sulfate and depurinated by incubation at 42 °C for 16 h in 50 μl of 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. Methylation rate was measured for 5′-labeled DNA by the cleavage at the methylated base with 10% piperidine at 95 °C for 30 min and analysis of the DNA fragments on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Quantification of the intensities of the bands allowed us to find the necessary methylation conditions. The Ttk DNA-binding site of 22 bp was methylated with dimethyl sulfate so that 30% of the DNA molecule had one, and only one, modified purine and less than 9% had more than one modified purine. DNA-protein cross-linking was carried out in 100 μl of the binding buffer containing 20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm ZnSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol. One end-labeled partially depurinated DNA was incubated with TTK DBD at room temperature for 15 min, and the 200 mm pyridine-borane complex dissolved in methanol was added to the final concentration of 10 mm (14Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Kamashev D. Esipova N.G. Ebralidse K. Mirzabekov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After incubation for 1.5 h at 37 °C, generated cross-links were additionally reduced with NaBH4 (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml). To maintain pH, HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to 25 mm. Following incubation at room temperature for 20 min, an equal amount of NaBH4 and HEPES were added, and reducing was carried out for an extra 20 min. Reduced cross-links were loaded onto 16% discontinuous polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and 7 m urea. Radioactive bands were excised from the gel. DNA-linked protein was eluted from the gel by incubation in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-mercaptoacetic acid (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF at 45 °C for 4 h, and the eluant was collected; then procedure was repeated under the same conditions and eluants were pooled. Protein cross-linked to DNA was digested with 1 μg of trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade) at 37 °C for 6 h in 100 mmNH4CO3, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The 5′-labeled DNA or DNA-linked peptides were fragmented at purines by the treatment with 2% diphenylamine in 70% formic acid aqueous solution at 37 °C for 30 min. Mixtures were extracted by diethyl ether for five times and dried. DNA fragments as well as DNA-linked peptides were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 90 mmTris borate, and 0.2 mm EDTA. To digest the 3′-end of peptide-linked oligonucleotides, T4 DNA polymerase was used as 3′ → 5′-exonuclease. Peptide-linked oligonucleotides were treated with 0.2 units of polymerase in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min. Products were precipitated and resolved in polyacrylamide gel. Treatment of the peptide-linked oligonucleotides with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment yields the same products (not shown). Uniformly labeled poly[d(A-T)] was partially depurinated and cross-linked with TTK DBD as described above. The DNA moiety of the linked complexes was digested with 2% diphenylamine in 70% formic acid at 70 °C for 70 min to a short radioactive oligonucleotide tag covalently bound to the protein. After digestion with trypsin and subsequent fractionating by gel electrophoresis, the radioactive bands were eluted from the gel as described above and treated with 0.5 units of alkaline phosphatase in 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 30 min. The resultant dephosphorylated nucleotide-peptides were re-electrophoresed under the same conditions, eluted from the gel, and sequenced by Edman degradation. In this work we analyzed both specific and nonspecific Ttk-DNA complexes. To determine the amino acid residues and DNA bases close to each other in Ttk-DNA complexes, we used zero length DNA-protein cross-linking. DNA activated by partial depurination can bind covalently with the N-terminal α-amino group, ε-amino group of lysines, and the imidazole group of histidines (13Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of these residues within the DNA-protein complex is considered to provide direct evidence for their proximity to the modified sites on DNA. Thus, the main goal of the in vitrocross-linking studies is the identification of the amino acid residues cross-linked to DNA and the positions of the cross-links on the DNA (15Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsy A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An end-labeled 22-bp DNA fragment containing the Ttk-binding site was methylated with dimethyl sulfate so that less than 9% of the DNA molecules had more than one modified purine. Methylated DNA was depurinated by heating. Elimination of purines causes formation of the aldehyde group on DNA that is able to form cross-links with the protein residues (15Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsy A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We verified that Tramtrack binding to the partially depurinated DNA is still specific. The DNA was titrated by TTK DBD in cross-linking buffer, and complex formation was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The band shift assay (Fig.1) shows that zinc fingers of Ttk bind depurinated DNA-binding site as strongly as the non-modified one.Figure 1DNA binding assay for TTK DBD.Non-modified and partially depurinated Ttk DNA-binding site as well as Ttk DNA-binding sites with indicated base substitutions were tested for the protein binding. Increasing amount of TTK DBD was incubated with 5′-labeled 22-bp DNA fragments (1.5 nm), and the protein concentrations were the same for each DNA. Free and bound DNA were separated by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gel buffered with 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3). DNA sequences are listed in Fig.7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Partially depurinated DNA was incubated with TTK DBD as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the generated cross-links were purified by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in a discontinuous SDS/urea-polyacrylamide gel. Fig.2 A shows that the major product of cross-linking was well separated from both non-cross-linked DNA and protein. The yield of the cross-linking was 1–4%. In order to separate different possible amino acids of Ttk that were cross-linked to DNA, the DNA-linked protein was digested with trypsin, and the resultant DNA-linked peptides were separated by gel electrophoresis. Four radioactive bands containing Ttk peptides linked to 5′-labeled full-length strands of 22-bp DNA (Fig. 2 B) were excised from the gel after autoradiography and eluted. In order to identify the positions of cross-linking on the DNA, 5′-labeled DNA strands cross-linked to peptides were subjected to the A + G sequencing reaction. The interpretation rests on the assumption that the sequencing ladder must be interrupted at and above the position of the cross-linked purine, because of the retardation imposed by a covalently attached peptide moiety (Fig.3). The retarded bands migrate between the full-length (non-cleaved) DNA fragment linked to peptide and the DNA fragment corresponding to the site of cross-linking. Bands DA1–DA4 and DB1–DB4 shown in Fig. 2 B may arise from the peptides cross-linked to several purines on the DNA strand. In such a case, the sequencing pattern will be a superposition of the patterns corresponding to cross-links through several purines. To separate them, the DNA-linked peptides were digested with 3′ → 5′-exonuclease (Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I or T4 DNA polymerase); the products were fractionated by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) and eluted from the gel. Exonuclease stops close to the site of cross-linking, and the number of the removed nucleotides depends on the distance between the 3′-end of the strand and the site of cross-linking. In this way cross-links to the different DNA sites can be separated. All peptides linked to strand A migrate after digestion with exonuclease as a single band (Fig. 4), and consequently peptides must be cross-linked to a single DNA site. By contrast, peptides linked to strand B migrate after treatment with exonuclease as several bands. Thus, they were cross-linked to several sites of DNA strand B. The separated products of exonuclease digestion were subjected to the A + G sequencing reaction, and electrophoresis was carried out under denaturing conditions (Fig.5). It can be seen that G14 of strand A is the first “absent” purine in the sequencing ladders. Thus, G14 on strand A is the site where all four peptides were cross-linked to strand A. DNA-linked peptide DB1 has four products of exonuclease digestion (Fig. 4,lane 8, 1–4). The A + G sequencing reaction and subsequent electrophoresis show that the products carry cross-links through the sites G8, A10, A13, and G15 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–4). DNA-linked peptide DB2 has two products of digestion, both cross-linked through the site G15 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and6). DB3 was transformed into the only peptide, cross-linked through the site G15. Finally, DNA-linked peptide DB4 was cross-linked through the sites G8 and G15. Thus, our approach makes it possible to determine the protein cross-linked DNA bases precisely; we first used this technique here.Figure 5Identification of the sites of the protein cross-linking.

For this purpose we modified the method of the cross-link analysis. The protein was cross-linked to DNA, and the DNA moiety of the cross-linked complexes was digested with micrococcal nuclease, so that only a short oligonucleotide tag is covalently bound to the protein (13Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Kamashev D. Esipova N.G. Ebralidse K. Mirzabekov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The non-digested DNA tag, that corresponds to the site of cross-linking was labeled with [32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Subsequently, the protein was digested with trypsin, and the resultant nucleotide-linked peptides were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 6). This permits comparison of the nucleotide-peptide patterns corresponding to Ttk complexed to DNA of different lengths and sequences. The maps of cross-linked nucleotide-peptides were obtained for complexes of TTK DBD with its binding site (lane 1, Fig.6) and nonspecific sequences (lanes 2 and 3, Fig.6). Nucleotide-peptide patterns of the nonspecific poly[d(A-T)] and 49-bp DNA fragment and of the Ttk-binding site are almost identical. To identify the cross-linked peptides, we prepared them in quantities sufficient for direct sequencing. As cross-linking to the specific DNA-binding site and to the poly[d(A-T)] results in the same nucleotide-peptides, the latter one was used for preparative cross-linking. Uniformly labeled poly[d(A-T)] was partially depurinated and cross-linked with TTK DBD. The DNA moiety of the linked complexes was digested with formic acid/diphenylamine to a short radioactive oligonucleotide tag covalently bound to the protein and bearing 5′-phosphate. After digestion with trypsin and subsequent fractionating by gel electrophoresis, the radioactive bands were eluted from the gel (Fig. 6) and treated with alkaline phosphatase. During re-electrophoresis under the same conditions the nucleotide-peptides migrate slower than before the treatment with phosphatase due to the loss of the 5′-phosphates in the oligonucleotide moiety of the nucleotide-peptides (migration rate is about 70% of the original mobility, Fig. 6). Thus, nucleotide-peptides were purified not only from the other nucleotide-peptides (during the first electrophoresis) but also from the non-labeled peptides that were not retarded during the second electrophoresis. Radioactive nucleotide-peptides were eluted from the gel and sequenced by Edman degradation. Peptides eluted from the bands N1, N2, and N3 are found to have the same sequence ?EFTK (residues 1–5 of TTK DBD), and peptides from bands NN1 and NN2 (the latter is not shown in Fig. 6) have also the same sequence ?EFTKEGEHTYR (residues 1–12). The ? indicates Met-1, which was not identified. This proves that it is modified by cross-linking. Both peptide sequences contain possible amino acids that can be cross-linked to sites of DNA depurination, Met-1, Lys-5, and His-9. Since the two latter residues were identified on the peptide sequencing chromatography, they were not cross-linked to DNA. Thus, TTK DBD N terminus is the major product of cross-linking of the protein to partially depurinated DNA. The finding that several peptides (marked NN) were the result of non-complete digestion with trypsin explains why we had several bands corresponding to cross-linking through a single amino acid. We have used DNA-protein cross-linking techniques (15Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsy A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to study the complex between the 66-residue DNA-binding domain of the Tramtrack protein (TTK DBD) and both a specific and a nonspecific DNA-binding site. In both cases the major product of TTK DBD-DNA cross-linking was identified to be the N-terminal α-amino group of the protein. We conclude that the N terminus of the TTK DBD is in contact with DNA in both specific and nonspecific complexes with DNA. DNA was mildly methylated and depurinated to generate aldehyde groups that are able to form Schiff bases (cross-links) with either N-terminal α-amino group of proteins, ε-amino group of lysines, or imidazole groups of histidines (13Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D.

Formation of such a zero length cross-links provides evidence for the close vicinity of the corresponding DNA and protein groups. In contrast, the absence of cross-links between protein residue and DNA does not necessarily indicate that protein side chains are remote from DNA (13Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsy A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The chemistry used here favors the formation of cross-links preferentially through N-terminal α−amino groups, then through lysines, and to a less extent through histidines (14Nacheva G.A.

Mirzabekov A.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Five bases of the specific Ttk DNA binding site were found to contact the N terminus of the TTK DBD. The contact points can be divided into two sites on the DNA sequence; one includes base pairs 13–15 and the other base pairs 8–10 (Fig. 7). If the protein had no particular position on DNA, its N terminus should have contacted all possible DNA base pairs, i.e. base pairs 1–22. Instead we obtained only two sites of contact, corresponding to two specific positions of the protein on the DNA, and as expected, the location of the protein on the DNA is not random. Within these two regions TTK DBD N terminus does not contact only one base pair and hence appears to be flexible, similar to many other protein tails (9Hyre D.E. Klevit R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the TTK DBD is residue 184 of the intact 68.5-kDa Tramtrack protein (11Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The sequence of the TTK DBD construct we studied starts from mefTKEGEHT, with first three residues encoded by the vector. The corresponding sequence in the intact protein is svrnycTKEGEHT. As can be seen, the positively charged group of the arginine in the intact protein is replaced in the construct with an N-terminal α-amino group. We speculate that in the full-length protein the arginine residue would make contact with the same bases of the DNA-binding site as does the N terminus of the TTK DBD in our cross-linking studies. The yield of cross-links is proportional to the length of time apurinic sites and protein residues are in close contact. For the specific TTK DBD-DNA complex 90% of the total cross-links involve base pairs 13–15 of binding site. Thus, the interaction of the N terminus of TTK DBD with base pairs 13–15 corresponds to the specific complex. This observation is in agreement with the footprinting data; binding of the TTK DBD protects these sites from the attack of hydroxyl radicals, methylation, and DNase I cleavage (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Base pairs 13–15 observed to be in contact with the N terminus of the TTK DBD fall within the minimal binding site of Ttk which retains full binding affinity (corresponding to base pairs 5–15 with an overhanging adenine at each 5′-end (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), see Fig. 7). We attribute the interaction of the TTK DBD N terminus with base pairs 8–10 to nonspecific one as follows: 1) it is minor (10%) product of the N termini cross-linking, and 2) in the crystal structure these bases are involved in specific contacts with residues from the zinc finger “reading heads” (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, an interaction of the TTK DBD N terminus with bases 8–10 is only possible in the absence of specific binding. Residues N-terminal to the formal start of the first zinc finger have been shown to play a role in the binding of certain zinc finger proteins to DNA. Such proteins contain relatively few, two or three, zinc finger motifs. For the yeast transcription factor SWI5, 11 residues N-terminal to the first zinc finger are necessary for stable folding and the binding of the protein to DNA (3Nakaseko Y. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of SWI5 shows that a 15-residue region N-terminal to the finger motifs forms part of the structure of the first finger domain adding a β−strand and α-helix (17Dutnall R.N. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Structure. 1996; 4: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Comparison of methylation interference footprinting study of SWI5 containing 10 and 22 residues N-terminal the first zinc finger motif shows that the presence of these residues enlarge the region of DNA protected by protein (17Dutnall R.N. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Structure. 1996; 4: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our finding that the N terminus of the TTK DBD interacts with the DNA bases remote from the specific binding site of the zinc finger domain with DNA is in agreement with these data. Another example of the participation of the N-terminal tail of the zinc finger protein in DNA binding comes from the yeast ADR1 protein. The minimal DNA binding domain of the protein includes two zinc fingers and an accessory sequence of 20 residues N-terminal to the first finger motif (7Thukral S.K. Eisen A. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1566-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NMR studies of the protein (8Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Hyre D.E. Klevit R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) show that the N-terminal sequence is unstructured and highly flexible in the absence of DNA. Upon binding to DNA the tail region becomes more protected from solvent exchange and exhibits reduced motions. It was proposed that the N-terminal region of ADR1 lies on the surface of DNA (8Schmiedeskamp M. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14003-14011Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Hyre D.E. Klevit R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 929-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For Tramtrack protein our conclusion is that the N-terminal region preceding the first zinc finger of Tramtrack is essential for DNA binding due to its direct interaction with DNA at base pairs 13–15, 5′ to the sites of zinc fingers interactions located at base pairs 7–11 (Fig. 7). In the crystal structure of the TTK DBD-DNA complex, residues N-terminal to the first zinc finger form a third strand to the β-sheet and do not interact directly with DNA (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The distance between G15 and the closest side chain of the TTK DBD, exceeds 12 Å (5Fairall L. Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Hence, the protein side chains are too distant from G15 to make a contact with this base in TTK DBD-DNA complex. Nevertheless it was clearly shown by the footprinting studies that G15 belongs to the minimal Ttk DNA-binding site (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our finding that the residues preceding the first zinc finger make contact with this base. Our data show that in solution the N-terminal region is unfolded and interacts with DNA rather than with the first zinc finger of Tramtrack. Tramtrack has several natural binding sites within theftz upstream enhanced element and zebra elements (10Fairall L. Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Harrison S.D. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,12Brown J.L. Sonoda S. Ueda H. Scott M.P. Wu C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), where base pairs 13–15 are not conserved (see Fig. 7). Thus, interaction of Tramtrack residues preceding the first zinc finger with base pairs 13–15 of DNA is likely to be nonspecific, contributing to affinity rather than to specificity. To prove the idea that these base pairs do not contribute to DNA recognition despite the fact that they belong to Ttk minimal binding site, we checked the protein binding to the Ttk-binding site carrying mutations. Wild-type base pairs were replaced with base pairs that were never found within natural Tramtrack-binding sites. Fig. 1 shows that substitution of base pairs 13, 14, and 15 decrease the protein binding only twice (G15C) or three times (A13G and C14G) which indicates that DNA-protein interaction remains specific. We believe that the interaction of the N terminus of the TTK DBD with DNA contributes to DNA binding by orientating the protein along DNA. This interaction also takes place when the protein is bound to nonspecific DNA and hence may play role in the search for the specific binding site. We thank Daniela Rhodes for stimulating discussions and carrying out a major part of this work in her laboratory in LMB/MRC, Cambridge, UK, and Louise Fairall for the generous gift of TTK DBD."
https://openalex.org/W2325252116,"We demonstrate that treatment of HCW-2 cells, an apoptotic resistant variant of the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line with phorbol-12-myristate acetate (PMA), induced differentiation along the monocytic lineage. During this process there was a dramatic increase in the mitochondrial levels of the apoptosis effector, Bak, due to the stabilization of bak mRNA, which was correlated with the sensitization of HCW-2 cells to respond to the apoptotic effect of staurosporine (STS). Treatment of PMA-differentiated, but not undifferentiated, HCW-2 cells induced processing of Bid, substantial efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. The biological significance of the increased mitochondrial Bak in differentiated HCW-2 cells was supported by the finding that transient transfection of a bak cDNA into HCW-2 cells conferred sensitivity to STS-triggered apoptosis, as determined by pro-caspase-3 processing, cytochrome c efflux and DNA fragmentation. Our results suggest that the induction of Bak, upon monocytic differentiation, may be a critical event that regulates the apoptotic sensitivity of differentiated HCW-2 cells."
