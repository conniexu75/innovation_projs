https://openalex.org/W2032882684,"Cytosine methylation is the major covalent modification of mammalian genomic DNA and plays important roles in transcriptional regulation. The molecular mechanism underlying the enzymatic removal of this epigenetic mark, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylase TET1, by converting 5mCs to 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmCs), promotes DNA demethylation in mammalian cells through a process that requires the base excision repair pathway. Though expression of the 12 known human DNA glycosylases individually did not enhance removal of 5hmCs in mammalian cells, demethylation of both exogenously introduced and endogenous 5hmCs is promoted by the AID (activation-induced deaminase)/APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme complex) family of cytidine deaminases. Furthermore, Tet1 and Apobec1 are involved in neuronal activity-induced, region-specific, active DNA demethylation and subsequent gene expression in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse brain in vivo. Our study suggests a TET1-induced oxidation-deamination mechanism for active DNA demethylation in mammals.

USA. 2000; 97: 5237-5242Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). 5mCs, especially when clustered, are important transcriptional silencers at gene promoters and endogenous retrotransposons in the genome (Jaenisch and Bird, 2003Jaenisch R. Bird A. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar). DNA methylation also plays critical roles in tissue-specific gene expression, X chromosome inactivation, gene imprinting, and nuclear reprogramming (Bonasio et al., 2010Bonasio R. Tu S. Reinberg D.

Cytosine methylation is catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and deficiencies in these enzymes result in profound developmental defects (Goll and Bestor, 2005Goll M.G. Bestor T.H.

During early development, the mammalian DNA methylome is dramatically reprogrammed at two stages (Feng et al., 2010bFeng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W.

In the zygote, DNA methylation of the paternal, but not maternal, pronucleus is rapidly lost at the genome-wide scale (Mayer et al., 2000Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T.

In primordial germ cells, DNA methylomes undergo a second wave of reprogramming, resulting in a large decrease in the global 5mC level (Hajkova et al., 2010Hajkova P. Jeffries S.J. Lee C. Miller N.

In contrast, postdevelopmental DNA demethylation occurs in a highly locus-specific fashion and has been shown to regulate gene expression in various tissues (Ma et al., 2009aMa D.K. Guo J.U.

Active DNA demethylation mediated by DNA glycosylases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA demethylation is required for epigenetic resetting during somatic reprogramming by nuclear transfer (Simonsson and Gurdon, 2004Simonsson S. Gurdon J. DNA demethylation is necessary for the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), cell fusion (Bhutani et al., 2010Bhutani N. Brady J.J. Damian M. Sacco A. Corbel S.Y. Blau H.M. Reprogramming towards pluripotency requires AID-dependent DNA demethylation.Nature. 2010; 463: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), or transcription factor-based derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S.

Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). In the adult mammalian brain, whereas the DNA epigenome is stable at the genome-wide level (Ma et al., 2009bMa D.K. Jang M.H. Guo J.U. Kitabatake Y. Chang M.L. Pow-Anpongkul N. Flavell R.A. Lu B. Ming G.L. Song H. Neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b promotes epigenetic DNA demethylation and adult neurogenesis.Science. 2009; 323: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), emerging evidence suggests the presence of active DNA modifications at specific genomic loci, and these modifications are critical for certain types of brain plasticity (Day and Sweatt, 2010Day J.J. Sweatt J.D. DNA methylation and memory formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1299-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2010Ma D.K. Marchetto M.C. Guo J.U. Ming G.L. Gage F.H. Song H. Epigenetic choreographers of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a leads to decreased CpG methylation at several genomic loci and impacts synaptic functions of adult forebrain neurons (Feng et al., 2010aFeng J. Zhou Y. Campbell S.L. Le T. Li E. Sweatt J.D. Silva A.J. Fan G. Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a maintain DNA methylation and regulate synaptic function in adult forebrain neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Deletion of Gadd45b abolishes neuronal activity-induced DNA demethylation in the adult mouse dentate gyrus at specific genomic loci, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (Fgf1) promoters, and attenuates activity-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Ma et al., 2009bMa D.K. Jang M.H. Guo J.U. Kitabatake Y. Chang M.L. Pow-Anpongkul N. Flavell R.A. Lu B. Ming G.L. Song H. Neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b promotes epigenetic DNA demethylation and adult neurogenesis.Science. 2009; 323: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation changes also affects synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Day and Sweatt, 2010Day J.J. Sweatt J.D. DNA methylation and memory formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1299-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), further suggesting the importance of epigenetic DNA modification mechanisms in the adult nervous system. Although DNA demethylation in mammals has been observed both at the genome-wide and locus-specific levels, mechanisms underlying the removal of methyl groups from the genomic DNA have been under intensive debate (Ooi and Bestor, 2008Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. The colorful history of active DNA demethylation.Cell. 2008; 133: 1145-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Several mammalian proteins have been reported to exhibit DNA demethylase activity; however, such activities remain controversial (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence has implicated DNA repair as a potential mechanism for active DNA demethylation (Gehring et al., 2009Gehring M. Reik W. Henikoff S. DNA demethylation by DNA repair.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 82-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, Ma et al., 2009aMa D.K. Guo J.U. Ming G.L. Song H. DNA excision repair proteins and Gadd45 as molecular players for active DNA demethylation.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1526-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholara; Zhu, 2009Zhu J.K. Active DNA demethylation mediated by DNA glycosylases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In plants, a group of 5mC-specific DNA glycosylases, including ROS1, DME, and DML2/3, can specifically excise 5mC to initiate the base excision repair (BER) to achieve active DNA demethylation (Zhu, 2009Zhu J.K. Active DNA demethylation mediated by DNA glycosylases.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, no ortholog of these 5mC-specific DNA glycosylases has been identified in mammalian genomes. Alternatively, it has been proposed that glycosylation of 5mC may be preceded by deamination of 5mC and generation of a T:G mismatch, which can be efficiently repaired by mammalian glycosylases TDG and MBD4 (Gehring et al., 2009Gehring M.

One cytidine deaminase, activation-induced deaminase (AID), is required for OCT4 and NANOG promoter demethylation during in vitro nuclear reprogramming (Bhutani et al., 2010Bhutani N. Brady J.J. Damian M. Sacco A. Corbel S.Y. Blau H.M. Reprogramming towards pluripotency requires AID-dependent DNA demethylation.Nature. 2010; 463: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Aid null mice also exhibit significant defect in genome-wide DNA demethylation in primordial germ cells (Popp et al., 2010Popp C. Dean W. Feng S. Cokus S.J. Andrews S. Pellegrini M. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W. Genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation in mouse primordial germ cells is affected by AID deficiency.Nature. 2010; 463: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, AID is unable to act on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and the 5mC reactivity for AID deamination in vitro is much lower than unmethylated cytosines (Bransteitter et al., 2003Bransteitter R. Pham P. Scharff M.D. Goodman M.F. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates deoxycytidine on single-stranded DNA but requires the action of RNase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunol. 2005; 42: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether AID, if it does initiate demethylation, directly deaminates 5mCs in vivo. TET proteins, a group of Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, have recently been identified as 5mC hydroxylases that oxidize 5mCs to produce 5hmCs (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y.

Conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mammalian DNA by MLL partner TET1.Science. 2009; 324: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (3898) Google Scholar). 5hmC may achieve passive DNA demethylation by excluding DNMT1, which maintains symmetric CpG methylation during DNA replication (Valinluck and Sowers, 2007Valinluck V. Sowers L.C. Endogenous cytosine damage products alter the site selectivity of human DNA maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tet1 knockdown in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) results in Nanog promoter hypermethylation and defects in ESC self-renewal (Ito et al., 2010Ito S. D'Alessio A.C. Taranova O.V. Hong K. Sowers L.C. Zhang Y. Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). 5hmC has also been hypothesized as a potential intermediate for active DNA demethylation (Bonasio et al., 2010Bonasio R. Tu S. Reinberg D. Molecular signals of epigenetic states.Science. 2010; 330: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, Feng et al., 2010bFeng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W.

However, direct evidence for active demethylation of 5hmC-containing DNA is lacking. In two recent studies, loss-of-function mutations of TET2 appeared to display opposite effects on DNA methylation status (Figueroa et al., 2010Figueroa M.E. Abdel-Wahab O. Lu C. Ward P.S. Patel J. Shih A. Li Y. Bhagwat N. Vasanthakumar A.

Ganetzky R. et al.Impaired hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine in myeloid cancers with mutant TET2.Nature. 2010; 468: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), further raising the question of a general role of TET proteins and 5hmC in DNA demethylation. Notably, 5hmCs exist in relative abundance in various brain regions (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009Kriaucionis S. Heintz N. The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain.Science. 2009; 324: 929-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). The physiological function of 5hmC and TET proteins in the brain remains to be determined. Here, we show that overexpression of TET1 in human cells reactivates a methylation-silenced plasmid reporter and promotes DNA demethylation of both exogenous nonreplicable methylated reporter plasmids and multiple endogenous genomic loci. We provide direct evidence that human cells possess a robust demethylating activity toward 5hmC-containing DNA, which is DNA replication independent and requires an intact BER pathway. Furthermore, AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases promote 5hmC demethylation both in cultured human cells and in the adult mouse brain. Similar to deamination, 5hmC demethylation is processive, transcription dependent, and strand biased. Finally, Tet1 is both sufficient and required for neuronal activity-induced, region-specific, and active DNA demethylation in the adult mouse brain in vivo. Our study identified TET1 as a critical factor to initiate an oxidation-deamination mechanism underlying active DNA demethylation in mammals. We first confirmed the 5mC hydroxylase activity of human TET1 by analysis of purified genomic DNA from HEK293 cells overexpressing the HA-tagged human TET1 catalytic domain (aa1418–2136, referred to as TET1) using immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry (Figures 1A and Figure S1A available online). The specificity of 5hmC antibodies was confirmed by immunoblotting of linear DNA that contained almost exclusively unmethylated cytosines, 5mCs, or 5hmCs (Figure S1B). To examine whether hydroxylation of 5mC by TET1 promotes active DNA demethylation, we utilized a reporter assay using an in vitro methylated GFP-expressing plasmid (Figure S1C) (Ma et al., 2009bMa D.K. Jang M.H. Guo J.U. Kitabatake Y. Chang M.L. Pow-Anpongkul N. Flavell R.A. Lu B. Ming G.L. Song H. Neuronal activity-induced Gadd45b promotes epigenetic DNA demethylation and adult neurogenesis.Science. 2009; 323: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Complete methylation of all CpGs on the plasmid by the bacterial methyltransferase SssI resulted in strong silencing of GFP expression after transfection into HEK293 cells (Figure 1A). Overexpression of TET1, but not a catalytically inactive TET1 mutant (H1671Y/D1673A; TET1m), promoted reactivation of GFP expression, resulting in a significant increase in the number of GFP+ cells as quantified by FACS (Figure 1A). Thus, TET1 hydroxylase activity promotes the reversal of the silencing effect of cytosine methylation.Figure S1TET1 Catalyzes 5mC Hydroxylation and Promotes Demethylation of Exogenous SssI-Methylated Reporter Plasmids and Endogenous Genomic Loci, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Immunoblotting analysis of 5hmC of genomic DNA samples from HEK293 cells at 48 hr after transfection of the empty expression vector, or the expression vector for TET1, or TET1m.(B) The specificity of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 5hmC was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using PCR-generated fully modified DNA fragments (see Experimental Procedures).

Amounts of DNA are shown under each sample. (C) A schematic illustration of the experimental procedure. Cytosine methylation near transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes is known to be critical for transcriptional silencing (Suzuki and Bird, 2008Suzuki M.M. Bird A. DNA methylation landscapes: provocative insights from epigenomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Bisulfite sequencing around the GFP TSS showed very sparse CpG demethylation 48 hr after transfection of SssI-methylated plasmids into HEK293 cells (Figure 1B). Expression of TET1, but not TET1m, significantly enhanced the demethylation of these CpGs (Figure 1B). As expected, sorted GFP+ cells with TET1 expression displayed much increased CpG demethylation (Figure 1B). We also used an independent approach to measure CpG methylation levels based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) after HpaII digestion, which is blocked by both CpG methylation and hydroxymethylation (Jin et al., 2010Jin S.G. Kadam S. Pfeifer G.P. Examination of the specificity of DNA methylation profiling techniques towards 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e125Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis showed a significant increase of HpaII sensitivity around GFP TSS in the presence of TET1, but not TET1m (Figure 1C and Table S1). Because the reporter plasmid is incapable of replication in HEK293 cells, the DNA demethylation observed around the GFP TSS is active in nature. We next examined whether 5mC hydroxylation also promotes demethylation of the endogenous genomic DNA. Indeed, overexpression of TET1, but not TET1m, significantly increased HpaII sensitivity at multiple loci from distinct genomic subregions (Figure 1C), including promoters of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), FGF1, and neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), but not at long interspersed nonrepetitive elements (LINE-1s). Thus, TET1 overexpression also promotes region-specific DNA demethylation at endogenous genomic loci in human cells. To ascertain whether TET1-induced DNA demethylation is mediated by 5hmC generation, we examined whether premodified 5hmC-containing DNA is demethylated in human cells. By replacing deoxycytidine triphosphates (dCTPs) with either 5-methyl-deoxycytidine triphosphates (5mdCTPs) or 5-hydroxymethyl-deoxycytidine triphosphates (5hmdCTPs) in PCR reactions, we generated linear GFP expression cassettes in which almost all cytosines, except for primer regions, are either 5mCs or 5hmCs (∼99.3% of all cytosines; Figure 2A , Figure S2A , and Table S1). As expected, HpaII can digest neither fully methylated nor fully hydroxymethylated DNA fragments (Figure S2B). Overexpression of TET1, but not TET1m, led to significant HpaII sensitivity near GFP TSS in 5mC-GFP DNA after transfection into HEK293 cells (Figure 2B), which required demethylation of all four cytosines in the CCGG motif. Importantly, HpaII sensitivity at the same position arose on 5hmC-GFP DNA after transfection and was not further increased by TET1 overexpression (Figure 2B). These results suggest that TET1-induced DNA demethylation is a direct result of 5hmC generation in human cells.Figure S25hmC-Containing DNA Are Demethylated in HEK293 Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) A schematic illustration of the experimental procedure.(B) Fully methylated or hydroxymethylated DNA is completely resistant to the HpaII digestion.(C) A small portion of the reference sequence and bisulfite sequencing results of transfected 5hmC-GFP DNA fragments.

Cytosines in CpG and CpH contexts are indicated by open and filled triangles, respectively. Demethylated 5hmCs in the result sequences are highlighted in yellow. To directly quantify cytosine demethylation, we carried out bisulfite sequencing analysis of 5mC-GFP and 5hmC-GFP DNA using a modified protocol (Table S1). Consistent with HpaII digestion results, bisulfite sequencing of 5mC-GFP DNA showed negligible demethylation after transfection into HEK293 cells (Figures 2C and 2D). Expression of TET1 led to ∼0.8% of 5mCpGs demethylated in each 500 bp clone (Figure 2D). Surprisingly, 5mCs in non-CpG contexts (5mCpH, H = A/C/T) showed an even higher frequency of demethylation in the presence of TET1 (Figure 2D). Importantly, robust demethylation occurred on transfected 5hmC-GFP DNA, with ∼2% of 5hmCpGs and ∼9% of 5hmCpHs demethylated in each clone, which accounts for ∼8.5% of all modified cytosines in this region (Figure 2D and Figure S2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate the presence of a DNA replication-independent 5hmC-demethylating activity and an unexpected capacity for active demethylation of 5hmCs in non-CpG contexts in mammalian cells. To characterize the mechanism underlying 5hmC demethylation, we used pharmacological inhibitors to examine the potential involvement of the BER pathway, which has been implicated for DNA demethylation in vertebrates (Gehring et al., 2009Gehring M.

GC-induced direct repression via GR binding to complex “negative” GREs (nGREs) has been reported. However, GR-mediated transrepression was generally ascribed to indirect “tethered” interaction with other DNA-bound factors. We report that GC-induces direct transrepression via the binding of GR to simple DBS (IR nGREs) unrelated to (+)GRE. These DBS act on agonist-liganded GR, promoting the assembly of cis-acting GR-SMRT/NCoR repressing complexes. IR nGREs are present in over 1000 mouse/human ortholog genes, which are repressed by GC in vivo. Thus variations in the levels of a single ligand can coordinately turn genes on or off depending in their response element DBS, allowing an additional level of regulation in GR signaling. This mechanism suits GR signaling remarkably well, given that adrenal secretion of GC fluctuates in a circadian and stress-related fashion.

Distinct response elements mediate direct transrepression by glucocorticoid receptor This direct repression, distinct from “tethered” transrepression, controls many genes Direct repression is important for homeostasis, circadian and stress functions Our discovery paves the way to improved anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids (GCs) are peripheral effectors of circadian and stress-related homeostatic functions fundamental for survival throughout vertebrate life span (Chrousos, 2009Chrousos G.P.

They are widely used to combat inflammatory and allergic disorders and their therapeutic effects have been mainly ascribed to their capacity to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Rhen and Cidlowski, 2005Rhen T. Cidlowski J.A. Antiinflammatory action of glucocorticoids–new mechanisms for old drugs.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). GCs act by binding to the GC receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily. In absence of GCs, GR is maintained in the cytoplasm by molecular chaperones. Binding of GCs generates a conformational switch in the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) which affects GR interactions with chaperones and facilitates nuclear translocation (Ricketson et al., 2007Ricketson D. Hostick U. Fang L. Yamamoto K.R. Darimont B.D. A conformational switch in the ligand-binding domain regulates the dependence of the glucocorticoid receptor on Hsp90.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, GR binds to GC response elements (GREs) and regulates transcription of target genes. “Simple” GREs belong to a family of imperfect palindromes consisting of two inverted hexameric half-site motifs separated by three base pairs (bp) (Meijsing et al., 2009Meijsing S.H. Puffal M.A. So A.Y. Bates D.L. Chen L. Yamamoto K.R. DNA binding site sequence directs glucocorticoid receptor structure and activity.Science. 2009; 324: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Such “simple” (+)GRE confer transcriptional transactivation to agonist-liganded GR through association with coactivators (e.g., SRC1, TIF2/SRC2 and SRC3) (Lonard and O'Malley, 2007Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Nuclear receptor coregulators: judges, juries and executioners of cellular regulation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). “Composite” GREs consist of DNA binding sites (DBS) for GR which, in association with binding sites for other factors, can act synergistically to mediate transactivation or transrepression. In a few of cases, binding of GR to promoter regions has been implicated in GC-induced transrepression, but no consensus sequence for “repressing” negative GREs (nGREs) has emerged (Dostert and Heinzel, 2004Dostert A. Heinzel T. Negative glucocorticoid receptor response elements and their role in glucocorticoid action.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2807-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Remarkably, “tethering” GREs do not contain DBS for GR per se, but instead contain binding sites for other DNA-bound regulators, such as NFκB and AP1, that recruit GR (Karin, 1998Karin M.

Herrlich P. Crosstalk between the glucocorticoid receptor and other transcription factors: Molecular aspects.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 275: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, tethering GREs confer “indirect” transrepression to agonist liganded GR. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease that exhibits a high prevalence (Bieber, 2008Bieber T. Atopic dermatitis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 1483-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). We recently developed mouse models which closely mimic human AD (Li et al., 2005Li M. Messadeq N. Teletin M. Pasquali J.L. Metzger D. Chambon P. Retinoid X receptor ablation in adult mouse keratinocytes generates an atopic dermatitis triggered by thymic stromal lymphopoietin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2006Li M. Hener P. Zhang Z. Kato S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11736-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and revealed that induction of the Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSLP) cytokine in epidermal keratinocytes is necessary and sufficient to trigger a human AD-like syndrome. As topical GCs are important tools for AD treatment, we wondered whether their effect could result from TSLP repression. We report that GCs transcriptionally repress TSLP expression in AD mouse models, and demonstrate that this repression is mediated through direct binding of GR to a “simple” nGRE, which belongs to a novel family of evolutionary-conserved cis-acting negative response elements (IR nGREs) found in numerous GC-repressed genes. The GC agonist fluocinolone acetonide (FA) was applied to ears of mice concomitantly treated with the “low-calcemic” Vitamin D3 (VitD3) analog MC903 (Calcipotriol; hereafter called MC) to trigger TSLP expression (Li et al., 2006Li M. Hener P. Zhang Z. Kato S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11736-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In wild-type (WT) mice, FA application inhibited basal TSLP RNA level by ∼50%, which interestingly could be relieved by coapplication of the GC antagonist RU486 (mifepristone, hereafter named RU), while MC-induced increase of TSLP RNA, which was fully blocked by FA, was also restored by RU cotreatment (Figure 1A ). Similarly, the retinoic acid (RA)-induced increase of TSLP transcripts (Li et al., 2006Li M. Hener P. Zhang Z. Kato S. Metzger D. Chambon P. Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11736-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) was blocked by FA and restored by RU (Figure S1A available online). As expected, the expression of the GC-inducible GPX3 (glutathione peroxidase 3) gene which harbours a (+)GRE (Tuckermann et al., 1999Tuckermann J.P. Reichardt H.M. Arribas R. Richter K.H. Schutz G. Angel P. The DNA binding-independent function of the glucocorticoid receptor mediates repression of AP-1-dependent genes in skin.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was enhanced by FA (Figure 1A) and inhibited by RU cotreatment, while FA or RU had no effect on MC-dependent expression of the CYP24A1 gene (a VitD3 target) (Figure 1A). Inhibition of TSLP expression by FA was not dependent on its induction by MC or RA, as a 3-day FA application to ears of RXRαβep−/− or VDR/RARαγep−/− mice (selectively lacking in epidermal keratinocytes both RXRα and β, or VDR and both RARα and RARγ, respectively) which express high levels of TSLP in epidermal keratinocytes in the absence of MC or RA treatment (Li et al., 2005Li M.

A BAC containing a 50kb genomic DNA sequence encompassing the TSLP coding and flanking sequences was processed along as a positive control for efficiency of ligation (TSLP BAC). The GR involvement in FA-induced inhibition of MC-induced TSLP expression in keratinocytes was demonstrated using adult mice in which GR was selectively ablated in keratinocytes (GRep−/− mice). Although the basal TSLP level was similar in vehicle-treated WT and GRep−/− mice, FA blocked MC-induced TSLP expression in WT, but not in GRep−/− mice (Figure 1B, right panel). MC treatment was more efficient in GRep−/− than in WT mice, indicating that endogenous GCs may partially inhibit MC-induced TSLP expression in WT epidermis. TSLP expression was similarly repressed by FA and restored by RU in mouse intestinal epithelium (Figure S1B) and in human lung epithelial cells A549 (Figure S1C), whereas expression of the (+)GRE-containing mouse GPX3 and human GILZ (Wang et al., 2004Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C. Yamamoto K.R. Chromatin immunoprécipitation (ChIP) scanning identifies primary glucocorticoid receptor target genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15603-15608Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) GC-induced genes was enhanced by FA and inhibited by RU. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that GR-mediated FA inhibition of TSLP expression was transcriptional (Figure 1C). As neither NFκB nor AP1 are involved in TSLP induction by MC in epidermis (unpublished data), its repression was unlikely to be mediated by a tethering GRE. A bioinformatics analysis of 20 kb of DNA located upstream and downstream from the mouse and human TSLP translation startsite (+1) did not reveal any (+)GRE or known “composite” activating or repressing GRE, but unveiled the presence of a palindromic sequence consisting of two inverted repeated (IR) motifs separated by one bp (called hereafter IR1 nGRE), in the upstream promoter region of both mouse (m) and human (h) TSLP genes (Figure 1E). Recombinant human GR protein in electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and supershift assays with GR antibody showed that this putative mTSLP IR1 nGRE and its human counterpart, as well as the TAT (+)GRE (Meijsing et al., 2009Meijsing S.H. Puffal M.A. So A.Y. Bates D.L. Chen L. Yamamoto K.R. DNA binding site sequence directs glucocorticoid receptor structure and activity.Science. 2009; 324: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), bound to the GR protein (Figure 1D, left panel). These bindings were specific, as shown by lack of GR binding to a mutant (+)GRE and to three mTSLP IR1 nGRE mutants (Mut1, 2, and 3) (Figures 1E and 1D, middle panel). Complexes formed between the recombinant GR and either putative IR1 nGREs or (+)GRE similarly migrated. As GR binds (+)GREs as a dimer (Wrange et al., 1989Wrange O. Eriksson P. Perlmann T. The purified activated glucocorticoid receptor is a homodimer.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two GR monomers may bind these putative nGREs. Competition bindings between [32P]-labeled mTSLP IR1 nGRE probe and excess cold (+)GRE probe, and vice-versa, indicated that GR has a higher affinity for (+)GRE than for TSLP IR1 nGRE (Figure 1D, right panel). GC-induced binding of GR to TSLP IR1 nGRE, the generation of a repressing complex, and its effect on the organization of the TSLP promoter regions, were investigated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with WT epidermis and intestinal epithelium, as well as in vitro with cultured A549 cells. Four regions of the TSLP promoter were analyzed: the proximal promoter region (PP), the region containing the IR1 nGRE, and those containing the DR3d VitD3 (VDRE) and the DR2b Retinoic Acid (RARE) response elements (unpublished data) (Figure 1F and Figure S1D). ChIP assays of epidermis revealed weak bindings of GR, as well as of SMRT and NCoR corepressors (Lonard and O'Malley, 2007Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Nuclear receptor coregulators: judges, juries and executioners of cellular regulation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) to the nGRE region, which were strongly increased upon a 6hr topical FA treatment (Figure 1G). The concomitant disappearance of both GR and SMRT/NCoR bindings to the nGRE region in GRep−/− mutant mice (Figure 1G) indicated that corepressor bindings were associated with that of GR, which was confirmed by colocalization of GR and corepressors, when shorter segments of the nGRE region were explored (Figure S1E). Upon FA treatment, in the same cells, GR as well as SRC2, SRC3 and Pol II but not SMRT and NCoR, were recruited to the GPX3 (+)GRE region (Figure S1F). Moreover, binding of GR to (+)GRE, was antagonized by RU, which on its own, did not allow the binding of GR to GPX3 (+)GRE (Figure S1F). SMRT and NCoR are known to recruit histone deacetylase (HDACs) to repressing complexes. As for GR and corepressors, HDAC2 and HDAC3 were weakly bound to the nGRE in vehicle-treated epidermis, and FA strongly enhanced this recruitment (Figure S1G), further supporting that GC-induced binding of GR to TSLP IR1 nGRE generates a repressing complex. RU topical treatment precluded FA-induced generation of this repressing complex on nGRE, whereas application of MC (Figure 1G and Figure S1G) or retinoic acid (RA) (Figure S1H, upper panels) had no effect. We also used mouse intestinal epithelium, which revealed, upon FA intraperitoneal injection, a strong binding of GR together with SMRT and NCoR corepressors to the TSLP IR1 nGRE region. RU addition precluded the generation of this FA-induced repressing complex, whereas VitD3 had no effect (Figure S1I, upper panel). Similarly, FA addition to A549 cells resulted in a stronger binding of GR together with SMRT and NCoR to the nGRE region (which was suppressed by RU, Figure S1J), whereas it induced binding of an activating complex to the GILZ gene (+)GRE (Figure S1K). To demonstrate that SMRT and NCoR are instrumental in GC-induced IR1 nGRE-mediated TSLP repression, we knocked-down their expression in A549 cells by 60% and 80%, respectively, with selective siRNA (Figure 1H). Upon single siRNA treatment, ChIP assays showed a marked decrease in SMRT binding and complete disappearance of NCoR binding to TSLP nGRE, while no SMRT and NCoR binding could be detected upon siSMRT and siNCoR RNAs cotreatment (Figure 1I). Dex-induced TSLP repression was prevented by concomitant knockdowns of SMRT and NCoR, but not significantly affected by their single knockdown, thus demonstrating that SMRT and NCoR are instrumental in GC-induced IR1 nGRE-mediated repression, and that these two corepressors can be functionally redundant. Interestingly, the ChIP data suggest that GR is less efficiently bound to the IR1 nGRE in the absence of the two corepressors (Figure 1I). Note that SMRT and NCoR knockdowns (on their own or together) did not affect GR expression and Dex-induced transactivation of the (+)GRE GILZ gene (Figure 1H). In the absence of an agonist ligand, a repressing complex containing VDR and SMRT was bound to TSLP DR3d VDRE in epidermal keratinocytes, whereas it was replaced by a VDR-SRC2/SRC3-Pol II activating complex upon MC topical treatment (Figure 1G and unpublished results). Upon MC and FA cotreatment, VDR association with the VDRE was not inhibited, whereas those of SRC2, SRC3, and Pol II were drastically reduced, and an association of SMRT was observed (Figure 1G). No association of GR to DR3d VDRE was detected, but these latter changes are clearly related to binding of FA to GR, as RU cotreatment (MC+FA+RU) restored the activation binding pattern observed upon treatment with MC alone (Figure 1G). No GR binding to the PP region could be detected upon FA treatment. However, this treatment precluded VDR, SRC2, SRC3 and Pol II bindings induced by MC treatment, and a RU cotreatment (MC+FA+RU) reversed the effect of FA, indicating an involvement of FA-liganded GR in preventing the association of VDR, SRC2/SRC3 and Pol II with the PP region (Figure 1G, lower panels). Similarly, the generation of a repressing complex on IR1 nGRE precluded the formation of an activating complex on DR2b RARE and the PP regions (Figure S1H). Note that, in contrast to the DR3d VDRE complex, the DR2b RARE complex contains SRC2 only. In keeping with the above data, in intestinal epithelium, the generation of a repressing complex on TSLP IR1 nGRE also precluded formation of a VitD3-induced activating complex on DR3d VDRE and the PP regions (Figure S1I, middle panels). That, in presence of MC, the same activating complexes (VDR, SRC2/SRC3 and Pol II) were associated with DR3d VDRE and PP regions indicated that these two regions could be in close apposition through chromatin looping. We therefore performed Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) assays on epidermal chromatin of mice topically treated with vehicle, FA, MC, MC+FA, RU, and MC+FA+RU. Cross-linked chromatin was digested with Nla III restriction enzyme to separate DR3d, nGRE and PP regions (Figure 1F), which were then ligated to reveal possible interactions between PP and DR3d VDRE or nGRE regions (Figure 1J). No interaction between nGRE and PP region, nor between nGRE and VDRE, could be detected upon FA or RU treatment, whereas an interaction was observed upon MC treatment between DR3d VDRE and PP regions, which was precluded by FA cotreatment (MC+FA), and restored upon RU addition (MC+FA+RU) (Figure 1J). Interactions between DR3d VDRE and PP regions were similarly revealed upon Alu I digestion (Figures S1L and S1M). Thus, the TSLP IR1 nGRE which is located ∼1.3 kb upstream from the PP region could act as a silencer element precluding the formation of a chromatin loop between the PP and the VDRE enhancer region located ∼7.3 kb upstream. To investigate whether additional DNA elements could be required to generate a repressing activity, we inserted the TSLP IR1 nGRE upstream of an enhancerless SV40 early promoter located 5′ to the luciferase coding sequence of pGL3 vector (Figure 2A ). A VDRE separated from the IR1 nGRE by a 314bp-long DNA segment devoid of any known transregulator binding site (not shown) was inserted to generate a luciferase-expressing reporter plasmid (pGL3 vector 1), which was transfected into A549 cells, followed by addition of VitD3 and/or FA. FA addition did not affect luciferase expression in absence of IR1 nGRE, whereas its presence resulted in decreased expression (which could be prevented by RU addition) of basal and VDRE-mediated VitD3-induced transcription (Figures 2A and 2B). As expected, FA-induced increase in luciferase expression was observed when IR1 nGRE was replaced b"
https://openalex.org/W1986352294,"The shoot apical meristem (SAM) comprises a group of undifferentiated cells that divide to maintain the plant meristem and also give rise to all shoot organs. SAM fate is specified by class III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors, which are targets of miR166/165. In Arabidopsis, AGO10 is a critical regulator of SAM maintenance, and here we demonstrate that AGO10 specifically interacts with miR166/165. The association is determined by a distinct structure of the miR166/165 duplex. Deficient loading of miR166 into AGO10 results in a defective SAM. Notably, the miRNA-binding ability of AGO10, but not its catalytic activity, is required for SAM development, and AGO10 has a higher binding affinity for miR166 than does AGO1, a principal contributor to miRNA-mediated silencing. We propose that AGO10 functions as a decoy for miR166/165 to maintain the SAM, preventing their incorporation into AGO1 complexes and the subsequent repression of HD-ZIP III gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1743429370,"To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network, the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level, with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks."
https://openalex.org/W2046105451,"All cells employ ATP-powered proteases for protein-quality control and regulation. In the ClpXP protease, ClpX is a AAA+ machine that recognizes specific protein substrates, unfolds these molecules, and then translocates the denatured polypeptide through a central pore and into ClpP for degradation. Here, we use optical-trapping nanometry to probe the mechanics of enzymatic unfolding and translocation of single molecules of a multidomain substrate. Our experiments demonstrate the capacity of ClpXP and ClpX to perform mechanical work under load, reveal very fast and highly cooperative unfolding of individual substrate domains, suggest a translocation step size of 5-8 amino acids, and support a power-stroke model of denaturation in which successful enzyme-mediated unfolding of stable domains requires coincidence between mechanical pulling by the enzyme and a transient stochastic reduction in protein stability. We anticipate that single-molecule studies of the mechanical properties of other AAA+ proteolytic machines will reveal many shared features with ClpXP."

https://openalex.org/W2029751037,"UFM1 is a member of the ubiquitin like protein family. While the enzymatic cascade of UFM1 conjugation has been elucidated in recent years, the biological function remains largely unknown. In this report we demonstrate that the recently identified C20orf116 [1], which we name UFM1-binding protein 1 containing a PCI domain (UFBP1), andCDK5RAP3 interact with UFM1. Components of the UFM1 conjugation pathway (UFM1, UFBP1, UFL1 and CDK5RAP3) are highly expressed in pancreatic islets of Langerhans and some other secretory tissues. Co-localization of UFM1 with UFBP1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)depends on UFBP1. We demonstrate that ER stress, which is common in secretory cells, induces expression of Ufm1, Ufbp1 and Ufl1 in the beta-cell line INS-1E.siRNA-mediated Ufm1 or Ufbp1knockdown enhances apoptosis upon ER stress.Silencing the E3 enzyme UFL1, results in similar outcomes, suggesting that UFM1-UFBP1 conjugation is required to prevent ER stress-induced apoptosis.

Contagious yawning has been theoretically and empirically linked to empathy. If empathy underlies contagious yawning, we predict that subjects should show an ingroup-outgroup bias by yawning more in response to watching ingroup members yawn than outgroup. Twenty-three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from two separate groups watched videos of familiar and unfamiliar individuals yawning or at rest (control). The chimpanzees yawned more when watching the familiar yawns than the familiar control or the unfamiliar yawns, demonstrating an ingroup-outgroup bias in contagious yawning. These results provide further empirical support that contagious yawning is a measure of empathy, which may be useful for evolutionary biology and mental health."

https://openalex.org/W1970787992,"Background While WHO recently recommended universal parasitological confirmation of suspected malaria prior to treatment, debate has continued as to whether wide-scale use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can achieve this goal. Adherence of health service personnel to RDT results has been poor in some settings, with little impact on anti-malarial drug consumption. The Senegal national malaria control programme introduced universal parasite-based diagnosis using malaria RDTs from late 2007 in all public health facilities. This paper assesses the impact of this programme on anti-malarial drug consumption and disease reporting. Methods and Findings Nationally-collated programme data from 2007 to 2009 including malaria diagnostic outcomes, prescription of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and consumption of RDTs in public health facilities, were reviewed and compared. Against a marked seasonal variation in all-cause out-patient visits, non-malarial fever and confirmed malaria, parasite-based diagnosis increased nationally from 3.9% of reported malaria-like febrile illness to 86.0% over a 3 year period. The prescription of ACT dropped throughout this period from 72.9% of malaria-like febrile illness to 31.5%, reaching close equivalence to confirmed malaria (29.9% of 584873 suspect fever cases). An estimated 516576 courses of inappropriate ACT prescription were averted. Conclusions The data indicate high adherence of anti-malarial prescribing practice to RDT results after an initial run-in period. The large reduction in ACT consumption enabled by the move from symptom-based to parasite-based diagnosis demonstrates that effective roll-out and use of malaria RDTs is achievable on a national scale through well planned and structured implementation. While more detailed information on management of parasite-negative cases is required at point of care level to assess overall cost-benefits to the health sector, considerable cost-savings were achieved in ACT procurement. Programmes need to be allowed flexibility in management of these funds to address increases in other programmatic costs that may accrue from improved diagnosis of febrile disease."
https://openalex.org/W2144783796,"The abundant flavonoid aglycone, naringenin, which is responsible for the bitter taste in grapefruits, has been shown to possess hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, our group demonstrated that naringenin inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) production, while others demonstrated its potential in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and diabetes. However, naringenin suffers from low oral bioavailability critically limiting its clinical potential. In this study, we demonstrate that the solubility of naringenin is enhanced by complexation with β-cyclodextrin, an FDA approved excipient. Hydroxypropoyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), specifically, increased the solubility of naringenin by over 400-fold, and its transport across a Caco-2 model of the gut epithelium by 11-fold. Complexation of naringenin with HPβCD increased its plasma concentrations when fed to rats, with AUC values increasing by 7.4-fold and Cmax increasing 14.6-fold. Moreover, when the complex was administered just prior to a meal it decreased VLDL levels by 42% and increased the rate of glucose clearance by 64% compared to naringenin alone. These effects correlated with increased expression of the PPAR co-activator, PGC1α in both liver and skeletal muscle. Histology and blood chemistry analysis indicated this route of administration was not associated with damage to the intestine, kidney, or liver. These results suggest that the complexation of naringenin with HPβCD is a viable option for the oral delivery of naringenin as a therapeutic entity with applications in the treatment of dyslipidemia, diabetes, and HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2027266979,"Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is involved in human physiological responses to a variety of xenobiotic compounds, including common therapeutic drugs and exogenous chemicals present in the diet and the environment. Many questions remain about the evolutionary mechanisms that have led to the high prevalence of slow acetylators in the human species. Evidence from recent surveys of NAT2 gene variation suggests that NAT2 slow-causing variants might have become targets of positive selection as a consequence of the shift in modes of subsistence and lifestyle in human populations in the last 10,000 years. We aimed to test more extensively the hypothesis that slow acetylation prevalence in humans is related to the subsistence strategy adopted by the past populations. To this end, published frequency data on the most relevant genetic variants of NAT2 were collected from 128 population samples (14,679 individuals) representing different subsistence modes and dietary habits, allowing a thorough analysis at both a worldwide and continent scale. A significantly higher prevalence of the slow acetylation phenotype was observed in populations practicing farming (45.4%) and herding (48.2%) as compared to populations mostly relying on hunting and gathering (22.4%) (P = 0.0007). This was closely mirrored by the frequency of the slow 590A variant that was found to occur at a three-fold higher frequency in food producers (25%) as compared to hunter-gatherers (8%). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the Neolithic transition to subsistence economies based on agricultural and pastoral resources modified the selective regime affecting the NAT2 acetylation pathway. Furthermore, the vast amount of data collected enabled us to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date description of NAT2 worldwide genetic diversity, thus building up a useful resource of frequency data for further studies interested in epidemiological or anthropological research questions involving NAT2."
https://openalex.org/W2067963527,"Neuroaxonal degeneration in the central nervous system contributes substantially to the long term disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, in vivo determination and monitoring of neurodegeneration remain difficult. As the widely used MRI-based approaches, including the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) have some limitations, complementary in vivo measures for neurodegeneration are necessary. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a potent tool for the detection of MS-related retinal neurodegeneration. However, crucial aspects including the association between OCT- and MRI-based atrophy measures or the impact of MS-related parameters on OCT parameters are still unclear. In this large prospective cross-sectional study on 104 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients we evaluated the associations of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and total macular volume (TMV) with BPF and addressed the impact of disease-determining parameters on RNFLT, TMV or BPF. BPF, normalized for subject head size, was estimated with SIENAX. Relations were analyzed primarily by Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models considering within-patient inter-eye relations. We found that both RNFLT (p = 0.019, GEE) and TMV (p = 0.004, GEE) associate with BPF. RNFLT was furthermore linked to the disease duration (p<0.001, GEE) but neither to disease severity nor patients' age. Contrarily, BPF was rather associated with severity (p<0.001, GEE) than disease duration and was confounded by age (p<0.001, GEE). TMV was not associated with any of these parameters. Thus, we conclude that in RRMS patients with relatively short disease duration and rather mild disability RNFLT and TMV reflect brain atrophy and are thus promising parameters to evaluate neurodegeneration in MS. Furthermore, our data suggest that RNFLT and BPF reflect different aspects of MS. Whereas BPF best reflects disease severity, RNFLT might be the better parameter for monitoring axonal damage longitudinally. Longitudinal studies are necessary for validation of data and to further clarify the relevance of TMV."

Synaptotagmins are vesicle proteins composed of a short N-terminal intravesicular sequence followed by a single transmembrane region, a linker sequence, and two C-terminal C2-domains that bind Ca2+ in some but not all synaptotagmins. Ca2+ induces binding of the two Syt1 C2-domains to phospholipid membranes and to assembled SNARE-complexes; both actions contribute to triggering exocytosis (Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001Fernandez-Chacon R.

However, in addition to the well-characterized exocytotic Ca2+-sensors Syt1, Syt2, Syt7 and Syt9, mammals express four other Ca2+-binding synaptotagmins whose function remains unknown (Syt3, Syt5, Syt6, and Syt10). Strikingly, Syt3, Syt5, Syt6, and Syt10 constitute a separate class of synaptotagmins with homologous N-terminal cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, thereby dimerizing these synaptotagmins (Fukuda et al., 1999Fukuda M.

The properties of Syt3, Syt5, Syt6, and/or Syt10 suggest that they act as Ca2+-sensors for some form of exocytosis, possibly asynchronous neurotransmitter release (Li et al., 1995bLi C. Ullrich B.

Ca2+-dependent and -independent activities of neural and non-neural synaptotagmins.Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), but no loss-of-function experiments to probe their biological roles have been reported. In brain, Syt3, Syt5, Syt6, and Syt10 are primarily, maybe exclusively, expressed in neurons (Mittelstaedt et al., 2009Mittelstaedt T. Seifert G. Alvarez-Baron E. Steinhauser C. Becker A.J. Schoch S. Differential mRNA expression patterns of the synaptotagmin gene family in the rodent brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Syt3 and Syt5 are widely distributed, whereas Syt6 is primarily expressed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the cortex, and Syt10 in olfactory bulb neurons (Mittelstaedt et al., 2009Mittelstaedt T. Seifert G. Alvarez-Baron E. Steinhauser C. Becker A.J. Schoch S. Differential mRNA expression patterns of the synaptotagmin gene family in the rodent brain.J. Comp. Neurol. 2009; 512: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of Syt10 but not of Syt3, Sy5, or Syt6 is induced in cortex by seizures (Babity et al., 1997Babity J.M. Armstrong J.N. Plumier J.C. Currie R.W. Robertson H.A. A novel seizure-induced synaptotagmin gene identified by differential display.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 2638-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have systematically examined the function of Syt10, chosen because of its localization to the olfactory bulb, using a genetic approach. Surprisingly, our data show that Syt10 functions as a Ca2+-sensor for the exocytotic secretion of IGF-1 containing vesicles, and that this role is specific for Syt10, whereas Syt1 acts as a separate Ca2+-sensor for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in the same neurons. Our data define an unanticipated Ca2+-dependent secretory pathway in neurons that coexists with the standard synaptotagmin-dependent synaptic and neuroendocrine pathways of exocytosis; thus, different synaptotagmins can in the same cell control distinct Ca2+-triggered exocytosis reactions that operate without overlap, but by similar mechanisms. We produced constitutive and conditional Syt10 KO mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Figure 1A ). Constitutive Syt10 KO mice were viable and fertile (Figures S1A and S1B). Since Syt10 is expressed at highest levels in the olfactory bulb (Mittelstaedt et al., 2009Mittelstaedt T. Seifert G. Alvarez-Baron E. Steinhauser C. Becker A.J. Schoch S.

We found no change in overall gross morphology (Figure 1C) and no alteration in the density of mitral and granule cell neurons (Figures S1C and S1D). However, measurements of the staining intensity for synapsin, a general synaptic marker (Südhof et al., 1989Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner M.A. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. et al.Synapsins: mosaics of shared and individual domains in a family of synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins.Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), revealed that the synapsin signal was decreased in the external plexiform layer (EPL), but not the olfactory glomeruli (Figures 1C and 1D and Figure S1E). To investigate this further, we measured the overall density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the EPL using antibodies to the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1) and to glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD65), respectively (Figures 1E and 1F and Figures S1F–S1I). Both markers revealed a significant reduction of staining intensity over the EPL but not the olfactory glomeruli, suggesting that the Syt10 KO decreases the overall density of synapses in the EPL. Most synapses in the EPL are reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses between excitatory mitral cell neurons and inhibitory granule cell neurons (Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998Isaacson J.S.

Membrane and synaptic properties of mitral cells in slices of rat olfactory bulb.Brain Res. 1997; 745: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Their overall function can be monitored in acute olfactory bulb slices by stimulating extracellularly in the granule cell layer, and recording in whole-cell mode from mitral neurons (Chen and Shepherd, 1997Chen W.R. Shepherd G.M. Membrane and synaptic properties of mitral cells in slices of rat olfactory bulb.Brain Res. 1997; 745: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Figure 2A ). Retrograde action potentials in mitral neurons trigger excitation of granule neuron dendrites, which then elicit inhibitory GABAergic postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) that can be monitored in the mitral neurons. Optimization experiments revealed that these events are best induced by stimulating close to the mitral cell layer (Figure S2A ). The nature of the IPSCs thus observed was validated by the demonstration that they are blocked both by inhibitors of inhibitory and of excitatory transmission (Figure 2A).Figure S2Systematic Tests of Different Locations of the Stimulating Electrode on IPSC size (A), Sample Traces for Input/Output Curves (B), and Mean IPSC Parameters Measured at the Standard Stimulation Strength (80 μA) Used for All Slice Experiments (C), Related Figure 2Show full caption(A) Examination of the effect of different locations of the stimulating electrode relative to the recording electrode on the size of the evoked IPSC in the recording strategy shown (see also Figure 2A).

In mitral cells from Syt10 KO mice the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous mIPSCs was decreased ∼40% compared to littermate wild-type controls (Figure 2B). Input/output curves uncovered a significant decrease in synaptic strength (Figures 2C and S2B). IPSCs measured during a 10 Hz stimulus train applied for 1 s were uniformly decreased ∼70%; this decrease was equally observed for the first response and for delayed release, a form of asynchronous release (Maximov and Südhof, 2005Maximov A. Südhof T.C. Autonomous function of synaptotagmin 1 in triggering synchronous release independent of asynchronous release.Neuron. 2005; 48: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that the synaptic change consisted in an overall decrease in synaptic transmission capacity, not in an impairment of a particular type of release (Figures 2D and 2E). Moreover, total neuronal cell capacitance was decreased ∼30%, whereas the input resistance was increased ∼75%, indicating that Syt10 KO neurons are smaller and electrically ‘tighter’ (Figure 2F). Our electrophysiological experiments in acute slices suggest that deletion of Syt10 impairs synaptic transmission in the olfactory bulb, but do not reveal whether excitatory and/or inhibitory synapses are affected. To measure synaptic transmission more directly, we examined cultured olfactory bulb neurons from conditional (floxed) Syt10 KO mice. Neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing inactive cre recombinase (as a control), or active cre recombinase (to induce acute deletion of Syt10; Figure 1A; Ho et al., 2006Ho A. Morishita W. Atasoy D. Liu X. Tabuchi K. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Genetic analysis of Mint/X11 proteins: essential presynaptic functions of a neuronal adaptor protein family.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13089-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this manner, we analyzed identical populations of neurons that only differ in the expression of inactive versus active cre recombinase. Moreover, we additionally examined Syt1 KO neurons to test whether Syt1 and Syt10 perform similar functions (Figure 3). Inspection of cultured olfactory bulb neurons identified two predominant types of neurons, large (∼27 μm diameter) and small neurons (∼12 μm diameter). As shown below, these neurons likely represent mitral/tufted neurons and granule cells, respectively, with the latter also including other, less abundant types of interneurons (Trombley and Westbrook [1990]). In the following, we recorded IPSCs and EPSCs from presumptive mitral neurons, and additionally EPSCs from granule neurons. The phenotype produced by the acute deletion of Syt10 was identical for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in both types of neurons, as far measured: spontaneous ‘mini’ frequencies were decreased 30%–50% without a change in mini amplitude, the amplitudes of responses triggered by action potentials were decreased ∼40%, and release induced by hypertonic sucrose (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) was lowered by ∼50% (Figures 3A-3L). Thus, the Syt10 KO uniformly causes a loss of overall synaptic strength in excitatory and inhibitory synapses in mitral and granule cell neurons. Direct comparisons of the Syt10 KO phenotype with that of the Syt1 KO, analyzed in parallel in the same preparation, revealed that the two synaptotagmin KOs caused completely different effects. Specifically, whereas the Syt10 KO decreased the mini mIPSC frequency in mitral neurons ∼50%, the Syt1 KO increased it ∼300% (Figures 3I and 3J); whereas the Syt10 KO decreased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs ∼40%, the Syt1 KO decreased it > 90% (Figure 3K); and finally, whereas the Syt10 KO decreased synaptic transmission induced by hypertonic sucrose ∼50%, the Syt1 KO had no effect on this type of synaptic response (Figure 3L). These results show that Syt10 operates in a different pathway or by a different mechanism than Syt1. The physiological phenotype of Syt10 KO neurons could be explained by a uniform decrease in the strength of all synapses, or by a decrease in synapse numbers. Moreover, the slice recordings revealed that the Syt10 KO caused a significant decrease in capacitance and increase in input resistance in mitral neurons (Figure 2F). Strikingly, we observed the same effect of the Syt10 KO in cultured mitral and granule cell neurons, whereas in parallel experiments the Syt1 KO produced no change in these parameters (Figures 4A and 4B ). These results suggest that the Syt10 KO phenotype may be due, at least in part, to a decrease in neuronal size. To test this hypothesis, we stained cultured olfactory bulb neurons with vGlut1 antibodies and measured the sizes of the cell bodies of excitatory vGlut1-positive neurons (presumably primarily mitral cells), and of inhibitory vGlut1-negative neurons (presumably primarily granule cells). These measurements confirmed that the excitatory neurons were twice as large as inhibitory neurons (Figures 4C and 4D), validating the size classification used for the electrophysiological experiments (Figure 3). Moreover, these measurements revealed that the Syt10 KO significantly reduced the size of both types of neurons (Figures 4C and 4D), confirming the hypothesis from the capacitance measurements that the Syt10 KO decreases the neuronal soma size (Figure 4A). To examine whether not only the neuronal cell bodies, but also the entire neuronal arborization is affected by the Syt10 KO, we expressed tdTomato in a small subset of neurons by transfection, and measured the total length and branching complexity of their dendrites (Figures 4E–4G). Strikingly, the Syt10 KO decreased the total dendritic length of mitral neurons by ∼40% (Figure 4F), and reduced their arborization even more (Figure 4G). In contrast, measurements of the density of synapses per dendritic length uncovered no change (Figures 4H and 4I). Viewed together, these data show that the Syt10 KO causes a general decrease in neuronal size and arborization in olfactory bulb neurons, resulting in a decrease in the number of synapses per neuron even though synapse density per dendrite length is unchanged. These findings in cultured neurons agree well with those of the olfactory bulb sections (Figures 1C-1F), and the ∼40% decrease in neuronal size and dendritic length corresponds closely to the impairment in synaptic strength we observed electrophysiologically (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Syt10 belongs to a group of Ca2+-binding synaptotagmins that includes Syt3, Syt5, and Syt6, and that differs from the group containing Syt1. The Syt10 group of synaptotagmins exhibit a high degree of sequence homology, and may heterodimerize (Fukuda et al., 1999Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Conserved N-terminal cysteine motif is essential for homo- and heterodimer formation of synaptotagmins III, V, VI, and X.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that these synaptotagmins are functionally redundant, similar to the redundancy among the Syt1 group of synaptotagmins that act as Ca2+-sensors for fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Xu et al., 2007Xu J. Mashimo T. Südhof T.C. Synaptotagmin-1, −2, and −9: Ca2+ sensors for fast release that specify distinct presynaptic properties in subsets of neurons.Neuron. 2007; 54: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the Syt10 KO phenotype, measured electrophysiologically, could be rescued by other members of its group of synaptotagmins. Unexpectedly, we found that only expression of Syt10, but not of Syt3, Syt5, or Syt6, reversed the decrease in synaptic strength, the decline in cell capacitance, and the increase in input resistance produced by the Syt10 KO (Figures 5A–5C ). We next probed whether Syt10 acts functionally as a Ca2+-sensor by mutating the Ca2+-binding sites of its C2-domains (Figure S3B; Shin et al., 2009Shin O.H. Xu J. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Differential but convergent functions of Ca2+ binding to synaptotagmin-1 C2 domains mediate neurotransmitter release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16469-16474Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rescue experiments showed that the Ca2+-binding site mutation inactivated the ability of Syt10 to reverse the Syt10 KO phenotype (Figures 5D-5F). Thus, Syt10 acts as a Ca2+-sensor to maintain the normal size and arborization of olfactory bulb neurons, with a function that is unique to this synaptotagmin isoform and not shared by other, closely related synaptotagmins. How does Syt10 regulate the growth and arborization of olfactory bulb neurons? Since the experiments up to now indicate that Syt10 might be a Ca2+-sensor for the exocytosis of an unknown growth factor, we tested whether cultured olfactory bulb neurons exhibit an activity-dependent trophic phenotype. At the same time, we examined whether olfactory bulb neurons secrete IGF-1 in an activity-dependent manner, because this growth factor is abundantly expressed in olfactory bulb neurons, supports olfactory bulb neurogenesis and differentiation, and maintains olfactory map formation (Bartlett et al., 1991Bartlett W.P.

Chronic treatment of cultured wild-type olfactory bulb neurons with 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX), a Na+-channel blocker that silences network activity in cultured neurons, caused a decrease in cell capacitance and an increase in input resistance similar to the effect of the Syt10 KO (Figure S3D ). Direct measurements of the IGF-1 concentration in the medium revealed a significant decrease of secreted IGF-1 in TTX-treated neurons (Figure S3D). Thus, silencing of olfactory bulb neurons stunts their growth, and decreases IGF-1 secretion. We next tested whether secretion of IGF-1 could be stimulated by mild depolarization of cultured olfactory bulb neurons by incubating them in 15 mM K+, and whether the Syt10 KO impaired the stimulated secretion of IGF-1 (Figures 5G–5I). Indeed, 15 mM K+ depolarizat"
https://openalex.org/W1993566688,"Mammalian oocyte meiotic maturation involves oocyte polarization and a unique asymmetric division, but until now, the underlying mechanisms have been poorly understood. Arp2/3 complex has been shown to regulate actin nucleation and is widely involved in a diverse range of processes such as cell locomotion, phagocytosis and the establishment of cell polarity. Whether Arp2/3 complex participates in oocyte polarization and asymmetric division is unknown. The present study investigated the expression and functions of Arp2/3 complex during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the Arp2/3 complex was restricted to the cortex, with a thickened cap above the meiotic apparatus, and that this localization pattern was depended on actin. Disruption of Arp2/3 complex by a newly-found specific inhibitor CK666, as well as by Arpc2 and Arpc3 RNAi, resulted in a range of effects. These included the failure of asymmetric division, spindle migration, and the formation and completion of oocyte cytokinesis. The formation of the actin cap and cortical granule-free domain (CGFD) was also disrupted, which further confirmed the disruption of spindle migration. Our data suggest that the Arp2/3 complex probably regulates oocyte polarization through its effect on spindle migration, asymmetric division and cytokinesis during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation."

However, the impact upon the long term health of the children is currently unknown. In this study, we used an animal model to determine the consequences of maternal shift work exposure on the health of the adult offspring. Pregnant rats were exposed to chronic phase shifts (CPS) in their photoperiod every 3–4 days throughout gestation and the first week after birth. Adult offspring were assessed for a range of metabolic, endocrine, circadian and neurobehavioural parameters. At 3 months of age, male pups exposed to the CPS schedule in utero had increased adiposity (+29%) and hyperleptinaemia (+99% at 0700h). By 12 months of age, both male and female rats displayed hyperleptinaemia (+26% and +41% respectively) and hyperinsulinaemia (+110% and +83% respectively). 12 month old female CPS rats displayed poor glucose tolerance (+18%) and increased insulin secretion (+29%) in response to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. In CPS males the glucose response was unaltered, but the insulin response was reduced by 35%. The glucose response to an insulin tolerance test was decreased by 21% in CPS females but unaltered in males. Disruption of circadian rhythmicity during gestation resulted in gender dependent metabolic consequences for the adult offspring. These results highlight the need for a thorough analysis of shift work exposure in utero on the health of the adult offspring in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2011232899,"As gigantic herbivores, sauropod dinosaurs were among the most important members of Mesozoic communities. Understanding their ecology is fundamental to developing a complete picture of Jurassic and Cretaceous food webs. One group of sauropods in particular, Diplodocoidea, has long been a source of debate with regard to what and how they ate. Because of their long lineage duration (Late Jurassic-Late Cretaceous) and cosmopolitan distribution, diplodocoids formed important parts of multiple ecosystems. Additionally, fortuitous preservation of a large proportion of cranial elements makes them an ideal clade in which to examine feeding behavior.Hypotheses of various browsing behaviors (selective and nonselective browsing at ground-height, mid-height, or in the upper canopy) were examined using snout shape (square vs. round) and dental microwear. The square snouts, large proportion of pits, and fine subparallel scratches in Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus, and Rebbachisaurus suggest ground-height nonselective browsing; the narrow snouts of Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, and Tornieria and the coarse scratches and gouges on the teeth of Dicraeosaurus suggest mid-height selective browsing in those taxa. Comparison with outgroups (Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus) reinforces the inferences of ground- and mid-height browsing and the existence of both non-selective and selective browsing behaviors in diplodocoids.These results reaffirm previous work suggesting the presence of diverse feeding strategies in sauropods and provide solid evidence for two different feeding behaviors in Diplodocoidea. These feeding behaviors can subsequently be tied to paleoecology, such that non-selective, ground-height behaviors are restricted to open, savanna-type environments. Selective browsing behaviors are known from multiple sauropod clades and were practiced in multiple environments."

The cellular events underlying this important process in learning and memory are still being revealed. Here we describe and characterize the AAA+ ATPase Thorase, which regulates the expression of surface AMPAR. In an ATPase-dependent manner Thorase mediates the internalization of AMPAR by disassembling the AMPAR-GRIP1 complex. Following genetic deletion of Thorase, the internalization of AMPAR is substantially reduced, leading to increased amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, enhancement of LTP, and elimination of LTD. These molecular events are expressed as deficits in learning and memory in Thorase null mice. This study identifies an AAA+ ATPase that plays a critical role in regulating the surface expression of AMPAR and thereby regulates synaptic plasticity and learning and memory."

Logistic regression analyses indicated that NSSI was significantly associated with self-reported suicide attempts. Analyses examining the conditional association of NSSI and suicidal ideation with self-reported suicide attempts revealed that NSSI was significantly associated with greater risk of suicide attempts in those not reporting suicidal ideation than those reporting suicidal ideation in the past year.These findings highlight the importance of NSSI as a potentially independent risk factor for suicide attempts among Chinese/Han adolescents and college students."
https://openalex.org/W1971504361,"Background Interaction of the iminium and alkanolamine forms of sanguinarine with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was characterized by spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings Formation of strong complexes of BSA with both iminium and alkanolamine forms was revealed from fluorescence quenching of sanguinarine. Binding parameters calculated from Stern-Volmer quenching method revealed that the neutral alkanolamine had higher affinity to BSA compared to the charged iminium form. Specific binding distances of 3.37 and 2.38 nm between Trp 212 (donor) and iminium and alkanolamine forms (acceptor), respectively, were obtained from Forster resonance energy transfer studies. Competitive binding using the site markers warfarin and ibuprofen, having definite binding sites, demonstrated that both forms of sanguinarine bind to site I (subdomain IIA) on BSA. Sanguinarine binding alters protein conformation by reducing the α-helical organization and increasing the coiled structure, indicating a small but definitive partial unfolding of the protein. Thermodynamic parameters evaluated from isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that the binding was enthalpy driven for the iminium form but favoured by negative enthalpy and strong favourable entropy contributions for the alkanolamine form, revealing the involvement of different molecular forces in the complexation. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that the neutral alkanolamine form binds to the protein more favourably compared to the charged iminium, in stark contrast to the reported DNA binding preference of sanguinarine."

Robustness against temperature variations is thus expected to be an essential network property, particularly in organisms without inherent temperature control. Here, we combine experimental analyses with computational modeling to investigate thermal robustness of signaling in chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, a relatively simple and well-established model for systems biology. We show that steady-state and kinetic pathway parameters that are essential for chemotactic performance are indeed temperature-compensated in the entire physiological range. Thermal robustness of steady-state pathway output is ensured at several levels by mutual compensation of temperature effects on activities of individual pathway components. Moreover, the effect of temperature on adaptation kinetics is counterbalanced by preprogrammed temperature dependence of enzyme synthesis and stability to achieve nearly optimal performance at the growth temperature. Similar compensatory mechanisms are expected to ensure thermal robustness in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1985436520,"The Astrophorida (Porifera, Demospongiae(p)) is geographically and bathymetrically widely distributed. Systema Porifera currently includes five families in this order: Ancorinidae, Calthropellidae, Geodiidae, Pachastrellidae and Thrombidae. To date, molecular phylogenetic studies including Astrophorida species are scarce and offer limited sampling. Phylogenetic relationships within this order are therefore for the most part unknown and hypotheses based on morphology largely untested. Astrophorida taxa have very diverse spicule sets that make them a model of choice to investigate spicule evolution.With a sampling of 153 specimens (9 families, 29 genera, 89 species) covering the deep- and shallow-waters worldwide, this work presents the first comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the Astrophorida, using a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene partial sequence and the 5' end terminal part of the 28S rDNA gene (C1-D2 domains). The resulting tree suggested that i) the Astrophorida included some lithistid families and some Alectonidae species, ii) the sub-orders Euastrophorida and Streptosclerophorida were both polyphyletic, iii) the Geodiidae, the Ancorinidae and the Pachastrellidae were not monophyletic, iv) the Calthropellidae was part of the Geodiidae clade (Calthropella at least), and finally that v) many genera were polyphyletic (Ecionemia, Erylus, Poecillastra, Penares, Rhabdastrella, Stelletta and Vulcanella).The Astrophorida is a larger order than previously considered, comprising ca. 820 species. Based on these results, we propose new classifications for the Astrophorida using both the classical rank-based nomenclature (i.e., Linnaean classification) and the phylogenetic nomenclature following the PhyloCode, independent of taxonomic rank. A key to the Astrophorida families, sub-families and genera incertae sedis is also included. Incongruences between our molecular tree and the current classification can be explained by the banality of convergent evolution and secondary loss in spicule evolution.

https://openalex.org/W1984774839,"The composition of amylopectin is the determinant of rice eating quality under certain threshold of protein content and the ratio of amylose and amylopectin. In molecular biology level, the fine structure of amylopectin is determined by relative activities of starch branching enzyme (SBE), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), and soluble starch synthase (SSS) in rice grain under the same ADP-Glucose level. But the underlying mechanism of eating quality in molecular biology level remains unclear. This paper reports the differences on major parameters such as SNP and insertion-deletion sites, RNA expressions, and enzyme activities associated with eating quality of japonica varieties. Eight japonica rice varieties with significant differences in various eating quality parameters such as palatability and protein content were used in this experiment. Association analysis between nucleotide polymorphism and eating quality showed that S12 and S13 loci in SBE1, S55 in SSS1, S58 in SSS2A were significantly associated with apparent amylose content, alkali digestion value, setback viscosity, consistency viscosity, pasting temperature, which explained most of the variation in apparent amylose content, setback viscosity, and consistency viscosity; and explained almost all variations in alkali digestion value and pasting temperature. Thirty-five SNPs and insertion-deletions from SBE1, SBE3, GBSS1, SSS1, and SSS2A differentiated high or intermediate palatability rice varieties from low palatability rice varieties. Correlation analysis between enzyme activities and eating quality properties revealed that SBE25 and SSS15/W15 were positively correlated with palatability, whereas GBSS10 and GBSS15 were negatively correlated. Gene expressions showed that SBE1 and SBE3 expressions in high palatability varieties tended to be higher than middle and low palatability varieties. Collectively, SBE1, SBE3, SSS1, and SSS2A, especially SBE1 and SBE3 could improve eating quality, but GBSS1 decreased eating quality. The results indicated the possibility of developing high palatability cultivars through modification of key genes related to japonica rice eating quality formation in starch biosynthesis."

Expression of intestine-specific transcription factors in the esophagus likely contributes to metaplasia development. Our objective was to explore the effects of an intestine-specific transcription factor when expressed in the mouse esophageal epithelium. Transgenic mice were derived in which the transcription factor Cdx2 is expressed in squamous epithelium using the murine Keratin-14 gene promoter. Effects of the transgene upon cell proliferation and differentiation, gene expression, and barrier integrity were explored. K14-Cdx2 mice express the Cdx2 transgene in esophageal squamous tissues. Cdx2 expression was associated with reduced basal epithelial cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Ultrastructurally two changes were noted. Cdx2 expression was associated with dilated space between the basal cells and diminished cell-cell adhesion caused by reduced Desmocollin-3 mRNA and protein expression. This compromised epithelial barrier function, as the measured trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the K14-Cdx2 epithelium was significantly reduced compared to controls (1189 Ohm*cm(2) ±343.5 to 508 Ohm*cm(2)±92.48, p = 0.0532). Secondly, basal cells with features of a transitional cell type, intermediate between keratinocytes and columnar Barrett's epithelial cells, were observed. These cells had reduced keratin bundles and increased endoplasmic reticulum levels, suggesting the adoption of secretory-cell features. Moreover, at the ultrastructural level they resembled ""Distinctive"" cells associated with multilayered epithelium. Treatment of the K14-Cdx2 mice with 5'-Azacytidine elicited expression of BE-associated genes including Cdx1, Krt18, and Slc26a3/Dra, suggesting the phenotype could be advanced under certain conditions. We conclude that ectopic Cdx2 expression in keratinocytes alters cell proliferation, barrier function, and differentiation. These altered cells represent a transitional cell type between normal squamous and columnar BE cells. The K14-Cdx2 mice represent a useful model to study progression from squamous epithelium to BE."

Precise mechanism(s) of minocycline's functions are not well defined.Fourteen rhesus macaques were SIV infected and neuronal metabolites measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS). Seven received minocycline (4 mg/kg) daily starting at day 28 post-infection (pi). Monocyte expansion and activation were assessed by flow cytometry, cell traffic to lymph nodes, CD16 regulation, viral replication, and cytokine production were studied.Minocycline treatment decreased plasma virus and pro-inflammatory CD14+CD16+ and CD14(lo)CD16+ monocytes, and reduced their expression of CD11b, CD163, CD64, CCR2 and HLA-DR. There was reduced recruitment of monocyte/macrophages and productively infected cells in axillary lymph nodes. There was an inverse correlation between brain NAA/Cr (neuronal injury) and circulating CD14+CD16+ and CD14(lo)CD16+ monocytes. Minocycline treatment in vitro reduced SIV replication CD16 expression on activated CD14+CD16+ monocytes, and IL-6 production by monocytes following LPS stimulation.Neuroprotective effects of minocycline are due in part to reduction of activated monocytes, monocyte traffic. Mechanisms for these effects include CD16 regulation, reduced viral replication, and inhibited immune activation."
https://openalex.org/W2086259491,"Insomnia is reported to chronically affect 10∼15% of the adult population. However, very little is known about the genetics and metabolism of insomnia. Here we surveyed 10,038 Korean subjects whose genotypes have been previously profiled on a genome-wide scale. About 16.5% reported insomnia and displayed distinct metabolic changes reflecting an increase in insulin secretion, a higher risk of diabetes, and disrupted calcium signaling. Insomnia-associated genotypic differences were highly concentrated within genes involved in neural function. The most significant SNPs resided in ROR1 and PLCB1, genes known to be involved in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, respectively. Putative enhancers, as indicated by the histone mark H3K4me1, were discovered within both genes near the significant SNPs. In neuronal cells, the enhancers were bound by PAX6, a neural transcription factor that is essential for central nervous system development. Open chromatin signatures were found on the enhancers in human pancreas, a tissue where PAX6 is known to play a role in insulin secretion. In PLCB1, CTCF was found to bind downstream of the enhancer and interact with PAX6, suggesting that it can probably inhibit gene activation by PAX6. PLCB4, a circadian gene that is closely located downstream of PLCB1, was identified as a candidate target gene. Hence, dysregulation of ROR1, PLCB1, or PLCB4 by PAX6 and CTCF may be one mechanism that links neural and pancreatic dysfunction not only in insomnia but also in the relevant psychiatric disorders that are accompanied with circadian rhythm disruption and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2079835687,"Nipah virus (NiV) was first recognized in 1998 in a zoonotic disease outbreak associated with highly lethal febrile encephalitis in humans and a predominantly respiratory disease in pigs. Periodic deadly outbreaks, documentation of person-to-person transmission, and the potential of this virus as an agent of agroterror reinforce the need for effective means of therapy and prevention. In this report, we describe the vaccine potential of NiV virus-like particles (NiV VLPs) composed of three NiV proteins G, F and M. Co-expression of these proteins under optimized conditions resulted in quantifiable amounts of VLPs with many virus-like/vaccine desirable properties including some not previously described for VLPs of any paramyxovirus: The particles were fusogenic, inducing syncytia formation; PCR array analysis showed NiV VLP-induced activation of innate immune defense pathways; the surface structure of NiV VLPs imaged by cryoelectron microscopy was dense, ordered, and repetitive, and consistent with similarly derived structure of paramyxovirus measles virus. The VLPs were composed of all the three viral proteins as designed, and their intracellular processing also appeared similar to NiV virions. The size, morphology and surface composition of the VLPs were consistent with the parental virus, and importantly, they retained their antigenic potential. Finally, these particles, formulated without adjuvant, were able to induce neutralizing antibody response in Balb/c mice. These findings indicate vaccine potential of these particles and will be the basis for undertaking future protective efficacy studies in animal models of NiV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2057000049,"Cancer genomes frequently contain somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) that can significantly perturb the expression level of affected genes and thus disrupt pathways controlling normal growth. In melanoma, many studies have focussed on the copy number and gene expression levels of the BRAF, PTEN and MITF genes, but little has been done to identify new genes using these parameters at the genome-wide scale. Using karyotyping, SNP and CGH arrays, and RNA-seq, we have identified SCNA affecting gene expression (‘SCNA-genes’) in seven human metastatic melanoma cell lines. We showed that the combination of these techniques is useful to identify candidate genes potentially involved in tumorigenesis. Since few of these alterations were recurrent across our samples, we used a protein network-guided approach to determine whether any pathways were enriched in SCNA-genes in one or more samples. From this unbiased genome-wide analysis, we identified 28 significantly enriched pathway modules. Comparison with two large, independent melanoma SCNA datasets showed less than 10% overlap at the individual gene level, but network-guided analysis revealed 66% shared pathways, including all but three of the pathways identified in our data. Frequently altered pathways included WNT, cadherin signalling, angiogenesis and melanogenesis. Additionally, our results emphasize the potential of the EPHA3 and FRS2 gene products, involved in angiogenesis and migration, as possible therapeutic targets in melanoma. Our study demonstrates the utility of network-guided approaches, for both large and small datasets, to identify pathways recurrently perturbed in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1980179789,"Patterns of migration and habitat use in diadromous fishes can be highly variable among individuals. Most investigations into diadromous movement patterns have been restricted to populations in regulated rivers, and little information exists for those in unregulated catchments. We quantified movements of migratory barramundi Lates calcarifer (Bloch) in two large unregulated rivers in northern Australia using both elemental (Sr/Ba) and isotope (87Sr/86Sr) ratios in aragonitic ear stones, or otoliths. Chemical life history profiles indicated significant individual variation in habitat use, particularly among chemically distinct freshwater habitats within a catchment. A global zoning algorithm was used to quantify distinct changes in chemical signatures across profiles. This algorithm identified between 2 and 6 distinct chemical habitats in individual profiles, indicating variable movement among habitats. Profiles of 87Sr/86Sr ratios were notably distinct among individuals, with highly radiogenic values recorded in some otoliths. This variation suggested that fish made full use of habitats across the entire catchment basin. Our results show that unrestricted movement among freshwater habitats is an important component of diadromous life histories for populations in unregulated systems."
https://openalex.org/W2092017777,"Doubt about the relevance, appropriateness and transparency of peer review has promoted the use of citation metrics as a viable adjunct or alternative in the assessment of research impact. It is also commonly acknowledged that research metrics will not replace peer review unless they are shown to correspond with the assessment of peers. This paper evaluates the relationship between researchers' influence as evaluated by their peers and various citation metrics representing different aspects of research output in 6 fields of public health in Australia. For four fields, the results showed a modest positive correlation between different research metrics and peer assessments of research influence. However, for two fields, tobacco and injury, negative or no correlations were found. This suggests a peer understanding of research influence within these fields differed from visibility in the mainstream, peer-reviewed scientific literature. This research therefore recommends the use of both peer review and metrics in a combined approach in assessing research influence. Future research evaluation frameworks intent on incorporating metrics should first analyse each field closely to determine what measures of research influence are valued highly by members of that research community. This will aid the development of comprehensive and relevant frameworks with which to fairly and transparently distribute research funds or approve promotion applications."
https://openalex.org/W2014588596,"Mesangial matrix expansion is a prominent feature of the most common form of glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy (IgAN). To find molecular markers and improve the understanding of the disease, the gene and protein expression of proteoglycans were investigated in biopsies from IgAN patients and correlated to clinical and morphological data. We collected and microdissected renal biopsies from IgAN patients (n = 19) and from healthy kidney donors (n = 14). Patients were followed for an average time of 4 years and blood pressure was according to target guidelines. Distinct patterns of gene expression were seen in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial cells. Three of the proteoglycans investigated were found to be of special interest and upregulated in glomeruli: perlecan, decorin and biglycan. Perlecan gene expression negatively correlated to albumin excretion and progress of the disease. Abundant decorin protein expression was found in sclerotic glomeruli, but not in unaffected glomeruli from IgAN patients or in controls. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), known to interact with perlecan, decorin and biglycan, were upregulated both on gene and protein level in the glomeruli. This study provides further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in mesangial matrix expansion in IgAN. We conclude that perlecan is a possible prognostic marker for patients with IgAN. In addition, the up-regulation of biglycan and decorin, as well as TGF-β itself, indicate that regulation of TGF-β, and other profibrotic markers plays a role in IgAN pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2005761466,"Background In 2007 WHO issued a guideline to improve the diagnosis of smear-negative and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in HIV-positive patients. This guideline relies heavily on the acceptance of HIV-testing and availability of chest X-rays. Methods and Findings Cohort study of TB suspects in four tuberculosis (TB) clinics in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We assessed the operational performance of the guideline, the incremental yield of investigations, and the diagnostic accuracy for smear-negative tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients using culture positivity as reference standard. 1,147 (68.9%) of 1,665 TB suspects presented with unknown HIV status, 1,124 (98.0%) agreed to be tested, 79 (7.0%) were HIV-positive. Compliance with the guideline for chest X-rays and sputum culture requests was 97.1% and 98.3% respectively. Only 35 of 79 HIV-positive patients (44.3%) with a chest X-ray suggestive of TB started TB treatment within 10 days. 105 of 442 HIV-positive TB suspects started TB treatment (56.2% smear-negative pulmonary TB (PTB), 28.6% smear-positive PTB, 15.2% EPTB). The median time to TB treatment initiation was 5 days (IQR: 2–13 days), ranging from 2 days (IQR: 1–11.5 days) for EPTB, over 2.5 days (IQR: 1–4 days) for smear-positive PTB to 9 days (IQR: 3–17 days) for smear-negative PTB. Among the 34 smear-negative TB patients with a confirmed diagnosis, the incremental yield of chest X-ray, clinical suspicion or abdominal ultrasound, and culture was 41.2%, 17.6% and 41.2% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm to diagnose smear-negative TB in HIV-positive TB suspects was 58.8% (95%CI: 42.2%–73.6%) and 79.4% (95%CI: 74.8%–82.4%) respectively. Conclusions Pending point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests for TB disease, diagnostic algorithms are needed. The diagnostic accuracy of the 2007 WHO guideline to diagnose smear-negative TB is acceptable. There is, however, reluctance to comply with the guideline in terms of immediate treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1971374042,"Background Large scale and individual genetic studies have suggested numerous susceptible genes for depression in the past decade without conclusive results. There is a strong need to review and integrate multi-dimensional data for follow up validation. The present study aimed to apply prioritization procedures to build-up an evidence-based candidate genes dataset for depression. Methods Depression candidate genes were collected in human and animal studies across various data resources. Each gene was scored according to its magnitude of evidence related to depression and was multiplied by a source-specific weight to form a combined score measure. All genes were evaluated through a prioritization system to obtain an optimal weight matrix to rank their relative importance with depression using the combined scores. The resulting candidate gene list for depression (DEPgenes) was further evaluated by a genome-wide association (GWA) dataset and microarray gene expression in human tissues. Results A total of 5,055 candidate genes (4,850 genes from human and 387 genes from animal studies with 182 being overlapped) were included from seven data sources. Through the prioritization procedures, we identified 169 DEPgenes, which exhibited high chance to be associated with depression in GWA dataset (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.00005). Additionally, the DEPgenes had a higher percentage to express in human brain or nerve related tissues than non-DEPgenes, supporting the neurotransmitter and neuroplasticity theories in depression. Conclusions With comprehensive data collection and curation and an application of integrative approach, we successfully generated DEPgenes through an effective gene prioritization system. The prioritized DEPgenes are promising for future biological experiments or replication efforts to discoverthe underlying molecular mechanisms for depression."
https://openalex.org/W2059505398,"Clearance of apoptotic cells is of key importance during development, tissue homeostasis and wound healing in multi-cellular animals. Genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a set of genes involved in the early steps of cell clearance, in particular the recognition and internalization of apoptotic cells. A pathway that orchestrates the maturation of phagosomes containing ingested apoptotic cells in the worm has recently been described. However, many steps in this pathway remain elusive. Here we show that the C. elegans SNX9-family member LST-4 (lateral signaling target) and its closest mammalian orthologue SNX33 play an evolutionary conserved role during apoptotic cell corpse clearance. In lst-4 deficient worms, internalized apoptotic cells accumulated within non-acidified, DYN-1-positive but RAB-5-negative phagosomes. Genetically, we show that LST-4 functions at the same step as DYN-1 during corpse removal, upstream of the GTPase RAB-5. We further show that mammalian SNX33 rescue C. elegans lst-4 mutants and that overexpression of truncated SNX33 fragments interfered with phagosome maturation in a mammalian cell system. Taken together, our genetic and cell biological analyses suggest that LST-4 is recruited through a combined activity of DYN-1 and VPS-34 to the early phagosome membrane, where it cooperates with DYN-1 to promote recruitment/retention of RAB-5 on the early phagosomal membrane during cell corpse clearance. The functional conservation between LST-4 and SNX33 indicate that these early steps of apoptotic phagosome maturation are likely conserved through evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1974211332,"Events encoded in separate sensory modalities, such as audition and vision, can seem to be synchronous across a relatively broad range of physical timing differences. This may suggest that the precision of audio-visual timing judgments is inherently poor. Here we show that this is not necessarily true. We contrast timing sensitivity for isolated streams of audio and visual speech, and for streams of audio and visual speech accompanied by additional, temporally offset, visual speech streams. We find that the precision with which synchronous streams of audio and visual speech are identified is enhanced by the presence of additional streams of asynchronous visual speech. Our data suggest that timing perception is shaped by selective grouping processes, which can result in enhanced precision in temporally cluttered environments. The imprecision suggested by previous studies might therefore be a consequence of examining isolated pairs of audio and visual events. We argue that when an isolated pair of cross-modal events is presented, they tend to group perceptually and to seem synchronous as a consequence. We have revealed greater precision by providing multiple visual signals, possibly allowing a single auditory speech stream to group selectively with the most synchronous visual candidate. The grouping processes we have identified might be important in daily life, such as when we attempt to follow a conversation in a crowded room."
https://openalex.org/W2072887413,"Background Assortative mating can help explain how genetic variation for male quality is maintained even in highly polygynous species. Here, we present a longitudinal study examining how female and male ages, as well as male social dominance, affect assortative mating in fallow deer (Dama dama) over 10 years. Assortative mating could help explain the substantial proportion of females that do not mate with prime-aged, high ranking males, despite very high mating skew. We investigated the temporal pattern of female and male matings, and the relationship between female age and the age and dominance of their mates. Results The peak of yearling female matings was four days later than the peak for older females. Younger females, and especially yearlings, mated with younger and lower-ranking males than older females. Similarly, young males and lower-ranking males mated with younger females than older males and higher-ranking males. Furthermore, the timing of matings by young males coincided with the peak of yearling female matings, whereas the timing of older male matings (irrespective of rank) coincided with the peak of older female matings. Conclusions Assortative mating, through a combination of indirect and/or direct female mate choice, can help explain the persistence of genetic variation for male traits associated with reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W2094876429,"The body schema is an action-related representation of the body that arises from activity in a network of multiple brain areas. While it was initially thought that the body schema developed with experience, the existence of phantom limbs in individuals born without a limb (amelics) led to the suggestion that it was innate. The problem with this idea, however, is that the vast majority of amelics do not report the presence of a phantom limb. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) of traumatic amputees can evoke movement sensations in the phantom, suggesting that traumatic amputation does not delete movement representations of the missing hand. Given this, we asked whether the absence of a phantom limb in the majority of amelics means that the motor cortex does not contain a cortical representation of the missing limb, or whether it is present but has been deactivated by the lack of sensorimotor experience. In four upper-limb amelic subjects we directly stimulated the arm/hand region of M1 to see 1) whether we could evoke phantom sensations, and 2) whether muscle representations in the two cortices were organised asymmetrically. TMS applied over the motor cortex contralateral to the missing limb evoked contractions in stump muscles but did not evoke phantom movement sensations. The location and extent of muscle maps varied between hemispheres but did not reveal any systematic asymmetries. In contrast, forearm muscle thresholds were always higher for the missing limb side. We suggest that phantom movement sensations reported by some upper limb amelics are mostly driven by vision and not by the persistence of motor commands to the missing limb within the sensorimotor cortex. We propose that prewired movement representations of a limb need the experience of movement to be expressed within the primary motor cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2080271384,"Background The aim was to evaluate the readability of research information leaflets (RIL) for minors asked to participate in biomedical research studies and to assess the factors influencing this readability. Methods and Findings All the pediatric protocols from three French pediatric clinical research units were included (N = 104). Three criteria were used to evaluate readability: length of the text, Flesch's readability score and presence of illustrations. We compared the readability of RIL to texts specifically written for children (school textbooks, school exams or extracts from literary works). We assessed the effect of protocol characteristics on readability. The RIL had a median length of 608 words [350 words, 25th percentile; 1005 words, 75th percentile], corresponding to two pages. The readability of the RIL, with a median Flesch score of 40 [30; 47], was much poorer than that of pediatric reference texts, with a Flesch score of 67 [60; 73]. A small proportion of RIL (13/91; 14%) were illustrated. The RIL were longer (p<0.001), more readable (p<0.001) and more likely to be illustrated (p<0.009) for industrial than for institutional sponsors. Conclusion Researchers should routinely compute the reading ease of study information sheets and make greater efforts to improve the readability of written documents for potential participants."
https://openalex.org/W1986763737,"Cooperation is indispensable in human societies, and much progress has been made towards understanding human pro-social decisions. Formal incentives, such as punishment, are suggested as potential effective approaches despite the fact that punishment can crowd out intrinsic motives for cooperation and detrimentally impact efficiency. At the same time, evolutionary biologists have long recognized that cooperation, especially food sharing, is typically efficiently organized in groups living on wild foods, even absent formal economic incentives. Despite its evident importance, the source of this voluntary compliance remains largely uninformed. Drawing on costly signaling theory, and in light of the widely established competitive nature of males, we hypothesize that unique and displayable rewards (trophies) out of competition may trigger male generosity in competitive social environments.Here, we use a controlled laboratory experiment to show that cooperation is sustained in a generosity competition with trophy rewards, but breaks down in the same environment with equally valuable but non-unique and non-displayable rewards. Further, we find that males' competition for trophies is the driving force behind treatment differences. In contrast, it appears that female competitiveness is not modulated by trophy rewards.Our results suggest new approaches to promoting cooperation in human groups that, unlike punishment mechanisms, do not sacrifice efficiency. This could have important implications in any domain where voluntary compliance matters--including relations between spouses, employers and employees, market transactions, and conformity to legal standards."
https://openalex.org/W2058248090,"There is conclusive evidence that there are fitness costs of plant defense and that herbivores can drive selection for defense. However, most work has focused on above-ground interactions, even though belowground herbivory may have greater impacts on individual plants than above-ground herbivory. Given the role of belowground plant structures in resource acquisition and storage, research on belowground herbivores has much to contribute to theories on the evolution of plant defense. Pocket gophers (Geomyidae) provide an excellent opportunity to study root herbivory. These subterranean rodents spend their entire lives belowground and specialize on consuming belowground plant parts.We compared the root defenses of native forbs from mainland populations (with a history of gopher herbivory) to island populations (free from gophers for up to 500,000 years). Defense includes both resistance against herbivores and tolerance of herbivore damage. We used three approaches to compare these traits in island and mainland populations of two native California forbs: 1) Eschscholzia californica populations were assayed to compare alkaloid deterrents, 2) captive gophers were used to test the palatability of E. californica roots and 3) simulated root herbivory assessed tolerance to root damage in Deinandra fasciculata and E. californica. Mainland forms of E. californica contained 2.5 times greater concentration of alkaloids and were less palatable to gophers than island forms. Mainland forms of D. fasciculata and, to a lesser extent, E. californica were also more tolerant of root damage than island conspecifics. Interestingly, undamaged island individuals of D. fasciculata produced significantly more fruit than either damaged or undamaged mainland individuals.These results suggest that mainland plants are effective at deterring and tolerating pocket gopher herbivory. Results also suggest that both forms of defense are costly to fitness and thus reduced in the absence of the putative target herbivore."

Despite huge efforts seeking for speciation-related incompatibilities in the past several decades, a general understanding of how genetic incompatibility evolves in affecting hybrid fitness is not available, primarily due to the fact that the number of known incompatibilities is small. Instead of further mapping specific incompatible genes, in this paper we aimed to know the overall effects of incompatibility on fertility and viability, the two aspects of fitness, by examining 89 gametes produced by yeast S. cerevisiae - S. paradoxus F1 hybrids. Homozygous F2 hybrids formed by autodiploidization of F1 gametes were subject to tests for growth rate and sporulation efficiency. We observed much stronger defects in sporulation than in clonal growth for every single F2 hybrid strain, indicating that genetic incompatibility affects hybrid fertility more than hybrid viability in yeast. We related this finding in part to the fast-evolving nature of meiosis-related genes, and proposed that the generally low expression levels of these genes might be a cause of the observation."
https://openalex.org/W2065832147,"We describe the design and synthesis of a new Tc-99m labeled bioconjugate for imaging activated complement, based on Short Consensus Repeats 1 and 2 of Complement Receptor 2 (CR2), the binding domain for C3d. To avoid non specific modification of CR2 and the potential for modifying lysine residues critical to the CR2/C3d contact surface, we engineered a new protein, recombinant CR2 (rCR2), to include the C-terminal sequence VFPLECHHHHHH, a hexahistidine tag (for site-specific radiolabeling with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+). The protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. To test the function of the recombinant CR2, binding to C3d was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The function was further confirmed by binding of rCR2 to C3d+ red blood cells (RBC) which were generated by deposition of human or rat C3d and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The affinity of rCR2 for C3d+, in presence of 150 mM NaCl, was measured using surface plasma resonance giving rise to a KD≈500 nM. Radiolabeling of rCR2 or an inactive mutant of rCR2 (K41E CR2) or an unrelated protein of a similar size (C2A) with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+ at gave radiochemical yields >95%. Site-specifically radiolabeled rCR2 bound to C3d to C3d+ RBC. Binding of radiolabeled rCR2 to C3d was inhibited by anti-C3d and the radiolabeled inactive mutant K41E CR2 and C2A did not bind to C3d+ RBCs. We conclude that rCR2-Tc99m has excellent radiolabeling, stability and C3d binding characteristics and warrants in vivo evaluation as an activated complement imaging agent."

https://openalex.org/W2135466166,"Periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) in the USA are divided into three species groups (-decim, -cassini, -decula) of similar but distinct morphology and behavior. Each group contains at least one species with a 17-year life cycle and one with a 13-year cycle; each species is most closely related to one with the other cycle. One explanation for the apparent polyphyly of 13- and 17-year life cycles is that populations switch between the two cycles. Using a numerical model, we test the general feasibility of life cycle switching by the introduction of alleles for one cycle into populations of the other cycle. Our results suggest that fitness reductions at low population densities of mating individuals (the Allee effect) could play a role in life cycle switching. In our model, if the 13-year cycle is genetically dominant, a 17-year cycle population will switch to a 13-year cycle given the introduction of a few 13-year cycle alleles under a moderate Allee effect. We also show that under a weak Allee effect, different year-classes (""broods"") with 17-year life cycles can be generated. Remarkably, the outcomes of our models depend only on the dominance relationships of the cycle alleles, irrespective of any fitness advantages."

Lysed cell RNA was used for real-time PCR, protein was used for Western blot analysis and TG-2 transamidase activity was measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was done to determine the expression of TGases.Immunohistochemistry and western blot confirmed the expression of TGs-1, 2, 3 and 5 proteins in cultured SFs and eye tissues. Real time PCR showed TG-1, 2, 5 transcript levels to be down regulated 3 fold (p<0.05) in cultured human and mouse SFs after incubation with atropine and this was reversed by carbachol. However, TG-3 expression was increased with atropine and decreased with carbachol at all concentrations. Atropine abrogated the carbachol-induced activation of SF in a dose-dependent manner. TGs-1, 3, 5 were localized in the entire mouse corneal epithelium, stroma and endothelium but TG-2 was present only in the corneal subepithelium and stroma. All TGs were localized in mouse Meibomian glands however TG-2 had a weak expression.Our results confirm that TGs-1, 2, 3 and 5 are expressed in human SF and murine ocular tissues, eyelid and associated Meibomian glands. Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed that muscarinic antagonist down-regulates TGs-1, 2 and 5 in both cultured human and mouse SFs and upregulates TG-3. Atropine abrogated the carbachol-induced activation of SF in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that manipulation of TGs by way of muscarinic receptor acting drugs may be a plausible method of intervention in wound healing and scleral remodeling."

The optimized bSSFP sequence was compared to T1- and T2-weighted spin echo sequences.SNR and CNR increased with flip angle. As bandwidth increased, SNR, CNR and artifacts such as chemical shift decreased. The final optimized sequence was 4 PC, 2 NEX, FA 50°, BW ±62.5 kHz and took 14-26 minutes with 200 µm isotropic resolution. The SNR efficiency of the bSSFP images was higher than for T1WSE and T2WSE. CNR was highest for T1WSE, followed closely by bSSFP, with the T2WSE having the lowest CNR. With the bSSFP images the whole body and organs of interest including renal, iliac, inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes were visible.We were able to obtain fast, high-resolution, high CNR images of the healthy mouse prostate with an optimized bSSFP sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2023840546,"Background Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was recently discovered to be the first human gammaretrovirus that is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer (PC). Although a mechanism for XMRV carcinogenesis is yet to be established, this virus belongs to the family of gammaretroviruses well known for their ability to induce cancer in the infected hosts. Since its original identification XMRV has been detected in several independent investigations; however, at this time significant controversy remains regarding reports of XMRV detection/prevalence in other cohorts and cell type/tissue distribution. The potential risk of human infection, coupled with the lack of knowledge about the basic biology of XMRV, warrants further research, including investigation of adaptive immune responses. To study immunogenicity in vivo, we vaccinated mice with a combination of recombinant vectors expressing codon-optimized sequences of XMRV gag and env genes and virus-like particles (VLP) that had the size and morphology of live infectious XMRV. Results Immunization elicited Env-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against XMRV in mice. The peak titers for ELISA-binding antibodies and NAb were 1∶1024 and 1∶464, respectively; however, high ELISA-binding and NAb titers were not sustained and persisted for less than three weeks after immunizations. Conclusions Vaccine-induced XMRV Env antibody titers were transiently high, but their duration was short. The relatively rapid diminution in antibody levels may in part explain the differing prevalences reported for XMRV in various prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome cohorts. The low level of immunogenicity observed in the present study may be characteristic of a natural XMRV infection in humans."
