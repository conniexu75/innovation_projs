https://openalex.org/W3000852548,"In a magnetic topological insulator, nontrivial band topology conspires with magnetic order to produce exotic states of matter that are best exemplified by quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators and axion insulators. Up till now, such magnetic topological insulators are obtained by doping topological insulators with magnetic atoms. The random magnetic dopants, however, inevitably introduce disorders that hinder further exploration of quantum effects in the material. Here, we resolve this dilemma by probing quantum transport in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin flake - a topological insulator with intrinsic magnetic order. In this layered van der Waals crystal, the ferromagnetic layers couple anti-parallel to each other, so MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is an antiferromagnet. A magnetic field, however, aligns all the layers and induces an interlayer ferromagnetic order; we show that a quantized anomalous Hall response emerges in atomically thin MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ under a moderate magnetic field. MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ therefore becomes the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator exhibiting quantized anomalous Hall effect. The result establishes MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as an ideal arena for further exploring various topological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W3002219094,"Mapping cell fate during hematopoiesis Biologists have long attempted to understand how stem and progenitor cells in regenerating and embryonic tissues differentiate into mature cell types. Through the use of recent technical advances to sequence the genes expressed in thousands of individual cells, differentiation mechanisms are being revealed. Weinreb et al. extended these methods to track clones of cells (cell families) across time. Their approach reveals differences in cellular gene expression as cells progress through hematopoiesis, which is the process of blood production. Using machine learning, they tested how well gene expression measurements account for the choices that cells make. This work reveals that a considerable gap still exists in understanding differentiation mechanisms, and future methods are needed to fully understand—and ultimately control—cell differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W3000984827,"Introduction One-in-three men who have sex with men (MSM) in Uganda have never tested for HIV. Peer-driven HIV testing strategies could increase testing coverage among non-testers. We evaluated the yield of peer distributed HIV self-test kits compared with standard-of-care testing approaches in identifying undiagnosed HIV infection. Methods From June to August 2018, we conducted a pilot study of secondary distribution of HIV self-testing (HIVST) through MSM peer networks at The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) centres in Entebbe and Masaka. Peers were trained in HIVST use and basic HIV counselling. Each peer distributed 10 HIVST kits in one wave to MSM who had not tested in the previous six months. Participants who tested positive were linked by peers to HIV care. The primary outcome was the proportion of undiagnosed HIV infections. Data were analysed descriptively. Results A total of 297 participants were included in the analysis, of whom 150 received HIVST (intervention). The median age of HIVST recipients was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR], 22–28) compared to 28 years IQR (25–35) for 147 MSM tested using standard-of-care (SOC) strategies. One hundred forty-three MSM (95%) completed HIVST, of which 32% had never tested for HIV. A total of 12 participants were newly diagnosed with HIV infection: 8 in the peer HIVST group and 4 in the SOC group [5.6% vs 2.7%, respectively; P = 0.02]. All participants newly diagnosed with HIV infection received confirmatory HIV testing and were initiated on antiretroviral therapy. Conclusion Peer distribution of HIVST through MSM networks is feasible and effective and could diagnose more new HIV infections than SOC approaches. Public health programs should consider scaling up peer-delivered HIVST for MSM."
https://openalex.org/W3002262305,"Mammalian mitochondria assemble four complexes of the respiratory chain (RCI, RCIII, RCIV, and RCV) by combining 13 polypeptides synthesized within mitochondria on mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) with over 70 polypeptides encoded in nuclear DNA, translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and imported into mitochondria. We have previously observed that mitoribosome assembly is inefficient because some mitoribosomal proteins are produced in excess, but whether this is the case for other mitochondrial assemblies such as the RCs is unclear. We report here that pulse-chase stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a valuable technique to study RC assembly because it can reveal considerable differences in the assembly rates and efficiencies of the different complexes. The SILAC analyses of HeLa cells indicated that assembly of RCV, comprising F1/Fo-ATPase, is rapid with little excess subunit synthesis, but that assembly of RCI (i.e. NADH dehydrogenase) is far less efficient, with dramatic oversynthesis of numerous proteins, particularly in the matrix-exposed N and Q domains. Unassembled subunits were generally degraded within 3 h. We also observed differential assembly kinetics for individual complexes that were immunoprecipitated with complex-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody that recognizes the ND1 subunit of RCI co-precipitated a number of proteins implicated in FeS cluster assembly and newly synthesized ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1 (UQCRFS1), the Rieske FeS protein in RCIII, reflecting some coordination between RCI and RCIII assemblies. We propose that pulse-chase SILAC labeling is a useful tool for studying rates of protein complex assembly and degradation."

The Lanzhou lily (Lilium davidii, var. unicolor) is an important medicinal plant with high economic value. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its photosynthetic and antioxidation responses to low temperature still remain poorly understood. This study subjected the Lanzhou lily to the two temperatures of 20°C (control) and 4°C (low temperature) for 24 h. Physiological parameters related to membrane integrity, photosynthesis, antioxidant system, and differentially expressed genes were investigated. Compared with control, low temperature increased the relative electrical conductivity by 43.2%, while it decreased net photosynthesis rate, ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence, and catalase activity by 47.3%, 10.1%, and 11.1%, respectively. In addition, low temperature significantly increased the content of soluble protein, soluble sugar, and proline, as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. Comparative transcriptome profiling showed that a total of 238,109 differentially expressed genes were detected. Among these, 3,566 were significantly upregulated while 2,982 were significantly downregulated in response to low temperature. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that in response to low temperature, the mostly significantly enriched differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in phosphorylation, membrane and protein kinase activity, as well as photosynthesis, light harvesting, light reaction, and alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis also indicated that the most significantly enriched pathways involved ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, phenylalanine metabolism, circadian rhythm, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis of antenna proteins, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Moreover, the expression patterns of 10 randomly selected differentially expressed genes confirmed the RNA-Seq results. These results expand the understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the Lanzhou lily to low temperature stress."

Lifetime effective sun exposure was calculated using Melbourne formula and expressed as quintiles. These were supplemented with physical environmental measurements.Lifetime sun exposure hours, smoking, indoor kitchen smoke exposure and their association with cataract and subtypes. Prevalence of cataract calculated based on lens opacities or evidence of cataract surgery.Cataract was identified in 3231 (33.3%) participants. Prevalence of cataract in males (32.3%) and females (34.1%) was similar. Nuclear cataract was the commonest sub-type identified in 94.7% of affected eyes. Sun exposure had a significant association with cataract with odds ratio (OR) increasing from 1.6 (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: 1.4, 1.9) in 3rd quintile, to 2.6 (CI: 2.2, 3.1) in 4th quintile and 9.4 (CI: 7.9, 11.2) in 5th quintile (p<0.0001). Cataract also showed a significant association with smoking (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.2, 1.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.0-1.4). Nuclear cataract showed a positive association with increasing sun exposure in 3rd (β coefficient 0.5, CI:0.2-0.7), 4th (β: 0.9, CI: 0.7-1.1) and 5th (β: 2.1, CI:1.8-2.4) quintiles of sun exposure, smoking (β: 0.4, CI: 0.2-0.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (β: 0.3, CI: 01-0.5) while cortical cataract showed a positive association with sun exposure only in 5th quintile (β: 2.6, CI:1.0-4.2). Posterior subcapsular cataract was not associated with any of the risk factors.Cataract is associated with increasing level of sun exposure, smoking and exposure to indoor kitchen smoke."
https://openalex.org/W3000888090,"Background Experimental and clinical studies suggested an analgesic effect on chronic pain by motor cortex activation. The present study explored the complex mechanisms of interaction between motor and pain during performing the slow and fast finger tapping task alone and in concomitant with nociceptive laser stimulation. Method The participants were 38 patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and 21 healthy subjects. We used a simultaneous multimodal method of laser-evoked potentials and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate metabolic and electrical changes during the finger tapping task and concomitant noxious laser stimulation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a portable and optical method to detect cortical metabolic changes. Laser-evoked potentials are a suitable tool to study the nociceptive pathways function. Results We found a reduced tone of cortical motor areas in patients with FM compared to controls, especially during the fast finger tapping task. FM patients presented a slow motor performance in all the experimental conditions, requesting rapid movements. The amplitude of laser evoked potentials was different between patients and controls, in each experimental condition, as patients showed smaller evoked responses compared to controls. Concurrent phasic pain stimulation had a low effect on motor cortex metabolism in both groups nor motor activity changed laser evoked responses in a relevant way. There were no correlations between Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FNIRS) and clinical features in FM patients. Conclusion Our findings indicated that a low tone of motor cortex activation could be an intrinsic feature in FM and generate a scarce modulation on pain condition. A simple and repetitive movement such as that of the finger tapping task seems inefficacious in modulating cortical responses to pain both in patients and controls. The complex mechanisms of interaction between networks involved in pain control and motor function require further studies for the important role they play in structuring rehabilitation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3002347697,"Engineering and bioconjugation of proteins is a critically valuable tool that can facilitate a wide range of biophysical and structural studies. The ability to orthogonally tag or label a domain within a multidomain protein may be complicated by undesirable side reactions to noninvolved domains. Furthermore, the advantages of segmental (or domain-specific) isotopic labeling for NMR, or deuteration for neutron scattering or diffraction, can be realized by an efficient ligation procedure. Common methods—expressed protein ligation, protein trans-splicing, and native chemical ligation—each have specific limitations. Here, we evaluated the use of different variants of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A for a range of ligation reactions and demonstrate that conditions can readily be optimized to yield high efficiency (i.e. completeness of ligation), ease of purification, and functionality in detergents. These properties may enable joining of single domains into multidomain proteins, lipidation to mimic posttranslational modifications, and formation of cyclic proteins to aid in the development of nanodisc membrane mimetics. We anticipate that the method for ligating separate domains into a single functional multidomain protein reported here may enable many applications in structural biology."

In the mouse retina, we find that LRRTM4 is enriched at GABAergic synapses on axon terminals of rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Knockout of LRRTM4 reduces RBC axonal GABAA and GABAC receptor clustering and disrupts presynaptic inhibition onto RBC terminals. LRRTM4 removal also perturbs the stereotyped output synapse arrangement at RBC terminals. Synaptic ribbons are normally apposed to two distinct postsynaptic “dyad” partners, but in the absence of LRRTM4, “monad” and “triad” arrangements are also formed. RBCs from retinas deficient in GABA release also demonstrate dyad mis-arrangements but maintain LRRTM4 expression, suggesting that defects in dyad organization in the LRRTM4 knockout could originate from reduced GABA receptor function.

Efficient information transfer in the CNS relies on precise partnerships between transsynaptic adhesion proteins, which regulate multiple aspects of synaptic development and function (Dalva et al., 2007Dalva M.B.

Given that RBCs lack AMPA receptors, we wondered how LRRTM4 may function at RBC synapses. Using light and serial electron microscopy (EM) together with electrophysiology, we discovered an unexpected role of LRRTM4 for the organization of inhibitory synapses mediating presynaptic inhibition and the assembly of RBC ribbon synapses. We used an LRRTM4-specific antibody (Siddiqui et al., 2013Siddiqui T.J. Tari P.K. Connor S.A. Zhang P. Dobie F.A. She K. Kawabe H. Wang Y.T. Brose N. Craig A.M.

We were particularly interested in RBCs because they show enrichment of both LRRTM4 mRNA (Shekhar et al., 2016Shekhar K. Lapan S.W. Whitney I.E. Tran N.M. Macosko E.Z. Kowalczyk M. Adiconis X.

We immunolabeled LRRTM4 and the RBC-specific protein kinase C (PKC) in retinas from Grm6-tdtomato mice (Kerschensteiner et al., 2009Kerschensteiner D. Morgan J.L. Parker E.D. Lewis R.M. Wong R.O.

LRRTM4 immunoreactivity associated with RBC and ON CBC terminals was isolated by analyses of 3D confocal image stacks (see STAR Methods). We found LRRTM4 to be localized predominantly at RBC terminals (Figure 1C), with little LRRTM4 signal at ON CBC terminals (e.g., type 6 axons) (Figure 1C). The enrichment of LRRTM4 at RBC terminals is consistent with previous gene expression studies (Shekhar et al., 2016Shekhar K. Lapan S.W. Whitney I.E. Tran N.M. Macosko E.Z. Kowalczyk M. Adiconis X.

Rep. 2018; 8: 5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine whether LRRTM4 was localized at GABAergic synapses on RBC axons, we used Ai9/slc6a5-cre mice to visualize a subset of A17 amacrines. Presynaptic amacrine boutons surrounding RBC terminals contain vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) (Schubert et al., 2013Schubert T. Hoon M. Euler T. Lukasiewicz P.D. Wong R.O. Developmental regulation and activity-dependent maintenance of GABAergic presynaptic inhibition onto rod bipolar cell axonal terminals.Neuron. 2013; 78: 124-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We found LRRTM4 signal at RBC terminals apposed to VIAAT-positive A17 boutons (Figure 1D). Previous studies show that there are three distinct GABA receptor (GABAR) postsynaptic sites at RBC terminals containing GABAAα1R, GABAAα3R, or GABACR (Fletcher et al., 1998Fletcher E.L. Koulen P. Wässle H. GABAA and GABAC receptors on mammalian rod bipolar cells.J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 396: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Schubert et al., 2013Schubert T. Hoon M. Euler T.

Developmental regulation and activity-dependent maintenance of GABAergic presynaptic inhibition onto rod bipolar cell axonal terminals.Neuron. 2013; 78: 124-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we refer to each of these postsynaptic sites as distinct synapses. LRRTM4 puncta colocalized with GABAAα1R puncta (Figure 1E) at RBC terminals, confirming that LRRTM4 is present at GABAergic synapses. LRRTM4, however, did not colocalize with the small fraction of GABAAα3R present on RBC terminals (Figure 1E; and see Schubert et al., 2013Schubert T. Hoon M. Euler T. Lukasiewicz P.D. Wong R.O. Developmental regulation and activity-dependent maintenance of GABAergic presynaptic inhibition onto rod bipolar cell axonal terminals.Neuron. 2013; 78: 124-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Direct colocalization between LRRTM4 and GABACR could not be assessed, because both antibodies were raised in the same species. However, LRRTM4 puncta at RBC terminals not colocalized with GABAAα1 are likely localized at GABAC synapses. Because LRRTM4 is associated with glutamatergic synapses in the cortex and hippocampus (de Wit et al., 2013de Wit J. O’Sullivan M.L. Savas J.N. Condomitti G. Caccese M.C. Vennekens K.M.

Choi T.Y. Kang H. Cho Y.S. Choii G. Uvarov P. Park D. Jeong D. Jeon S. Lee D. et al.LRRTM3 regulates excitatory synapse development through alternative splicing and neurexin binding.Cell Rep. 2016; 14: 808-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we next probed which LRRTM4 isoform is primarily expressed in the mouse retina. Previous studies have shown the presence of the long LRRTM4 isoform in monkey and mouse retina (Kawamura et al., 2018Kawamura Y. Suga A. Fujimaki T. Yoshitake K. Tsunoda K. Murakami A. Iwata T. LRRTM4-C538Y novel gene mutation is associated with hereditary macular degeneration with novel dysfunction of ON-type bipolar cells.J. Hum. Genet. 2018; 63: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We thus performed real-time quantitative PCR from wild-type mouse retinal homogenates and found that like the rest of the brain, the short isoform of LRRTM4 is enriched in the retina relative to the long isoform (Figure S1). To determine whether LRRTM4 regulates GABAergic synapse assembly at RBC terminals, we compared the expression of GABAAα1R and GABACR on RBC terminals in retinas from LRRTM4 knockout (KO) animals with that of littermate controls. Immunofluorescence for both GABAAα1R and GABACR was remarkably downregulated in LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals (Figure 2A). As a control, the retinas were co-labeled with the ribbon marker, C-terminal binding protein-2 (CtBP2; Schmitz et al., 2000Schmitz F. Königstorfer A. Südhof T.C. RIBEYE, a component of synaptic ribbons: a protein’s journey through evolution provides insight into synaptic ribbon function.Neuron. 2000; 28: 857-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar); the expression of CtBP2 within RBC terminals was comparable between genotypes (Figure 2A). We determined percent volume occupancy as a measure of receptor expression (see Hoon et al., 2017bHoon M. Sinha R. Okawa H. Using fluorescent markers to estimate synaptic connectivity in situ.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1538: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The volume occupancies of both GABAAα1 and GABAC, but not CtBP2, were significantly reduced in LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals compared to control (Figure 2C). Perhaps not surprisingly, GABAAα3 expression within RBC terminals did not vary across genotypes (Figure S2). Thus, loss of LRRTM4 specifically reduced the expression of GABAAα1 and GABACRs at RBC terminals. During development, GABAAα1R expression at RBC terminals increases from approximately postnatal day 12 (P12; 2 days before eye-opening) and GABACR expression increases between P16 and P30 (Hoon et al., 2015Hoon M. Sinha R. Okawa H. Suzuki S.C. Hirano A.A. Brecha N. Rieke F. Wong R.O. Neurotransmission plays contrasting roles in the maturation of inhibitory synapses on axons and dendrites of retinal bipolar cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 12840-12845Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine if LRRTM4 deficiency impairs the formation of GABAR clusters on RBC boutons, we quantified GABAAα1 and GABAC expression within P12 LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals (Figures 2B and 2C). GABAAα1, but not GABAC, expression was significantly reduced in P12 LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals (Figure 2C). However, GABACR expression of P21 LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals was significantly reduced compared to control (P21 control RBC GABAC percent occupancy = 4.12 ± 0.59; P21 LRRTM4 KO RBC GABAC percent occupancy = 0.59 ± 0.11; p = 0.000046; N = 8 RBCs per genotype; 2 littermate control-KO animal pairs). These observations indicate that LRRTM4 equips GABAA and GABAC synapses across RBC terminals with adequate receptor amounts during assembly of these synapses. To determine whether the changes in GABARs correspond to a loss in function, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from RBCs and recorded the responses elicited by puffing GABA on RBC terminals (Figure 2D). After recording a GABA-evoked inhibitory current, we applied a GABACR antagonist (TPMPA) followed by a GABAAR antagonist (GABAzine) to distinguish the GABAA- and GABAC-mediated components of the evoked current (Figures S3A and 2D). The total GABA-evoked response and the GABAA and the GABAC components were all significantly reduced in RBCs from adult LRRTM4 KO retinas compared to controls (Figure 2D), corroborating the reduction in GABAR expression across LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals (Figure 2A). In P12 retinas, the net GABA-evoked response and the GABAA component were significantly reduced in LRRTM4 KO (Figure 2D), corroborating the immunolabeling data (Figures 2B and 2C). Because LRRTM4 deficiency disrupts GABAR clustering across RBC terminals, we next determined the functional consequences of LRRTM4 deficiency on reciprocal feedback received by RBCs and on retinal output (spiking responses of output ganglion cells [GCs]; Figure 1A). The amplitude of the A17-mediated feedback current (Chávez et al., 2006Chávez A.E. Singer J.H. Diamond J.S.

To probe retinal output, we measured light-evoked spike responses from ON alpha GCs (a well-characterized GC that receives rod signals; Grimes et al., 2014Grimes W.N. Schwartz G.W. Rieke F.

Figure 2F plots the spike responses of ON alpha GCs in LRRTM4 KO retina to 10 ms light flashes of increasing intensity. Interestingly, under these dim-light conditions that predominantly activate the rod pathway, the GC responses were nearly identical for the dimmest flashes in both LRRTM4 KO and control retinas but were significantly weaker in LRRTM4 KO retina at higher flash strengths of >1 R∗/rod/flash. This suggests that the absence of LRRTM4 impairs transmission of visual signals under dim-light conditions, when the RBC synapse is being strongly activated. Previous studies reveal some LRRTM4 expression in the outer plexiform layer of the retina (Woods et al., 2018Woods S.M. Mountjoy E. Muir D. Ross S.E. Atan D. A comparative analysis of rod bipolar cell transcriptomes identifies novel genes implicated in night vision.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 5506Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), where photoreceptors synapse onto BC dendrites. We measured light-evoked excitatory synaptic input onto RBCs in LRRTM4 KO and littermate control retinas (Figures S3B and S3C) to test transmission at the rod→RBC synapse. Responses of RBCs to increasing light intensity were comparable across genotypes (Figure S3C) indicating that the effects of LRRTM4 deletion on RBCs are largely restricted to the axonal compartment. The reduced expression of GABAAR and GABACR on LRRTM4 KO RBC terminals could result from a reduction in the total number of inhibitory synapses on the RBC terminal, or from fewer GABARs at each synapse. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared synapse arrangements of RBC terminals in LRRTM4 KO and littermate control retinas using serial block face scanning EM (SBFSEM). Synaptic ribbons in RBC axon terminals are sites of glutamate release onto processes of A17 and AII postsynaptic partners at a junction called the dyad (Figure 3A). In addition to reciprocal feedback inhibition by A17 amacrines onto the RBC terminal at synaptic dyads (Figures 1A and 3A; Chávez et al., 2010Chávez A.E. Grimes W.N. Diamond J.S.

https://openalex.org/W3001466010,"Anaemia in pregnancy is a major health problem and an important cause of adverse foetomaternal outcomes in developing countries. Iron deficiency is the cause of the overwhelming majority of the cases of anaemia in pregnancy. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) has been linked with adverse foetal and maternal outcomes. This study investigated the prevalence of IDA and evaluated its effects on foetomaternal outcomes among parturients in Lagos, Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 220 women aged 15–49 years with singleton gestation at term, between May 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017. Participants were selected by systematic sampling and baseline data were collected through interviews. Venous blood samples were obtained to measure haemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations, and the associations between IDA (defined as anaemia and iron deficiency) and pregnancy outcomes were examined. A P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The prevalence of IDA was 12.3%. Routine antenatal iron supplementation (adjusted odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.07–0.46; P = 0.001) and interpregnancy interval of at least 2 years (adjusted odds ratio 0.20, 95% confidence interval 0.05–0.97; P = 0.021) have significant association with IDA. Iron deficiency anaemia was not significantly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes but there were significant associations with increased risk of blood transfusion (P = 0.001) and maternal infectious morbidities such as puerperal pyrexia (P = 0.041) and wound infection (P = 0.020). IDA is still a fairly common condition among parturients in Lagos and it’s mostly associated with maternal peripartum morbidities. Adequate pregnancy spacing through the use of effective contraception and routine antenatal iron supplementations in pregnancy is a recommended preventive measure against IDA and its adverse sequelae. Future studies should adopt the use of transferrin saturation (TSAT) in compliment with serum ferritin assay as a more sensitive marker of iron deficiency."

We investigated a suspected outbreak to determine the magnitude of cases, characterize the cases and identify risk factors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Gilgil, a peri-urban settlement in Central Kenya.Hospital records for the period 2010-2016 were reviewed and additional cases were identified through active case search. Clinical diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis was made based on presence of ulcerative, nodular or papular skin lesion. The study enrolled 58 cases matched by age and neighbourhood to 116 controls in a case control study. Data was collected using structured questionnaires and simple proportions, means and medians were computed, and logistic regression models were constructed for analysis of individual, indoor and outdoor risk factors.Of the 255 suspected cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis identified, females constituted 56% (142/255) and the median age was 7 years (IQR 7-21). Cases occurred in clusters and up to 43% of cases originated from Gitare (73/255) and Kambi-Turkana (36/255) villages. A continuous transmission pattern was depicted throughout the period under review. Individual risk factors included staying outside the residence in the evening after sunset (OR 4.1, CI 1.2-16.2) and visiting forests (OR 4.56, CI 2.04-10.22). Sharing residence with a case (OR 14.4, CI 3.8-79.3), residing in a thatched house (OR 7.9, CI 1.9-45.7) and cracked walls (OR 2.3, CI 1.0-4.9) were identified among indoor factors while sighting rock hyraxes near residence (OR 5.3, CI 2.2-12.7), residing near a forest (OR 7.8, CI 2.8-26.4) and having a close neighbour with cutaneous leishmaniasis (OR 6.8, CI 2.8-16.0) were identified among outdoor factors.We identify a large burden of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Gilgil with evidence of individual, indoor and outdoor factors of disease spread. The role of environmental factors and rodents in disease transmission should be investigated further."

In this study we determined the candidate mechanisms by which metformin lowers glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) in mouse and rat hepatocytes challenged with high glucose or gluconeogenic precursors. Cell metformin loads in the therapeutic range lowered cell G6P but not ATP and decreased G6pc mRNA at high glucose. The G6P lowering by metformin was mimicked by a complex 1 inhibitor (rotenone) and an uncoupler (dinitrophenol) and by overexpression of mGPDH, which lowers glycerol 3-phosphate and G6P and also mimics the G6pc repression by metformin. In contrast, direct allosteric activators of AMPK (A-769662, 991, and C-13) had opposite effects from metformin on glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and cell G6P. The G6P lowering by metformin, which also occurs in hepatocytes from AMPK knockout mice, is best explained by allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and/or fructose bisphosphatase-1, as supported by increased metabolism of [3-3H]glucose relative to [2-3H]glucose; by an increase in the lactate m2/m1 isotopolog ratio from [1,2-13C2]glucose; by lowering of glycerol 3-phosphate an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1; and by marked G6P elevation by selective inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1; but not by a more reduced cytoplasmic NADH/NAD redox state.

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed drug for lowering blood glucose in type 2 diabetes. Its therapeutic effect involves inhibition of glucose absorption by the gut and inhibition of glucose production by the liver (1Bailey C.J. Metformin: historical overview.Diabetologia. 2017; 60 (28776081): 1566-157610.1007/s00125-017-4318-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Evidence for the latter mechanism in man is largely derived from chronic studies demonstrating efficacy after 2–26 weeks therapy (2Natali A. Ferrannini E.

Throughout this study on rat and mouse hepatocytes, we used a protocol comprising a 2-h preincubation with metformin followed by a 1-h incubation with medium containing the substrates and the same metformin concentration as during the preincubation. Using this protocol, the cell metformin content at the end of the 3-h incubation with 100–200 μm metformin is 1–2 nmol/mg in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 1A). This corresponds to an intracellular/extracellular metformin concentration ratio of ∼5 (Fig. 1B). These data on mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 1, A and B) are similar to data on rat hepatocytes reported previously (18Al-Oanzi Z.H. Fountana S. Moonira T. Tudhope S.J. Petrie J.L. Alshawi A. Patman G.

We determined the effects of metformin on cell G6P in rat or mouse hepatocytes incubated with either high glucose (25 mm) or with dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which enters the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway at the level of triose phosphates, or with xylitol, which enters the pathway at triose phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate (23Cook D.E.

Metformin did not lower G6P in hepatocytes incubated with 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1C), but it lowered G6P dose-dependently in rat or mouse hepatocytes with 25 mm glucose (Fig. 1, D and E) and caused a greater fractional lowering when G6P was elevated by S4048 (Fig. 1, F and G). Similarly metformin lowered G6P with both DHA (Fig. 1H) and xylitol (Fig. 1I). Cell ATP was decreased by 1 mm metformin but not by ≤0.5 mm metformin (Fig. 1, J–N). We next tested whether direct activators of AMPK (A-769662, 991, and C-13) mimic the metformin lowering of G6P with high glucose or DHA (Fig. 2). A-769662 and compound 991 bind to a discrete pocket between the α and β subunits of AMPK (27Cool B. Zinker B. Chiou W. Kifle L. Cao N. Perham M. Dickinson R. Adler A. Gagne G. Iyengar R. Zhao G.

A-769662 (20 μm) caused similar phosphorylation of the AMPK target acetyl-CoA carboxylase–S79 as 500 μm metformin (Fig. 2A), and C-13 and 991 at 3 μm caused comparable phosphorylation as 20 μm A-769662 (Fig. 2B). With 25 mm glucose, A-769662 increased G6P, 991 had no effect, and C-13 caused a modest decrease compared with metformin (Fig. 2C) with negligible effect on ATP (Fig. 2D) but with significant inhibition in the production of lactate and pyruvate unlike metformin (Fig. 2E). With DHA, the AMPK activators unlike metformin significantly raised G6P (Fig. 2F), with little effect on ATP (Fig. 2G), and A-769662 and C-13 also increased glucose production (Fig. 2H). This indicates opposite effects of AMPK activators from metformin on glycolysis with high glucose and on gluconeogenesis from DHA and shows that the AMPK activators do not mimic the G6P lowering by metformin. We next tested whether A-769662 mimics metformin (≥0.2 mm) on gene regulation at high glucose. For these experiments, we used 45 mm glucose to achieve G6P levels intermediate between 25 mm glucose alone and 25 mm glucose + S4048. High glucose caused repression of Gck (by 60%) and induction of G6pc and Pklr by 5- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, I–K). A-769662 caused similar Pklr repression as high metformin (Fig. 2K) but did not mimic the effect of 0.2 mm metformin on either Gck or G6pc expression (Fig. 2, I and J). This implicates AMPK-independent mechanisms for the counter-regulatory effects of low metformin on G6pc and Gck expression. To test for involvement of AMPK in the metformin mechanism on G6P, we used hepatocytes from liver-specific AMPKα1α2 knockout mice. We confirmed the lack of immunoactivity to AMPKα in hepatocytes from AMPKα1lox/lox,α2lox/lox–Alfp–Cre (AMPK-KO) compared with the AMPKα1lox/lox,α2lox/lox (AMPKlox/lox) controls (Fig. 3A) and also a lack of immunoactivity to phospho-AMPKα after challenge with metformin or A-769662 (Fig. 3B). To test whether activation of AMPK by metformin is affected by raised G6P, we compared phospho-AMPK immunoactivity in conditions of low and high G6P with 25 mm glucose + S4048 in control hepatocytes from AMPKlox/lox mice. Phosphorylation of AMPK by high metformin (0.5 mm) and by A-769662 (10 μm) was not attenuated by high glucose + S4048 compared with 5 mm glucose (Fig. 3C). Hepatocytes from AMPK-KO mice had similar levels of cell ATP in control conditions without S4048 with either 25 mm glucose (Fig. 3, D and E) or with 5 mm DHA (Fig. 3, F and G) and similar elevation of G6P with S4048 at 25 mm glucose or DHA (Fig. 3, H–K) as control hepatocytes from AMPKlox/lox mice. The AMPK-KO hepatocytes showed small but significant lowering of ATP with S4048 (Fig. 3, L and M), which is best explained by compromised ATP homeostasis in conditions of raised G6P. Metformin (0.2 and 0.5 mm) caused similar or greater fractional lowering of G6P in AMPK-KO hepatocytes with high glucose + S4048 or with DHA + S4048 as for AMPKlox/lox controls (Fig. 3, N and O). This indicates involvement of AMPK-independent mechanisms in the metformin lowering of G6P. To test for mechanisms linked to mitochondrial function (Fig. 4A), we compared metformin with a complex 1 inhibitor (rotenone), an uncoupler (dinitrophenol (DNP)), and with berberine, which causes mitochondrial depolarization similar to metformin (30Qiu B.Y. Turner N. Li Y.Y. Gu M. Huang M.W. Wu F. Pang T. Nan F.J. Ye J.M. Li J.Y. Li J. High-throughput assay for modulators of mitochondrial membrane potential identifies a novel compound with beneficial effects on db/db mice.Diabetes. 2010; 59 (19833880): 256-26510.2337/db09-0223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rotenone, DNP, and berberine caused comparable lowering of G6P as metformin (Fig. 4B), with negligible effect on ATP (Fig. 4C). To test whether the metformin mechanism is similar to that of rotenone or the uncoupler, we determined the metabolism of [U-14C]glucose to 14CO2 as a measure of mitochondrial oxidation (Fig. 4D). Glucose oxidation was inhibited by rotenone, as expected for a complex I inhibitor, which promotes an increase in NADH/NAD ratio, and it was stimulated with DNP, consistent with dissipation of the proton gradient and increased electron transport. Metformin inhibited glucose oxidation at 500 μm (Fig. 4D), consistent with inhibition of complex I at this concentration (31Alshawi A. Agius L. Low metformin causes a more oxidized mitochondrial NADH/NAD redox state in hepatocytes and inhibits gluconeogenesis by a redox-independent mechanism.J. Biol.

However, lower metformin concentrations had no effect on glucose oxidation (Fig. 4D). The similar lowering of G6P by rotenone and DNP, which have opposite effects on substrate oxidation, implicates the decrease in the mitochondrial proton gradient as a possible link to the G6P lowering. Mechanisms linked to the mitochondrial proton gradient include ATP synthase (complex V) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), which generates NADPH from NADH, NADP, and proton import (Fig. 4A). We next tested whether rhein (4,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone 2-carboxylic acid), an inhibitor of NNT (32Moyle J. Mitchell P. The proton-translocating nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) transhydrogenase of rat liver mitochondria.Biochem.

To test for possible involvement of NNT activity or raised NADP in the G6P-lowering effect of metformin, we determined cell NADP in incubations with metformin, and we also tested NH4+ (2 mm), which raises NADP by consumption of NADPH during urea synthesis (33Sies H. Summer K.H. Bücher T. A process requiring mitochondrial NADPH: urea formation from ammonia.FEBS Lett. 1975; 54 (236928): 274-27810.1016/0014-5793(75)80091-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Sies H.

Cell NADP was higher at 5 mm glucose than at 25 mm glucose and was raised by NH4+ at low and high glucose and by 500 μm metformin at high glucose (Fig. 4F).

These genetic variations can affect drug efficacy as well as cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We retrieved drug-response related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated data from databases and analyzed to elucidate population specific distribution of 159 drug-response related SNPs in twenty six populations belonging to five super-populations (African, Admixed Americans, East Asian, European and South Asian). Significant interpopulation differences exist in the minor (variant) allele frequencies (MAFs), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype distributions among these populations. 65 of the drug-response related alleles, which are considered as minor (variant) in global population, are present as the major alleles (frequency ≥0.5) in at least one or more populations. Populations that belong to the same super-population have similar distribution pattern for majority of the variant alleles. These drug response related variant allele frequencies and their pairwise LD measure (r2) can clearly distinguish the populations in a way that correspond to the known evolutionary history of human and current geographic distributions, while D' cannot. The data presented here may aid in identifying drugs that are more appropriate and/or require pharmacogenetic testing in these populations. Our findings emphasize on the importance of distinct, ethnicity-specific clinical guidelines, especially for the African populations, to avoid ADRs and ensure effective drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3146519904,"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common candidate mutations in human beings that play a vital role in the genetic basis of certain diseases. Previous studies revealed that Solute Carrier Family 26 Member 4 (SLC26A4) being an essential gene of the multi-faceted transporter family SLC26 facilitates reflexive movement of Iodide into follicular lumen through apical membrane of thyrocyte. SLC26A4 gene encodes Pendred protein, a membrane glycoprotein, highly hydrophobic in nature, present at the apical membrane of thyrocyte functioning as transporter of iodide for thyroid cells. A minor genetic variation in SLC26A4 can cause Pendred syndrome, a syndrome associated with thyroid glands and deafness. In this study, we performed in-silico analysis of 674 missense SNPs of SLC26A4 using different computational platforms.

Moreover, protein structure prediction, protein-ligand docking and Molecular Dynamics simulation were performed to confirm the impact of two evident alterations (Y127H and G334A) on the protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W3002164542,"Assessments of the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) usually assume that fishing patterns change exclusively due to the implementation of an MPA. This assumption increases the risk of erroneous conclusions in assessing marine zoning, and consequently counter-productive management actions. Accordingly, it is important to understand how fishers respond to a combination of the implementation of no-take zones, and various climatic and human drivers of change. Those adaptive responses could influence the interpretation of assessment of no-take zone effectiveness, yet few studies have examined these aspects. Indeed, such analysis is often unfeasible in developing countries, due to the dominance of data-poor fisheries, which precludes full examination of the social-ecological outcomes of MPAs. In the Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), however, the availability of long-term spatially explicit fishery monitoring data (1997-2011) for the spiny lobster fishery allows such an analysis. Accordingly, we evaluated how the spatiotemporal allocation of fishing effort in this multiple-use MPA was affected by the interaction of diverse climatic and human drivers, before and after implementation of no-take zones. Geographic information system modelling techniques were used in combination with boosted regression models to identify how these drivers influenced fishers' behavior. Our results show that the boom-and-bust exploitation of the sea cucumber fishery and the global financial crisis 2007-09, rather than no-take zone implementation, were the most important drivers affecting the distribution of fishing effort across the archipelago. Both drivers triggered substantial macro-scale changes in fishing effort dynamics, which in turn altered the micro-scale dynamics of fishing patterns. Fishers' adaptive responses were identified, and their management implications analyzed. This leads to recommendations for more effective marine and fishery management in the Galapagos, based on improved assessment of the effectiveness of no-take zones."
https://openalex.org/W3002187843,"Aging HIV-infected antiretroviral-treatment (ART)-controlled patients often present cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. Thus, it is mandatory that life-long used ART has no cardiometabolic toxicity. Protease inhibitors have been associated with cardiometabolic risk, integrase-strand-transfer-inhibitors (INSTI) with weight gain and the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc with improved vascular function. We have previously reported that the INSTI dolutegravir and maraviroc improved, and ritonavir-boosted atazanavir(atazanavir/r) worsened, inflammation and senescence in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC)s from adult controls. Here, we analyzed the pathways involved in the drugs' effects on inflammation, senescence and also insulin resistance.We analyzed the involvement of the anti-inflammatory SIRT-1 pathway in HCAECs. Then, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the effect of dolutegravir, maraviroc and atazanavir/r and used siRNA-silencing to address ubiquitin-specific-peptidase-18 (USP18) involvement into ART effects.Dolutegravir reduced inflammation by decreasing NFκB activation and IL-6/IL-8/sICAM-1/sVCAM-1 secretion, as did maraviroc with a milder effect. However, when SIRT-1 was inhibited by splitomicin, the drugs anti-inflammatory effects were maintained, indicating that they were SIRT-1-independant. From the transcriptomic analysis we selected USP18, previously shown to decrease inflammation and insulin-resistance. USP18-silencing enhanced basal inflammation and senescence. Maraviroc still inhibited NFκB activation, cytokine/adhesion molecules secretion and senescence but the effects of dolutegravir and atazanavir/r were lost, suggesting that they involved USP18. Otherwise, in HCAECs, dolutegravir improved and atazanavir/r worsened insulin resistance while maraviroc had no effect. In USP18-silenced cells, basal insulin resistance was increased, but dolutegravir and atazanavir/r kept their effect on insulin sensitivity, indicating that USP18 was dispensable.USP18 reduced basal inflammation, senescence and insulin resistance in coronary endothelial cells. Dolutegravir and atazanavir/r, but not maraviroc, exerted opposite effects on inflammation and senescence that involved USP18. Otherwise, dolutegravir improved and atazanavir/r worsened insulin resistance independently of USP18. Thus, in endothelial cells, dolutegravir and atazanavir/r oppositely affected pathways leading to inflammation, senescence and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3002607199,"Z-numbers can generate a more flexible structure to model the real information because of capturing expert’s reliability. Moreover, various semantics can flexibly be reflected by linguistic terms under various circumstances. Thus, this study aims to model the portfolio selection problems based on aggregation operators under linguistic Z-number environment. Therefore, a multi-stage methodology is proposed and linguistic Z-numbers are applied to describe the assessment information. Moreover, the weighted averaging (WA) aggregation operator, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation operator and the hybrid weighted averaging (HWA) aggregation operator are developed to fuse the input arguments under the linguistic Z-number environment. Then, using the max-score rule and the score-accuracy trade-off rule, three qualitative portfolio models are presented to allocate the optimal assets. These models are suitable for general investors and risky investors. Finally, to illustrate the validity of the proposed qualitative approach, a real case including 20 corporations of Tehran stock exchange market in Iran is provided and the obtained results are analyzed. The results show that combining linguistic Z-numbers with portfolio selection processes can increase the tendencies and capabilities of investors in the capital market and it helps them manage their portfolios efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W3000871659,"One of the most promising applications of human pluripotent stem cells is their utilization for human-based pharmacological models. Despite the fact that membrane transporters expressed in the liver play pivotal role in various hepatic functions, thus far only little attention was devoted to the membrane transporter composition of the stem cell-derived liver models. In the present work, we have differentiated HUES9, a human embryonic stem cell line, toward the hepatic lineage, and monitored the expression levels of numerous differentiation marker and liver transporter genes with special focus on ABC transporters. In addition, the effect of bile acid treatment and polarizing culturing conditions on hepatic maturation has been assessed. We found that most transporter genes crucial for hepatic functions are markedly induced during hepatic differentiation; however, as regards the transporter composition the end-stage cells still exhibited dual, hepatocyte and cholangiocyte character. Although the bile acid treatment and sandwich culturing only slightly influenced the gene expressions, the stimulated cell polarization resulted in formation of bile canaliculi and proper localization of transporters. Our results point to the importance of membrane transporters in human stem cell-derived hepatic models and demonstrate the relevance of cell polarization in generation of applicable cellular models with correctly localized transporters. On the basis of our observations we suggest that conventional criteria for the evaluation of the quality of stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells ought to be augmented with additional elements, such as polarized and functional expression of hepatic transporters."
https://openalex.org/W3003080311,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in cell-cell communication. In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), EVs function as carriers to transport cargo proteins into the periplasm for storage during glucose starvation. However, intracellular organelles that synthesize these EV-associated cargo proteins have not been identified. Here, we investigated whether cytoplasmic organelles—called intracellular vesicle clusters (IVCs)—serve as sites for the synthesis of proteins targeted for secretion as EV-associated proteins. Using proteomics, we identified 377 IVC-associated proteins in yeast cells grown under steady-state low-glucose conditions, with the largest group being involved in protein translation. Isolated IVCs exhibited protein synthesis activities that required initiation and elongation factors. We have also identified 431 newly synthesized proteins on isolated IVCs. Expression of 103Q-GFP, a foreign protein with a long polyglutamine extension, resulted in distribution of this protein as large puncta that co-localized with IVC markers, including fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and the vacuole import and degradation protein Vid24p. We did not observe this pattern in cycloheximide-treated cells or in cells lacking VID genes, required for IVC formation. The induction of 103Q-GFP on IVCs adversely affected total protein synthesis in intact cells and on isolated IVCs. This expression also decreased levels of EV-associated cargo proteins in the extracellular fraction without affecting the number of secreted EVs. Our results provide important insights into the functions of IVCs as sites for the synthesis of EV-associated proteins targeted for secretion to the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W3001118394,"Young children with brain tumours are at high risk of developing treatment-related sequelae. We aimed to assess neuropsychological outcomes 5 years after treatment. This cross-sectional study included children under 4 years of age with medulloblastoma (MB) or ependymoma (EP) enrolled in the German brain tumour trials HIT2000 and HIT-REZ2005. Testing was performed using the validated Wuerzburg Intelligence Diagnostics (WUEP-D), which includes Kaufman-Assessment-Battery, Coloured Progressive Matrices, Visual-Motor Integration, finger tapping ""Speed"", and the Continuous Performance Test. Of 104 patients in 47 centres, 72 were eligible for analyses. We assessed whether IQ was impacted by disease extent, disease location, patient age, gender, age at surgery, and treatment (chemotherapy with our without craniospinal irradiation [CSI] or local radiotherapy [LRT]). Median age at surgery was 2.3 years. Testing was performed at a median of 4.9 years after surgery. Patients with infratentorial EPs (treated with LRT) scored highest in fluid intelligence (CPM 100.9±16.9, mean±SD); second best scores were achieved by patients with MB without metastasis treated with chemotherapy alone (CPM 93.9±13.2), followed by patients with supratentorial EPs treated with LRT. In contrast, lowest scores were achieved by patients that received chemotherapy and CSI, which included children with metastasised MB and those with relapsed MB M0 (CPM 71.7±8.0 and 73.2±21.8, respectively). Fine motor skills were reduced in all groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that type of treatment had an impact on IQ, but essentially not age at surgery, time since surgery or gender. Our results confirm previous reports on the detrimental effects of CSI in a larger cohort of children. Comparable IQ scores in children with MB treated only with chemotherapy and in children with EP suggest that this treatment strategy represents an attractive option for children who have a high chance to avoid application of CSI. Longitudinal follow-up examinations are warranted to assess long-term neuropsychological outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3001279661,"Besides monocyte (MO)-derived macrophages (MACs), self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages (trMACs) maintain the intracutaneous MAC pool in murine skin. Here, we have asked whether the same phenomenon occurs in human skin using organ-cultured, full-thickness skin detached from blood circulation and bone marrow. Skin stimulation ex vivo with the neuropeptide substance P (SP), mimicking neurogenic skin inflammation, significantly increased the number of CD68+MACs in the papillary dermis without altering intracutaneous MAC proliferation or apoptosis. Since intraluminal CD14+MOs were undetectable in the non-perfused dermal vasculature, new MACs must have differentiated from resident intracutaneous progenitor cells in human skin. Interestingly, CD68+MACs were often seen in direct cell-cell-contact with cells expressing both, the hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 and SP receptor (neurokinin-1 receptor [NK1R]). These cell-cell contacts and CD34+cell proliferation were up-regulated in SP-treated skin samples. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence that resident MAC progenitors, from which mature MACs can rapidly differentiate within the tissue, do exist in normal adult human skin. That these NK1R+trMAC-progenitor cells quickly respond to a key stress-associated neuroinflammatory stimulus suggests that this may satisfy increased local MAC demand under conditions of wounding/stress."
https://openalex.org/W3001575790,"In vertebrates, the embryonic environment is known to affect the development and the health of individuals. In broiler chickens, the thermal-manipulation (TM) of eggs during the incubation period was shown to improve heat tolerance at slaughter age (35 days of age) in association with several modifications at the molecular, metabolic and physiological levels. However, little is known about the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), a closely related avian species widely used as a laboratory animal model and farmed for its meat and eggs. Here we developed and characterized a TM procedure (39.5°C and 65% relative humidity, 12 h/d, from days 0 to 13 of incubation) in quails by analyzing its short and long-term effects on zootechnical, physiological and metabolic parameters. Heat-tolerance was tested by a heat challenge (36°C for 7h) at 35 days of age. TM significantly reduced the hatching rate of the animals and increased mortality during the first four weeks of life. At hatching, TM animals were heavier than controls, but lighter at 25 days of age for both sexes. Thirty-five days after hatching, TM decreased the surface temperature of the shank in females, suggesting a modulation of the blood flow to maintain the internal temperature. TM also increased blood partial pressure and oxygen saturation percentage at 35 days of age in females, suggesting a long-term modulation of the respiration physiology. Quails physiologically responded to the heat challenge, with a modification of several hematologic and metabolic parameters, including an increase in plasma corticosterone concentration. Several physiological parameters such as beak surface temperature and blood sodium concentration revealed that TM birds responded differently to the heat challenge compared to controls. Altogether, this first comprehensive characterization of TM in Japanese quail showed durable effects that may affect the response of TM quails to heat."

However, there is a dearth of studies that examined the associated factors of common mental illness among epilepsy patients in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and factors associated with common mental disorders in epilepsy patients who attended government health institutions in Bahir Dar city, Ethiopia.Health institution based cross-sectional study was conducted using a systematic sampling technique among people living with epilepsy in Bahir Dar City Administration. Common mental illness was assessed using a self-reporting questionnaire and a semi-structured questionnaire was employed to collect data on socio-demographic and clinical related characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, univariate logistic regression, and multivariable logistic regression.The magnitude of comorbid common mental illness among people living with epilepsy was found 35.4%. High magnitude of common mental illness was reported among females (39.9%) when compared to males (32.3%). The most prevalent common mental disorders symptoms include being worried, unhappy feeling, trouble thinking clearly, and difficult to enjoy daily activities. Family history of epilepsy, frequent seizures attacks, side effects of antiepileptic drugs, lack of social support and not adherent to antiepileptic drugs were factors associated with common mental illness.Common mental illness was found to be prevalent among people living with epilepsy. Therefore, it is recommended that great attention should be given to mental illness besides controlling seizure attacks."

Our field inventory estimation shows an average above ground biomass (AAGB) accumulation of 0.145 Kt/ha with average carbon stock (ACS) value of 0.072 Kt/ha. Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI images of 1989, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 were used to extract vegetation fractions through Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA) and forest area was calculated for respective years. Based on the forest area and estimated ACS value, the biomass carbon stock with corresponding CO2 emissions/sequestration was worked out for each time and change in forest carbon stock was determined for different time periods from 1989 to 2018. Our analysis shows net increase of 561 ha in forest cover and 40.39 Kt of ACS along with increase in corresponding CO2 sequestrations of 147.83 Kt over the study period. The results based on combination of remote sensing and field inventory provide valuable information and scientific basis to plan and ensure sustainable forest management (SFM) through reforestation, protection and conservation to enhance and maintain adequate forest cover and reduce CO2 emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3000985223,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease with low prevalence in pediatrics. Health studies have not sufficiently analyzed the role of psychological variables in rare diseases such as PCD. This paper studies the psychological characteristics of a group of pediatric patients diagnosed with PCD compared to their healthy peers. The sample consisted of 48 preadolescents-adolescents, aged 9–18 years (M = 12.96; SD = 2.71), with similar distribution by sex, and 25% of the patients having dyskinesia. Clinical anxiety-depression, self-esteem and psychological well-being were evaluated using questionnaires: the Adolescent Psychological Well-being Scale (BIEPS-J), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE). Data were analysed using descriptive, mean comparison (t-test) and diffuse comparative qualitative analysis (QCA). The results show no differences were found between healthy and PCD patients in the variables analyzed, except for social ties showing the latter greater well-being in this aspect. In QCA models, the variables that best explained the high or low levels of well-being were depression and self-esteem, and primary ciliary dyskinesia was not a necessary condition for presenting low levels of well-being. In conclusion, our results highlight the need to explore psychological aspects in pediatric patients with rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3002676016,"Multiple organ dysfunction induced by sepsis often involves kidney injury. Extracellular histones released in response to damage-associated molecular patterns are known to facilitate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) and its lectin-like domain (D1) exert anti-inflammatory effects and neutralize damage-associated molecular patterns. However, the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury remain poorly understood. Our purpose was to investigate the association between extracellular histone H3 levels and kidney injury, and to clarify the effects of rhTM and D1 on extracellular histone H3 levels, kidney injury, and survival in sepsis-induced rats. Rats in whom sepsis was induced via cecal ligation and puncture were used in this study. Histone H3 levels, histopathology of the kidneys, and the survival rate of rats at 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture were investigated. Histone H3 levels increased over time following cecal ligation and puncture. Histopathological analyses indicated that the distribution of degeneration foci among tubular epithelial cells of the kidney and levels of histone H3 increased simultaneously. Administration of rhTM and D1 significantly reduced histone H3 levels compared with that in the vehicle-treated group and improved kidney injury. The survival rates of rats in rhTM- and D1-treated groups were significantly higher than that in the vehicle-treated group. The results of this study indicated that rhTM and its D1 similarly reduce elevated histone H3 levels, thereby reducing acute kidney injury. Our findings also proposed that rhTM and D1 show potential as new treatment strategies for sepsis combined with acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W3003041545,"Workplace bullying is a significant cause of stress at work. Existing studies, primarily based on Western-oriented frameworks and instruments, have largely overlooked the role of culture. This oversight questions whether understandings generated from those studies can be generalised to employees working in Eastern countries, which differ on important cultural dimensions. To date, there is no Eastern-based instrument for measuring workplace bullying. In two studies, we developed and validated such a measure: the Malaysian Workplace Bullying Index (MWBI). Study 1 entailed a content validation of bullying behaviours via written records (diaries) completed by Malaysian bullying victims. The 19 validated behaviours formed the basis of Study 2, with additions from the wider literature. Study 2 used survey data collected at three time-points from Malaysian employees exposed to bullying at work. The final result was an 18-item scale with two nine-item factors: work-related bullying and person-related bullying. Overall, the MWBI is a psychometrically sound measure of workplace bullying in Eastern workplaces."

Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using inductive coding and thematic analyses. We examined findings through the lens of paternalism, a theory that illustrates adults' role in children's autonomy and wellbeing.Mothers have a substantial impact on young women's health values, knowledge, and empowerment. Young women reported bringing information from their mothers into patient-provider health discussions. Clinical best practices included intermingled components of office policies, state laws, and clinical guidelines, which supported health workers' actions to have confidential conversations. There were variations in how health workers engaged young women in a confidential conversation within the exam room.Both young women and health workers benefit from situations in which health workers firmly ask the parent to leave the exam room for a private conversation with the patient. Young women reported this improves their comfort in asking the questions they need to make the best decision for themselves. Clinic leadership needs to ensure that confidentiality surrounding young women's reproductive health is uniform throughout their practice and integrated into patient flow."

Size of the common bile duct (CBD) is a predictor of biliary obstruction and, therefore, its measurement is an important component of biliary system evaluation. Factors like age, height, weight, BMI, previous cholecystectomy, drugs, and type of imaging modality affect CBD diameter, but the duct significantly dilated due to obstructive biliary pathology.To measure the normal CBD diameter and its association with age, sex, and anthropometric measurement at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital and selected private imaging center, Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019.Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted on 206 subjects without any history of hepatobiliary abnormality. The CBD measured at the proximal part just caudal to the porta hepatis. Descriptive analysis, student t-test, one way ANOVA, correlation and both bivariable and multivariable linear regression analysis were implemented. In bivariable linear regression variables with p-value, less than 0.2 were selected for multivariable analysis and in multivariable linear regression analysis variables with P-Value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.The mean age of the study participants was 39.4 (range 18-87). The mean diameter of the CBD was 3.64mm 95%CI (3.52, 3.77), which ranges from 1.8 to 5.9 mm, with 65% of the participant having CBD diameter less than 4mm. The diameter of CBD significantly associated with age with a linear trend. The mean diameter in a rural area was greater than subjects living in an urban area. Independent t-test showed no statistically significant difference in CBD diameter between male and female subjects.The lower limit of the CBD diameter for this study was similar to most of the studies, but the upper limit was found to be slightly lower. The diameter was significantly associated with age along the linear trend and it was progressively increased from the lower age group onwards. The diameter of CBD did not show statistically significant association with any of the anthropometric measurement."
https://openalex.org/W3001593456,"Previously those with asthma were often advised to avoid strenuous exercise because of fear for exercise-induced asthmatic reactions, but recent findings suggest many beneficial effects on health related to exercise. We elaborated on the relation between regular exercise and asthma control among adults. This was a population-based cross-sectional Northern Finnish Asthma Study (NoFAS), in which altogether 1922 adult subjects 17-73 years old living in Northern Finland answered the NoFAS questionnaire. The determinant of interest was the total amount of regular exercise during leisure time, measured in hours per week and categorized into no, low (>0≤2h per week), medium (>2 ≤5h), high (>5≤10h) and very high (>10h) exercise categories. The outcome of interest was asthma control, which was assessed based on the Asthma Control Test (ACT). As statistical methods we applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Poisson regression. ACT score increased gradually, i.e. asthma control improved, with an increasing amount of exercise from no exercise (mean ACT = 19.4; difference from the reference: -1.57, 95% CI -2.12 to -1.01) to high exercise reference category (mean = 21.0), but was slightly lower (mean = 20.3; -0.64, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.02) in the very high exercise category. Such non-linear relation was present both in women and in men. In conclusion, we provide evidence that moderate to high regular exercise improves asthma control among adults with asthma. Advice about regular exercise should be included as an important part of asthma management for adults."
https://openalex.org/W3002143226,"Due to the ageing population, the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders will continue to rise, as well as healthcare expenditure. To overcome these increasing expenditures, integration of orthopaedic care should be stimulated. The Primary Care Plus (PC+) intervention aimed to achieve this by facilitating collaboration between primary care and the hospital, in which specialised medical care is shifted to a primary care setting. The present study aims to evaluate the referral decision following orthopaedic care in PC+ and in particular to evaluate the influence of diagnostic tests on this decision. Therefore, retrospective monitoring data of patients visiting PC+ for orthopaedic care was used. Data was divided into two periods; P1 and P2. During P2, specialists in PC+ were able to request additional diagnostic tests (such as ultrasounds and MRIs). A total of 2,438 patients visiting PC+ for orthopaedic care were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the referral decision following PC+ (back to the general practitioner (GP) or referral to outpatient hospital care). Independent variables were consultation- and patient-related predictors. To describe variations in the referral decision, logistic regression modelling was used. Results show that during P2, significantly more patients were referred back to their GP. Moreover, the multivariable analysis show a significant effect of patient age on the referral decision (OR 0.86, 95% CI = 0.81-0.91) and a significant interaction was found between the treating specialist and the period (p = 0.015) and between patient's diagnosis and the period (p ≤ 0.001). Despite the significant impact of the possibility of requesting additional diagnostic tests in PC+, it is important to discuss the extent to which the availability of diagnostic tests fits within the vision of PC+. In addition, selecting appropriate profiles for specialists and patients for PC+ are necessary to further optimise the effectiveness and cost of care."
https://openalex.org/W3002512800,"Sustainability standards are used to assure improved environmental performance in the aquaculture sector. But standard setters face limitations in including a broad range of producers with different capabilities, which in turn reduces their scope and impact. Drawing on Sen's capability approach, we introduce a novel way to assess the extent to which sustainability standards can support the capability of farmers to make prescribed improvements to their production practices. In doing so, we compare four shrimp aquaculture standards (Aquaculture Stewardship Council, Global Aquaculture Alliance, Southeast Asian Shrimp Aquaculture Improvement Protocol and the Thai Agricultural Standard) based on an analysis of what we label the 'prescribed capitals' and 'bundle of capitals' that underpin the compliance capability of producers. The results show that standards narrowly prescribe standards requiring human capital, while there is potential for prescribing a wider bundle of social, financial and physical capitals that can allow more flexible standard compliance. The findings raise the prospect of redesigning sustainability standards to support a broader diversity of producer capabilities and, in turn, increase their overall impact."

https://openalex.org/W3001736915,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening disease, and until today there is no other treatment available than surgical intervention. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)-inhibitors, used clinically to treat type 2 diabetes, have in murine models been shown to attenuate aneurysm formation and decrease aortic wall matrix degradation, inflammation and apoptosis. Our aim was to investigate if DPP4 is present, active and differentially expressed in human AAA.DPP4 gene expression was elevated in both media and adventitia of AAA tissue compared with control tissue, as measured by microarrays and qPCR, with consistent findings in external data. The plasma activity of DPP4 was however lower in male patients with AAA compared with age- and gender-matched controls, independently of comorbidity or medication. Immunohistochemical double staining revealed co-localization of DPP4 with cells positive for CD68, CD4 and -8, CD20, and SMA. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that expression of DPP4 in AAA tissue correlated with expression of biological processes related to B- and T-cells, extracellular matrix turnover, peptidase activity, oxidative stress and angiogenesis whereas it correlated negatively with muscle-/actin-related processes.DPP4 is upregulated in both media and adventitia of human AAA and correlates with aneurysm pathophysiological processes. These results support previous murine mechanistic studies and implicate DPP4 as a target in AAA disease."
https://openalex.org/W3000874898,"The Rdr1 gene confers resistance to black spot in roses and belongs to a large TNL gene family, which is organized in two major clusters at the distal end of chromosome 1. We used the recently available chromosome scale assemblies for the R. chinensis ‘Old Blush’ genome, re-sequencing data for nine rose species and genome data for Fragaria, Rubus, Malus and Prunus to identify Rdr1 homologs from different taxa within Rosaceae. Members of the Rdr1 gene family are organized into two major clusters in R. chinensis and at a syntenic location in the Fragaria genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the two clusters existed prior to the split of Rosa and Fragaria and that one cluster has a more recent origin than the other. Genes belonging to cluster 2, such as the functional Rdr1 gene muRdr1A, were subject to a faster evolution than genes from cluster 1. As no Rdr1 homologs were found in syntenic positions for Prunus persica, Malus x domestica and Rubus occidentalis, a translocation of the Rdr1 clusters to the current positions probably happened after the Rubeae split from other groups within the Rosoideae approximately 70–80 million years ago during the Cretaceous period."

Wavelet-MRP maps yield a clear depiction of hypervascular tumor regions, as recently shown. Objective The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible connection of the wavelet-MRP power spectrum in glioblastoma (GBM) with local vascularity and cell proliferation. Methods For this IRB-approved study 12 patients (63.0+/-14.9y; 7m) with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM were included. Target regions for biopsies were prospectively marked on tumor regions as seen on preoperative 3T MRI. During subsequent neurosurgical tumor resection 43 targeted biopsies were taken from these target regions, of which all 27 matching samples were analyzed. All specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for endothelial cell marker CD31 and proliferation marker Ki67 and correlated to the wavelet-MRP power spectrum as derived from DSC perfusion weighted imaging. Results There was a strong correlation between wavelet-MRP power spectrum (median = 4.41) and conventional relative cerebral blood volume (median = 5.97 ml/100g) in Spearman's rank-order correlation (κ = .83, p < .05). In a logistic regression model, the wavelet-MRP power spectrum showed a significant correlation to CD31 dichotomized to no or present staining (p = .04), while rCBV did not show a significant correlation to CD31 (p = .30). No significant association between Ki67 and rCBV or wavelet-MRP was found (p = .62 and p = .70, respectively). Conclusion The wavelet-MRP power spectrum derived from existing DSC-MRI data might be a promising new surrogate for tumor vascularity in GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3000786100,"Estrogens are important for maintaining metabolic health in males. However, the key sources of local estrogen production for regulating energy metabolism have not been fully defined. Immune cells exhibit aromatase activity and are resident in metabolic tissues. To determine the relative contribution of immune cell-derived estrogens for metabolic health in males, C57BL6/J mice underwent bone marrow transplant with marrow from either wild-type (WT(WT)) or aromatase-deficient (WT(ArKO)) donors. Body weight, body composition, and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed over 24 weeks with mice maintained on a regular chow diet. No differences were found in insulin sensitivity between groups, but WT(ArKO) mice were more glucose tolerant than WT(WT) mice 20 weeks after transplant, suggestive of enhanced glucose disposal (AUCglucose 6061±3349 in WT(WT) mice versus 3406±1367 in WT(ArKO) mice, p = 0.01). Consistent with this, skeletal muscle from WT(ArKO) mice showed higher expression of the mitochondrial genes Ppargc1a (p = 0.03) and Nrf1 (p = 0.01), as well as glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4, Scl2a4; p = 0.02). Skeletal muscle from WT(ArKO) mice had a lower concentration of 17β-estradiol (5489±2189 pg/gm in WT(WT) mice versus 3836±2160 pg/gm in WT(ArKO) mice, p = 0.08) but higher expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα, Esr1), raising the possibility that aromatase deficiency in immune cells led to a compensatory increase in ERα signaling. No differences between groups were found with regard to body weight, adiposity, or gene expression within adipose tissue or liver. Immune cells are a key source of local 17β-estradiol production and contribute to metabolic regulation in males, particularly within skeletal muscle. The respective intracrine and paracrine roles of immune cell-derived estrogens require further delineation, as do the pathways that regulate aromatase activity in immune cells specifically within metabolic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3001038405,"Splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Rupture results in 25% mortality up to 75% in pregnant women with 95% fetal mortality. Brief reports suggest an increased risk of developing SAA in patients with HHT.We analyzed enhanced multidetector CT data in 186 HHT patients matched (gender and ± 5 year old) with 186 controls. We screened for SAA and recorded diameter of splenic and hepatic arteries and hepatic, pancreatic and splenic parenchymal involvements. We determined by univariate and multivariate analysis, the relationship with age, sex, genetic status, cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and visceral involvement.SAA concerned 24.7% of HHT patients and 5.4% of controls, p<0.001. Factors associated with increased risk of SAA in HHT were female gender (p = 0.04, OR = 2.12, IC 95% = 1.03-4.50), age (p = 0.0003, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02-1.06) and pancreatic parenchymal involvement (p = 0.04, OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.01-4.49), but not type of mutation, hepatic or splenic parenchymal involvements, splenic size or splenic artery diameter or CVRF.We found a 4.57 higher rate of SAA in HHT patients without evidence of splenic high output related disease or increased CVRF. These results suggest the presence of a vascular intrinsic involvement. It should lead to screening all HHT patients for SAA. The vasculopathy hypothesis could require a change in management as screening of all systemic arteries and even the aorta and to further research in the field."
https://openalex.org/W3001197868,"Uncertainty exists regarding the best way to communicate cardiovascular risk (CVR) to patients, and it is unclear whether the comprehension and perception of CVR varies according to the format used. The aim of the present work was to determine whether a strategy designed for communicating CVR information to patients with poorly controlled high blood pressure (HBP), but with no background of cardiovascular disease, was more effective than usual care in the control of blood pressure (BP) over the course of a year.A pragmatic, two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed. Consecutive patients aged 40-65 years, all diagnosed with HBP in the last 12 months, and all of whom showed poor control of their condition (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg), were recruited at 22 primary healthcare centres. Eleven centres were randomly assigned to the usual care arm, and 11 to the informative intervention arm (Educore arm). At the start of the study, the Educore arm subjects were shown the ""low risk SCORE table"", along with impacting images and information pamphlets encouraging the maintenance of good cardiovascular health. The main outcome variable measured was the control of HBP; the secondary outcome variables were SCORE table score, total plasma cholesterol concentration, use of tobacco, adherence to prescribed treatment, and quality of life.The study participants were 411 patients (185 in the Educore arm and 226 in the usual care arm). Multilevel logistic regression showed that, at 12 months, the Educore intervention achieved better control of HBP (OR = 1.57; 1.02 to 2.41). No statistically significant differences were seen between the two arms at 12 months with respect to the secondary outcomes.Compared to usual care, the Educore intervention was associated with better control of HBP after adjusting for age, baseline SBP and plasma cholesterol, at 12 months."
https://openalex.org/W3001246320,"Bees play a key role in the functioning of human-modified and natural ecosystems by pollinating agricultural crops and wild plant communities. Global pollinator conservation efforts need large-scale and long-term monitoring to detect changes in species' demographic patterns and shifts in bee community structure. The objective of this project was to test a molecular sequencing pipeline that would utilize a commonly used locus, produce accurate and precise identifications consistent with morphological identifications, and generate data that are both qualitative and quantitative. We applied this amplicon sequencing pipeline to native bee communities sampled across Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands and native grasslands in eastern North Dakota. We found the 28S LSU locus to be more capable of discriminating between species than the 18S SSU rRNA locus, and in some cases even resolved instances of cryptic species or morphologically ambiguous species complexes. Overall, we found the amplicon sequencing method to be a qualitatively accurate representation of the sampled bee community richness and species identity, especially when a well-curated database of known 28S LSU sequences is available. Both morphological identification and molecular sequencing revealed similar patterns in native bee community structure across CRP lands and native prairie. Additionally, a genetic algorithm approach to compute taxon-specific correction factors using a small subset of the most concordant samples demonstrated that a high level of quantitative accuracy could be possible if the specimens are fresh and processed soon after collection. Here we provide a first step to a molecular pipeline for identifying insect pollinator communities. This tool should prove useful for future national monitoring efforts as use of molecular tools becomes more affordable and as numbers of 28S LSU sequences for pollinator species increase in publicly-available databases."
https://openalex.org/W3001337601,"In radioactive source surveying protocols, a number of task-inherent features degrade the quality of collected gamma ray spectra, including: limited dwell times, a fluctuating background, a large distance to the source, weak source activity, and the low sensitivity of mobile detectors. Thus, collected gamma ray spectra are expected to be sparse and noise dominated. For extremely sparse spectra, direct background subtraction is infeasible and many background estimation techniques do not apply. In this paper, we present a statistical algorithm for source estimation and anomaly detection under such conditions. We employ a fixed-hyperparameter Gaussian processes regression methodology with a linear innovation sequence scheme in order to quickly update an ongoing source distribution estimate with no prior training required. We have evaluated the effectiveness of this approach for anomaly detection using background spectra collected with a Kromek D3S and simulated source spectrum and hyperparameters defined by detector characteristics and information derived from collected spectra. We attained an area under the ROC curve of 0.902 for identifying sparse source peaks within a sparse gamma ray spectrum and achieved a true positive rate of 93% when selecting the optimum thresholding value derived from the ROC curve."
https://openalex.org/W3002563184,"Background and purpose Previously, we showed that co-prevalence of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) in patients with intracranial aneurysms (IAs) was 2% in a Dutch cohort. In order to obtain more precise estimates and discover potential predictors of ECAA co-prevalence in the European population, we retrospectively compared differences and similarities of our Dutch cohort with a Finnish cohort using protocolled imaging of the cerebrovascular tree. Methods IA patients within the prospective database of the Kuopio University Hospital were eligible for this study (n = 1,118). Image analysis and hospital chart review were conducted. Results In total, 458 patients with complete carotid imaging conform protocol were analyzed. Twenty-four ECAAs in 21 patients were identified (4.6%, 95% CI 2.9–6.9), a higher co-prevalence than in the Dutch cohort (1.9%; 95% CI 1.0–3.3), prevalence odds ratio (POR) 2.45 (95% CI 1.19–5.03). In the Finnish cohort, 25% of all ECAAs were located around the carotid bifurcation, others in the internal carotid artery distally from the bifurcation. Independent predictors for ECAA co-prevalence were origin of country (POR 2.41, 95% CI 1.15–5.06) and male gender (POR 2.25, 95% CI 1.09–4.64). Conclusion The co-prevalence of ECAA in IA patients was twice as high in the Finnish compared to the Dutch IA cohort, with origin of country and male gender as independent predictors. Twenty-five percent of ECAAs would be missed, if the carotid bifurcation was not imaged. Therefore, we propose to always include imaging of the carotid bifurcation as the gold standard technique to identify ECAA in IA patients."
https://openalex.org/W3002693887,"Background The Self-Administered Food Security Survey Module for Children was developed to assess food insecurity of individual children and has not been used in Portugal. We aimed to apply the mixture item response theory model to the Self-Administered Food Security Survey Module for Children, to assess its reliability and validity, and to estimate the cut-offs of the food security status for Portuguese children. Methods The scale was self-administered to 2132 children of the Generation XXI birth cohort. The internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. We evaluated dimensionality and/or clustering, and Latent Class Analysis, Latent Trait Analysis and Mixture Latent Trait Analysis were tested. The number of classes and/or traits were defined according to the Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion, Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion, Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test, Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio Test and Entropy. Construct validity was explored using socio-demographic characteristics. The classification tree was used to define cut-offs to predict cluster membership. Results The best model was a Mixture Latent Trait Analysis with 1 factor and 2 classes (food security and food insecurity), assuming class variant item parameters (for items 1 and 3). Based on the estimated posterior probabilities, the food insecurity prevalence was 17.6%. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.617. A higher proportion of less-educated mothers and low-income households was observed in the food insecurity class. The classification tree showed an accuracy of 100.0% by identifying the food security and food insecurity groups. Conclusion Our results supported that the Self-Administered Food Security Survey Module for Children provides a valid and reliable measure, which allows the identification of food insecurity among Portuguese children."
https://openalex.org/W3002971698,"Female sex workers (FSWs) play a key role in HIV transmission in West Africa, while they have limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In line with UNAIDS recommendations extending ART to all HIV-infected individuals, we conducted this demonstration project on immediate treatment as prevention (TasP) among FSWs in Cotonou, Benin. We report data on treatment response and its relation to adherence, as well as on ART-resistant genotypes.Complete follow-up varied between 12 and 24 months. At each three-monthly visit, a questionnaire was administered, clinical examinations were carried out and blood samples collected. Adherence to treatment was estimated by self-report. Viral RNA was genotyped at baseline and final visits for drug resistance. Generalized estimating equations for repeated measures with a log-binomial link were used to analyze time trends and the association between adherence and virological response to treatment.One-hundred-seven HIV-positive and ART-naive FSWs were enrolled; 59.8% remained in the cohort till study completion and 62.6% had a final visit. Viral load<1000 (below quantification limit [<50]) was attained in 73.1% (64.6%) of participants at month-6, 84.8% (71.2%) at month-12, and 80.9% (65.1%) at the final visit. The proportion of women with suppressed (below quantification limit) viral load increased with increasing self-reported adherence (p = 0.06 (0.003), tests for trend). The proportion of participants with CD4≤500 also decreased drastically throughout follow-up (p < .0001). Twelve participants exhibited ART-resistant genotypes at baseline, but only two at their final visit.Our findings indicate that TasP is widely accepted among FSWs in Cotonou and could be implemented with relative success. However, due to mobility in this population, follow-up was sub-optimal, suggesting that large geographical coverage of FSW-friendly clinics is needed for sustained treatment implementation. We also fell short of the UNAIDS objective of 90% viral suppression among treated patients, underlining the need for better adherence support programs."
https://openalex.org/W3002187000,"Dynamic environments often contain features that change at slightly different times. Here we investigated how sensitivity to these slight timing differences depends on spatial relationships among stimuli. Stimuli comprised bilaterally presented plaid pairs that rotated, or radially expanded and contracted to simulate depth movement. Left and right hemifield stimuli initially moved in the same or opposite directions, then reversed directions at various asynchronies. College students judged whether the direction reversed first on the left or right-a temporal order judgment (TOJ). TOJ thresholds remained similar across conditions that required tracking only one depth plane, or bilaterally synchronized depth planes. However, when stimuli required simultaneously tracking multiple depth planes-counter-phased across hemifields-TOJ thresholds doubled or tripled. This effect depended on perceptual set. Increasing the certainty with which participants simultaneously tracked multiple depth planes reduced TOJ thresholds by 45 percent. Even complete certainty, though, failed to reduce multiple-depth-plane TOJ thresholds to levels obtained with single or bilaterally synchronized depth planes. Overall, the results demonstrate that global depth perception can alter local timing sensitivity. More broadly, the findings reflect a coarse-to-fine spatial influence on how we sense time."
https://openalex.org/W3003022339,"In a previous study we found a significant correlation between dystocia and hyponatraemia that developed during labour. The present study examined a possible causal relationship. In vitro studies often use area under the curve (AUC) determined by frequency and force of contractions as a measure of myometrial contractility. However, a phase portrait plot of isometric contraction, obtained by plotting the first derivate of contraction against force of contraction, could indicate that bi-or multiphasic contractions might be less effective compared to the smooth contractions.Myometrial biopsies were obtained from 17 women undergoing elective caesarean section at term. Each biopsy was divided into 8 strips and mounted isometrically in a force transducer. Seven biopsies were used in the first part of the study when half of the strips were immersed in the hyponatraemic study solution S containing Na+ 120 mmol/L and observed for 1 hour, followed by 1 hour in normonatraemic control solution C containing Na+ 136 mmol/L, then again in S for 1 hour, and finally 1 hour in C. The other half of the strips were studied in reverse order, C-S-C-S. The remaining ten biopsies were included in the second part of the study. Response to increasing doses of oxytocin (OT) in solutions S and C was studied. In the first part of the study we calculated AUC, and created phase portrait plots of two different contractions from the same strip, one smooth and one biphasic. In both parts of the study we registered frequency and force of contractions, and described appearance of the contractions.First part of the study: Mean (median) contractions per hour in C: 8.7 (7.6), in S 14,3 (13). Mean (SD) difference between groups 5.6 (4.2), p = 0.018. Force of contractions in C: 11.8 (10.2) mN, in S: 10.8 (9.2) mN, p = 0.09, AUC increased in S; p = 0.018. Bi-/multiphasic contractions increased from 8% in C to 18% in S, p = 0.001. All changes were reversible in C. Second part of the study: Frequency after OT 1.65 x 10-9 M in C:3.4 (2.9), in S: 3.8 (3.2), difference between groups: p = 0.48. After OT 1.65 x 10-7 M in C: 7.8 (8.9), increase from previous OT administration: p = 0.09, in S: 8.7 (9.0), p = 0.04, difference between groups, p = 0.32. Only at the highest dose of OT dose was there an increase in force of contraction in S, p = 0.05, difference between groups, p = 0.33. Initial response to OT was more frequently bi/multiphasic in S, reaching significance at the highest dose of OT(1.65 x 10-7 M), p = 0.015. when almost all contractions were bi/multiphasic.Hyponatraemia reversibly increased frequency of contractions and appearance of bi-or multiphasic contractions, that could reduce myometrial contractility. This could explain the correlation of hyponatraemia and instrumental delivery previously observed. Contractions in the hyponatraemic solution more frequently showed initial multiphasic contractions when OT was added in increasing doses. Longer lasting labours carry the risk both of hyponatraemia and OT administration, and their negative interaction could be significant. Further studies should address this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W3003132453,"Approximately one-third of the patients with well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) will develop a local recurrence. Not much is known about the molecular relationship between the primary tumor and the recurrent tumor, which is important to reveal potential drivers of recurrence. Here we investigated the biology of recurrent WDLPS by comparing paired primary and recurrent WDLPS using microRNA profiling and genome-wide DNA methylation analyses. In total, 27 paired primary and recurrent WDLPS formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples were collected. MicroRNA expression profiles were determined using TaqMan® Low Density Array (TLDA) cards. Genome-wide DNA methylation and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were assessed by methylated DNA sequencing (MeD-seq). A supervised cluster analysis based on differentially expressed microRNAs between paired primary and recurrent WDLPS did not reveal a clear cluster pattern separating the primary from the recurrent tumors. The clustering was also not based on tumor localization, time to recurrence, age or status of the resection margins. Changes in DNA methylation between primary and recurrent tumors were extremely variable, and no consistent DNA methylation changes were found. As a result, a supervised clustering analysis based on DMRs between primary and recurrent tumors did not show a distinct cluster pattern based on any of the features. Subgroup analysis for tumors localized in the extremity or the retroperitoneum also did not yield a clear distinction between primary and recurrent WDLPS samples. In conclusion, microRNA expression profiles and DNA methylation profiles do not distinguish between primary and recurrent WDLPS and no putative common drivers could be identified."
https://openalex.org/W3002571867,"The menisci are responsible for several functions. They are shock absorbers during dynamic loading on the knee and provide a broader surface area on which to distribute stress evenly to the tibia and femur. These functions allow for smoother movement and greater stability of the knee joint. Meniscal injury can be a great impediment to the function of the knee. Therefore, in the case of meniscal injury, our main concern is the relief of patient symptoms, followed by consequent restoration of meniscal function to the greatest of our ability. To prevent the long terms effects of a meniscectomy, meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) was developed. The potential of using the size of the contralateral healthy menisci, to determine the size of the menisci to be replaced, will be discussed.Knee MRIs done on healthy patients in the past 5 years were reviewed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed using a 3-T scanner. Each individual was examined with knee joints in full extension. Measurements were performed two separate times, two weeks apart. A mean of three measurements was made during each session to reduce error. Thirty-eight normal bilateral knee joints MRIs remained (16 males, 22 females). Participants were sampled from the institutional Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Age, gender, and the medial meniscal and lateral meniscal size of both knees were recorded. The laterality of the menisci was compared between both knees in each patient.A total of 38 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 37.39 (±9.50) years. They were 16 (42.1%) men and 22 (57.9%) women. We didn't find any significant difference in the mid-coronal section between left and right knees meniscal measurements. None of the measurements were significantly different between men and women. There was no significant difference in the medial mid-sagittal section or lateral mid-sagittal section between left and right knee meniscal measurements.The results obtained in this study may support the use of MRI of the bilateral knee to obtain an appropriately sized allograft."
https://openalex.org/W3002371932,"Determining intrinsic number of clusters in a multidimensional dataset is a commonly encountered problem in exploratory data analysis. Unsupervised clustering algorithms often rely on specification of cluster number as an input parameter. However, this is typically not known a priori. Many methods have been proposed to estimate cluster number, including statistical and information-theoretic approaches such as the gap statistic, but these methods are not always reliable when applied to non-normally distributed datasets containing outliers or noise. In this study, I propose a novel method called hierarchical linkage regression, which uses regression to estimate the intrinsic number of clusters in a multidimensional dataset. The method operates on the hypothesis that the organization of data into clusters can be inferred from the hierarchy generated by partitioning the dataset, and therefore does not directly depend on the specific values of the data or their distribution, but on their relative ranking within the partitioned set. Moreover, the technique does not require empirical data to train on, but can use synthetic data generated from random distributions to fit regression coefficients. The trained hierarchical linkage regression model is able to infer cluster number in test datasets of varying complexity and differing distributions, for image, text and numeric data, using the same regression model without retraining. The method performs favourably against other cluster number estimation techniques, and is also robust to parameter changes, as demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. The apparent robustness and generalizability of hierarchical linkage regression make it a promising tool for unsupervised exploratory data analysis and discovery."
