https://openalex.org/W4206975086,"Improvements to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have focused on increasing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability and maintaining high performance upon scale-up to module sizes. We report that replacing the commonly used mesoporous-titanium dioxide electron transport layer (ETL) with a thin layer of polyacrylic acid-stabilized tin(IV) oxide quantum dots (paa-QD-SnO2) on the compact-titanium dioxide enhanced light capture and largely suppressed nonradiative recombination at the ETL-perovskite interface. The use of paa-QD-SnO2 as electron-selective contact enabled PSCs (0.08 square centimeters) with a PCE of 25.7% (certified 25.4%) and high operational stability and facilitated the scale-up of the PSCs to larger areas. PCEs of 23.3, 21.7, and 20.6% were achieved for PSCs with active areas of 1, 20, and 64 square centimeters, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4226087845,"The emergence of the highly transmissible B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is concerning for antibody countermeasure efficacy because of the number of mutations in the spike protein. In this study, we tested a panel of anti-receptor-binding domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAb of VIR-7831 (sotrovimab)), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016) and Celltrion (CT-P59) for their ability to neutralize an infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate. Several mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987 and CT-P59) completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination, ~12-fold decrease) or minimally affected (S309). Our results suggest that several, but not all, of the antibodies in clinical use might lose efficacy against the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant. New in vitro data suggest that the new SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is likely to escape neutralization by most therapeutic antibodies currently available."
https://openalex.org/W4205331651,"The newly reported Omicron variant is poised to replace Delta as the most prevalent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant across the world. Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis of the Omicron variant spike protein in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reveals new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed by mutated residues arginine-493, serine-496, and arginine-498 in the receptor binding domain with ACE2. These interactions appear to compensate for other Omicron mutations such as the substitution of asparagine for lysine at position 417 (K417N) that are known to reduce ACE2 binding affinity, resulting in similar biochemical ACE2 binding affinities for the Delta and Omicron variants. Neutralization assays show that pseudoviruses that display the Omicron spike protein exhibit increased antibody evasion. The increase in antibody evasion and the retention of strong interactions at the ACE2 interface thus represent important molecular features that likely contribute to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant."
https://openalex.org/W4225386205,"The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is causing a rapid increase in infections across the globe. This new variant of concern carries an unusually high number of mutations in key epitopes of neutralizing antibodies on the viral spike glycoprotein, suggesting potential immune evasion. Here we assessed serum neutralizing capacity in longitudinal cohorts of vaccinated and convalescent individuals, as well as monoclonal antibody activity against Omicron using pseudovirus neutralization assays. We report a near-complete lack of neutralizing activity against Omicron in polyclonal sera from individuals vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and from convalescent individuals, as well as resistance to different monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. However, mRNA booster immunizations in vaccinated and convalescent individuals resulted in a significant increase of serum neutralizing activity against Omicron. This study demonstrates that booster immunizations can critically improve the humoral immune response against the Omicron variant."
https://openalex.org/W4207003944,"Abstract Booster vaccination with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines has been offered to adults in England starting on 14 September 2021. We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the relative effectiveness of a booster dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) compared to only a two-dose primary course (at least 175 days after the second dose) or unvaccinated individuals from 13 September 2021 to 5 December 2021, when Delta variant was dominant in circulation. Outcomes were symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hospitalization. The relative effectiveness against symptomatic disease 14–34 days after a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) booster after a ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 as a primary course ranged from around 85% to 95%. Absolute vaccine effectiveness ranged from 94% to 97% and was similar in all age groups. Limited waning was seen 10 or more weeks after the booster. Against hospitalization or death, absolute effectiveness of a BNT162b2 booster ranged from around 97% to 99% in all age groups irrespective of the primary course, with no evidence of waning up to 10 weeks. This study provides real-world evidence of substantially increased protection from the booster vaccine dose against mild and severe disease irrespective of the primary course."
https://openalex.org/W4205252391,"Abstract COVID-19, which is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by lung pathology and extrapulmonary complications 1,2 . Type I interferons (IFNs) have an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (refs 3–5 ). Although rapid induction of type I IFNs limits virus propagation, a sustained increase in the levels of type I IFNs in the late phase of the infection is associated with aberrant inflammation and poor clinical outcome 5–17 . Here we show that the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which controls immunity to cytosolic DNA, is a critical driver of aberrant type I IFN responses in COVID-19 (ref. 18 ). Profiling COVID-19 skin manifestations, we uncover a STING-dependent type I IFN signature that is primarily mediated by macrophages adjacent to areas of endothelial cell damage. Moreover, cGAS–STING activity was detected in lung samples from patients with COVID-19 with prominent tissue destruction, and was associated with type I IFN responses. A lung-on-chip model revealed that, in addition to macrophages, infection with SARS-CoV-2 activates cGAS–STING signalling in endothelial cells through mitochondrial DNA release, which leads to cell death and type I IFN production. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of STING reduces severe lung inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 and improves disease outcome. Collectively, our study establishes a mechanistic basis of pathological type I IFN responses in COVID-19 and reveals a principle for the development of host-directed therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4206313080,"High-fidelity control of quantum bits is paramount for the reliable execution of quantum algorithms and for achieving fault tolerance-the ability to correct errors faster than they occur1. The central requirement for fault tolerance is expressed in terms of an error threshold. Whereas the actual threshold depends on many details, a common target is the approximately 1% error threshold of the well-known surface code2,3. Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are promising for scaling, as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology4. Here we report a spin-based quantum processor in silicon with single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, all of which are above 99.5%, extracted from gate-set tomography. The average single-qubit gate fidelities remain above 99% when including crosstalk and idling errors on the neighbouring qubit. Using this high-fidelity gate set, we execute the demanding task of calculating molecular ground-state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm5. Having surpassed the 99% barrier for the two-qubit gate fidelity, semiconductor qubits are well positioned on the path to fault tolerance and to possible applications in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."
https://openalex.org/W4205613112,"Material composition engineering and device fabrication of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) in solution can introduce organic contamination and entail several synthetic, processing, and stabilization steps. We report three-dimensional (3D) direct lithography of PNCs with tunable composition and bandgap in glass. The halide ion distribution was controlled at the nanoscale with ultrafast laser–induced liquid nanophase separation. The PNCs exhibit notable stability against ultraviolet irradiation, organic solution, and high temperatures (up to 250°C). Printed 3D structures in glass were used for optical storage, micro–light emitting diodes, and holographic displays. The proposed mechanisms of both PNC formation and composition tunability were verified."
https://openalex.org/W4206801895,"Fault-tolerant quantum computers which can solve hard problems rely on quantum error correction. One of the most promising error correction codes is the surface code, which requires universal gate fidelities exceeding the error correction threshold of 99 per cent. Among many qubit platforms, only superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond have delivered those requirements. Electron spin qubits in silicon are particularly promising for a large-scale quantum computer due to their nanofabrication capability, but the two-qubit gate fidelity has been limited to 98 per cent due to the slow operation.Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5 per cent, along with single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.8 per cent, in silicon spin qubits by fast electrical control using a micromagnet-induced gradient field and a tunable two-qubit coupling. We identify the condition of qubit rotation speed and coupling strength where we robustly achieve high-fidelity gates. We realize Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover search algorithms with high success rates using our universal gate set. Our results demonstrate the universal gate fidelity beyond the fault-tolerance threshold and pave the way for scalable silicon quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W4206511670,"Fast and selective isolation of single cells with unique spatial and morphological traits remains a technical challenge. Here, we address this by establishing high-speed image-enabled cell sorting (ICS), which records multicolor fluorescence images and sorts cells based on measurements from image data at speeds up to 15,000 events per second. We show that ICS quantifies cell morphology and localization of labeled proteins and increases the resolution of cell cycle analyses by separating mitotic stages. We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time. By assessing complex cellular phenotypes, ICS substantially expands the phenotypic space accessible to cell-sorting applications and pooled genetic screening."
https://openalex.org/W4206498467,"Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing, because of their exceptional quantum coherence and atomic-scale footprint. However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, due to the lack of methods to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted 31P donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7)%. The quantum operations are precisely characterised using gate set tomography (GST), yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2)%, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11)% and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4)%. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0)% fidelity. Since electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons or physically shuttled across different locations, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins."
https://openalex.org/W4205506475,"Ageing is accompanied by a decline in cellular proteostasis, which underlies many age-related protein misfolding diseases1,2. Yet, how ageing impairs proteostasis remains unclear. As nascent polypeptides represent a substantial burden on the proteostasis network3, we hypothesized that altered translational efficiency during ageing could help to drive the collapse of proteostasis. Here we show that ageing alters the kinetics of translation elongation in both Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ribosome pausing was exacerbated at specific positions in aged yeast and worms, including polybasic stretches, leading to increased ribosome collisions known to trigger ribosome-associated quality control (RQC)4-6. Notably, aged yeast cells exhibited impaired clearance and increased aggregation of RQC substrates, indicating that ageing overwhelms this pathway. Indeed, long-lived yeast mutants reduced age-dependent ribosome pausing, and extended lifespan correlated with greater flux through the RQC pathway. Further linking altered translation to proteostasis collapse, we found that nascent polypeptides exhibiting age-dependent ribosome pausing in C. elegans were strongly enriched among age-dependent protein aggregates. Notably, ageing increased the pausing and aggregation of many components of proteostasis, which could initiate a cycle of proteostasis collapse. We propose that increased ribosome pausing, leading to RQC overload and nascent polypeptide aggregation, critically contributes to proteostasis impairment and systemic decline during ageing."
https://openalex.org/W4206210420,"Abstract Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is an important contributor to air pollution and can adversely affect human health 1–9 . A decrease in NO 2 concentrations has been reported as a result of lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 10–20 . Questions remain, however, regarding the relationship of satellite-derived atmospheric column NO 2 data with health-relevant ambient ground-level concentrations, and the representativeness of limited ground-based monitoring data for global assessment. Here we derive spatially resolved, global ground-level NO 2 concentrations from NO 2 column densities observed by the TROPOMI satellite instrument at sufficiently fine resolution (approximately one kilometre) to allow assessment of individual cities during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 compared to 2019. We apply these estimates to quantify NO 2 changes in more than 200 cities, including 65 cities without available ground monitoring, largely in lower-income regions. Mean country-level population-weighted NO 2 concentrations are 29% ± 3% lower in countries with strict lockdown conditions than in those without. Relative to long-term trends, NO 2 decreases during COVID-19 lockdowns exceed recent Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-derived year-to-year decreases from emission controls, comparable to 15 ± 4 years of reductions globally. Our case studies indicate that the sensitivity of NO 2 to lockdowns varies by country and emissions sector, demonstrating the critical need for spatially resolved observational information provided by these satellite-derived surface concentration estimates."

https://openalex.org/W4205959604,"Phase transitions connect different states of matter and are often concomitant with the spontaneous breaking of symmetries. An important category of phase transitions is mobility transitions, among which is the well known Anderson localization1, where increasing the randomness induces a metal-insulator transition. The introduction of topology in condensed-matter physics2-4 lead to the discovery of topological phase transitions and materials as topological insulators5. Phase transitions in the symmetry of non-Hermitian systems describe the transition to on-average conserved energy6 and new topological phases7-9. Bulk conductivity, topology and non-Hermitian symmetry breaking seemingly emerge from different physics and, thus, may appear as separable phenomena. However, in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, such transitions can be mutually interlinked by forming a triple phase transition10. Here we report the experimental observation of a triple phase transition, where changing a single parameter simultaneously gives rise to a localization (metal-insulator), a topological and parity-time symmetry-breaking (energy) phase transition. The physics is manifested in a temporally driven (Floquet) dissipative quasicrystal. We implement our ideas via photonic quantum walks in coupled optical fibre loops11. Our study highlights the intertwinement of topology, symmetry breaking and mobility phase transitions in non-Hermitian quasicrystalline synthetic matter. Our results may be applied in phase-change devices, in which the bulk and edge transport and the energy or particle exchange with the environment can be predicted and controlled."
https://openalex.org/W4205942662,"Vaccine hesitancy and emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) escaping vaccine-induced immune responses highlight the urgency for new COVID-19 therapeutics. Engineered angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein may prove to be especially efficacious against multiple variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we show that three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 protein markedly augmented the affinity for the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 isolate and multiple VOCs: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). In humanized K18-hACE2 mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 or P.1 variant, prophylactic and therapeutic injections of soluble ACE22.v2.4-IgG1 prevented lung vascular injury and edema formation, essential features of CoV-2-induced SARS, and above all improved survival. These studies demonstrate broad efficacy in vivo of an engineered ACE2 decoy against SARS-CoV-2 variants in mice and point to its therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W4206419859,"Fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm (polyspermy) leads to lethal genome imbalance and chromosome segregation defects. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the block to polyspermy is facilitated by a mechanism that prevents polytubey (the arrival of multiple pollen tubes to one ovule). We show here that FERONIA, ANJEA, and HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 receptor-like kinases located at the septum interact with pollen tube-specific RALF6, 7, 16, 36, and 37 peptide ligands to establish this polytubey block. The same combination of RALF (rapid alkalinization factor) peptides and receptor complexes controls pollen tube reception and rupture inside the targeted ovule. Pollen tube rupture releases the polytubey block at the septum, which allows the emergence of secondary pollen tubes upon fertilization failure. Thus, orchestrated steps in the fertilization process in Arabidopsis are coordinated by the same signaling components to guarantee and optimize reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W4221081445,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex disease that leads to motor neuron death. Despite heritability estimates of 52%, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered relatively few loci. We developed a machine learning approach called RefMap, which integrates functional genomics with GWAS summary statistics for gene discovery. With transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), RefMap identified 690 ALS-associated genes that represent a 5-fold increase in recovered heritability. Extensive conservation, transcriptome, network, and rare variant analyses demonstrated the functional significance of candidate genes in healthy and diseased motor neurons and brain tissues. Genetic convergence between common and rare variation highlighted KANK1 as a new ALS gene. Reproducing KANK1 patient mutations in human neurons led to neurotoxicity and demonstrated that TDP-43 mislocalization, a hallmark pathology of ALS, is downstream of axonal dysfunction. RefMap can be readily applied to other complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4206952071,"It is well known that affective and pleasant touch promotes individual well-being and facilitates affiliative social communication, although the neural circuit that mediates this process is largely unknown. Here, we show that social-touch-like tactile stimulation (ST) enhances firing of oxytocin neurons in the mouse paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) and promotes social interactions and positively reinforcing place preference. These results link pleasant somatosensory stimulation to increased social interactions and positive affective valence. We further show that tachykinin 1 (Tac1+) neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (l/vlPAG) send monosynaptic excitatory projections to PVH oxytocin neurons. Functionally, activation of PVH-projecting Tac1+ neurons increases firing of oxytocin neurons, promotes social interactions, and increases preference for the social touch context, whereas reducing activity of Tac1+ neurons abolishes ST-induced oxytocin neuronal firing. Together, these results identify a dipeptidergic pathway from l/vlPAG Tac1+ neurons to PVH oxytocin neurons, through which pleasant sensory experience promotes social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4206569790,"Microtubule (MT)–associated protein 7 (MAP7) is a required cofactor for kinesin-1–driven transport of intracellular cargoes. Using cryo–electron microscopy and single–molecule imaging, we investigated how MAP7 binds MTs and facilitates kinesin-1 motility. The MT-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7 bound MTs as an extended α helix between the protofilament ridge and the site of lateral contact. Unexpectedly, the MTBD partially overlapped with the binding site of kinesin-1 and inhibited its motility. However, by tethering kinesin-1 to the MT, the projection domain of MAP7 prevented dissociation of the motor and facilitated its binding to available neighboring sites. The inhibitory effect of the MTBD dominated as MTs became saturated with MAP7. Our results reveal biphasic regulation of kinesin-1 by MAP7 in the context of their competitive binding to MTs."

https://openalex.org/W4206552026,"In multicellular organisms, gene regulatory circuits generate thousands of molecularly distinct, mitotically heritable states through the property of multistability. Designing synthetic multistable circuits would provide insight into natural cell fate control circuit architectures and would allow engineering of multicellular programs that require interactions among distinct cell types. We created MultiFate, a naturally inspired, synthetic circuit that supports long-term, controllable, and expandable multistability in mammalian cells. MultiFate uses engineered zinc finger transcription factors that transcriptionally self-activate as homodimers and mutually inhibit one another through heterodimerization. Using a model-based design, we engineered MultiFate circuits that generate as many as seven states, each stable for at least 18 days. MultiFate permits controlled state switching and modulation of state stability through external inputs and can be expanded with additional transcription factors. These results provide a foundation for engineering multicellular behaviors in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W4205881884,"Flight speed is positively correlated with body size in animals1. However, miniature featherwing beetles can fly at speeds and accelerations of insects three times their size2. Here we show that this performance results from a reduced wing mass and a previously unknown type of wing-motion cycle. Our experiment combines three-dimensional reconstructions of morphology and kinematics in one of the smallest insects, the beetle Paratuposa placentis (body length 395 μm). The flapping bristled wings follow a pronounced figure-of-eight loop that consists of subperpendicular up and down strokes followed by claps at stroke reversals above and below the body. The elytra act as inertial brakes that prevent excessive body oscillation. Computational analyses suggest functional decomposition of the wingbeat cycle into two power half strokes, which produce a large upward force, and two down-dragging recovery half strokes. In contrast to heavier membranous wings, the motion of bristled wings of the same size requires little inertial power. Muscle mechanical power requirements thus remain positive throughout the wingbeat cycle, making elastic energy storage obsolete. These adaptations help to explain how extremely small insects have preserved good aerial performance during miniaturization, one of the factors of their evolutionary success."
https://openalex.org/W4205967011,"The biological basis of male–female brain differences has been difficult to elucidate in humans. The most notable morphological difference is size, with male individuals having on average a larger brain than female individuals1,2, but a mechanistic understanding of how this difference arises remains unknown. Here we use brain organoids3 to show that although sex chromosomal complement has no observable effect on neurogenesis, sex steroids—namely androgens—lead to increased proliferation of cortical progenitors and an increased neurogenic pool. Transcriptomic analysis and functional studies demonstrate downstream effects on histone deacetylase activity and the mTOR pathway. Finally, we show that androgens specifically increase the neurogenic output of excitatory neuronal progenitors, whereas inhibitory neuronal progenitors are not increased. These findings reveal a role for androgens in regulating the number of excitatory neurons and represent a step towards understanding the origin of sex-related brain differences in humans. Experiments in cerebral organoids show that sex hormones have a role in regulating the number of excitatory neurons in the human neocortex, providing insight into the mechanistic basis of sex-related brain differences in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4225995085,"Asymmetric multiprotein complexes that undergo subunit exchange play central roles in biology but present a challenge for design because the components must not only contain interfaces that enable reversible association but also be stable and well behaved in isolation. We use implicit negative design to generate β sheet–mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems."
https://openalex.org/W4206306369,"Inhibitory interneurons orchestrate prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity, but we have a limited understanding of the molecular and experience-dependent mechanisms that regulate synaptic plasticity across PFC microcircuits. We discovered that mGlu5 receptor activation facilitates long-term potentiation at synapses from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) onto somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) in mice. This plasticity appeared to be recruited during acute restraint stress, which induced intracellular calcium mobilization within SST-INs and rapidly potentiated postsynaptic strength onto SST-INs. Restraint stress and mGlu5 receptor activation each augmented BLA recruitment of SST-IN phasic feedforward inhibition, shunting information from other excitatory inputs, including the mediodorsal thalamus. Finally, studies using cell-type-specific mGlu5 receptor knockout mice revealed that mGlu5 receptor function in SST-expressing cells is necessary for restraint stress-induced changes to PFC physiology and related behaviors. These findings provide new insights into interneuron-specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms and suggest that SST-IN microcircuits may be promising targets for treating stress-induced psychiatric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4205811961,"Abstract Inorganic–organic hybrid materials represent a large share of newly reported structures, owing to their simple synthetic routes and customizable properties 1 . This proliferation has led to a characterization bottleneck: many hybrid materials are obligate microcrystals with low symmetry and severe radiation sensitivity, interfering with the standard techniques of single-crystal X-ray diffraction 2,3 and electron microdiffraction 4–11 . Here we demonstrate small-molecule serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (smSFX) for the determination of material crystal structures from microcrystals. We subjected microcrystalline suspensions to X-ray free-electron laser radiation 12,13 and obtained thousands of randomly oriented diffraction patterns. We determined unit cells by aggregating spot-finding results into high-resolution powder diffractograms. After indexing the sparse serial patterns by a graph theory approach 14 , the resulting datasets can be solved and refined using standard tools for single-crystal diffraction data 15–17 . We describe the ab initio structure solutions of mithrene (AgSePh) 18–20 , thiorene (AgSPh) and tethrene (AgTePh), of which the latter two were previously unknown structures. In thiorene, we identify a geometric change in the silver–silver bonding network that is linked to its divergent optoelectronic properties 20 . We demonstrate that smSFX can be applied as a general technique for structure determination of beam-sensitive microcrystalline materials at near-ambient temperature and pressure."

We found that reefs receiving larvae from highly connected dispersal corridors were associated with high fish species richness. Generally, larval ""sinks"" contained twice as much fish biomass as ""sources"" and exhibited greater resilience to human pressure when protected. Despite their potential to support biodiversity persistence and sustainable fisheries, up to 70% of important dispersal corridors, sinks, and source reefs remain unprotected, emphasizing the need for increased protection of networks of well-connected reefs."
https://openalex.org/W4206383357,"Black-hole-driven outflows have been observed in some dwarf galaxies with active galactic nuclei1, and probably play a role in heating and expelling gas (thereby suppressing star formation), as they do in larger galaxies2. The extent to which black-hole outflows can trigger star formation in dwarf galaxies is unclear, because work in this area has previously focused on massive galaxies and the observational evidence is scarce3-5. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf starburst galaxy previously reported to have a central massive black hole6-9, although that interpretation has been disputed because some aspects of the observational evidence are also consistent with a supernova remnant10,11. At a distance of approximately 9 Mpc, it presents an opportunity to resolve the central region and to determine if there is evidence for a black-hole outflow influencing star formation. Here we report optical observations of Henize 2-10 with a linear resolution of a few parsecs. We find an approximately 150-pc-long ionized filament connecting the region of the black hole with a site of recent star formation. Spectroscopy reveals a sinusoid-like position-velocity structure that is well described by a simple precessing bipolar outflow. We conclude that this black-hole outflow triggered the star formation."
https://openalex.org/W4206740007,"Across human societies, people form ""thick"" relationships characterized by strong attachments, obligations, and mutual responsiveness. People in thick relationships share food utensils, kiss, or engage in other distinctive interactions that involve sharing saliva. We found that children, toddlers, and infants infer that dyads who share saliva (as opposed to other positive social interactions) have a distinct relationship. Children expect saliva sharing to happen in nuclear families. Toddlers and infants expect that people who share saliva will respond to one another in distress. Parents confirm that saliva sharing is a valid cue of relationship thickness in their children's social environments. The ability to use distinctive interactions to infer categories of relationships thus emerges early in life, without explicit teaching; this enables young humans to rapidly identify close relationships, both within and beyond families."
https://openalex.org/W4205143772,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging-associated condition characterized by the clonal outgrowth of pre-leukemic cells that acquire specific mutations. Although individuals with CH are healthy, they are at an increased risk of developing myeloid malignancies, suggesting that additional alterations are needed for the transition from a pre-leukemia stage to frank leukemia. To identify signaling states that cooperate with pre-leukemic cells, we used an in vivo RNAi screening approach. One of the most prominent genes identified was the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. Loss of TRAF6 in pre-leukemic cells results in overt myeloid leukemia and is associated with MYC-dependent stem cell signatures. TRAF6 is repressed in a subset of patients with myeloid malignancies, suggesting that subversion of TRAF6 signaling can lead to acute leukemia. Mechanistically, TRAF6 ubiquitinates MYC, an event that does not affect its protein stability but rather represses its functional activity by antagonizing an acetylation modification."
https://openalex.org/W4205217297,"Introduction Although patients with severe COVID-19 are known to be at high risk of developing thrombotic events, the effects of anticoagulation (AC) dose and duration on in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients remain poorly understood and controversial. The goal of this study was to investigate survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients who received prophylactic or therapeutic dose AC and analyze the mortality rate with respect to detailed demographic and clinical characteristics. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective, observational study of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York who received either prophylactic (n = 158) or therapeutic dose AC (n = 153). Primary outcome was in-hospital death assessed by survival analysis and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. Results For the first 3 weeks of ICU stay, we observed similar survival curves for prophylactic and therapeutic AC groups. However, after 3 or more weeks of ICU stay, the therapeutic AC group, characterized by high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), had markedly higher death incidence rates with 8.6 deaths (95% CI = 6.2–11.9 deaths) per 1,000 person-days and about 5 times higher risk of death (adj. HR = 4.89, 95% CI = 1.71–14.0, p = 0.003) than the prophylactic group (2.4 deaths [95% CI = 0.9–6.3 deaths] per 1,000 person-days). Among therapeutic AC users with prolonged ICU admission, non-survivors were characterized by older males with depressed lymphocyte counts and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Our findings raise the possibility that prolonged use of high dose AC, independent of thrombotic events or clinical background, might be associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AKI, age, lymphocyte count, and cardiovascular disease may represent important risk factors that could help identify at-risk patients who require long-term hospitalization with therapeutic dose AC treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4205366574,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in late 2019, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The risk factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and COVID-19 are reported to be common. This study aimed to determine the potential role of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common in IPF and COVID-19.Based on GEO database, we obtained DEGs from one SARS-CoV-2 dataset and five IPF datasets. A series of enrichment analysis were performed to identify the function of upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively. Two plugins in Cytoscape, Cytohubba and MCODE, were utilized to identify hub genes after a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Finally, candidate drugs were predicted to target the upregulated DEGs.A total of 188 DEGs were found between COVID-19 and IPF, out of which 117 were upregulated and 71 were downregulated. The upregulated DEGs were involved in cytokine function, while downregulated DEGs were associated with extracellular matrix disassembly. Twenty-two hub genes were upregulated in COVID-19 and IPF, for which 155 candidate drugs were predicted (adj.P.value < 0.01).Identifying the hub genes aberrantly regulated in both COVID-19 and IPF may enable development of molecules, encoded by those genes, as therapeutic targets for preventing IPF progression and SARS-CoV-2 infections."
https://openalex.org/W4206507119,"Arsenic is a carcinogenic groundwater contaminant that is toxic even at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level and its on-site determination remains challenging. Colorimetric test strips, though cheap and widely used, often fail to give reliable quantitative data. On the other hand, electrochemical detection is sensitive and accurate but considerably more expensive at the onset. Here, we present a study on arsenic detection in groundwater using a low-cost, open-source potentiostat based on Arduino technology. We tested different types of gold electrodes (screen-printed and microwire) with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV), achieving low detection limits (0.7 μg L -1 ). In a study of arsenic contaminated groundwaters in Mexico, the microwire technique provides greater accuracy than test strips (reducing the median error from -50% to +2.9%) and greater precision (reducing uncertainties from ±25% to ±4.9%). Most importantly, the rate of false negatives versus the World Health Organisation’s 10 μg L -1 limit was reduced from 50% to 0% (N = 13 samples). Arsenic determination using open-source potentiostats may offer a low-cost option for research groups and NGOs wishing to perform arsenic analysis in-house, yielding superior quantitative data than the more widely used colorimetric test strips."
https://openalex.org/W4206924397,"Advanced and aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) depends on glutamine for survival and proliferation. We have previously shown that inhibition of glutaminase 1, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of glutamine catabolism, achieves significant therapeutic effect; however, therapy resistance is inevitable. Here we report that while the glutamine carbon is critical to PCa survival, a parallel pathway of glutamine nitrogen catabolism that actively contributes to pyrimidine assembly is equally important for PCa cells. Importantly, we demonstrate a reciprocal feedback mechanism between glutamine carbon and nitrogen pathways which leads to therapy resistance when one of the two pathways is inhibited. Combination treatment to inhibit both pathways simultaneously yields better clinical outcome for advanced PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W4207065939,"Effective therapeutic options are still lacking for uveal melanoma (UM) patients who develop metastasis. Metastatic traits of UM are linked to BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) mutations. Cell metabolism is re-programmed in UM with BAP1 mutant UM, but the underlying mechanisms and opportunities for therapeutic intervention remain unclear. BAP1 mutant UM tumors have an elevated glycolytic gene expression signature, with increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and PDH kinase (PDHK1). Furthermore, BAP1 mutant UM cells showed higher levels of phosphorylated PDHK1 and PDH that was associated with an upregulated glycolytic profile compared to BAP1 wild-type UM cells. Suppressing PDHK1-PDH phosphorylation decreased glycolytic capacity and cell growth, and induced cell cycle arrest of BAP1 mutant UM cells. Our results suggest that PDHK1-PDH phosphorylation is a causative factor of glycolytic phenotypes found in BAP1 mutant UM and propose a therapeutic opportunity for BAP1 mutant UM patients."

No studies have examined the associations of various risk factors related to anthropometry, bone mineral density and body composition of specific body regions with hypertension and diabetes comorbidity (HDC). This study explored the association between HDC and various risk factors related to specific body regions.A total of 7,978 subjects (3,451 men and 4,527 women) aged ≥ 50 years were included in the analysis. A binary logistic regression analysis based on complex sample data analysis was conducted to examine associations between the normal and diabetes groups, between the normal and hypertension groups, and between the normal and HDC groups.Among Korean adults aged ≥ 50 years, 11.27% of men and 10.05% of women had both diabetes and hypertension. The HDC prevalence was higher in men than in women. In men, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR, adjusted OR = 1.63 [1.22-2.18], adjusted p<0.001) exhibited a more significant association with HDC than other indices, left leg fat mass (adjusted OR = 0.61 [0.45-0.81], adjusted p = 0.0009) and right leg fat mass (adjusted OR = 0.60 [0.45-0.81], adjusted p = 0.0007) displayed strong negative associations with diabetes, and left leg lean mass (adjusted OR = 0.77 [0.67-0.89], adjusted p = 0.0002) and trunk fat mass (adjusted OR = 1.28 [1.07-1.52], adjusted p = 0.0062) were significantly associated with hypertension. In women, left leg fat mass (adjusted OR = 0.29 [0.22-0.39], adjusted p<0.0001) and right leg fat mass (adjusted OR = 0.32 [0.23-0.45], adjusted p<0.0001) exhibited strong negative associations with HDC, waist circumference (WC) (adjusted OR = 2.15 [1.40-3.30], adjusted p = 0.0005) showed a stronger association with diabetes than did other indices, and WC (adjusted OR = 1.39 [1.11-1.74], adjusted p = 0.0040) and WHtR (adjusted OR = 1.39 [1.09-1.76], adjusted p = 0.0075) were significantly associated with hypertension.HDC was more strongly associated with fat and lean mass than diabetes and hypertension. The association between HDC and body fat variables was more robust in women than in men."
https://openalex.org/W4205612389,"Olfaction, one of the most important sensory systems governing insect behavior, is a possible target for pest management. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the antennal transcriptome of the cowpea beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), which is a major pest of stored pulses and legumes. The de novo antennal RNA-seq assembly results identified 17 odorant, 2 gustatory, and 10 ionotropic receptors, 1 sensory neuron membrane protein, and 12 odorant-binding and 7 chemosensory proteins. Moreover, differential gene expression analysis of virgin male and female antennal samples followed by qRT-PCR revealed 1 upregulated and 4 downregulated odorant receptors in males. We also performed homology searches using the coding sequences built from previously proposed amino acid sequences derived from genomic data and identified additional chemosensory-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W4206647906,"Hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia (HIL) of blood samples have been a concern in hospitals because they reflect pre-analytical processes' quality control. However, very few studies investigate the influence of patients' gender, age, and department, as well as sample-related turnaround time, on the incidence rate of HIL in fasting serum biochemistry specimens.A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted to investigate the incidence rate of HIL based on the HIL index in 501,612 fasting serum biochemistry specimens from January 2017 to May 2018 in a tertiary university hospital with 4,200 beds in Sichuan, southwest China. A subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the differences in the HIL incidence rate by gender, age and department of patients, and turnaround time of specimens.The incidence rate of hemolysis, lipemia and icterus was 384, 53, and 612 per 10,000 specimens. The male patients had a significantly elevated incidence of hemolysis (4.13% vs. 3.54%), lipemia (0.67% vs. 0.38%), and icterus (6.95% vs. 5.43%) than female patients. Hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus incidence rate were significantly associated with the male sex with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.174 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.140-1.208], 1.757 (95%CI: 1.623-1.903), and 1.303 (95%CI: 1.273-1.333), respectively, (P<0.05). The hospitalized patients had a higher incidence of hemolysis (4.03% vs. 3.54%), lipemia (0.63% vs. 0.36%), and icterus (7.10% vs. 4.75%) than outpatients (P<0.001). Specimens with relatively longer transfer time and/or detection time had a higher HIL incidence (P<0.001). The Pediatrics had the highest incidence of hemolysis (16.2%) with an adjusted OR (AOR) of 4.93 (95%CI, 4.59-5.29, P<0.001). The Neonatology department had the highest icterus incidence (30.1%) with an AOR of 4.93 (95%CI: 4.59-5.29, P<0.001). The Neonatology department (2.32%) and Gastrointestinal Surgery (2.05%) had the highest lipemia incidence, with an AOR of 1.17 (95%CI: 0.91-1.51) and 4.76 (95%CI: 4.70-5.53), both P-value <0.001. There was an increasing tendency of hemolysis and icterus incidence for children under one year or adults aged more than 40.Evaluation of HIL incidence rate and HIL-related influence factors in fasting serum biochemistry specimens are impartment to interpret the results more accurately and provide better clinical services to patients."
https://openalex.org/W4206467368,"The use of next generation sequencing is critical for the surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, transmission, as single base mutations have been identified with differences in infectivity. A total of 1,459 high quality samples were collected, sequenced, and analyzed in the state of Delaware, a location that offers a unique perspective on transmission given its proximity to large international airports on the east coast. Pangolin and Nextclade were used to classify these sequences into 16 unique clades and 88 lineages. A total of 411 samples belonging to the Alpha 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) strain of concern were identified, as well as one sample belonging to Beta 20H/501.V2 (B.1.351), thirteen belonging to Epsilon 20C/S:452R (B.1.427/B.1.429), two belonging to Delta 20A/S:478K (B.1.617.2), and 15 belonging to Gamma 20J/501Y.V3 (p.1). A total of 2217 unique coding mutations were observed with an average of 17.7 coding mutations per genome. These data paired with continued sample collection and sequencing will give a deeper understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 strains within Delaware and its surrounding areas."
https://openalex.org/W4206100249,"Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between breastfeeding and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in community-dwelling parous women and to clarify whether the associations depend on age. Methods The present cross-sectional study included 11,118 women, aged 35–69 years. Participants’ longest breastfeeding duration for one child and their number of breastfed children were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire, and their total breastfeeding duration was approximated as a product of the number of breastfed children and the longest breastfeeding duration. The longest and the total breastfeeding durations were categorized into none and tertiles above 0 months. Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia) were defined as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Associations between breastfeeding history and metabolic syndrome or each cardiovascular risk factor were assessed using multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis. Results Among a total of 11,118 women, 10,432 (93.8%) had ever breastfed, and 1,236 (11.1%) had metabolic syndrome. In participants aged &lt;55 years, an inverse dose–response relationship was found between the number of breastfed children and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome; multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 breastfed children were 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 1.17), 0.50 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.87), 0.44 (95% CI: 0.24 to 0.84), and 0.35 (95% CI: 0.14 to 0.89), respectively. The longest and total breastfeeding durations of longer than 0 months were also associated with lower odds of metabolic syndrome relative to no breastfeeding history in participants aged &lt;55 years. In contrast, all measures of breastfeeding history were not significantly associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors in participants aged ≥55 years old. Conclusions Breastfeeding history may be related to lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged parous women."
https://openalex.org/W4205256596,"Onion (Allium cepa L) is a major reservoir of important nutraceutical ingredients. Herein, nutraceutical profiling of elite germplasm was assessed and hybrids with improved nutraceutical quality were selected. The nutraceutical components were screened through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis (scan range 4000-400cm-1) followed by spectrophotometric/colorimetric quantification in oven dried bulb samples. Line × Tester (L×T) analysis was used to identify potential hybrids with better nutraceutical quality. Based on common functional groups obtained from FTIR analysis, as well as bulb color, the onion genotypes were categorized into six groups viz., white, yellowish brown, light brown, dark brown, brown and purplish brown. Results indicated that the purplish brown, yellowish brown and dark brown genotypes had maximum concentration of pyruvic acid, total flavonoids and total phenolic content, while vitamin C content showed weak association with color pigmentation. The onion variety 'Onion Swat' contained the highest level of pyruvic acid (17.18 μM) and 'MKS8823GO' had the highest vitamin C content (13.83mg/100mL). The L×T analysis revealed that out of 35 crosses, 'MKS-77127 × Onion Swat' and 'MKS-77127 × MKS777' were the best hybrids with improved nutraceutical quality. Further, observations for specific combining ability, general combining ability, genetic versus environmental variance, heritability and heterosis indicated that the studied parameters were genetically inherited and could be improved significantly by adopting an appropriate breeding strategy."
