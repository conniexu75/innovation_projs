https://openalex.org/W3217695149,"Research into the earliest development of inhibitory control is limited by a lack of suitable tasks. In particular, commonly used inhibitory control tasks frequently have too high language and working memory demands for children under 3 years of age. Furthermore, researchers currently tend to shift to a new set of inhibitory control tasks between infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, raising doubts about whether the same function is being measured. Tasks that are structurally equivalent across age could potentially help resolve this issue. In the current report, a new response inhibition task, the Early Childhood Inhibitory Touchscreen Task (ECITT), was developed. This task can be minimally modified to suit different ages, whilst remaining structurally equivalent. In the new task, participants have to overcome a tendency to respond to a frequently rewarded location on a touchscreen and instead make an alternative response. The ECITT was validated in three independent studies (with additional data, N = 166, reported in Supporting Information). In Study 1 (N = 81), cross-sectional data indicated that inhibitory performance on the task improved significantly between 24 and 30 months of age. In Study 2 (N = 38), longitudinal data indicated steady improvement in inhibitory control between 18, 21 and 24 months, with significant stability in individual performance differences between each consecutive age in terms of accuracy (but not in terms of reaction time). Finally, in Study 3 (N = 64), inhibitory performance on a faster-paced version of the same task showed a similar developmental course across the lifespan (4-84 years) to other response inhibition tasks and was significantly correlated with Stop-signal performance. The ECITT extends the assessment of response inhibition earlier than previous tasks-into early toddlerhood. Because the task is simple and structurally equivalent across age, future longitudinal studies should benefit from using the ECITT to investigate the development of inhibitory control in a consistent manner across the toddler years and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3215195370,"Mental health disorders represent an enormous cost to society, are related to economic outcomes, and have increased markedly since the COVID-19 outbreak. Economic activity contracted dramatically on a global scale in 2020, representing the worst crisis since the Great Depression. This study used the COVID Impact Survey to provide insights on the interactions of mental illness and economic uncertainty during COVID-19. We used a probability-based panel survey, COVID Impact Survey, conducted in the U.S. over three waves in the period April-June 2020. The survey covered individual information on employment, economic and financial uncertainty, mental and physical health, as well as other demographic information. The prevalence of moderate mental distress was measured using a Psychological Distress Scale, a 5-item scale that is scored on a 4-point scale (total range: 0-15). The mental distress effect of employment, economic, and financial uncertainty, was assessed in a logit regression analysis conditioning for demographic and health information. It is found that employment, health coverage, social security, and food provision uncertainty are additional stressors for mental health. These economic factors work in addition to demographic effects, where groups who display increased risk for psychological distress include: women, Hispanics, and those in poor physical health. A decrease in employment and increases in economic uncertainty are associated with a doubling of common mental disorders. The population-representative survey evidence presented strongly suggests that economic policies which support employment (e.g., job keeping, job search support, stimulus spending) provide not only economic security but also constitute a major health intervention. Moving forward, the economic uncertainty effect ought to be reflected in community level intervention and prevention efforts, which should include strengthening economic support to reduce financial and economic strain."
https://openalex.org/W3216949161,"The objective of this paper is to model lost Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from symptoms arising from COVID-19 disease in the UK population, including symptoms of 'long-COVID'. The scope includes QALYs lost to symptoms, but not deaths, due to acute COVID-19 and long-COVID. The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19, encompassing acute symptoms and long-COVID symptoms, was modelled using a decay function. Permanent injury as a result of COVID-19 infection, was modelled as a fixed prevalence. Both parts were combined to calculate QALY loss due to COVID-19 symptoms. Assuming a 60% final attack rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population, we modelled 299,730 QALYs lost within 1 year of infection (90% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 10% permanent injury) and 557,764 QALYs lost within 10 years of infection (49% due to symptomatic COVID-19 and 51% due to permanent injury). The UK Government willingness-to-pay to avoid these QALY losses would be £17.9 billion and £32.2 billion, respectively. Additionally, 90,143 people were subject to permanent injury from COVID-19 (0.14% of the population). Given the ongoing development in information in this area, we present a model framework for calculating the health economic impacts of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model framework can aid in quantifying the adverse health impact of COVID-19, long-COVID and permanent injury following COVID-19 in society and assist the proactive management of risk posed to health. Further research is needed using standardised measures of patient reported outcomes relevant to long-COVID and applied at a population level."
https://openalex.org/W3200748122,"Studies assessing the mental health of patients with COVID-19 infection remain limited. Disasters and major emergencies, not just COVID-19, undoubtedly lead to greater incidence of mental health problems. Previous studies indicate that the novel Coronavirus disease can cause panic and stress in patients. Our literature search didn’t reveal any previous published data from Cameroon and the Central African sub-region. In order to bridge this gap, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. We carried out a cross-sectional study in a secondary hospital in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. We recruited hospitalised COVID-19 patients during a 4-month period. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics. The HADS score was used to assess levels of anxiety and depression. All analysis were done using Stata 14. A P value of &lt;0.05 was used as the cut-off for statistical significance. A total number of 285 patients took part in this study with a mean age of 48.47 years. The prevalence of anxiety in COVID-19 patients was 60.35% while the prevalence of depression was 81.40%. At multivariate logistic regression male gender (OR: 1.89, P = 0.04), hypoxaemia (OR: 2.20, P = 0.01), presence of COVID-19 complications (OR: 1.61, P = 0.02) and current episode of depression (OR: 4.14, P&lt;0.01) were independently associated with anxiety. Similarly, age &gt; 35 years (OR:2.03, P = 0.02), presence of comorbidity (OR: 1.68, P = 0.01), BMI &gt; = 30kg/m2 (OR: 1.78, P = 0.02), presence of COVID-19 complications (OR: 1.28, P = 0.01) and anxiety (OR: 4.60, P&lt;0.001) were independently associated with depression. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 experienced high levels of anxiety and depression. Treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 should therefore include psychotherapy and psychiatric support."
https://openalex.org/W3215883321,"The soil-born filamentous fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC), which causes vascular wilt disease in banana plants, is one of the most economically important Fusarium species. Biocontrol using endophytic microorganisms is among the most effective methods for controlling banana Fusarium wilt. In this study, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) showed strong antifungal activity against FOC. Seventeen compounds were identified from the VOCs produced by endophytic fungi Sarocladium brachiariae HND5, and three (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 3,4-dimethoxystyrol and caryophyllene) showed antifungal activity against FOC with 50% effective concentrations of 36, 60 and 2900 μL/L headspace, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and double fluorescence staining revealed that 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 3,4-dimethoxystyrol damaged the plasma membranes, resulting in cell death. 3,4-dimethoxystyrol also could induce expression of chitin synthases genes and altered the cell walls of FOC hyphae. Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate staining indicated the caryophyllene induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FOC hyphae. FOC secondary metabolism also responded to active VOC challenge by producing less fusaric acid and expressions of genes related to fusaric acid production were interrupted at sublethal concentrations. These findings indicate the potential of S. brachiariae HND5 as a biocontrol agent against FOC and the antifungal VOCs as fumigants."
https://openalex.org/W3216614262,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic diversity and pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) are major barriers to successful antiretroviral therapy (ART). In China, sexual intercourse is the most frequent route of HIV-1 transmission. However, few studies have analyzed PDR and transmission networks in detail among individuals in China with acute HIV-1 infection and their sexual contacts.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Baoding City, Hebei Province, China from 2019-2020. CD4 T cell counts and viral loads were assessed and a HIV-1 genotypic PDR assay was developed in-house. Transmission networks were visualized using Cytoscape with a threshold genetic distance of 0.015 among HIV-1 subtypes.From 139 newly diagnosed and drug-naïve individuals with HIV-1, 132 pol gene sequences were obtained and revealed eight HIV-1 subtypes. Circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE was the most frequent subtype (53.0%, 70/132) followed by CRF07_BC (26.5%, 35/132), B (13.6%, 18/132), unique recombinant forms (2.3%, 3/132), CRF55_01B (1.5%, 2/132), CRF103_01B (1.5%, 2/132), CRF65_cpx (0.8%, 1/132), and C (0.8%, 1/132). A total of 47 pol gene sequences were used to generate 10 molecular transmission networks. The overall prevalence of PDR was 7.6% and that of PDR to non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors was 6.1%. Of three transmission networks for PDR, two were closely associated with Beijing and Tianjin, while another was restricted to sequences determined in this study.These results demonstrate that during acute HIV-1 infection, PDR is transmitted in dynamic networks. This suggests that early detection, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment are critical to effectively control HIV-1 spread."
https://openalex.org/W3215296178,"Malaria and anemia remain major public health challenges in Tanzania. Household socioeconomic factors are known to influence these conditions. However, it is not clear how these factors influence malaria transmission and anemia in Masasi and Nanyumbu Districts. This study presents findings on malaria and anemia situation in under-five children and its influencing socioeconomic factors in Masasi and Nanyumbu Districts, surveyed as part of an ongoing seasonal malaria chemoprevention operational study.A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020. Finger-prick blood samples collected from children aged 3-59 months were used to test for malaria infection using malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT), thick smears for determination of asexual and sexual parasitemia, and thin smear for parasite speciation. Hemoglobin concentration was measured using a HemoCue spectrophotometer. A structured questionnaire was used to collect household socioeconomic information from parents/caregivers of screened children. The prevalence of malaria was the primary outcome. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression models were used appropriately.Overall mRDT-based malaria prevalence was 15.9% (373/2340), and was significantly higher in Nanyumbu (23.7% (167/705) than Masasi District (12.6% (206/1635), p<0.001. Location (Nanyumbu), no formal education, household number of people, household number of under-fives, not having a bed net, thatched roof, open/partially open eave, sand/soil floor, and low socioeconomic status were major risks for malaria infection. Some 53.9% (1196/2218) children had anemia, and the majority were in Nanyumbu (63.5% (458/705), p<0.001. Location (Nanyumbu), mRDT positive, not owning a bed net, not sleeping under bed net, open/partially open eave, thatched window, sex of the child, and age of the child were major risk factors for anemia.Prevalence of malaria and anemia was high and was strongly associated with household socioeconomic factors. Improving household socioeconomic status is expected to reduce the prevalence of the conditions in the area."
https://openalex.org/W3215808529,"Platelet count/spleen longest diameter ratio (PSDR) is widely used in clinical practice due to its good performance in predicting esophageal varices (EV). We obtained spleen volume (SV) by magnetic resonance examination, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of platelet count/spleen volume ratio (PSVR) and spleen volume in predicting EV in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis. Methods: This study was a diagnostic accuracy experiment and retrospective, 199 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis who met the criteria were selected as the research subjects. All patients were collected blood samples in the morning on an empty stomach within 2 days, and related indicators were tested. Within 10 days, they received electronic gastroscopy and abdominal magnetic resonance examination. According to the Child-Pugh score, the patients were divided into groups with or without EV and with or without high-risk esophageal varices (HRV), then statistical analysis of the two groups was performed.The area under the curve (AUC) of PSVR in predicting EV or HRV in each group (85.5%-92.6%) was higher than PSDR, SV, spleen diameter, and platelet count. The AUC of PSDR in diagnosing HRV was higher than SV, and the AUC of SV in diagnosing EV was higher than PSDR, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). In Child-Pugh A patients, Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed PSVR could be a predictor of HRV (P<0.05), SV was a reliable predictor of EV (P<0.05).PSVR is better than PSDR, spleen diameter, platelet count in predicting EV; in the absence of serological results, SV could be used instead of PSDR. Both can predict EV or HRV of patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W3216234845,"With the highest HIV incidence and prevalence globally, the government of Eswatini started a substantial scale-up of HIV treatment and prevention services in 2011. Two sequential large population-based surveys were conducted before and after service expansion to assess the impact of the national response. Cross-sectional, household-based, nationally representative samples of adults, ages 18 to 49 years, were sampled in 2011 and 2016. We measured HIV prevalence, incidence (recent infection based on limiting antigen ≤1.5 optical density units and HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL), viral load suppression (HIV RNA <1000 copies/mL among all seropositive adults) and unsuppressed viremia (HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL among all, regardless of HIV status) and assessed for temporal changes by conducting a trend analysis of the log ratio of proportions, using a Z statistic distribution. HIV prevalence remained stable from 2011 to 2016 [32% versus 30%, p = 0.10]. HIV incidence significantly declined 48% [2.48% versus 1.30%, p = 0.01]. Incidence remained higher among women than men [2011: 3.16% versus 1.83%; 2016: 1.76% versus 0.86%], with a smaller but significant relative reduction among women [44%; p = 0.04] than men [53%; p = 0.09]. The proportion of seropositive adults with viral load suppression significantly increased from 35% to 71% [p < .001]. The proportion of the total adult population with unsuppressed viremia decreased from 21% to 9% [p < .001]. National HIV incidence in Eswatini decreased by nearly half and viral load suppression doubled over a five-year period. Unsuppressed viremia in the total population decreased 58%. These population-based findings demonstrate the national impact of expanded HIV services in a hyperendemic country."
https://openalex.org/W3217797836,"The therapeutic effect of low-voltage area (LVA)-guided left atrial (LA) linear ablation for non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (non-PAF) is uncertain. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of LA linear ablation based on the preexisting LVA and its effects on LA reverse remodeling in non-PAF patients.We retrospectively evaluated 145 consecutive patients who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for drug-refractory non-PAF. CARTO-guided bipolar voltage mapping was performed in atrial fibrillation (AF). LVA was defined as sites with voltage ≤ 0.5 mV. If circumferential pulmonary vein isolation couldn't convert AF into sinus rhythm, additional LA linear ablation was performed preferentially at sites within LVA.After a mean follow-up duration of 48 ± 33 months, 29 of 145 patients had drugs-refractory AF/LA tachycardia recurrence. Low LA emptying fraction, large LA size and high extent of LVA were associated with AF recurrence. There were 136 patients undergoing LA linear ablation. The rate of linear block at the mitral isthmus was significantly higher via LVA-guided than non-LVA-guided linear ablation. Patients undergoing LVA-guided linear ablation had larger LA size and higher extent of LVA, but the long-term AF/LA tachycardia-free survival rate was higher than the non-LVA-guided group. The LA reverse remodeling effects by resuming sinus rhythm were noted even in patients with a diseased left atrium undergoing extensive LA linear ablation.LVA-guided linear ablation through targeting the arrhythmogenic LVA and reducing LA mass provides a better clinical outcome than non-LVA guided linear ablation, and outweighs the harmful effects of iatrogenic scaring in non-PAF patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215099256,"In June 2016, Chile implemented the Law of Food Labelling and Advertising, which included a mandatory front-of-pack warning labels on food and beverages high in added sugar, saturated fat, sodium or energy density, restrictions on child-directed marketing and on the promotion and sales of these products in schools. The regulation does not include taxes although Chile had implemented a tiered tax on SSBs two years before this law was implemented. Therefore, the objective of the study was to simulate the impact of taxing food and beverages based on the cutoff's points for warning labels on purchases and revenues.We derived price elasticities using the linear approximation of the almost ideal demand system for six groups of labeled food and beverages (with a warning label based on the regulation) and unlabeled (with no warning label): 1) unlabeled beverages, 2) labeled beverages, 3) unlabeled cereal based products, 4) labeled cereal based products, 5) labeled meat and fish and 6) labeled sweet snacks and desserts. The study used data on household food beverage purchases from the Kantar WorldPanel Chile and Euromonitor sales to adjust the Kantar elasticity results to the national average. We estimated revenues under three tax scenarios for all labeled food and beverages: 10%, 20%, 30% of the final price excluding taxes.Except for labeled fish and meat, all food and beverage groups were price elastic. After accounting for a reduction in consumption after the taxes, economic and population growth, revenues for all groups could reach between 457 million USD to 1.3 billion USD. These results based on the much larger tax base of these labeled ""high in added sugar, salt or saturated fat or energy density"" foods and beverages is much larger.This fiscal package could be implemented in countries with warning labels to enhance health and welfare. The Chilean warning label front-of-the-package system provides an important guide for countries considering policies to reduce diet-related non communicable diseases, including obesity. The fiscal policy impact alone, as shown here for Chile, will be highly impactful in reducing ultra-processed food intake and generating revenues."
https://openalex.org/W3215344568,"The primary flavonoid, pinocembrin, is thought to have a variety of medical uses which relate to its reported anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer properties. Some studies have reported that this flavonoid has anti-fibrotic activities. In this study, we investigated whether pinocembrin would impede fibrosis, dampen inflammation and improve lung function in a large animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis was induced in two localized lung segments in each of the 10 sheep participating in the study. This was achieved via two infusions of bleomycin delivered bronchoscopically at a two-week interval. Another lung segment in the same sheep was left untreated, and was used as a healthy control. The animals were kept for a little over 5 weeks after the final infusion of bleomycin. Pinocembrin, isolated from Eucalyptus leaves, was administered to one of the two bleomycin damaged lung segments at a dose of 7 mg. This dose was given once-weekly over 4-weeks, starting one week after the final bleomycin infusion. Lung compliance (as a measure of stiffness) was significantly improved after four weekly administrations of pinocembrin to bleomycin-damaged lung segments. There were significantly lower numbers of neutrophils and inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage of bleomycin-infused lung segments that were treated with pinocembrin. Compared to bleomycin damaged lung segments without drug treatment, pinocembrin administration was associated with significantly lower numbers of immuno-positive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the lung parenchyma. Histopathology scoring data showed that pinocembrin treatment was associated with significant improvement in inflammation and overall pathology scores. Hydroxy proline analysis showed that the administration of pinocembrin did not reduce the increased collagen content that was induced by bleomycin in this model. Analyses of Masson's Trichrome stained sections showed that pinocembrin treatment significantly reduced the connective tissue content in lung segments exposed to bleomycin when compared to bleomycin-infused lungs that did not receive pinocembrin. The striking anti-inflammatory and modest anti-fibrotic remodelling effects of pinocembrin administration were likely linked to the compound's ability to improve lung pathology and functional compliance in this animal model of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3215430594,"The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Quebec, Canada, occurred at Verdun Hospital on February 25, 2020. A month later, a localized outbreak was observed at this hospital. We performed tiled amplicon whole genome nanopore sequencing on nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from 31 March to 17 April 2020 in 2 local hospitals to assess viral diversity (unknown at the time in Quebec) and potential associations with clinical outcomes. We report 264 viral genomes from 242 individuals–both staff and patients–with associated clinical features and outcomes, as well as longitudinal samples and technical replicates. Viral lineage assessment identified multiple subclades in both hospitals, with a predominant subclade in the Verdun outbreak, indicative of hospital-acquired transmission. Dimensionality reduction identified two subclades with mutations of clinical interest, namely in the Spike protein, that evaded supervised lineage assignment methods–including Pangolin and NextClade supervised lineage assignment tools. We also report that certain symptoms (headache, myalgia and sore throat) are significantly associated with favorable patient outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the strength of unsupervised, data-driven analyses whilst suggesting that caution should be used when employing supervised genomic workflows, particularly during the early stages of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3216854396,"Intimate partner sexual violence and non-partner rape experiences are widely reported by female students in South African higher education institutions, as they are globally. However, limited research has focused on investigating vulnerability factors, which is vital for informing interventions.To describe the factors and inter-relationships associated with female students' increased vulnerability to past year experience of partner sexual violence and non-partner rape in South African higher education settings.We interviewed 1293 female students, i.e., 519 students in six Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college campuses and 774 students at three university campuses. Participants were volunteers aged 18-30. The measured vulnerability factors included childhood sexual abuse, other trauma, mental ill-health, risky sexual behaviours, food insecurity, partner violence, and controlling behaviours. We used bivariate analysis, logistic regression, and structural equation modelling methods.Twenty percent of participants experienced past-year sexual violence (17% partner sexual violence and 7.5% non-partner rape). Childhood sexual abuse had direct effects on experiencing past year sexual violence and physical, emotional partner violence or controlling behaviours. Risky sexual behaviours mediated the relationships of childhood sexual abuse or harmful alcohol use and past-year sexual violence experience. Mental ill-health mediated the relationships between childhood sexual abuse, other traumatic exposures, food insecurity, physical, emotional partner violence or controlling behaviours, and past-year partner sexual violence or non-partner rape experience.Risky sexual behaviours, gender inequitable relationship dynamics, mental ill-health, and food insecurity are related and amenable vulnerability factors associated with female students' sexual violence experiences. Therefore, addressing these through comprehensive campus interventions, which are implemented when students first enrol in higher education and are most vulnerable to sexual violence, is critical. Society-wide sexual violence prevention is also imperative."
https://openalex.org/W3217043508,"The past two decades of research have raised gut microbiota composition as a contributing factor to the development of obesity, and higher abundance of certain bacterial species has been linked to the lean phenotype, such as Akkermansia muciniphila. The ability of pre- and probiotics to affect metabolic health could be via microbial community alterations and subsequently changes in metabolite profiles, modulating for example host energy balance via complex signaling pathways. The aim of this mice study was to determine how administration of a prebiotic fiber, polydextrose (PDX) and a probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 (B420), during high fat diet (HFD; 60 kcal% fat) affects microbiota composition in the gastrointestinal tract and adipose tissue, and metabolite levels in gut and liver. In this study C57Bl/6J mice (N = 200) were split in five treatments and daily gavaged: 1) Normal control (NC); 2) HFD; 3) HFD + PDX; 4) HFD + B420 or 5) HFD + PDX + B420 (HFD+S). At six weeks of treatment intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed, and feces were collected at weeks 0, 3, 6 and 9. At end of the intervention, ileum and colon mucosa, adipose tissue and liver samples were collected. The microbiota composition in fecal, ileum, colon and adipose tissue was analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing, fecal and liver metabolomics were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It was found that HFD+PDX intervention reduced body weight gain and hepatic fat compared to HFD. Sequencing the mice adipose tissue (MAT) identified Akkermansia and its prevalence was increased in HFD+S group. Furthermore, by the inclusion of PDX, fecal, lleum and colon levels of Akkermansia were increased and liver health was improved as the detoxification capacity and levels of methyl-donors were increased. These new results demonstrate how PDX and B420 can affect the interactions between gut, liver and adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3217593319,"Akkermansia muciniphila is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides within the gut mucus layer, and plays an important role in promoting gut barrier integrity, modulating the immune response and inhibiting gut inflammation. Growth stimulation of A. muciniphila by polyphenols including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) from difference sources is well-documented. However, no published in vitro culture data on utilization of polyphenols by A. muciniphila are available, and the mechanism of growth-stimulating prebiotic effect of polyphenols on it remains unclear. Here in vitro culture studies have been carried out on the metabolism of EGCG by A. muciniphila in the presence of either mucin or glucose. We found that A. muciniphila did not metabolize EGCG alone but could co-metabolize it together with both these substrates in the presence of mineral salts and amino acids for mucin and protein sources for glucose. Our metabolomic data show that A. muciniphila converts EGCG to gallic acid, epigallocatechin, and (-)-epicatechin through ester hydrolysis. The (-)-epicatechin formed is then further converted to hydroxyhydroquinone. Co-metabolism of A. muciniphila of EGCG together with either mucin or glucose promoted substantially its growth, which serves as a further demonstration of the growth-promoting effect of polyphenols on A. muciniphila and provides an important addition to the currently available proposed mechanisms of polyphenolic prebiotic effects on A. muciniphila."
https://openalex.org/W3217794423,"In boreal regions, the frequency of forest fires is increasing. In this study, thermogravimetric analysis was used to analyze the pyrolysis kinetics of dead surface combustibles in different forest types within the Daxing’an Mountains, China. The results show that the combustible material load of forest types, the Larix forest (LG) is relatively high. Base on the E of kinetic parameters, the LG, and Quercus forest (QM) forest types had relatively high combustibility values and comprehensive combustibility values for 1-, 10-, and 100-h time lags. According to the obtained P values, the pyrolysis of dead surface fuels with 1-, 10-, and 100-h time lags is relatively difficult in the Larix / Betula mixed forest (L-B) and QM forest types. Therefore, mixed forests of the LG, L-B, and QM tree species can be established as fire-resistant forests to establish a fire barrier, reduce the combustibility of forest stands, and reduce the possibility of forest fires."
https://openalex.org/W3161852659,"Certain facial features provide useful information for recognition of facial expressions. In two experiments, we investigated whether foveating informative features of briefly presented expressions improves recognition accuracy and whether these features are targeted reflexively when not foveated. Angry, fearful, surprised, and sad or disgusted expressions were presented briefly at locations which would ensure foveation of specific features. Foveating the mouth of fearful, surprised and disgusted expressions improved emotion recognition compared to foveating an eye or cheek or the central brow. Foveating the brow led to equivocal results in anger recognition across the two experiments, which might be due to the different combination of emotions used. There was no consistent evidence suggesting that reflexive first saccades targeted emotion-relevant features; instead, they targeted the closest feature to initial fixation. In a third experiment, angry, fearful, surprised and disgusted expressions were presented for 5 seconds. Duration of task-related fixations in the eyes, brow, nose and mouth regions was modulated by the presented expression. Moreover, longer fixation at the mouth positively correlated with anger and disgust accuracy both when these expressions were freely viewed (Experiment 2b) and when briefly presented at the mouth (Experiment 2a). Finally, an overall preference to fixate the mouth across all expressions correlated positively with anger and disgust accuracy. These findings suggest that foveal processing of informative features is functional/contributory to emotion recognition, but they are not automatically sought out when not foveated, and that facial emotion recognition performance is related to idiosyncratic gaze behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3214901738,"The prefrontal cortex is sensitive to stress experiences and significantly impacted by early life adversity. Cognitive flexibility is an executive function that is associated with positive outcomes in adulthood and implicated in activity in the prefrontal cortex. The relationship between early life adversity and cognitive flexibility is underreported. Using the cumulative risk model, we conducted two studies to examine the association between early life adversity and cognitive flexibility in college students and adults (cumulative N = 510). Exposure to early life adversity was assessed using the adverse childhood experiences scale (ACEs). Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Additionally, as perceived chronic stress is associated with impaired prefrontal cortex function, we measured that as well. Higher number of ACEs was correlated with lower number of completed categories on the WCST in both college students and adults. Perceived chronic stress was not associated with cognitive flexibility, but did correlate positively with ACEs. Individuals with a higher number of ACEs were also more likely to report higher levels of perceived chronic stress. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that exposure to adverse childhood experiences predicted lower scores on completed categories. Our findings provide further evidence that individuals with early life adversity exhibit reduced cognitive flexibility in adulthood."

However, it remains unclear whether ARBs confer a survival benefit on patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Here, we assessed the associations between ARB use and survival in patients with OSCC of different stages. Materials and methods This was a 10-year retrospective cohort study of OSCC patients. We enrolled 7,558 patients diagnosed with oral cancer between January 2007 and December 2017 whose details had been entered into the Chang Gung Research Database. Seven hundred and fourteen patients were recruited from the Chang Gung Research Database after performing 1:1 propensity score-matching between ARB users and non-users. Cox’s regression models with adjusted covariates were employed to detect factors influencing the survival rates of patients with OSCC. Results Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the overall survival (OS) rate of 180-day ARB users increased ( p = 0.038). Cox’s regression models indicated that ARB use, younger patients, early-stage OSCC, and patients without diabetes mellitus were independently prognostic of improved OS. Increased OS was more prominent in 180-day ARB users in stage III, Iva, and IVb categories. Conclusions ARB use for more than 180 days is associated with an increased survival rate and is a positive, independent prognostic factor in patients with OSCC. A further two-arm study should be conducted to confirm the clinical usefulness of ARBs in OSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3216651031,"The rapid development of advanced technology worldwide has promoted an increase in the need for highly skilled engineers who are adept at applying job-related technologies and have engineering competency (ENcom) to gain knowledge and introduce creative solutions. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of the associations between ICT competencies related to work (ICT-Work) and the ENcom of engineering students. This study sought to examine the role of ICT-Work on ENcom. Based on the literature, self-esteem and self-regulated learning (SRL) were identified as factors that indicate the effect of ICT-Work on ENcom, while gender was identified as a moderator that conditioned these mediated relationships. The sample consisted of 1,313 undergraduate engineering students from eleven universities in Thailand. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) showed positive direct and indirect effects of ICT-Work on ENcom, self-esteem, and SRL and confirmed that self-esteem and SRL mediate the impact of ICT-Work on ENcom. Moreover, multigroup SEM revealed no gender differences in the factor loadings and structural path coefficients of ICT-Work on ENcom via self-esteem and SRL. To prepare students for their professional lives in the digital world, educational institutions should emphasize the importance of developing engineering students in ICT-Work and the use of advanced ICT involved in the job."
https://openalex.org/W3217169888,"To understand the extent to which behaviors consistent with high quality medication reconciliation occurred in primary care settings and explore barriers to high quality medication reconciliation.Fully mixed sequential equal status design including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and surveys.Primary care practices within an integrated healthcare delivery system in the United States.We conducted 170 observations of patient encounters across 15 primary care clinics, 48 semi-structured interviews with staff, and 10 semi-structured interviews with patients. We also sent out surveys to 2,541 eligible staff with 616 responses (24% response rate) and to 5,132 eligible patients with 577 responses (11% response rate).Inconsistency emerged as a major barrier to effective medication reconciliation. This inconsistency was present across a variety of factors such as the lack of standardized workflows for conducting medication reconciliation, a lack of knowledge about medication and the process of medication reconciliation, varying levels of importance ascribed to medication reconciliation, and inadequate integration of medication reconciliation into clinical workflows. Findings were generally consistent across all data collection methods.We have identified several barriers which impact the process of medication reconciliation in primary care settings. Our key finding is that the process of medication reconciliation is plagued by inconsistencies which contribute to inaccurate medication lists. These inconsistencies can be broken down into several categories (standardization, knowledge, importance, and inadequate integration) which can be targets for future studies and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3217546711,"This study aimed to compare the quality of life and cost effectiveness between endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR) in young patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).This was a single-center, observational, and retrospective study.A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with AAA, who were <70 years old and underwent EVAR or OSR between January 2012 and October 2016. Only patients with aortic morphology that was suitable for EVAR were enrolled. Data on the complication rates, medical expenses, and expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected, and the cost per QALY at three years was compared.Among 90 patients with aortic morphology who were eligible for EVAR, 37 and 53 patients underwent EVAR and OSR, respectively. No significant differences were observed in perioperative cardiovascular events and death between the two groups. However, during the follow-up period, patients undergoing OSR showed a significantly lower complication rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.11; P = .021). From the three-year cost-effectiveness analysis, the total sum of costs was significantly lower in the OSR group (P < .001) than that in the EVAR group, and the number of QALYs was superior in the OSR group (P = .013). The cost per QALY at three years was significantly lower in the OSR group than that in the EVAR group (mean: $4038 vs. $10 137; respectively; P < .001).OSR had lower complication rates and better cost-effectiveness than EVAR Among young patients with feasible aortic anatomy."
https://openalex.org/W3217639143,"Psychomotor change is a core symptom of depression and one of the criteria in diagnosing depressive disorders. Research suggests depressed individuals demonstrate deviations in gait, or walking, compared to non-depressed controls. However, studies are sparse, often limited to older adults and observational gait assessment. It is also unclear if gait changes are due to dysregulation of affect, a core feature of depression. The current study addressed this gap by investigating the relation between positive and negative affect, depressive symptom severity, and gait in young adults.Using three-dimensional motion capture, gait parameters (velocity, stride length, and step time) were attained from 90 young adults during a task where they walked ten meters at their own pace overground in a laboratory for ten minutes. Self-report measures of mood and affect were collected.On average, the study population reported high negative and low positive affect. Contrary to our hypotheses, hierarchical regressions demonstrated no significant associations between gait parameters and affective or depressive symptoms (ps>.05).Our findings do not support a relation between affective symptoms and gait parameters. The results may indicate age-dependent gait pathology or that other symptoms of depression may influence gait more strongly than affect. They may also reflect an observational bias of gait changes in depressed young adults, one that is unsupported by objective data. Replication is warranted to further examine whether affective symptomology is embodied via gait differences in young adults."

In this validation study, we compared the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Test Ag Card with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in 214 participants who sought COVID-19 testing from a local public health district in Idaho, USA. The median age of participants was 35 and 82.7% were symptomatic. Thirty-seven participants (17.3%) had positive RT-PCR results. Results between the two tests were 94.4% concordant. The sensitivity of the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Test Ag Card was 67.6% (95% CI: 50.2-81.9%), and the specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 97.9-100.0%). The positive predictive value (PPV) for the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Test Ag Card was 100.0% (95% CI: 86.2-100.0%), and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.6% (95% CI: 89.1-96.6%). Although the sensitivity of BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Test Ag Card was lower than RT-PCR, rapid results and high specificity support its use for early detection of COVID-19, especially in settings where SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is not readily available. Rapid antigen tests, such as the BinaxNOW™ COVID-19 Test Ag Card, may be a more convenient tool in quickly identifying and preventing COVID-19 transmission, especially in rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W3215248284,"Expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats (TNR) in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is highly associated with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD). Due to limitations in the availability of DNA from diseased corneal endothelium, sizing of CTG repeats in FECD patients has typically been determined using DNA samples isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. However, it is non-feasible to extract enough DNA from surgically isolated FECD corneal endothelial tissue to determine repeat length based on current technology. To circumvent this issue, total RNA was isolated from FECD corneal endothelium and sequenced using long-read sequencing. Southern blotting of DNA samples isolated from primary cultures of corneal endothelium from these same affected individuals was also assessed. Both long read sequencing and Southern blot analysis showed significantly longer CTG TNR expansion (&gt;1000 repeats) in the corneal endothelium from FECD patients than those characterized in leukocytes from the same individuals (&lt;90 repeats). Our findings suggest that the TCF4 CTG repeat expansions in the FECD corneal endothelium are much longer than those found in leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3215534485,"Previous studies have shown an increase of insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) in animal models of neuropathic pain. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that reducing the expression of IGF2 using intrathecal IGF2 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) would attenuate the development of neuropathic pain in rats after spared nerve injury (SNI). Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated group, in which surgery was performed to cut the muscles without injuring the nerves; SNI group, in which SNI surgery was performed to sever the nerves; and SNI + siRNA IGF2 group, in which SNI surgery was performed, and IGF2-siRNA was administered intrathecally 1 day after SNI. The rats were assessed for mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia 1 day before surgery (baseline), and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days after siRNA treatment. The rat spinal cord was collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Compared with the SNI group, rats that received IGF2 siRNA showed a significantly increased SNI-induced paw-withdrawal threshold to metal filament stimulation from Day 4 to Day 10 after SNI surgery. IGF2 siRNA significantly decreased the response duration from the acetone test from Day 2 to Day 10 following SNI surgery. SNI increased IGF2 mRNA expression on Day 2 and increased IGF2 protein expression on Day 8 and Day 10 in the spinal cord of the SNI rats. However, the above-mentioned effects of IGF2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly inhibited in the SNI + IGF2 siRNA group. We demonstrated that intrathecal administration of IGF2 siRNA provided significant inhibition of SNI-induced neuropathic pain via inhibition of IGF2 expression in the spinal cord. The analgesic effect lasted for 10 days. Further exploration of intrathecal IGF2 siRNA administration as a potential therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3216109730,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the main causes of blindness in children worldwide. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), play critical protective roles in the development and function of neurons and vasculature. Lack of BDNF expression results in increased endothelial cell apoptosis and reduced endothelial cell-cell contact. Premature babies who develop ROP tend to have lower serum BDNF levels. BDNF expression is also significantly lower in mouse retinas following exposure to hyperoxia compared to those reared in room air. Specifically, BDNF promotes angiogenic tube formation of endothelial cells (EC), and it is considered an EC survival factor required for stabilization of intramyocardial vessels. We hypothesized that the activation of TrkB receptor protects retinal vasculature in the mice during oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR), a model of ROP. To test this hypothesis, we treated neonatal mice with 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF) (5 mg/kg body weight), a TrkB receptor agonist. We examined its potential protective effects on retinal vessel obliteration and neovascularization, two hallmarks of ROP and OIR. We found that retinas from DHF treated postnatal day 8 (P8) and P12 mice have similar levels of vessel obliteration as retinas from age-matched control mice subjected to OIR. Similarly, DHF showed no significant effect on mitigation of retinal neovascularization during OIR in P17 mice. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the TrkB receptor agonist DHF provides no significant protective effects during OIR."
https://openalex.org/W3216772149,"Introduction Eye-tracking research has been widely used in radiology applications. Prior studies exclusively analysed either temporal or spatial eye-tracking features, both of which alone do not completely characterise the spatiotemporal dynamics of radiologists’ gaze features. Purpose Our research aims to quantify human visual search dynamics in both domains during brain stimuli screening to explore the relationship between reader characteristics and stimuli complexity. The methodology can be used to discover strategies to aid trainee radiologists in identifying pathology, and to select regions of interest for machine vision applications. Method The study was performed using eye-tracking data 5 seconds in duration from 57 readers (15 Brain-experts, 11 Other-experts, 5 Registrars and 26 Naïves) for 40 neuroradiological images as stimuli (i.e., 20 normal and 20 pathological brain MRIs). The visual scanning patterns were analysed by calculating the fractal dimension (FD) and Hurst exponent (HE) using re-scaled range (R/S) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) methods. The FD was used to measure the spatial geometrical complexity of the gaze patterns, and the HE analysis was used to measure participants’ focusing skill. The focusing skill is referred to persistence/anti-persistence of the participants’ gaze on the stimulus over time. Pathological and normal stimuli were analysed separately both at the “First Second” and full “Five Seconds” viewing duration. Results All experts were more focused and a had higher visual search complexity compared to Registrars and Naïves. This was seen in both the pathological and normal stimuli in the first and five second analyses. The Brain-experts subgroup was shown to achieve better focusing skill than Other-experts due to their domain specific expertise. Indeed, the FDs found when viewing pathological stimuli were higher than those in normal ones. Viewing normal stimuli resulted in an increase of FD found in five second data, unlike pathological stimuli, which did not change. In contrast to the FDs, the scanpath HEs of pathological and normal stimuli were similar. However, participants’ gaze was more focused for “Five Seconds” than “First Second” data. Conclusions The HE analysis of the scanpaths belonging to all experts showed that they have greater focus than Registrars and Naïves. This may be related to their higher visual search complexity than non-experts due to their training and expertise."

Participants were equally distributed in two groups: according to the classification of vaginal smears according to Nugent criteria in normal (scores 0 to 3) and BV (scores ≥7). Cervicovaginal fluid samples were used for measurements of hBDs1, 2 and 3 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Levels of each hBD were compared between the two study groups using Mann-Whitney test, with p-value <0.05 considered as significant. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated for sociodemographic variables and hBD1-3 levels associated with BV a multivariable analysis. Correlation between Nugent score and measured levels of hBDs1-3 were calculated using Spearman's test.Cervicovaginal fluids from women with BV showed lower levels of hBD-1 [median 2,400.00 pg/mL (0-27,800.00); p<0.0001], hBD-2 [5,600.00 pg/mL (0-45,800.00); p<0.0001] and hBD-3 [1,600.00 pg/mL (0-81,700.00); p = 0.012] when compared to optimal microbiota [hBD-1: [median 3,400.00 pg/mL (0-35,600.00), hBD-2: 12,300.00 pg/mL (0-95,300.00) and hBD-3: 3,000.00 pg/mL (0-64,300.00), respectively].

Participant language was qualitatively assessed and key communication elements and communication gaps identified.Twenty-five in-office conversations, 14 follow-up physician dictations, and 17 telephone interviews were conducted with a total of 29 unique patients, 4 caregivers, and 14 physicians. In-office conversations were generally physician-driven and focused primarily on symptom frequency, location, and severity; lexicon from both parties centered on ""episodes"" and ""swelling."" During visits, impact on quality of life was not routinely assessed by physicians nor discussed proactively by patients; however, during telephone interviews and online, patients frequently described the multifaceted burden of HAE. Patients highlighted the difficulties they experience by using repetition, emphasis, and metaphors; they also varied the descriptors used for attacks depending on the communication goal. Physicians used intensifiers to emphasize the necessity of rescue medication access, whereas prophylactic treatments were positioned as an option for frequent or laryngeal attacks.Vocabulary differences suggest that the full impact of HAE is not consistently communicated by patients to physicians during clinical visits, indicating the potential for misaligned understanding of disease burden. A patient-driven, rather than physician-driven approach to the discussions may elicit valuable information that could help to optimize treatment approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3216053782,"Sentiment analysis is a branch of natural language analytics that aims to correlate what is expressed which comes normally within unstructured format with what is believed and learnt. Several attempts have tried to address this gap (i.e., Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, word embedding, etc.), even though the deep learning models achieved high performance, their generative process remains a “black-box” and not fully disclosed due to the high dimensional feature and the non-deterministic weights assignment. Meanwhile, graphs are becoming more popular when modeling complex systems while being traceable and understood. Here, we reveal that a good trade-off transparency and efficiency could be achieved with a Deep Neural Network by exploring the Credit Assignment Paths theory. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm which alleviates the features’ extraction mechanism and attributes an importance level of selected neurons by applying a deterministic edge/node embeddings with attention scores on the input unit and backward path respectively. We experiment on the Twitter Health News dataset were the model has been extended to approach different approximations (tweet/aspect and tweets’ source levels, frequency, polarity/subjectivity), it was also transparent and traceable. Moreover, results of comparing with four recent models on same data corpus for tweets analysis showed a rapid convergence with an overall accuracy of ≈83% and 94% of correctly identified true positive sentiments. Therefore, weights can be ideally assigned to specific active features by following the proposed method. As opposite to other compared works, the inferred features are conditioned through the users’ preferences (i.e., frequency degree) and via the activation’s derivatives (i.e., reject feature if not scored). Future direction will address the inductive aspect of graph embeddings to include dynamic graph structures and expand the model resiliency by considering other datasets like SemEval task7, covid-19 tweets, etc."

Interrupting TB treatment means that patients remain infectious for longer time and are at risk of developing drug resistance and death. This study was conducted to identify and describe predictors of TB treatment interruption.A cohort of 291 notified TB patients from 20 selected health facilities in Vihiga County were enrolled in to the study and followed up until the end of treatment. Patient characteristics that potentially predict treatment interruption were recorded during treatment initiation using structured questionnaires. Patients who interrupted treatment were traced and reasons for stoppage of treatment recorded. Kaplan Meier method was used to estimate probabilities of treatment interruption by patient characteristics and determine time intervals. The Log rank test for the equality of survival distributions analyzed significance of survival differences among categorical variables. For multivariable analysis, Cox proportional hazard model, was fitted to identify predictors of TB treatment interruption through calculation of hazard ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). For variable analysis, statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0.05. Reasons for treatment interruption were categorized according to most recurrent behavioral or experiential characteristics.Participants' median age was 40 years (IQR = 32-53) and 72% were male. Of the 291 patients, 11% (n = 32) interrupted treatment. Incidences of treatment interruption significantly occurred during intensive phase of treatment. Independent predictors of treatment interruption included alcohol consumption (HR = 9.2, 95% CI; 2.6-32.5, p < 0.001), being female (HR = 5.01, 95% CI; 1.68-15.0, p = 0.004), having primary or lower education level (HR = 3.09, 95% CI; 1.13-8.49, p < 0.029) and having a treatment supporter (HR = 0.33, 95% CI; 0.14-0.76, p = 0.009). Reasons for interrupting treatment were categorized as: alcoholism, feeling better after treatment initiation, associated TB stigma, long distance to health facility, lack of food, perception of not having TB and pill burden.TB treatment interruption was high and largely associated with patients' socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics. These multidimensional factors suggest the need for interventions that not only target individual patients but also environment in which they live and receive healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W3216236634,"Anthropogenic air pollution has been implicated in aberrant changes of DNA methylation and homocysteine increase (>15μM/L). Folate (<3 ng/mL) and vitamin B12 (<220 pg/mL) deficiencies also reduce global DNA methylation via homocysteine increase. Although B-vitamin supplements can attenuate epigenetic effects of air pollution but such understanding in population-specific studies are lacking. Hence, the present study aims to understand the role of air pollution, homocysteine, and nutritional deficiencies on methylation.We examined cross-sectionally, homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 (chemiluminescence) and global DNA methylation (colorimetric ELISA Assay) among 274 and 270 individuals from low- and high- polluted areas, respectively, from a single Mendelian population. Global DNA methylation results were obtained on 254 and 258 samples from low- and high- polluted areas, respectively.Significant decline in median global DNA methylation was seen as a result of air pollution [high-0.84 (0.37-1.97) vs. low-0.96 (0.45-2.75), p = 0.01]. High homocysteine in combination with air pollution significantly reduced global DNA methylation [high-0.71 (0.34-1.90) vs. low-0.93 (0.45-3.00), p = 0.003]. Folate deficient individuals in high polluted areas [high-0.70 (0.37-1.29) vs. low-1.21 (0.45-3.65)] showed significantly reduced global methylation levels (p = 0.007). In low polluted areas, despite folate deficiency, if normal vitamin B12 levels were maintained, global DNA methylation levels improved significantly [2.03 (0.60-5.24), p = 0.007]. Conversely, in high polluted areas despite vitamin B12 deficiency, if normal folate status was maintained, global DNA methylation status improved significantly [0.91 (0.36-1.63)] compared to vitamin B12 normal individuals [0.54 (0.26-1.13), p = 0.04].High homocysteine may aggravate the effects of air pollution on DNA methylation. Vitamin B12 in low-polluted and folate in high-polluted areas may be strong determinants for changes in DNA methylation levels. The effect of air pollution on methylation levels may be reduced through inclusion of dietary or supplemented B-vitamins. This may serve as public level approach in natural settings to prevent metabolic adversities at community level."

Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners."

We characterised patients by their statin response (SR), baseline risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 10-year CVD outcomes.A multivariable model was developed using 183,213 United Kingdom (UK) patients without CVD to predict probability of sub-optimal SR, defined by guidelines as <40% reduction in LDL-C. We externally validated the model in a Hong Kong (HK) cohort (n = 170,904). Patients were stratified into four groups by predicted SR and 10-year CVD risk score: [SR1] optimal SR & low risk; [SR2] sub-optimal SR & low risk; [SR3] optimal SR & high risk; [SR4] sub-optimal SR & high risk; and 10-year hazard ratios (HR) determined for first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). Our SR model included 12 characteristics, with an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.71; UK) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.67-0.68; HK). HRs for MACE in predicted sub-optimal SR with low CVD risk groups (SR2 to SR1) were 1.39 (95% CI 1.35-1.43, p<0.001; UK) and 1.14 (95% CI 1.11-1.17, p<0.001; HK). In both cohorts, patients with predicted sub-optimal SR with high CVD risk (SR4 to SR3) had elevated risk of MACE (UK HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.32-1.40, p<0.001: HK HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.21-1.28, p<0.001).Patients with sub-optimal response to statins experienced significantly more MACE, regardless of baseline CVD risk. To enhance cholesterol management for primary prevention, statin response should be considered alongside risk assessment."

https://openalex.org/W3214935129,"An unbiased, widely accepted estimate of the rate of occurrence of new cases of autism over time would facilitate progress in understanding the causes of autism. The same may also apply to other disorders. While incidence is a widely used measure of occurrence, birth prevalence—the proportion of each birth year cohort with the disorder—is the appropriate measure for disorders and diseases of early childhood. Studies of autism epidemiology commonly speculate that estimates showing strong increases in rate of autism cases result from an increase in diagnosis rates rather than a true increase in cases. Unfortunately, current methods are not sufficient to provide a definitive resolution to this controversy. Prominent experts have written that it is virtually impossible to solve. This paper presents a novel method, time-to-event birth prevalence estimation (TTEPE), to provide accurate estimates of birth prevalence properly adjusted for changing diagnostic factors. It addresses the shortcomings of prior methods. TTEPE is based on well-known time-to-event (survival) analysis techniques. A discrete survival process models the rates of incident diagnoses by birth year and age. Diagnostic factors drive the probability of diagnosis as a function of the year of diagnosis. TTEPE models changes in diagnostic criteria, which can modify the effective birth prevalence when new criteria take effect. TTEPE incorporates the development of diagnosable symptoms with age. General-purpose optimization software estimates all parameters, forming a non-linear regression. The paper specifies all assumptions underlying the analysis and explores potential deviations from assumptions and optional additional analyses. A simulation study shows that TTEPE produces accurate parameter estimates, including trends in both birth prevalence and the probability of diagnosis in the presence of sampling effects from finite populations. TTEPE provides high power to resolve small differences in parameter values by utilizing all available data points."
https://openalex.org/W3214944187,"The process of brain death (BD) detrimentally affects donor lung quality. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique originally designed to evaluate marginal donor lungs. Nowadays, its potential as a treatment platform to repair damaged donor lungs is increasingly studied in experimental models. Rat models for EVLP have been described in literature before, yet the pathophysiology of BD was not included in these protocols and prolonged perfusion over 3 hours without anti-inflammatory additives was not achieved. We aimed to establish a model for prolonged EVLP of rat lungs from brain-dead donors, to provide a reliable platform for future experimental studies. Rat lungs were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups (n = 7/group): 1) healthy, directly procured lungs, 2) lungs procured from rats subjected to 3 hours of BD and 1 hour cold storage (CS), 3) healthy, directly procured lungs subjected to 6 hours EVLP and 4), lungs procured from rats subjected to 3 hours of BD, 1 hour CS and 6 hours EVLP. Lungs from brain-dead rats showed deteriorated ventilation parameters and augmented lung damage when compared to healthy controls, in accordance with the pathophysiology of BD. Subsequent ex vivo perfusion for 6 hours was achieved, both for lungs of healthy donor rats as for pre-injured donor lungs from brain-dead rats. The worsened quality of lungs from brain-dead donors was evident during EVLP as well, as corroborated by deteriorated ventilation performance, increased lactate production and augmented inflammatory status during EVLP. In conclusion, we established a stable model for prolonged EVLP of pre-injured lungs from brain-dead donor rats. In this report we describe tips and pitfalls in the establishment of the rat EVLP model, to enhance reproducibility by other researchers."
https://openalex.org/W3215265459,"Establishing a universally applicable protocol to assess the impact of BRCA1 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) expression is a problem which has yet to be resolved despite major progresses have been made. The numerous difficulties which must be overcome include the choices of cellular models and functional assays. We hypothesised that the use of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells might facilitate the standardisation of protocols for classification, and could better model the disease process. We generated eight iPS cell lines from patient samples expressing either BRCA1 pathogenic variants, non-pathogenic variants, or BRCA1 VUSs. The impact of these variants on DNA damage repair was examined using a ɣH2AX foci formation assay, a Homologous Repair (HR) reporter assay, and a chromosome abnormality assay. Finally, all lines were tested for their ability to differentiate into mammary lineages in vitro. While the results obtained from the two BRCA1 pathogenic variants were consistent with published data, some other variants exhibited differences. The most striking of these was the BRCA1 variant Y856H (classified as benign), which was unexpectedly found to present a faulty HR repair pathway, a finding linked to the presence of an additional variant in the ATM gene. Finally, all lines were able to differentiate first into mammospheres, and then into more advanced mammary lineages expressing luminal- or basal-specific markers. This study stresses that BRCA1 genetic analysis alone is insufficient to establish a reliable and functional classification for assessment of clinical risk, and that it cannot be performed without considering the other genetic aberrations which may be present in patients. The study also provides promising opportunities for elucidating the physiopathology and clinical evolution of breast cancer, by using iPS cells."
https://openalex.org/W3216214536,"To determine 1-year attributable healthcare costs of bronchiolitis.Using a population-based matched cohort and incidence-based cost analysis approach, we identified infants <12 months old diagnosed in an emergency department (ED) or hospitalized with bronchiolitis between April 1, 2003 and March 31, 2014. We propensity-score matched infants with and without bronchiolitis on sex, age, income quintile, rurality, co-morbidities, gestational weeks, small-for-gestational-age status and pre-index healthcare cost deciles. We calculated mean attributable 1-year costs using a generalized estimating equation model and stratified costs by age, sex, income quintile, rurality, co-morbidities and prematurity.We identified 58,375 infants with bronchiolitis (mean age 154±95 days, 61.3% males, 4.2% with comorbidities). Total 1-year mean bronchiolitis-attributable costs were $4,313 per patient (95%CI: $4,148-4,477), with $2,847 (95%CI: $2,712-2,982) spent on hospitalizations, $610 (95%CI: $594-627) on physician services, $562 (95%CI: $556-567)] on ED visits, $259 (95%CI: $222-297) on other healthcare costs and $35 ($27-42) on drugs. Attributable bronchiolitis costs were $2,765 (95%CI: $2735-2,794) vs $111 (95%CI: $102-121) in the initial 10 days post index date, $4,695 (95%CI: $4,589-4,800) vs $910 (95%CI: $847-973) in the initial 180 days and $1,158 (95%CI: $1,104-1213) vs $639 (95%CI: $599-679) during days 181-360. Mean 1-year bronchiolitis costs were higher in infants <3 months old [$5,536 (95%CI: $5,216-5,856)], those with co-morbidities [$17,530 (95%CI: $14,683-20,377)] and with low birthweight [$5,509 (95%CI: $4,927-6,091)].Compared to no bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis incurs five-time and two-time higher healthcare costs within the initial and subsequent six-months, respectively. Most expenses occur in the initial 10 days and relate to hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3216980660,"In this paper we optimized QuEChERS method for extraction of nine pesticides viz. acephate, acetamiprid, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, profenofos (insecticides), carbendazim and tebuconazole (fungicides) and performed their quantitative estimation in okra crop by HPLC-UV and GC-ECD. Decontamination treatments namely washing with running tap water, soaking in lukewarm water (50-60°C), soaking in solutions of 1% NaCl, 5% NaHCO3, 2% CH3COOH, 0.01% KMnO4 and three commercial formulations were also done for ten minutes every time, to calculate the extent of pesticide removal from okra. Results revealed that the proposed extraction method was efficient, inexpensive, accurate, rapid and precise and can suitably be used for the simultaneous quantitative determination of the above pesticides. The standard curve was linear over the concentration range of 0.05-5μg g-1 with R2 close to one (0.999). Soaking of okra in 2% acetic acid and then washing proved as the best decontamination treatments for all the pesticides. It showed the highest relative decontaminating capacity in comparison to the other solutions tested. Since the pesticide residues are usually present in higher amount in vegetables being consumed, it is of utmost importance to keep an eye over the use of pesticides to protect the crops."
https://openalex.org/W3217412269,"Nigeria has low antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive pregnant women. In a previous cluster-randomized trial in Nigeria, Baby Shower events resulted in higher HIV testing coverage and linkage of pregnant women to ART; here, we assess outcomes of Baby Shower events in a non-research setting.Baby Shower events, including a prayer ceremony, group education, music, gifting of a ""mama pack"" with safe delivery supplies, and HIV testing with ART linkage support for HIV-positive pregnant women, were conducted in eighty sites in Benue State, Nigeria. Client questionnaires (including demographics, ANC attendance, and HIV testing history), HIV test results, and reported linkage to ART were analyzed. Descriptive data on HIV testing and ART linkage data for facility-based care at ANC clinics in Benue State were also analyzed for comparison.Between July 2016 and October 2017, 10,056 pregnant women and 6,187 male partners participated in Baby Shower events; 61.5% of women attended with a male partner. Nearly half of female participants (n = 4515, 44.9%) were not enrolled in ANC for the current pregnancy, and 22.3% (n = 2,241) of female and 24.8% (n = 1,532) of male participants reported they had never been tested for HIV. Over 99% (n = 16,240) of participants had their HIV status ascertained, with 7.2% of females (n = 724) and 4.0% of males (n = 249) testing HIV-positive, and 2.9% of females (n = 274) and 2.3% of males (n = 138) receiving new HIV-positive diagnoses. The majority of HIV-positive pregnant women (93.0%, 673/724) were linked to ART. By comparison, at health facilities in Benue State during a similar time period, 99.7% of pregnant women had HIV status ascertained, 8.4% had a HIV-positive status, 2.1% were newly diagnosed HIV-positive, and 100% were linked to ART.Community-based programs such as the faith-based Baby Shower intervention complement facility-based approaches and can reach individuals who would not otherwise access facility-based care. Future Baby Showers implementation should incorporate enhanced support for ART linkage and retention to maximize the impact of this intervention on vertical HIV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3215772186,"Cardiovascular risk stratification is often performed in patients considered for renal transplantation. In a single center, we sought to examine the association between abnormal stress testing with imaging and post-renal transplant major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using multivariable logistic regression. From January 2006 to May 2016 232 patients underwent renal transplantation and 59 (25%) had an abnormal stress test result. Compared to patients with a normal stress test, patients with an abnormal stress test had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD), and heart failure. Among those with an abnormal result, 45 (76%) had mild, 10 (17%) moderate, and 4 (7%) severe ischemia. In our cohort, 9 patients (3.9%) had MACE at 30-days post-transplant, 5 of whom had an abnormal stress test. The long-term MACE rate, at a median of 5 years, was 32%. After adjustment, diabetes (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12–5.00, p = 0.02), CAD (OR: 3.05, 95% CI 1.30–7.14, p = 0.01) and atrial fibrillation (OR: 5.86, 95% CI 1.86–18.44, p = 0.002) were independently associated with long-term MACE, but an abnormal stress test was not (OR: 0.83, 95% CI 0.37–1.92, p = 0.68). In conclusion, cardiac stress testing was not an independent predictor of long-term MACE among patients undergoing renal transplant."
https://openalex.org/W3215953419,"The effectiveness of micronutrient powder (MNP) on the health outcome of children is yet to be proved. Although studies identified the barriers to the use of MNP the underlying factors related to the barriers to the use of MNP are still unexplored. We examined the underlying factors associated with the barriers reported by the caregivers of the children aged 6-59 months in Bangladesh.We analyzed pooled data of 3, 634 caregiver-child dyads extracted from eight cross-sectional surveys. The surveys were conducted as part of an evaluation of the Maternal, Infant and Young Children Nutrition programme (phase 2) in Bangladesh. We performed univariate analysis to find the barriers reported by the caregivers of the children. We identified the underlying factors related to the reported barriers by performing multiple logistic regression analysis.The mostly reported barrier was perceived lack of need for MNP among the caregivers of the children (39.9%), followed by lack of awareness of the product (21.7%) and cost of the product (18.1%). Caregivers of older children (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.69; 95% CI: 1.43, 2.00) and caregivers who maintained good infant and young child feeding practices (aOR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.57) perceived more lack of need for MNP. Caregivers of the female children (aOR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.98) were less likely to report that their children disliked MNP compared to the caregivers of the male children.Programmes intended to effectively promote MNP among the caregivers of children aged 6-59 months should carefully consider the factors that could underlie the barriers to the use of MNP."
https://openalex.org/W3216574899,"The biosynthesis of chiral alcohols has important value and high attention. Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) mediated reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds is an interesting way of synthesizing single enantiomers of chiral alcohols due to the high enantio-, chemo- and regioselectivity of the enzymes. However, relatively little research has been done on characterization and apply of AKRs to asymmetric synthesis of chiral alcohols. In this study, the AKR from Candida tropicalis MYA-3404 (C. tropicalis MYA-3404), was mined and characterized. The AKR shown wider optimum temperature and pH. The AKR exhibited varying degrees of catalytic activity for different substrates, suggesting that the AKR can catalyze a variety of substrates. It is worth mentioning that the AKR could catalytic reduction of keto compounds with benzene rings, such as cetophenone and phenoxyacetone. The AKR exhibited activity on N,N-dimethyl-3-keto-3-(2-thienyl)-1-propanamine (DKTP), a key intermediate for biosynthesis of the antidepressant drug duloxetine. Besides, the AKR still has high activity whether in a reaction system containing 10%-30% V/V organic solvent. What's more, the AKR showed the strongest stability in six common organic solvents, DMSO, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol. And, it retains more that 70% enzyme activity after 6 hours, suggesting that the AKR has strong solvent tolerance. Furthermore, the protein sequences of the AKR and its homology were compared, and a 3D model of the AKR docking with coenzyme NADPH were constructed. And the important catalytic and binding sites were identified to explore the binding mechanism of the enzyme and its coenzyme. These properties, predominant organic solvents resistance and extensive substrate spectrum, of the AKR making it has potential applications in the pharmaceutical field."
https://openalex.org/W3217232129,"Tissue factor (TF) is the primary activator of the extrinsic coagulation protease cascade. Although TF plays roles in various pathological states, such as thrombosis, inflammatory diseases, cancer, and atherosclerosis, its involvement in bone metabolism remains unknown.The present study examined the roles of TF in delayed bone repair induced by a diabetic state in mice using wild-type (WT) and low TF-expressing (LTF) male mice. A diabetic state was induced by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (STZ).A prolonged diabetic state significantly reduced total and trabecular bone mineral densities (BMD) as well as cortical bone thickness in WT and LTF mice; these BMD parameters were similar between WT and LTF mice treated with or without STZ. The diabetic state induced in WT mice delayed the repair of the femur following injury. The diabetic state induced in LTF mice was associated with further delays in bone repair. In in vitro experiments, TF significantly decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclast formation and osteoclastogenic gene expression in RAW264.7 cells. However, it did not affect the gene expression levels of runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix as well as alkaline phosphatase activity in mouse primary osteoblasts.Low TF state was associated with enhanced bone repair delay induced by diabetic state in mice. The TF-induced suppression of bone remodeling may be a contributing factor to the protective effects of TF against delayed bone repair in a diabetic state."
https://openalex.org/W3217532441,"Despite the research support that street performance is generally a beneficial element to public space, the legitimacy of street performance remains controversial. One critical issue is that busking is often confused with begging. With a psychological perspective, the present research examines the distinction of busking from begging. Two studies approached the problem from the viewpoints of street performers and passersby, respectively. Study 1 (N = 188) surveyed street performers on their reasons for street performance and reasons for why donations to street performance should be acceptable. The respondents could articulate various features of street performance along which busking could be similar to and yet distinguishable from begging. Study 2 (N = 189) experimentally compared busking and begging in how they could affect people's perception of public space. Relative to public space with begging, public space with busking was perceived as significantly more comforting, more active, less prone to crimes, and overall more likeable. These descriptive (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) findings help to clarify the difference between busking and begging: Street performance is not merely an act of soliciting donations in public space, but it also possesses artistic and entertaining qualities that can in turn make public space more favorable. The current findings can inform the policy making and regulations of street performance. Moreover, since the present research was conducted in Hong Kong, it contributes a cultural perspective to the literature on street performance."
https://openalex.org/W3217533711,"Amblyseius eharai is a generalist predatory mite that consumes spider mites, rust mites, thrips, and pollen, with a high adaptability to various plants. To better understand ecological and behavioral aspects of this species, we investigated its functional response to different stages of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we compared its environmental adaptability with that of other referenced phytoseiids using a temperature-dependent model of the intrinsic rate of increase. We were able to calculate the functional response parameters of both sexes of A. eharai when preying on eggs or larvae of T. urticae and, for females only, when preying on the deutonymph of T. urticae. Among the various combinations tested herein, A. eharai females preying on T. urticae larvae had the highest attack rate and shortest handling time. For eggs of T. urticae, A. eharai showed a lower attack rate; however, its handling time for eggs was significantly shorter compared to other phytoseiids. Using T. urticae larva as a prey, the attack rate of female A. eharai was higher and the handling time of both sexes of this species was shorter than those of other phytoseiid mites. Amblyseius eharai populations can show maximum performance quickly due to this species' lower optimal temperature for population growth (28.1°C) compared to other phytoseiid mites. Thus, we provided evidence that this predatory mite has the potential to be a new, effective biological control agent of greenhouse pests such as T. urticae due to its high predation capacity and low optimal temperature."
