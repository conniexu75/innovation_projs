https://openalex.org/W1965286266,"Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone."

Here we describe Recon 2, a community-driven, consensus 'metabolic reconstruction', which is the most comprehensive representation of human metabolism that is applicable to computational modeling. Compared with its predecessors, the reconstruction has improved topological and functional features, including ∼2× more reactions and ∼1.7× more unique metabolites. Using Recon 2 we predicted changes in metabolite biomarkers for 49 inborn errors of metabolism with 77% accuracy when compared to experimental data. Mapping metabolomic data and drug information onto Recon 2 demonstrates its potential for integrating and analyzing diverse data types. Using protein expression data, we automatically generated a compendium of 65 cell type-specific models, providing a basis for manual curation or investigation of cell-specific metabolic properties. Recon 2 will facilitate many future biomedical studies and is freely available at http://humanmetabolism.org/."
https://openalex.org/W2035310463,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in older individuals. To accelerate the understanding of AMD biology and help design new therapies, we executed a collaborative genome-wide association study, including >17,100 advanced AMD cases and >60,000 controls of European and Asian ancestry. We identified 19 loci associated at P < 5 × 10−8. These loci show enrichment for genes involved in the regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results include seven loci with associations reaching P < 5 × 10−8 for the first time, near the genes COL8A1-FILIP1L, IER3-DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9 and B3GALTL. A genetic risk score combining SNP genotypes from all loci showed similar ability to distinguish cases and controls in all samples examined. Our findings provide new directions for biological, genetic and therapeutic studies of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1980009210,"Coagulation factor Xa is targeted by a new generation of antithrombotic drugs such as rivaroxaban. However, as excessive factor Xa inhibition can cause bleeding, the clinical use of factor Xa inhibitors would be enhanced by the availability of a specific antidote. Uma Sinha and her colleagues devise such an antidote, an inactive form of recombinant factor Xa that can bind to and neutralize factor Xa inhibitors, and demonstrate its efficacy in animal models. Inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa (fXa) have emerged as a new class of antithrombotics but lack effective antidotes for patients experiencing serious bleeding. We designed and expressed a modified form of fXa as an antidote for fXa inhibitors. This recombinant protein (r-Antidote, PRT064445) is catalytically inactive and lacks the membrane-binding γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain of native fXa but retains the ability of native fXa to bind direct fXa inhibitors as well as low molecular weight heparin–activated antithrombin III (ATIII). r-Antidote dose-dependently reversed the inhibition of fXa by direct fXa inhibitors and corrected the prolongation of ex vivo clotting times by such inhibitors. In rabbits treated with the direct fXa inhibitor rivaroxaban, r-Antidote restored hemostasis in a liver laceration model. The effect of r-Antidote was mediated by reducing plasma anti-fXa activity and the non–protein bound fraction of the fXa inhibitor in plasma. In rats, r-Antidote administration dose-dependently and completely corrected increases in blood loss resulting from ATIII-dependent anticoagulation by enoxaparin or fondaparinux. r-Antidote has the potential to be used as a universal antidote for a broad range of fXa inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1987155530,"This study shows that Parkinson's disease–associated mutant forms of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) impair chaperone-mediated autophagy in neurons, thereby reducing degradation of α-synuclein by this pathway and contributing to the accumulation of this protein observed in brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease. We found LRRK2 to be degraded in lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), whereas the most common pathogenic mutant form of LRRK2, G2019S, was poorly degraded by this pathway. In contrast to the behavior of typical CMA substrates, lysosomal binding of both wild-type and several pathogenic mutant LRRK2 proteins was enhanced in the presence of other CMA substrates, which interfered with the organization of the CMA translocation complex, resulting in defective CMA. Cells responded to such LRRK2-mediated CMA compromise by increasing levels of the CMA lysosomal receptor, as seen in neuronal cultures and brains of LRRK2 transgenic mice, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived dopaminergic neurons and brains of Parkinson's disease patients with LRRK2 mutations. This newly described LRRK2 self-perpetuating inhibitory effect on CMA could underlie toxicity in Parkinson's disease by compromising the degradation of α-synuclein, another Parkinson's disease–related protein degraded by this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2038632547,"Cancer vaccines have had limited success in eliminating tumors in patients. Here Willem Overwijk and colleagues report that one reason for the failure of peptide-based vaccines may be their formulation. Their research shows that peptides formulated in incomplete Freund's adjuvant sequester CD8+ T cells at the site of injection, leading to T cell dysfunction and eventual apoptosis. A peptide and adjuvant formulation that did not persist long term at the injection site showed superior ability to induce a functional antitumor T cell response. To understand why cancer vaccine–induced T cells often do not eradicate tumors, we studied immune responses in mice vaccinated with gp100 melanoma peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (peptide/IFA), which is commonly used in clinical cancer vaccine trials. Peptide/IFA vaccination primed tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, which accumulated not in tumors but rather at the persisting, antigen-rich vaccination site. Once there, primed T cells became dysfunctional and underwent antigen-driven, interferon-γ (IFN-γ)- and Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated apoptosis, resulting in hyporesponsiveness to subsequent vaccination. Provision of CD40-specific antibody, Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist and interleukin-2 (IL-2) reduced T cell apoptosis but did not prevent vaccination-site sequestration. A nonpersisting vaccine formulation shifted T cell localization toward tumors, inducing superior antitumor activity while reducing systemic T cell dysfunction and promoting memory formation. These data show that persisting vaccine depots can induce specific T cell sequestration, dysfunction and deletion at vaccination sites; short-lived formulations may overcome these limitations and result in greater therapeutic efficacy of peptide-based cancer vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2097656361,"Nilanjan Chatterjee and colleagues report a theoretical framework to assess the predictive performance of polygenic models for risk prediction, based on analysis of genome-wide association study data sets. Across a range of common diseases and quantitative traits, they examine how predictive performance depends on the sample size, the total heritability and the underlying effect-size distributions. We report a new method to estimate the predictive performance of polygenic models for risk prediction and assess predictive performance for ten complex traits or common diseases. Using estimates of effect-size distribution and heritability derived from current studies, we project that although 45% of the variance of height has been attributed to SNPs, a model trained on one million people may only explain 33.4% of variance of the trait. Models based on current studies allow for identification of 3.0%, 1.1% and 7.0% of the populations at twofold or higher than average risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and prostate cancer, respectively. Tripling of sample sizes could elevate these percentages to 18.8%, 6.1% and 12.2%, respectively. The utility of polygenic models for risk prediction will depend on achievable sample sizes for the training data set, the underlying genetic architecture and the inclusion of information on other risk factors, including family history."
https://openalex.org/W2101045506,"NNMT converts SAM to the stable metabolite 1-methylnicotinamide, which reduces the methylation potential of cancer cells and thereby alters their epigenetic state to heighten the expression of protumorigenic genes. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by a mechanism that is still poorly understood. Here we show using metabolomics that NNMT impairs the methylation potential of cancer cells by consuming methyl units from S-adenosyl methionine to create the stable metabolic product 1-methylnicotinamide. As a result, NNMT-expressing cancer cells have an altered epigenetic state that includes hypomethylated histones and other cancer-related proteins combined with heightened expression of protumorigenic gene products. Our findings thus point to a direct mechanistic link between the deregulation of a metabolic enzyme and widespread changes in the methylation landscape of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972346280,"Memory and associated plasticity mechanisms span different timescales, from fleeting to enduring. This study shows that, across species, mTORC2's control of actin dynamics is critical for long-term forms of memory and synaptic plasticity. A major goal of biomedical research is the identification of molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie memory storage. Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP). We also found a comparable impairment of LTM in dTORC2-deficient flies, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway. Actin polymerization was reduced in the hippocampus of mTORC2-deficient mice and its restoration rescued both L-LTP and LTM. Moreover, a compound that promoted mTORC2 activity converted early LTP into late LTP and enhanced LTM. Thus, mTORC2 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction."

However, how the repertoire of SCF complexes is sustained remains unclear. Real-time measurements of formation and disassembly indicate that SCFFbxw7 is extraordinarily stable, but, in the Nedd8-deconjugated state, the cullin-binding protein Cand1 augments its dissociation by one-million-fold. Binding and ubiquitylation assays show that Cand1 is a protein exchange factor that accelerates the rate at which Cul1-Rbx1 equilibrates with multiple F box protein-Skp1 modules. Depletion of Cand1 from cells impedes recruitment of new F box proteins to pre-existing Cul1 and profoundly alters the cellular landscape of SCF complexes.

Here, we demonstrate a protein exchange factor activity for Cand1 that resolves the conflicting biochemical and genetic data and together with other data on the Nedd8 conjugation cycle enables us to propose a specific model for how the cellular repertoire of CRL complexes is controlled. To reconcile the conflicting observations on Cand1, we sought to characterize the assembly properties of SCF complexes by developing a real-time assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) that monitors the binding dynamics between F box protein-Skp1 and Cul1-Rbx1. Fbxw7 coexpressed with Skp1 was tagged at its C terminus, via the Sortase reaction (Popp et al., 2009Popp M.W.-L. Antos J.M. Ploegh H.L.

The transpeptidation reaction was efficient (data not shown) and the tag did not compromise ubiquitylation activity (Figure S1A available online). We observed FRET when Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 was mixed with Cul1-Rbx1 in which the N terminus of Cul1 is fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFPCul1) (Figure 1A). The association rate constant (kon) for complex assembly, 4 × 106 M−1 s−1, was determined by monitoring donor CFPCul1-Rbx1 fluorescence at varying concentrations of Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 in a stopped flow apparatus (Figures 1B and 1C). The FRET observed in our assay could be competed away by excess nonfluorescent Skp2-Skp1 (Figure 1D). Using this chase assay, we measured a dissociation rate constant (koff) for SCFFbxw7 of 9 × 10−7 s−1, or 0.5 week−1 (Figure 1E). These measurements revealed an extraordinarily tight complex with a KD of 200 fM. Neddylation of Cul1 did not affect the maximum FRET efficiency in our assay nor the rate of association or dissociation of SCFFbxw7, confirming that the neddylation-induced major conformational change in Rbx1 and Cul1’s C-terminal domain does not affect the binding interface of F box protein-Skp1 to Cul1’s N-terminal domain (Figure 1C and S1B–S1D) (Zheng et al., 2002bZheng N.

To test whether this is a general property, we prepared cell lysate from 293 cells that expressed tetracycline-inducible, FLAG-tagged Cul1 and were substantially depleted of Cand1 by stable expression of a lentiviral shRNA construct (Tet-FLAGCul1 Cand1kd cells). SCF complexes should be stable in this lysate due to the near absence of Cand1. This lysate was either mock treated or supplemented with a large excess of pure Cand1. Addition of Cand1 resulted in reduced recovery of 20 of 21 F box proteins observed in FLAGCul1 immunoprecipitates, whereas the level of Rbx1 association was not significantly affected (Figure S2). To measure directly Cand1’s effect on SCF assembly in the absence of confounding factors that might be present in cell lysates, we added two-fold molar excess Cand1 to preformed pure SCFFbxw7 assembled from Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 and CFPCul1-Rbx1. We observed a significant reduction in FRET after 5 min, indicating that Cand1 interfered with this assemblage (Figure 2A). This observation was not an artifact of our FRET assay because when we repeated these experiments with neddylated CFPCul1-Rbx1, Cand1’s effect was eliminated (Figure 2B).Figure 2Cand1 Actively Removes Fbxw7-Skp1 from Cul1 by Altering Off RateShow full caption(A) As in Figures 1A and 1D except with the addition of 100 nM Cand1.(B) As in (A), except using neddylated CFPCul1.(C) The change in donor fluorescence versus time in a stopped flow apparatus upon addition of 150 nM Cand1 to 50 nM CFPCul1-Rbx1 preincubated with 50 nM Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1.(D) The single exponential observed rates of SCF disassembly for various Cand1 concentrations mixed with 5 nM CFPCul1-Rbx1 or 5 nM neddylated CFPCul1-Rbx1 preincubated with 5 nM Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1.

The short time span used for Figure 2A is in direct contrast to the slow dissociation of Fbxw7TAMRA in the presence of excess unlabeled Skp2-Skp1 observed in Figure 1E, suggesting that Cand1 was not a conventional competitive inhibitor that trapped Cul1-Rbx1 as it dissociated from Fbxw7-Skp1 but instead actively promoted the disassembly of the SCFFbxw7 complex. To directly test this hypothesis, we measured the loss of FRET in real time upon addition of Cand1 to a preformed complex in a stopped flow apparatus (Figure 2C). Titration of Cand1 revealed increasingly rapid rates of SCFFbxw7 dissociation that followed saturation kinetics with a maximum rate of 1.3 s−1 and a half maximal concentration (KM) of 26 nM (Figure 2D). To eliminate interference from reassociation of Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 with CFPCul1-Rbx1, we repeated our measurements with unlabeled Skp2-Skp1 competitor in the reaction (Figure 2D). The maximal rate of Cand1-dependent dissociation remained unchanged while the KM increased to 53 nM (Figure 2D). In agreement with previous results, SCFFbxw7 formed with neddylated Cul1 showed no Cand1-induced dissociation over 30 s (Figure 2D). However, when the reactions were allowed to proceed for hours, we observed that saturating Cand1 accelerated disassembly of neddylated SCFFbxw7 by 45-fold (Figure 2E). Four main points arise from this analysis. First, the KM of 53 nM sets an upper limit on the KD between Cand1 and CFPCul1-Rbx1. Second, the saturation kinetics reveal the existence of a transient complex that contained Cand1, CFPCul1-Rbx1, and Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1. Third, the maximal observed rate of 1.3 s−1 represents the rate of Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 dissociation from the transient complex, which is accelerated by greater than one-million-fold compared to the spontaneous dissociation of SCFFbxw7. Finally, neddylation of Cul1 attenuated the effect of Cand1 by 30,000-fold. These observations are reminiscent of a recent analysis that shows that binding of IκBα to NF-κB both slows the association of NF-κB with DNA and causes a significant increase in the rate of dissociation of NF-κB from DNA (Bergqvist et al., 2009Bergqvist S. Alverdi V. Mengel B. Hoffmann A. Ghosh G. Komives E.A. Kinetic enhancement of NF-kappaBxDNA dissociation by IkappaBalpha.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19328-19333Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed likely that Cand1’s dramatic effect on the dissociation rate of SCFFbxw7 would also be accompanied by a decrease in the rate of assembly of SCFFbxw7. However, in the presence of saturating Cand1, we measured an association rate of 2.2 × 106 M−1 s−1 for Fbxw7TAMRA-Skp1 and CFPCul1-Rbx1 (Figure 2F). This is equivalent (within the error of our measurements) to the association rate without Cand1 (Figure 1C). As expected, when CFPCul1 was modified with Nedd8, Cand1 also had no effect on the association rate (Figure 2F). The above result has profound implications for building a model of Cand1’s function. First, Cand1 is not a competitive inhibitor. Whereas competitive inhibitors decrease kon and have no effect on koff, Cand1 had no effect on kon but increased koff. Second, unlike allosteric inhibitors, such as IκBα, that decrease the association rate of their targets in addition to increasing the dissociation rate, Cand1 only affected the dissociation rate of SCFFbxw7. This specific type of behavior is found in the mechanism of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that actively promote the exchange of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for GDP from target GTPases (Klebe et al., 1995Klebe C.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors operate by a simple allosteric competitive mechanism.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15423-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these cases, GEF binding to its target GTPase increases the dissociation rate of guanine nucleotides yet does not inhibit their association rate. This is accomplished by toggling between stable GEF-GTPase and GTPase-nucleotide complexes through a transient GEF-GTPase-nucleotide ternary complex in which the dissociation rates of both GEF and nucleotide are dramatically increased relative to their stable binary complexes (Klebe et al., 1995Klebe C.

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors operate by a simple allosteric competitive mechanism.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15423-15429Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results thus far conform to this model. Both Fbxw7-Skp1 and Cand1 formed tight complexes with Cul1-Rbx1 and there exists a transient ternary intermediate that exhibited a greatly increased rate of Fbxw7-Skp1 dissociation from Cul1-Rbx1. If Cand1 conforms to the behavior of GEFs, Cand1’s dissociation rate from Cul1-Rbx1 should be very slow but should increase dramatically in the presence of F box protein-Skp1 complexes. To measure this, we first developed a dissociation assay in which we monitored competitive displacement of Cand1TAMRA from GST-Rbx1-Cul1 in the presence of 10-fold excess of unlabeled Cand1. Displacement was monitored either by native gel electrophoresis (Figures S3A and S3B) or rapid pull-down of GST on glutathione resin (Figure 3A). This protocol revealed that spontaneous dissociation of Cand1TAMRA from Cul1 was extremely slow, with a rate of 1.2 × 10−5 s−1 (Figure 3B). This explains why Ubc12 is unable to conjugate Nedd8 to Cul1 that is bound to"

https://openalex.org/W2077084538,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates adaptive responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that lysosomal degradation of the HIF-1α subunit by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a major regulator of HIF-1 activity. Pharmacological inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, such as bafilomycin and chloroquine, increased HIF-1α levels and HIF-1 activity, whereas activators of chaperone-mediated autophagy, including 6-aminonicotinamide and nutrient starvation, decreased HIF-1α levels and HIF-1 activity. In contrast, macroautophagy inhibitors did not increase HIF-1 activity. Transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, also negatively regulated HIF-1 activity. HIF-1α interacts with HSC70 and LAMP2A, which are core components of the CMA machinery. Overexpression of HSC70 or LAMP2A decreased HIF-1α protein levels, whereas knockdown had the opposite effect. Finally, hypoxia increased the transcription of genes involved in CMA and lysosomal biogenesis in cancer cells. Thus, pharmacological and genetic approaches identify CMA as a major regulator of HIF-1 activity and identify interplay between autophagy and the response to hypoxia."

https://openalex.org/W2097815293,"This Technical Report describes light-activatable metabotropic glutamate receptors based on synthetic photoswitchable tethered ligands, and demonstrates optogenetic control of G protein–coupled receptor activity in neurons in vivo and ex vivo. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of membrane signaling proteins, respond to neurotransmitters, hormones and small environmental molecules. The neuronal function of many GPCRs has been difficult to resolve because of an inability to gate them with subtype specificity, spatial precision, speed and reversibility. To address this, we developed an approach for opto-chemical engineering of native GPCRs. We applied this to the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to generate light-agonized and light-antagonized mGluRs (LimGluRs). The light-agonized LimGluR2, on which we focused, was fast, bistable and supported multiple rounds of on/off switching. Light gated two of the primary neuronal functions of mGluR2: suppression of excitability and inhibition of neurotransmitter release. We found that the light-antagonized tool LimGluR2-block was able to manipulate negative feedback of synaptically released glutamate on transmitter release. We generalized the optical control to two additional family members: mGluR3 and mGluR6. This system worked in rodent brain slices and in zebrafish in vivo, where we found that mGluR2 modulated the threshold for escape behavior. These light-gated mGluRs pave the way for determining the roles of mGluRs in synaptic plasticity, memory and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2116787729,"Different types of neurons are differentially susceptible to West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Michael Diamond and colleagues now show that cerebellar granule cell neurons (GCN) have a higher basal level of expression of type I interferon–inducible genes than cortical neurons, making GCN more resistant to infection by a variety of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including WNV. Although susceptibility of neurons in the brain to microbial infection is a major determinant of clinical outcome, little is known about the molecular factors governing this vulnerability. Here we show that two types of neurons from distinct brain regions showed differential permissivity to replication of several positive-stranded RNA viruses. Granule cell neurons of the cerebellum and cortical neurons from the cerebral cortex have unique innate immune programs that confer differential susceptibility to viral infection ex vivo and in vivo. By transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1 and Rsad2 (also known as Viperin)) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in granule cell neurons. Thus, neurons from evolutionarily distinct brain regions have unique innate immune signatures, which probably contribute to their relative permissiveness to infection."

Although the regulation of SMA-α expression has been the focus of many studies, there is presently only limited information concerning miRNA regulation of lung myofibroblast differentiation and the involvement of these miRNAs in pulmonary fibrosis. To determine the role of miR-145 in regulating lung myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis. Wild-type and miR-145–/– mice were studied. Lung fibrosis models and cell culture systems were employed. miR-145 mimics or inhibitors were transfected into pulmonary fibroblasts. Fibrogenic and contractile activities of lung fibroblasts were determined. We found that miR-145 expression is upregulated in TGF-β1-reated lung fibroblasts. miR-145 expression is also increased in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as compared to in normal human lungs. Overexpression of miR-145 in lung fibroblasts increased SMA-α expression, enhanced contractility, and promoted formation of focal and fibrillar adhesions. In contrast, miR-145 deficiency diminished TGF-β1 induced SMA-α expression. miR-145 did not affect the activity of TGF-β1, but promoted the activation of latent TGF-β1. miR-145 targets KLF4, a known negative regulator of SMA-α expression. Finally, we found that miR-145–/– mice are protected from bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. miR-145 plays an important role in the differentiation of lung myofibroblasts. miR-145 deficiency is protective against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, suggesting that miR-145 may be a potential target in the development of novel therapies to treat pathological fibrotic disorders.—Yang, S., Cui, H., Xie, N., Icyuz, M., Banerjee, S., Antony, V.

https://openalex.org/W1981046179,"A previous study reported the use of luminol for the detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity using optical imaging in infiltrating neutrophils under inflammatory disease conditions. The detection is based on a photon-emitting reaction between luminol and an MPO metabolite. Because of tissue absorption and scattering, however, luminol-emitted blue light can be efficiently detected from superficial inflammatory foci only. In this study we report a chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) methodology in which luminol-generated blue light excites nanoparticles to emit light in the near-infrared spectral range, resulting in remarkable improvement of MPO detectability in vivo. CRET caused a 37-fold increase in luminescence emission over luminol alone in detecting MPO activity in lung tissues after lipopolysaccharide challenge. We demonstrated a dependence of the chemiluminescent signal on MPO activity using MPO-deficient mice. In addition, co-administration of 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABAH), an irreversible inhibitor of MPO, significantly attenuated luminescent emission from inflamed lungs. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with a nonspecific inhibitor, L-NAME, had no effect on luminol-mediated chemiluminescence production. Pretreatment of mice with MLN120B, a selective inhibitor of IKK-2, resulted in suppression of neutrophil infiltration to the lung tissues and reduction of MPO activity. We also demonstrated that CRET can effectively detect MPO activity at deep tissue tumor foci due to tumor development-associated neutrophil infiltration. We developed a sensitive MPO detection methodology that provides a means for visualizing and quantifying oxidative stress in deep tissue. This method is amenable to rapid evaluation of anti-inflammatory agents in animal models."

Via its SH2 domains, SHP2 directly associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in growth factor receptors (e.g. EGF receptor) or, more commonly, in scaffolding proteins. These binding interactions guide SHP2 subcellular localization to its physiological substrates. Moreover, recruitment of SHP2 to these docking sites is also intimately coupled to SHP2 activation (6Sugimoto S. Wandless T.J. Shoelson S.E. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the N-SH2 domain-mediated SHP2 autoinhibition was revealed by the crystal structure of SHP2 (residues 1–527) lacking the C-terminal 66 residues (10Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2.Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The structure shows that the inactive form of SHP2 adopts a closed conformation with the N-SH2 domain interacting extensively with the PTP domain, directly blocking the phosphatase catalytic site. Thus, the N-SH2 domain has two nonoverlapping ligand binding sites: an intermolecular interaction with phosphopeptides from docking proteins and an intramolecular interaction with the PTP domain. A comparison of the SHP2 structure with those of the isolated N-SH2 domain both in the absence of and in complex with a Tyr(P) peptide suggests that these two sites may communicate with negative cooperativity and are linked via an allosteric change between two different SH2 domain conformations: an active Tyr(P) peptide-bound state and an inactive PTP domain interacting state. Engagement of the SH2-domain to specific Tyr(P)-based docking sequences is suggested to diminish its inhibitory interaction with the PTP domain, leading to SHP2 catalytic activation in the open conformation. Although SHP2 mutations are associated with a number of developmental and neoplastic disorders, the precise mechanism by which mutations in SHP2 cause diseases remains poorly understood. The vast majority of NS or neoplasia-associated mutations alter amino acid residues clustering at the interface between the N-SH2 and PTP domains. The PTP activity of either NS- or leukemia-associated SHP2 mutants is greater than that of wild type, indicating that these substitutions disrupt the autoinhibitory interface between the N-SH2 and catalytic domains to favor the open, active conformation, resulting in gain-of-function (GOF) effects (11Fragale A.

In contrast, mutations associated with LS reside in the PTP domain, cause reduced phosphatase activity, and are, therefore, deemed loss-of-function defects (14Tartaglia M. Martinelli S. Stella L.

These genetic and biochemical findings generated an enigma; How do mutations that provoke opposite effects on SHP2 phosphatase activity cause phenotypically similar disorders? To address this question, we hypothesize that pathogenic mutations alter not only SHP2 phosphatase activity but also its molecular switching mechanism to drive disease outcomes, and thus detailed understanding of the structure and function of SHP2 will yield new insights into the molecular features that underlie the diseases. Our results reveal that although LS mutants are catalytically impaired and adopt a closed conformation, they have an increased propensity for the open conformation. As a result, the LS mutants bind upstream activators preferentially and stay longer with the scaffolding adapters thus prolonging specific substrate turnover, which compensate for the reduced phosphatase activity. Thus, catalytically impaired LS-associated SHP2 mutants may engender GOF phenotypes. Pepsin was obtained from Sigma. Mass Spectrometry grade H2O and acetonitrile were from Burdick and Jackson. D2O (99.9 atom %D) was form Aldrich. Antibodies for ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, and Gab1 were from Cell Signaling Technology. SHP2/1–528 was cloned into pET-21a+ vector with His6 tag at the C terminus. Mutant SHP2 was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutant SHP2s were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by sequential chromatography of HiPrep 26 desalting column (GE Healthcare), cation exchange column packed with SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The purities were determined to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The crystal were grown at 20 °C in the hanging drops containing 1.5 ml of protein solution (8 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) and 1.5 ml of reservoir solution (20% PEG3350, 300 mm KCOOH). The addition of spermidine (100 mm, 0.3 ml) or CaCl2 (100 mm, 0.3 ml) to the drops improved the growth of well ordered crystals for wild-type SHP2 and the Y279C mutant, respectively. The crystals were transferred into the cryoprotectant buffer (30% PEG3350, 200 mm KCOOH, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) and flash-frozen by liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 19-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and were processed with HKL3000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The data were collected to 2.3 Å resolution in the P21212 space group. The wild-type SHP2 structure was solved by molecular replacement with Molrep (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. MOLREP. an automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl.

The structure refinement was carried out iteratively with phenix.refine in the PHENIX software suite (20Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W.

The refined structure had none (for the wild type) or 0.2% (for the Y279C mutant) of the residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The crystal structure of WT and Y279C as well as the structure of E76K generated in Coot by in silico mutation of WT were used to set up three simulation systems with xleap program in Amber9 software package (21Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The Amber biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6564) Google Scholar). Missing atoms and hydrogens were added, then the protein was neutralized by Na+ or Cl− counterions and solvated in a truncated octahedral box of TIP3P water with 9 Å buffer between the solute and box edge, and the amber ff03 force field was employed to generate the topology and parameter files. Each system was relaxed by two successive energy minimizations in sander program and followed by heating from 0 to 300 K for 50 ps with a restrain force constant of 10.0 kcal/mol·Å in the pmemd program. A 30-ns MD simulation in NPT ensemble (p = 1 atm, T = 300 K) was performed with the pmemd program. The SHAKE algorithm was employed, and the time step was set to 2.0 fs. Particle mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to treat the long range electrostatic interactions with a default cutoff of 10.0 Å. Both energies and coordinates were saved every 2 ps. Combined MD simulations and continuum solvation model MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area) (22Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y.

Res. 2000; 33: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar) was utilized to decompose the free energy into individual residue pairs, and the interdomain interaction energy was calculated by adding up the energy of all interface residue pairs. In detail, the energy decomposition was performed on a pairwise per-residue basis (DCTYPE = 3); the gas-phase energy and polar component of solvation free energy were calculated using molecular mechanics (MM = 1) and Onufriev's Generalized Born (GB) method (IGB = 2); the non-polar component was determined through the solvent-accessible surface area (GBSA = 2); the interior and exterior dielectric constants were set to 1 and 80, respectively. The entropy contribution was ignored (NM = 0) because it should be almost identical among these three systems. The calculations were performed on 1461 conformational snapshots extracted from MD trajectory from 0.8 to 30 ns at a time interval of 20 ps. Stock solutions of SHP2-WT (650 μm), E76K (568 μm), and Y279C (568 μm) (1–528) were prepared in a 1H2O-based buffer (pH 7.8). Deuterium exchange was initiated by dilution of each enzyme 20-fold in a similar deuterium 2H2O buffer (pD 7.8) held at ambient temperature. At set deuterium exchange time points (from 10 s to 1 h) the reaction was quenched by the addition of a cold 1H2O-based 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.3) at equal volume. For “peptide-based” mass spectrometry analysis, the quench solution contained solvated pepsin endoproteinase (Sigma) that would make a (1.5:1 (w/w) pepsin:SHP2 enzyme) ratio during digestion. Quenched sample was allowed to digest on ice for 4 min before injection. Sample peptides were loaded by autosampler onto a XBridge C18 2.5-Micron 2.1 × 50 mm (Waters) column that was submerged under ice. A Surveyor MS pump (Finnigan) was used to generate the chromatographic gradients. Peptides were separated in time using a steep gradient of acetonitrile (10–35% in 7.5 min) and electrosprayed into an LTQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan). Sequest (Thermo) was used to identify SHP2 peptic peptides. Peptides were accepted for analysis based upon XCorr value significance and identification in multiple sample runs. All peptide-based samples were manually prepared and run in triplicate with a general standard deviation per time point of <0.2Da. Unbiased peptide precursor ion peak envelope centroiding was performed using HX-express software (23Weis D.D. Engen J.R. Kass I.J. Semi-automated data processing of hydrogen exchange mass spectra using HX-Express.J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Significant deuterium exchange differences in SHP2 mutants relative to WT were mapped onto the SHP2 crystal structure in a “heat map” format. Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were conducted at 25 °C in a pH 7.0 buffer of 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by the addition of NaCl. Assay mixtures of 200 μl in total volume were set up in a 96-well plate. A substrate concentration range from 0.2 to 5 Km was used to determine the kcat and Km. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of wild-type or mutant SHP2. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 50 μl of 5 m sodium hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using a plate reader. The steady state kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot. PTP activity was assayed using pNPP as a substrate in a pH 7.0 buffer containing 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl at 25 °C. The assays were performed in 96-well plates with a final reaction volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme (catalytic domain of wild-type SHP2 or Y279C) to a reaction mixture containing pNPP (2 mm for the wild-type or 10 mm for Y279C) with various concentrations of the N-SH2 domain. For Ki determination, pNPP concentration was varied, whereas the N-SH2 domain was fixed at three different concentrations. The reaction rate was measured using a SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Data fitting was performed using SigmaPlot Kinetics module. The activation of the full-length SHP2 was carried out under the kcat/Km condition with pNPP as a substrate (with the concentration of pNPP more than 10-fold lower than the respective Km values). For wild-type SHP2, pNPP concentration was 0.2 mm, and the protein concentration was 1.75 μm. The full activation control was performed using 160 nm E76K mutant and 0.2 mm pNPP. For the Y279C SHP2 mutant, pNPP concentration was 0.5 mm, and the protein concentration was 3.5 μm. The full activation control was performed using 1.88 μm E76K/Y279C double mutant and 0.5 mm pNPP. Various amounts of the phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine (F2pmp)-derived IRS1 peptide SLN(F2Pmp)IDLDLVK up to 100 μm final concentration were added to the reaction. The percent activity was calculated with normalized linear reaction rates (rate per μm protein) with respect to the normalized control rate. Kd was obtained by fitting the data to Equation 1, % Activity=-[P0]K0+[P0]+KdKd+[P0]×C(Eq. 1) where P0 is the total concentration of the activating peptide, Kd is the dissociation constant of the SHP2·peptide complex, and C is the ratio of the basal and fully activated SHP2 activity. HEK293 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. WT or mutant SHP2 (E76K, D61Y, Y279C, T468M) cloned in the mammalian expression vector pCN-HA, a modified version of pcDNA3.1 that generated proteins with N-terminal HA tag, were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were serum-starved for an additional 6 h and then either left unstimulated or stimulated with EGF (5 or 50 ng/ml) for various times (0, 5, 10, 30 min). All growth factor were obtained from Calbiochem. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaVO3) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and clarified in a microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were measured by using Coomassie protein reagent. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. We determined the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of pNPP by the full-length (residues 1–528) and catalytic domain (residues 246–547) of wild-type SHP2, the most representative GOF mutants D61Y and E76K, and 2 of the most recurrent LS mutants, Y279C and T468M. As shown in Table 1, the activity of the full-length SHP2 was less than 5% that of the catalytic domain, in accord with the structural observation that the full-length SHP2 is in an autoinhibited, closed conformation. Consistent with the expectation that the GOF mutants are in an open, activated state, full-length D61Y and E76K exhibit kinetic parameters indistinguishable from those of the wild-type catalytic domain. In contrast, the kcat values for the catalytic domains of Y279C and T468M were 26- and 46-fold lower than that of the wild-type counterpart, indicating that LS-associated SHP2 mutants are catalytically impaired. Interestingly, the kcat values for the full-length Y279C and T468M were still 5- and 13-fold lower than those of their corresponding catalytic domains. These results suggest that full-length Y279C and T468M exist in a closed, autoinhibited conformation. Consistent with this prediction, full activity was restored to SHP2/Y279C when Glu-76 was replaced by a Lys, which likely disrupts the autoinhibitory mechanism.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant SHP2 with pNPP as a substrateSHP2kcatKms−1mmWT/CD6.4 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.3WT/FL0.31 ± 0.022.7 ± 0.2E76K/FL6.8 ± 0.33.4 ± 0.2D61Y/FL6.0 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.1Y279C/CD0.25 ± 0.0511.3 ± 0.5Y279C/FL0.052 ± 0.0037.6 ± 0.4E76K/Y279C/FL0.34 ± 0.048.4 ± 0.6T468M/CD0.14 ± 0.0022.4 ± 0.1T468M/FL0.011 ± 0.0012.1 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab To gain insight into LS mutations, we solved the structures of both wild-type and Y279C SHP2 (residues 1–528) at 2.3 Å resolution. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Both structures belong to the P21212 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The wild-type SHP2 structure (Fig. 1B) was very similar to that reported previously (10Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Crystal structure of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2.Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The D′E loop and the adjacent D′ and E β strands of the N-SH2 domain insert deeply into the catalytic cleft of the PTP domain, interacting with residues of the active site loops (i.e. the phosphate binding or P-loop, the Tyr(P) recognition loop, and the Q loop) to maintain SHP2 in the closed, autoinhibited conformation. Specifically, Asp-61 and Tyr-62 in the D′E loop mimic the interactions of a Tyr(P) substrate with the catalytic domain in which the side chain of Asp-61 forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the main chain amides of the P-loop and the side chains of the catalytic Cys-459, Arg-362, and Arg-465, whereas the side chain of Tyr-62 interacts with Tyr-279 within the Tyr(P)-recognition loop. These interactions sterically block access of substrates to the catalytic site and inhibit SHP2 phosphatase activity.TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statisticsSHP2/WTSHP2/Y279CData collectionSpace groupP21212P21212Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)54.85, 221.10, 40.3655.14, 225.12, 40.91α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Resolution (Å)2.30 (2.34-2.30)2.30 (2.34-2.30)Rmerge0.087 (0.628)0.081 (0.658)I/σI25.3 (2.9)31.1 (1.9)Completeness (%)95.6 (92.1)99.8 (100)Redundancy4.9 (4.9)7.3 (4.2)RefinementResolution (Å)2.302.30No. reflections21,76123,522Rwork/Rfree0.196/0.2550.209/0.266No. atomsProtein40244040Water150183B-factorsProtein48.149.4Water46.045.7Root mean square deviationsBond lengths Å)0.0080.008Bond angles (°)1.1431.115 Open table in a new tab Consistent with the prediction from our kinetic analyses, Y279C also existed in the closed, autoinhibited form (Fig. 1C).

Although the Y279C mutation can be unambiguously identified by the strong negative difference map around the phenol side chain (Fig. 1D), the overall Y279C structure was almost identical to that of the wild-type SHP2, with a root mean square deviation of 0.44 Å for 498 Cα atoms. A closer examination of both the wild-type and Y279C structures uncovered the molecular basis of the impaired activity for the Y279C mutant. Tyr-279 was located in the Tyr(P) recognition loop and was well conserved among the PTPs. In PTP1B, the cognate Tyr-46 sets the depth of the catalytic cleft, and its side chain π-π stacks with the benzene ring of Tyr(P) to assist substrate recognition and dephosphorylation (24Jia Z.

https://openalex.org/W2072551099,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) critically regulates mitosis through its dynamic localization to kinetochores, centrosomes and the midzone. The polo-box domain (PBD) and activity of PLK1 mediate its recruitment to mitotic structures, but the mechanisms regulating PLK1 dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we identify PLK1 as a target of the cullin 3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, containing the BTB adaptor KLHL22, which regulates chromosome alignment and PLK1 kinetochore localization but not PLK1 stability. In the absence of KLHL22, PLK1 accumulates on kinetochores, resulting in activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). CUL3-KLHL22 ubiquitylates Lys 492, located within the PBD, leading to PLK1 dissociation from kinetochore phosphoreceptors. Expression of a non-ubiquitylatable PLK1-K492R mutant phenocopies inactivation of CUL3-KLHL22. KLHL22 associates with the mitotic spindle and its interaction with PLK1 increases on chromosome bi-orientation. Our data suggest that CUL3-KLHL22-mediated ubiquitylation signals degradation-independent removal of PLK1 from kinetochores and SAC satisfaction, which are required for faithful mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2092285861,"Proteasome is central to proteostasis maintenance, as it degrades both normal and damaged proteins. Herein, we undertook a detailed analysis of proteasome regulation in the in vivo setting of Drosophila melanogaster. We report that a major hallmark of somatic tissues of aging flies is the gradual accumulation of ubiquitinated and carbonylated proteins; these effects correlated with a ~50% reduction of proteasome expression and catalytic activities. In contrast, gonads of aging flies were relatively free of proteome oxidative damage and maintained substantial proteasome expression levels and highly active proteasomes. Moreover, gonads of young flies were found to possess more abundant and more active proteasomes than somatic tissues. Exposure of flies to oxidants induced higher proteasome activities specifically in the gonads, which were, independently of age, more resistant than soma to oxidative challenge and, as analyses in reporter transgenic flies showed, retained functional antioxidant responses. Finally, inducible Nrf2 activation in transgenic flies promoted youthful proteasome expression levels in the aged soma, suggesting that age-dependent Nrf2 dysfunction is causative of decreasing somatic proteasome expression during aging. The higher investment in proteostasis maintenance in the gonads plausibly facilitates proteome stability across generations; it also provides evidence in support of the trade-off theories of aging."

Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight."
https://openalex.org/W2030740278,"The inhibitor-κB kinase-nuclear factor-κB (IKK-NF-κB) and epidermal growth factor receptor-activator protein-1 (EGFR-AP1) pathways are often co-activated and promote malignant behavior, but the underlying basis for this relationship is unclear. Resistance to inhibitors of IKKβ or EGFR is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Here, we reveal that both IKKα and β contribute to nuclear activation of canonical and alternate NF-κB/REL family transcription factors, and overexpression of signal components that enhance co-activation of the EGFR-AP1 pathway. We observed that IKKα and IKKβ exhibit increased protein expression, nuclear localization, and phosphorylation in HNSCC tissues and cell lines. Individually, IKK activity varied among different cell lines, but overexpression of both IKKs induced the strongest NF-κB activation. Conversely, siRNA knock down of both IKKs significantly decreased nuclear localization and phosphorylation of canonical RELA and IκBα and alternative p52 and RELB subunits. Knock down of both IKKs more effectively inhibited NF-κB activation, broadly modulated gene expression and suppressed cell proliferation and migration. Global expression profiling revealed that NF-κB, cytokine, inflammatory response and growth factor signaling are among the top pathways and networks regulated by IKKs. Importantly, IKKα and IKKβ together promoted the expression and activity of transforming growth factor α, EGFR and AP1 transcription factors cJun, JunB and Fra1. Knock down of AP1 subunits individually decreased 8/15 (53%) of IKK-targeted genes sampled and similarly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Mutations of NF-κB and AP1-binding sites abolished or decreased IKK-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter activity. Compounds such as wedelactone with dual IKK inhibitory activity and geldanomycins that block IKKα/β and EGFR pathways were more active than IKKβ-specific inhibitors in suppressing NF-κB activation and proliferation and inducing cell death. We conclude that IKKα and IKKβ cooperatively activate NF-κB and EGFR/AP1 networks of signaling pathways and contribute to the malignant phenotype and the intrinsic or acquired therapeutic resistance of HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2004351789,"Superoxide flashes are transient bursts of superoxide production within the mitochondrial matrix that are detected using the superoxide-sensitive biosensor, mitochondria-targeted circularly permuted YFP (mt-cpYFP). However, due to the pH sensitivity of mt-cpYFP, flashes were suggested to reflect transient events of mitochondrial alkalinization. Here, we simultaneously monitored flashes with mt-cpYFP and mitochondrial pH with carboxy-SNARF-1. In intact cardiac myocytes and purified skeletal muscle mitochondria, robust mt-cpYFP flashes were accompanied by only a modest increase in SNARF-1 ratio (corresponding to a pH increase of <0.1), indicating that matrix alkalinization is minimal during an mt-cpYFP flash. Individual flashes were also accompanied by stepwise increases of MitoSOX signal and decreases of NADH autofluorescence, supporting the superoxide origin of mt-cpYFP flashes. Transient matrix alkalinization induced by NH4Cl only minimally influenced flash frequency and failed to alter flash amplitude. However, matrix acidification modulated superoxide flash frequency in a bimodal manner. Low concentrations of nigericin (< 100 nm) that resulted in a mild dissipation of the mitochondrial pH gradient increased flash frequency, whereas a maximal concentration of nigericin (5 μm) collapsed the pH gradient and abolished flash activity. These results indicate that mt-cpYFP flash events reflect a burst in electron transport chain-dependent superoxide production that is coincident with a modest increase in matrix pH. Furthermore, flash activity depends strongly on a combination of mitochondrial oxidation and pH gradient.

https://openalex.org/W2087025991,"Reciprocal regulation of metabolism and signaling allows cells to modulate their activity in accordance with their metabolic resources. Thus, amino acids could activate signal transduction pathways that control cell metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of amino acids on fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) metabolism. We demonstrate that amino acids increase Fru-2,6-P2 concentration in HeLa and in MCF7 human cells. In conjunction with this, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity, glucose uptake, and lactate concentration were increased. These data correlate with the specific phosphorylation of heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB2) isoenzyme at Ser-483. This activation was mediated by the PI3K and p38 signaling pathways. Furthermore, Akt inactivation blocked PFKFB2 phosphorylation and Fru-2,6-P2 production, thereby suggesting that the above signaling pathways converge at Akt kinase. In accordance with these results, kinase assays showed that amino acid-activated Akt phosphorylated PFKFB2 at Ser-483 and that knockdown experiments confirmed that the increase in Fru-2,6-P2 concentration induced by amino acids was due to PFKFB2. In addition, similar effects on Fru-2,6-P2 metabolism were observed in freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes treated with amino acids, which indicates that these effects are not restricted to human cancer cells. In these cardiomyocytes, the glucose consumption and the production of lactate and ATP suggest an increase of glycolytic flux. Taken together, these results demonstrate that amino acids stimulate Fru-2,6-P2 synthesis by Akt-dependent PFKFB2 phosphorylation and activation and show how signaling and metabolism are inextricably linked."
https://openalex.org/W2158510407,"The objective of this study was to improve the biomechanical properties of engineered neotissues through promoting the development of collagen cross-links. It was hypothesized that supplementing medium with copper sulfate and the amino acid hydroxylysine would enhance the activity of lysyl oxidase enzyme to form collagen cross-links, increasing the strength and integrity of the neotissue. Neocartilage constructs were generated using a scaffoldless, self-assembling process and treated with copper sulfate and hydroxylysine, either alone or in combination, following a 2-factor, full-factorial study design. Following a 6-wk culture period, the biomechanical and biochemical properties of the constructs were measured. Results found copper sulfate to significantly increase pyridinoline (PYR) cross-links in all copper sulfate-containing groups over controls. When copper sulfate and hydroxylysine were combined, the result was synergistic, with a 10-fold increase in PYR content over controls. This increase in PYR cross-links manifested in a 3.3-fold significant increase in the tensile properties of the copper sulfate + hydroxylysine group. In addition, an 123% increase over control values was detected in the copper sulfate group in terms of the aggregate modulus. These data elucidate the role of copper sulfate and hydroxylysine toward improving the biomechanical properties of neotissues through collagen cross-linking enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1973304938,"Approximately 50% of melanomas depend on mutant B-RAF for proliferation, metastasis and survival. The inhibition of oncogenic B-RAF with highly targeted compounds has produced remarkable albeit short-lived clinical responses in B-RAF mutant melanoma patients. Reactivation of signaling downstream of B-RAF is frequently associated with acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibitors, and the identification of B-RAF targets may provide new strategies for managing melanoma. Oncogenic B-RAFV600E is known to promote the stabilizing phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, implicated in melanoma survival and chemoresistance. We now show that B-RAFV600E signaling also induces the transcription of Mcl-1 in melanocytes and melanoma. We demonstrate that activation of STAT3 serine-727 and tyrosine-705 phosphorylations is promoted by B-RAFV600E activity and that the Mcl-1 promoter is dependent on a STAT consensus-site for B-RAF-mediated activation. Consequently, suppression of STAT3 activity disrupted B-RAFV600E-mediated induction of Mcl-1 and reduced melanoma cell survival. We propose that STAT3 has a central role in the survival and contributes to chemoresistance of B-RAFV600E melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1976868184,"Sirt1 is a NAD+-dependent class III deacetylase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. In addition to its well-characterized effects in peripheral tissues, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal Sirt1 activity plays a role in the central regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. To assess this idea, we generated Sirt1 neuron-specific knockout (SINKO) mice. On both standard chow and HFD, SINKO mice were more insulin sensitive than Sirt1f/f mice. Thus, SINKO mice had lower fasting insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. Hypothalamic insulin sensitivity of SINKO mice was also increased over controls, as assessed by hypothalamic activation of PI3K, phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 following systemic insulin injection. Intracerebroventricular injection of insulin led to a greater systemic effect to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in SINKO mice compared with controls. In line with the in vivo results, insulin-induced AKT and FoxO1 phosphorylation were potentiated by inhibition of Sirt1 in a cultured hypothalamic cell line. Mechanistically, this effect was traced to a reduced effect of Sirt1 to directly deacetylate and repress IRS-1 function. The enhanced central insulin signaling in SINKO mice was accompanied by increased insulin receptor signal transduction in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. In summary, we conclude that neuronal Sirt1 negatively regulates hypothalamic insulin signaling, leading to systemic insulin resistance.

Interventions that reduce neuronal Sirt1 activity have the potential to improve systemic insulin action and limit weight gain on an obesigenic diet. Insulin resistance is a defining pathophysiologic feature of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity is the most common cause of insulin resistance in the United States and other Western countries (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. Insulin sensitivity: modulation by nutrients and inflammation.J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is characterized by an impaired ability of insulin to enhance muscle glucose uptake, suppress adipose tissue lipolysis, and suppress hepatic glucose production (1Schenk S. Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. Insulin sensitivity: modulation by nutrients and inflammation.J. Clin. Investig. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar).

In addition, insulin inhibits hepatic glucose output via both direct and indirect pathways, the latter relying on a CNS neuronal network (3Girard J. Insulin's effect on the liver: “direct or indirect?” continues to be the question.J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Scherer et al. demonstrated that even a minimal amount of insulin administered into the CNS inhibited lipolysis in adipose tissue (4Scherer T. O'Hare J. Diggs-Andrews K. Schweiger M.

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a member of the sirtuin protein family, is a class III histone deacetylase (5Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Mammalian sirtuins: biological insights and disease relevance.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of Sirt1, Silent Information Regulator 2 (Sir2), is implicated in stress responses and the increased lifespan caused by calorie restriction. The enzymatic activity of sirtuins requires NAD+, suggesting these enzymes function as cellular energy sensors, with enzyme activity typically increasing during periods of negative energy balance. Indeed, Sirt1 activation during fasting influences peripheral metabolic responses including fatty acid oxidation, insulin secretion, insulin action, adipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and inflammation (5Haigis M.C. Sinclair D.A. Mammalian sirtuins: biological insights and disease relevance.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2010; 5: 253-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). While a consensus has formed surrounding the beneficial effects of Sirt1 in peripheral tissues, evidence of a physiological role for Sirt1 in the CNS is mixed and somewhat controversial. For example, SIRT1 expression levels increase in the hypothalamus with fasting and regulate food intake (6Bartness T.J. Song C.K. Thematic review series: adipocyte biology. Sympathetic and sensory innervation of white adipose tissue.J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1655-1672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). On a mixed genetic background, Ramadori et al., reported that selective knock-out (KO) of Sirt1 in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, a key hypothalamic neuronal subset for energy homeostasis, decreases energy expenditure and increases susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice (7Ramadori G. Fujikawa T. Fukuda M. Anderson J. Morgan D.A. Mostoslavsky R. Stuart R.C. Perello M. Vianna C.R. Nillni E.A. Rahmouni K. Coppari R. SIRT1 deacetylase in POMC neurons is required for homeostatic defenses against diet-induced obesity.Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 78-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, both intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of EX-527, a specific Sirt1 inhibitor, and deletion of Sirt1 in Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons (situated adjacent to POMC cells in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), cause decreases of food intake and body weight in mice and rats (8Cakir I.

Thus, it appears that Sirt1 in different neuronal populations may play distinctive and sometimes even opposing roles in energy balance regulation. With respect to insulin sensitivity, whether Sirt1 in CNS directly influences central and/or peripheral insulin sensitivity is also controversial. In light of these results, we sought to ascertain the role of global neuronal Sirt1 in animals on a pure genetic background and without developmental problems that have confounded other analyses (10Ramadori G.

In the current work, we studied the physiological role of neuronal Sirt1 with respect to changes in insulin sensitivity associated with aging, high-fat (HF) feeding, and caloric restriction by generating and characterizing neuron-specific Sirt1 knock-out (Neuronal KO; SINKO) mice. We show for the first time that on both standard chow and HF diet, selective removal of Sirt1 in neurons causes increased systemic insulin sensitivity. SINKO mice remained insulin sensitive during aging and showed greater metabolic improvement than control mice during chronic calorie restriction. The improved systemic insulin sensitivity of SINKO mice was associated with improved CNS insulin signaling in the hypothalamus. These findings indicate that neuronal Sirt1 plays a physiological role to inhibit both hypothalamic insulin sensitivity and whole body glucose homeostasis. We backcrossed mice carrying Sirt1 floxed alleles (f/f mice) (49Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F.

We backcrossed transgenic mice harboring Cre recombinase under the control of the neuron-specific rat synapsin I promoter (Syn-Cre mice) (50Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P. Ye Z. Charnay P. Rushing E.J.

We bred f/f mice with Syn I-Cre mice to generate Sirt1 f/+ mice with a positive Cre gene, which were further bred with Sirt1 f/f mice to obtain Sirt1 SINKO mice. Since occasional male mice carrying synapsin I-Cre can generate germline deletion of the target gene in progeny due to expression of Cre recombinase in sperms, we screened all Sirt1 SINKO mice for germline deletion (e.g. heterozygous whole-body Sirt1 KO mice), and such mice were eliminated from our studies. We housed mice in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. At 12 wk of age, mice were either fed normal chow diet (LabDiet, Cucamonga, CA) or 60% HFD (Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). Mouse procedures conformed to the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the US National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Animal Subjects Committee of the University of California, San Diego. We performed hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies as previously described (12Lu M. Sarruf D.A. Talukdar S. Sharma S. Li P. Bandyopadhyay G. Nalbandian S. Fan W. Gayen J.R. Mahata S.K. Webster N.J. Schwartz M.W. Olefsky J.M. Brain PPAR-γ promotes obesity and is required for the insulin-sensitizing effect of thiazolidinediones.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Since average BW of SINKO mice is lower than control mice, relatively heavier SINKO mice and lighter control mice that have overlapped BW were selected for clamp studies. We only used mice that lost <6% of their pre-cannulation weight after 4-5 days of recovery. The clamp experiments began with a constant infusion (5 μCi h−1) of d-[3-3H]glucose (Du Pont-NEN, Boston, MA) in 6-h fasted mice. After 90 min of tracer equilibration and basal sampling, we infused glucose (50% dextrose; Abbott) and tracer (5 μCi h−1) plus insulin (6 mU kg−1 min−1) into the jugular vein. We drew small blood samples from the tail vein at 10-min intervals and confirmed the achievement of steady-state conditions (120 mg dl−1 ± 5 mg dl−1) at the end of the clamp by maintaining glucose infusion and plasma glucose concentration for a minimum of 20 min. We took blood samples at t = −10, 0 (basal), 110, and 120 (end of experiment) min to determine glucose-specific activity and insulin concentration. We quantified tracer-determined rates by using the Steele equation for steady-state conditions (51Steele R. Influences of glucose loading and of injected insulin on hepatic glucose output.Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1959; 82: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). At steady state, the rate of glucose disappearance, or total GDR, is equal to the sum of the rate of endogenous glucose productions (HGP) plus the exogenous (cold) GIR. The IS-GDR is equal to the total GDR minus the basal glucose turnover rate. We performed other metabolic measurements as previously described (12Lu M. Sarruf D.A. Talukdar S. Sharma S. Li P.

Immunohistochemistry studies were conducted by the UCSD histology core at Moores Cancer Center. For assay of biochemical responses to insulin stimulation in the CNS, we injected a bolus of insulin (0.2 units kg−1) or vehicle via inferior vena cava of anesthetized mice after a 6-h fast. After 10 min, we quickly isolated and snap froze hypothalamus. For assay of biochemical responses to insulin stimulation in peripheral tissues of HF-fed mice, we anesthetized 6-h fasted mice. We ligated vessels supplying one side of leg muscles, one lobe of the liver and one epididymal fat pad and took basal samples of liver, muscle, and fat. Five minutes after a bolus injection of insulin (0.6 units kg−1 via inferior vena cava), we harvested the remaining liver, muscle, and fat and snap froze to measure signal transduction markers. We performed chronic i.c.v. cannulation in chow-fed male mice as previously described (52Sanchez-Alavez M. Osborn O. Tabarean I.V. Holmberg K.H. Eberwine J. Kahn C.R. Bartfai T.

A stainless steel guide cannula (26 gauge, 7 mm long; Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) was implanted into the right lateral ventricle (anterior posterior: 0 mm (At Bregma); Lateral: 0.8 mm; ventral: 1.8 mm ventral to the surface of the skull) and anchored to the skull with a 1.6 mm stainless steel screw (Plastics One) and dental cement. Mice are allowed to recover for 4 days after cannulation and between experiments. On the day of the experiment, insulin (final concentration 10 mU/μl) was diluted in freshly prepared artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; 119 mm NaCl, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose). After 5.5 h fasting, injections of either aCSF or insulin (10 mU in a volume of 1 μl) were administered via the implanted cannula using an injector (33-gauge, protruding 0.2 mm beyond the tip of the cannula, total length 7.2 mm) connected to plastic tubing and a microsyringe (5 μl) over a period of 1 min. Blood samples were taken before and after i.c.v injection. Thirty minutes after the i.c.v injection, mice were subjected to either OGTTs or ITTs. We measured mouse lean and fat mass using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX). We individually placed mice into metabolic cages and adapted all animals to the novel environment for 48 h before study. We normalized VO2 and VCO2 using a multiple regression-based approach to account for variation of both lean and fat mass. We calculated energy expenditure (EE) based on EE = 3.815 × VO2 + 1.232 × VCO2. Chow-fed mice were intravenously injected with either vehicle or 0.4 units/kg of insulin. Five minutes later, hypothalami were quickly dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were then homogenized by in ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails. Tissue lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for IRS-1 and IRS-1-bound PI 3-kinase activity was assayed in immunobeads after IP as previously described (27Schenk S. McCurdy C.E. Philp A.

Investig. 2011; 121: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation using normal rabbit IgG, instead of anti-IRS-1 antibody, was used as a negative control. The kinase reaction was initiated with the addition of 2 μg phosphatidylinositol and 20 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and was allowed to proceed for 30 min. After termination of the reaction by the addition of 20 μl 8 N HCL, the lipid products were separated from the remaining [γ-32P]ATP with 2 successive chloroform extractions and then run for 2 h on a thin-layer chromatography plate. Separated PI(3)P was visualized on a film. Immortalized murine hypothalamic cell line GT1–7 cells were described previously (53Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L.

The medium was then replaced by fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS for another 24 h. Cells were serum starved for overnight in DMEM with 0.5% FBS before acute insulin stimulation.

We purchased antibody to p53, PGC1α, and acetylated FoxO1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and antibody to Mac-2 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). All other primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). We analyzed the protein bands using Image J densitometry analysis and normalized phosphorylated protein to total protein bands. For protein-protein interaction study, GT1–7 cells were washed with PBS once and then were in vivo crosslinked by 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 37 °C. The crosslink reaction was stopped by adding 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.8 to final concentration of 100 mm. Cellular lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a control IgG or an antibody for Sirt1 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P (NP)-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). After incubation at 4 °C for overnight, protein A/G-agarose beads was added to the immunoprecipitates and incubated for 1 h. The agarose beads were then washed extensively three times before being subjected to Western blot analysis. We carried out quantitative PCR as previously described (12Lu M. Sarruf D.A. Talukdar S.

Primer sequences used in the PCR reactions were chosen based on the sequences available in GenBankTM. We measured mRNA of Sirt1 using the following primer set: 5′- GATGCTGTGAAGTTACTGCAGGAGTG-3′ and 5′- GAGGGTCTGGGAGGTCTGGGAAG-3′, in which the reverse primer detects exon 4 that is absent in the mutant mice. We normalized the mRNA content of all genes reported to housekeeping genes (cyclophilin A and RNA polymerase II). For detection of mutant Sirt1 mRNA, we used the following primer set that binds to sequence flanking the absent exon: 5′-GATGCTGTGAAGTTACTGCAGGAGTG-3′ and 5′-GAATTTGTGACACAGAGACGGCTGG-3′. Primer sequences for other genes are all exon spanning and are available upon request. Quantitative lipidomic studies were performed by Lipomics Technologies Inc. as previously described (17Lu M.

Physiol. 2010; 298: E1036-E1048Google Scholar). Ceramide quantity in tissues was measured using the diglyceride kinase assay (29Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Determination of ceramides and diglycerides by the diglyceride kinase assay.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For experiments involving two factors, we analyzed data by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post tests using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). We performed individual pair-wise comparisons using Student's t test in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). To investigate the function of neuronal Sirt1, we generated SINKO mice using the synapsin I Cre-LoxP system. Cre expression driven by the Synapsin I promoter (Syn-Cre mice) leads to recombination in neurons, but not other cell types in the brain (6Bartness T.J. Song C.K.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1655-1672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Lu M. Sarruf D.A. Talukdar S. Sharma S. Li P. Bandyopadhyay G. Nalbandian S. Fan W. Gayen J.R.

Med. 2011; 17: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The deletion of the floxed exon4 of the Sirt1 gene, which encodes the deacetylase domain, does not cause a frameshift of Sirt1 protein translation (11Cohen D.E. Supinski A.M. Bonkowski M.S. Donmez G. Guarente L.P. Neuronal SIRT1 regulates endocrine and behavioral responses to calorie restriction.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2812-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cre expression results in a mutant Sirt1 protein with deacetylase deficiency but an intact C terminus. To verify brain-specific deletion of Sirt1 in SINKO mice, we isolated RNA from multiple brain regions and from peripheral tissues. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for measurement of Sirt1 exon 4 showed that brain Sirt1 deletion was regional, with markedly reduced mRNA abundance in spinal cord, brain stem, hypothalamus, diencephalon, and hippocampus, mildly reduced expression in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and unchanged levels in olfactory bulb and pituitary, compared with Sirt1f/f mice (Fig. 1A). Tissues other than brain displayed normal Sirt1 expression (Fig. 1B). That the decrease of Sirt1 mRNA was not more pronounced in SINKO versus control mice (Fig. 1A) likely reflects the neuron-specific nature of our gene targeting, with Sirt1 expression being unaffected in glial, endothelial and other brain cell types. Interestingly, the deletion of exon4 in SINKO hypothalamus has not only resulted in a molecular weight shift of the mutant protein, but also caused a reduction of total Sirt1 protein content (Fig. 1C), a phenomenon that has been reported previously in other Sirt1 KO models (13Wang R.H. Kim H.S. Xiao C. Xu X. Gavrilova O. Deng C.X. Hepatic Sirt1 deficiency in mice impairs mTorc2/Akt signaling and results in hyperglycemia, oxidative damage, and insulin resistance.J. Clin.

Physiol. 2011; 300: E312-E320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To further provide evidence for the magnitude of the Sirt1 deacetylase deletion, we found a marked increase in acetylation of the well-known Sirt1 targets p53 and Stat3 in hypothalamic extracts of SINKO mice (Fig. 1C). However, we did not detect hyperacetylation of PGC1α or FoxO1 (supplemental Fig. S1A). PCR detection of genomic DNA (data not shown) and RNA (Fig. 1D) from various tissues demonstrated Cre-mediated recombination in brain, but not in gut, muscle, liver, adipose tissue, spleen, and pancreatic islets (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, Cre-mediated recombination was not detected in trigeminal nerve ganglion cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that Sirt1 deletion was limited only to the CNS neurons, and did not occur in peripheral neurons. This KO expression pattern is comparable to what we have reported for Syn-Cre-driven PPARγ deletion (12Lu M. Sarruf D.A. Talukdar S. Sharma S. Li P. Bandyopadhyay G. Nalbandian S. Fan W. Gayen J.R. Mahata S.K. Webster N.J. Schwartz M.W. Olefsky J.M. Brain PPAR-γ promotes obesity and is required for the insulin-sensitizing effect of thiazolidinediones.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). On a standard chow diet, SINKO mice displayed slightly lower body weight (Fig. 2A), while body composition analysis showed no decrease in fat mass (Fig. 2B). Growth and fertility were normal in SINKO mice, and there were no differences in brain or pituitary size, serum growth hormone levels, hepatic IGF1 gene expression, or body length (supplemental Fig. S1, B–F) between control and SINKO mice. Mice of both genotypes consumed similar amounts of food on a chow diet (supplemental Fig. S1G). Since Sirt1f/f mice exhibited the same glucose tolerance and fasting insulin level as wild type (WT) mice on both standard chow and HFD (supplemental Fig. S1, H and I), we chose to use Sirt1f/f mice as controls throughout our study. To determine whether neuronal Sirt1 plays a physiological role to regulate insulin sensitivity, we first performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) on chow-fed Sirt1f/f and SINKO mice. Although the plasma glucose excursion was comparable in the two groups (Fig. 2C), plasma insulin levels were markedly reduced in SINKO mice (Fig. 2D), consistent with increased insulin sensitivity. This finding was corroborated by demonstrating an enhanced ability of insulin to lower blood glucose during insulin tolerance testing (ITT) in SINKO mice (supplemental Fig. S2A). To investigate whether either insulin resistance that accompanies aging or the response to caloric restriction (CR) were altered in SINKO mice, we repeated GTTs in 16-month old mic"
https://openalex.org/W2098036519,"Sulfs are extracellular sulfatases that have emerged recently as critical regulators of heparan sulfate (HS) activities through their ability to catalyze specific 6-O-desulfation of the polysaccharide. Consequently, Sulfs have been involved in many physiological and pathological processes, and notably for Sulf-2, in the development of cancers with poor prognosis. Despite growing interest, little is known about the structure and activity of these enzymes and the way they induce dynamic remodeling of HS 6-O-sulfation status. Here, we have combined an array of analytical approaches, including mass spectrometry, NMR, HS oligosaccharide sequencing, and FACS, to dissect HSulf-2 sulfatase activity, either on a purified octasaccharide used as a mimic of HS functional domains, or on intact cell-surface HS chains. In parallel, we have studied the functional consequences of HSulf-2 activity on fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced mitogenesis and found that the enzyme could differentially regulate FGF1 and FGF2 activities. Notably, these data supported the existence of precise 6-O-sulfation patterns for FGF activation and provided new insights into the saccharide structures involved. Altogether, our data bring to light an original processive enzymatic mechanism, by which HSulfs catalyze oriented alteration of HS 6-O-desulfation patterns and direct fine and differential regulation of HS functions."

https://openalex.org/W2046997677,"Throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) plays an important role in soil erosion in forests. We studied TKE as a function of biodiversity, functional diversity as well as structural stand variables in a secondary subtropical broad-leaved forest in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR) in south-east China, a biodiversity hotspot in the northern hemisphere with more than 250 woody species present. Using a mixed model approach we could identify significant effects of all these variables on TKE: TKE increased with rarefied tree species richness and decreased with increasing proportion of needle-leaved species and increasing leaf area index (LAI). Furthermore, for average rainfall amounts TKE was decreasing with tree canopy height whereas for high rainfall amounts this was not the case. The spatial pattern of throughfall was stable across several rain events. The temporal variation of TKE decreased with rainfall intensity and increased with tree diversity. Our results show that more diverse forest stands over the season have to cope with higher cumulative raindrop energy than less diverse stands. However, the kinetic energy (KE) of one single raindrop is less predictable in diverse stands since the variability in KE is higher. This paper is the first to contribute to the understanding of the ecosystem function of soil erosion prevention in diverse subtropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W2005802548,"DNA repair is essential for maintaining genomic stability, and defects in this process significantly increase the risk of cancer. Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) caused by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is characterized by high genomic instability. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the association between the loss of VHL and genomic instability remains unclear. Here, we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) promotes nuclear redistribution and K63-ubiquitylation of VHL in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Loss of VHL or VHL mutations that compromise its K63-ubiquitylation attenuates the DNA-damage response (DDR), resulting in decreased homologous recombination repair and persistence of DSBs. These results identify VHL as a component of the DDR network, inactivation of which contributes to the genomic instability associated with CCRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2023279756,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the transcriptional adaptation of hypoxic cells. The extensive transcriptional programm regulated by HIFs involves the induction of genes controlling angiogenesis, cellular metabolism, cell growth, metastasis, apoptosis, extracellular matrix remodeling and others. HIF is a heterodimer of HIF-α and HIF-β subunits. In addition to HIF-1α, HIF-2α has evolved as an isoform that contributes differently to the hypoxic adaptation by performing non-redundant functions. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear protein involved in the control of DNA repair and gene transcription by modulating chromatin structure and acting as part of gene-specific enhancer/promoter-binding complexes. Previous results have shown that PARP-1 regulates HIF-1 activity. In this study, we focused on the cross-talk between HIF-2α and PARP-1. By using different approaches to suppress PARP-1, we show that HIF-2α mRNA expression, protein levels and HIF-2-dependent gene expression, such as ANGPTL4 and erythropoietin (EPO), are regulated by PARP-1. This regulation occurs at both the transcriptional and post-trancriptional level. We also show a complex formation between HIF-2α with PARP-1. This complex is sensitive to PARP inhibition and seems to protect against the von Hippel-Lindau-dependent HIF-2α degradation. Finally, we show that parp-1(-/-) mice display a significant reduction in the circulating hypoxia-induced EPO levels, number of red cells and hemoglobin concentration. Altogether, these results reveal a complex functional interaction between PARP-1 and the HIF system and suggest that PARP-1 is involved in the fine tuning of the HIF-mediated hypoxic response in vivo."

Like the latter two, Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium known to cause life-threatening pneumonia, also possesses phospholipase activity.

In addition to PLA enzymes, secreted hydrolytic activity acting upon the water-soluble phosphodiester substrate para-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (p-NPPC) was found in L. pneumophila, which may indicate the presence of PLC activity (31Fliegera A.

Furthermore, an L. pneumophila Lsp type II secretion mutant is about 80–90% defective in secreted p-NPPC hydrolase activity, with export of p-NPPC hydrolase activity partially dependent (up to 30%) upon the Tat pathway (32Aragon V.

The virulence factor peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase Mip promotes p-NPPC hydrolase activity as well, albeit independently of PlcA (39Debroy S. Aragon V. Kurtz S. Cianciotto N.P.

A protein homologous to PlcA was recently identified and designated PlcB (40McCoy-Simandle K. Stewart C.R. Dao J. DebRoy S. Rossier O. Bryce P.J. Cianciotto N.P.

Whether PlcB, which contains a putative signal peptide akin to PlcA, also contributes to secreted p-NPPC hydrolase activity is currently unknown. L. pneumophila plcA and plcB single and double knock-out mutants replicate intracellularly in a manner comparable with that of wild type bacteria in macrophage, epithelial cell, and/or amoeba infection models, indicating that these enzymes are not necessary for these in vitro virulence characteristics (32Aragon V.

Moreover, L. pneumophila plcA mutants display no attenuation compared with wild type bacteria in in vivo mouse infections (30DebRoy S. Dao J. Söderberg M. Rossier O. Cianciotto N.P.

To summarize, it is still unclear whether L. pneumophila possesses one or several secreted PLC activities that target phospholipids. We therefore screened the L. pneumophila genome sequence for potentially encoded PLC enzymes and found, in addition to PlcA and PlcB described previously (32Aragon V. Rossier O. Cianciotto N.P.

Here we describe our observation that all three proteins exhibit PLC activity and demonstrate the importance of zinc ions for activity. Conserved amino acid residues in all of the L. pneumophila enzymes and PlcC of P. fluorescens were targeted for mutagenesis, with the finding that 15 residues are essential for PLC activity of PlcC. These residues also were completely conserved in other homologs of fungal proteins that have not yet been characterized. This set of properties, namely (a) lack of significant homology to enzymes of other PLC families, (b) considerable homology between the respective enzymes and conservation of specific essential amino acids embedded within conserved protein motifs, and (c) the necessity of Zn2+ for enzymatic activity, distinguishes these enzymes from other defined PLC groups. Therefore, we propose that the enzymes belong to a novel PLC family present in Legionella, some Pseudomonas spp., and fungi. L. pneumophila sg1 strains JR32 (47Sadosky A.B. Wiater L.A. Shuman H.A.

Characteristics of isogenic L. pneumophila JR32 as well as strain Corby mutants and complementing strains are listed in supplemental Table 1. Further experimental procedures for the mutants and complementing strains generated in this study are described below. All cloning experiments and plasmid propagations were performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α or Top10 (Invitrogen); recombinant expression of PLC proteins was done in E. coli BL21. The strains used are listed in supplemental Table 1 and were grown on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar and in buffered yeast extract (BYE) broth (both for Legionella) or on Luria Bertani (LB) agar and in LB broth (both for E. coli) as described previously (49Aurass P.

Improved semiselective medium for isolation of Legionella pneumophila from contaminated clinical and environmental specimens.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 298-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For growth in liquid laboratory medium, L. pneumophila was inoculated at an OD660 = 0.2–0.3 and was cultured in BYE broth at 37 °C with continuous shaking at 250 rpm. Bacterial growth was checked by determining the optical density of the culture at wavelength 660 nm (OD660) using a Beckman spectrophotometer DU520 (Beckman Coulter). When needed, media were supplemented with antibiotics at final concentrations as follows: kanamycin, 25 μg/ml (E. coli 50 μg/ml); chloramphenicol, 6 μg/ml (E. coli 30 μg/ml); gentamicin, 5 μg/ml (E. coli 10 μg/ml); and hygromycin, 100 μg/ml (E. coli 150 μg/ml). For assessment of hydrolytic activities, L. pneumophila culture supernatants were harvested at the end of exponential growth (OD660 = 2.0) by centrifugation for 5 min at 6000 × g, with subsequent concentration by MicroconTM filter tubes (10.000 NMWL (nominal molecular weight limit), Millipore) to obtain concentrated culture supernatants.

Genomic and plasmid DNA were prepared, amplified, and sequenced according to standard protocols. Primers were obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon (see supplemental Table 2).

Yeast vma mutants lack V-ATPase activity and allow exploration of connections between cellular pH, iron, and redox homeostasis common to all eukaryotes. A previous microarray study in a vma mutant demonstrated up-regulation of multiple iron uptake genes under control of Aft1p (the iron regulon) and only one antioxidant gene, the peroxiredoxin TSA2 (Milgrom, E., Diab, H., Middleton, F., and Kane, P. M. (2007) Loss of vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase activity in yeast results in chronic oxidative stress. J. Biol. Chem. 282, 7125-7136). Fluorescent biosensors placing GFP under transcriptional control of either an Aft1-dependent promoter (P(FIT2)-GFP) or the TSA2 promoter (P(TSA2)-GFP) were constructed to monitor transcriptional signaling. Both biosensors were up-regulated in the vma2Δ mutant, and acute V-ATPase inhibition with concanamycin A induced coordinate up-regulation from both promoters. PTSA2-GFP induction was Yap1p-dependent, indicating an oxidative stress signal. Total cell iron measurements indicate that the vma2Δ mutant is iron-replete, despite up-regulation of the iron regulon. Acetic acid up-regulated P(FIT2)-GFP expression in wild-type cells, suggesting that loss of pH control contributes to an iron deficiency signal in the mutant. Iron supplementation significantly decreased P(FIT2)-GFP expression and, surprisingly, restored P(TSA2)-GFP to wild-type levels. A tsa2Δ mutation induced both nuclear localization of Aft1p and P(FIT2)-GFP expression. The data suggest a novel function for Tsa2p as a negative regulator of Aft1p-driven transcription, which is induced in V-ATPase mutants to limit transcription of the iron regulon. This represents a new mechanism bridging the antioxidant and iron-regulatory pathways that is intimately linked to pH homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2015417678,"Neurexin and neuroligin are transmembrane adhesion proteins that play an important role in organizing the neuronal synaptic cleft. Our lab previously reported a method for imaging the trans-synaptic binding of neurexin and neuroligin called BLINC (Biotin Labeling of INtercellular Contacts). In BLINC, biotin ligase (BirA) is fused to one protein while its 15-amino acid acceptor peptide substrate (AP) is fused to the binding partner. When the two fusion proteins interact across cellular junctions, BirA catalyzes the site-specific biotinylation of AP, which can be read out by staining with streptavidin-fluorophore conjugates. Here, we report that BLINC in neurons cannot be reproduced using the reporter constructs and labeling protocol previously described. We uncover the technical reasons for the lack of reproducibilty and then re-design the BLINC reporters and labeling protocol to achieve neurexin-neuroligin BLINC imaging in neuron cultures. In addition, we introduce a new method, based on lipoic acid ligase instead of biotin ligase, to image trans-cellular neurexin-neuroligin interactions in human embryonic kidney cells and in neuron cultures. This method, called ID-PRIME for Interaction-Dependent PRobe Incorporation Mediated by Enzymes, is more robust than BLINC due to higher surface expression of lipoic acid ligase fusion constructs, gives stronger and more localized labeling, and is more versatile than BLINC in terms of signal readout. ID-PRIME expands the toolkit of methods available to study trans-cellular protein-protein interactions in living systems."
https://openalex.org/W2066648694,"The Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 4 (TRPV4) channel mediates crucial physiological functions, such as calcium signaling, temperature sensing, and maintaining cell volume and energy homeostasis. Noticeably, most disease-causing genetic mutations are concentrated in the cytoplasmic domains. In the present study, we focused on the role of the TRPV4 C terminus in modulating protein folding, trafficking, and activity. By examining a series of C-terminal deletions, we identified a 20-amino acid distal region covering residues 838-857 that is critical for channel folding, maturation, and trafficking. Surface biotinylation, confocal imaging, and fluorescence-based calcium influx assay demonstrated that mutant proteins missing this region were trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and unglycosylated, leading to accelerated degradation and loss of channel activity. Rosetta de novo structural modeling indicated that residues 838-857 assume a defined conformation, with Gly(849) and Pro(851) located at critical positions. Patch clamp recordings confirmed that lowering the temperature from 37 to 30 °C rescued channel activity of folding-defective mutants. Moreover, biochemical tests demonstrated that, in addition to participating in C-C interaction, the C terminus also interacts with the N terminus. Taken together, our findings indicate that the C-terminal region of TRPV4 is critical for channel protein folding and maturation, and the short distal segment plays an essential role in this process. Therefore, selectively disrupting the folding-sensitive region may present therapeutic potential for treating overactive TRPV4-mediated diseases, such as pain and skeletal dysplasias."

However, detailed information on the signaling and major physiological functions of corazonin and its receptor is largely unknown. In the current study, using both the mammalian cell line HEK293 and insect cell lines BmN and Sf21, we paired the Bombyx corazonin neuropeptide as a specific endogenous ligand for the Bombyx neuropeptide G protein-coupled receptor A21 (BNGR-A21), and we therefore designated this receptor as BmCrzR. Further characterization indicated that synthetic BmCrz demonstrated a high affinity for and activated BmCrzR, resulting in intracellular cAMP accumulation, Ca2+ mobilization, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation via the Gq- and Gs-coupled signaling pathways.

It had been reported that injected corazonin reduced the spinning rate, cocoon size, and hemolymph ecdysteroid level in the silkworm, meanwhile prolonging the pupal period (17Tanaka Y. Hua Y.

However, recent data indicated that RNA interference failed to detect a significant role for this neuropeptide in modulating mosquito heart physiology (18Hillyer J.F. Estévez-Lao T.Y. Funkhouser L.J.

Besides, [His7]corazonin has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the nutritional and physiological stress response in other insects (14Kapan N. Lushchak O.V. Luo J. Nassel D.R.

The physiological function of corazonin peptides is mediated by the corazonin receptor. The first corazonin receptor (CrzR) was identified from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in 2002 (21Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C. Molecular cloning and functional expression of a Drosophila corazonin receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), followed by the identification of homologous receptors in M. sexta (11Kim Y.J. Spalovská-Valachová I. Cho K.H. Zitnanova I.

These receptors all possess the typical features of a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The transmembrane regions of these receptors are conserved, whereas the N terminus is highly divergent. In Drosophila, corazonin has been identified as the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor CG10698, and this CrzR is expressed in embryos, larvae, pupae, and adult flies. In M. sexta, the corazonin receptor exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity for corazonin in Xenopus oocytes and was used as a biosensor to verify the initiation of the ecdysis behavioral sequence in Inka cells by corazonin signaling (11Kim Y.J. Spalovská-Valachová I. Cho K.H. Zitnanova I. Park Y. Adams M.E. Zitnan D. Corazonin receptor signaling in ecdysis initiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6704-6709Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The CrzR in A. gambiae was found to only be activated by its endogenous corazonin, with an EC50 value of 4 × 10−9 m, resulting in cAMP accumulation (22Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Identification of four evolutionarily related G protein-coupled receptors from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In M. domestica, tissue-specific RT-PCR revealed a high level of M. domestica corazonin receptor expression in the larval salivary glands and a moderate level in the CNS, whereas in adults, the receptor was expressed in both the head and body, suggesting multifunctionality of the Crz signaling system (24Sha K. Conner W.C. Choi D.Y. Park J.H.

Recent studies have highlighted the physiological functions of corazonin, such as rhythm control, metabolism, ecdysis, and stress response. However, the detailed information on Crz/CrzR signaling remains to be further elucidated. By genomic data mining and phylogenetic analysis, the Bombyx neuropeptide G protein-coupled receptor BNGR-A21 has been identified as a corazonin-like receptor in B. mori (25Roller L. Yamanaka N.

Therefore, in this study, we report on the cloning of the cDNA encoding the putative BNGR-A21 from the silkworm B. mori and its functional expression in the mammalian cell line HEK293 and insect cell lines BmN and Sf21. Our characterization provides an outline for Crz/CrzR signaling and perhaps aids in the interpretation of the signaling in ecdysis, spinning, development, and stress response in B. mori. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from HyClone (Beijing, China). G418, Lipofectamine 2000, and Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium were purchased from Invitrogen. SuperFectinTM II was purchased from Pufei Biotech (Shanghai, China). The pEGFP-N1 and pCMV-FLAG vectors were purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Monoclonal anti-FLAG® M2 antibody, monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-FITC antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and Nifedipine were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). H89, Go6983, U73122, U0126, cholera toxin (CTX), and pertussis toxin (PTX) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. The membrane probe DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate), nuclear dye, RIPA lysis buffer, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from Beyotime (Haimen, China). [Arg7]Corazonin was synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China). To construct the BNGR-A21 plasmid, RT-PCR was performed as described previously (32Zhu C. Huang H. Hua R. Li G. Yang D. Luo J. Zhang C. Shi L. Benovic J.L. Zhou N. Molecular and functional characterization of adipokinetic hormone receptor and its peptide ligands in Bombyx mori.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To amplify the full-length sequence encoding BNGR-A21, two pairs of primers for the receptor were designed based on the sequence from the GenBankTM AB330442 as described below. The coding sequence of A21 was amplified for the pCMV-FLAG vector using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGGACAACGAAGGCAACAGTAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTTATAACAAACTAATGTTCTGTCCAT-3′; an additional pair of primers was also designed for the pEGFP-N1 vector: the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGACAACGAAGGCAACAGTAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCCGTAACAAACTAATGTTCTGTCCATTCG-3′. The corresponding PCR products were cloned into the pCMV-FLAG, pEGFP-N1, pBmIE1-FLAG, and pBmIE1-EGFP expression vectors using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Beyotime, China) and we named these vectors Flag-A21, A21-EGFP, BmFlag-A21, and BmA21-EGFP, respectively. All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct sequences, orientations, and reading frames. Arrestin3-EGFP was generated as previously described (33Li G. Deng X. Wu C. Zhou Q. Chen L. Shi Y.

The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The BNGR-A21 cDNA plasmid constructs were transfected or cotransfected into HEK293, BmN, and Sf21 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and SuperFectinTM II (Pufei, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Selection for stable expression was initiated by the addition of G418 (800 μg/ml) 1–2 days after transfection. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% BSA (FACS buffer) and incubated with 10 μg/ml of FITC-labeled anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, the cells were pelleted and washed three times in FACS buffer. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in FACS buffer and subjected to flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer (Cytomics FC 500 MCL, Beckman Coulter). After seeding in a 48-well plate overnight, HEK293 or Sf21 cells transiently or stably cotransfected with BNGR-A21 and pCRE-Luc were grown to 90–95% confluence, stimulated with the corazonin peptides in DMEM without FBS, and incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was detected by a firefly luciferase assay kit (KenReal, Shanghai, China). The cAMP concentration was assessed using a commercially available cAMP detection kit (R&D Systems). The stable FLAG-A21- and BmFlag-A21-expressing HEK293 and Sf21 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were detached by a Nonenzymatic Cell Dissociation Solution (M&C Gene Technology, China) or 0.02% EGTA and then loaded with 3 μm Fura 2-AM (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' solution and then resuspended in Hanks' solution at a concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. Calcium flux was measured using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm in a fluorescence spectrometer (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO, Switzerland). The HEK293 and Sf21 cells transiently or stably expressing BNGR-A21 were seeded in 24-well plates and starved for 60 min in serum-free medium to reduce background ERK1/2 activation and to eliminate the effects of the change of medium. After stimulation with the agonist, the cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (Beyotime, China). Equal amounts of total cell lysate were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10–12%) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (TBS containing 0.05–0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Total ERK1/2 was assessed as a loading control after p-ERK1/2 chemiluminescence detection using an HRP substrate purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). HEK293 cells stably transfected with the FLAG-A21 construct were seeded in 24-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine. The cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of the agonist at the indicated times the following day. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). After fixing the cells for 5 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS, the cells were washed three times with TBS and then blocked for 60 min with 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5000 in 1% BSA/TBS) for 60 min. To each well, 200 μl of HRP substrate (Sigma) was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20–30 min. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 1% SDS, and plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). For receptor surface expression analysis and internalization assays, HEK293 and BmN cells transiently or stably expressing receptor-EGFP were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine and allowed to attach overnight under normal growth conditions. After 24 h, cells were stained with the membrane probe DiI (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C for 5–10 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and finally incubated with DAPI for 10 min. For the internalization assay, cells expressing A21-EGFP were treated with different concentrations of corazonin for different incubation times at 37 °C. For the β-arrestin and kurtz translocation assays, cells were cotransfected with the corresponding FLAG-A21 receptor constructs and β-arrestin1-EGFP, β-arrestin2-EGFP, or Bmkurtz-EGFP. After transfection, the cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, allowed to recover for 24–36 h in a 6-well plate, and incubated with 1 ml of DMEM without FBS, and if necessary, the corresponding ligands were added to stimulate the receptors for 5–15 min. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×63, 1.40 NA oil immersion lens. HEK293 cells stably expressing the FLAG-A21 construct were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates 1 day before the experiments. Cells were washed once with PBS, and 50 μl of PBS with 0.2% BSA was added to each well. Samples of labeled and unlabeled peptides were made in ligand buffer at a concentration four times the final concentration specified. An amount of 25 μl of labeled ligand and 25 μl of buffer or unlabeled ligand was added to each well. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 90 min and transferred onto ice. Cells were then washed three times with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS with 0.1% BSA as previously described (34Cvejic S. Zhu Z. Felice S.J. Berman Y. Huang X.Y. The endogenous ligand Stunted of the GPCR Methuselah extends lifespan in Drosophila.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Binding was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity with a Tecan microplate reader. Binding is presented as the percentage of total binding. The binding displacement curves were analyzed by GraphPad Prism. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously with slight modifications (21Cazzamali G. Saxild N. Grimmelikhuijzen C. Molecular cloning and functional expression of a Drosophila corazonin receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was completed using the PrimeScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, China). The cDNA from the samples was quantified on a real-time PCR machine (CFX-Touch, Bio-Rad) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, China). BNGR-A21 used the sense primer 5′-TTCTGAATCCAGACAAAAACCAA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-ATGATGTGTTGTTATCACCACGA-3′; actin used the sense primer 5′-CGTTCGTGATATCAAGGAGAAGCT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCCATACCCAAGAACGAGGGTTG-3′. The possibility of genomic DNA contamination was excluded by DNase treatment. Differential expression of the cell lines was compared using the ΔΔCT method. The corazonin peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis using the N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl strategy on a 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 9050 Pepsynthesizer Plus (Perceptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). Crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Dynamax-300 Å C18 25 cm × 21.4-mm inner diameter column with a flow rate of 9 ml/min and two solvent systems of 0.1% TFA/H2O and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile. Fractions containing the appropriate peptide were pooled together and lyophilized. The purity of the final product was assessed by analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. B. mori P50 were reared at 27 ± 3 °C and with a light:dark regime of 12 h:12 h on fresh mulberry leaves. Fourth instar larvae of similar size were divided into different treatment groups in the experiment. These larvae began molting on day 5 of the fourth instar and began spinning on day 7 of the fifth instar. Larvae were immobilized on ice before injection. B. mori CrzR dsRNA was generated in vitro by the MEGAscript® T7 Kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions using the sense primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTTCATTGGCAATGTGGCA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGATTCTCGGTCACTATGCTGGT-3′. Corazonin and CrzR dsRNA were dissolved in PBS and diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O, respectively, and injected into fourth and fifth instar larvae using a 10-μl microsyringe through the abdominal segm"
https://openalex.org/W2043654333,"Prostate tumor overexpressed-1 (PTOV1), a modulator of the Mediator transcriptional regulatory complex, is expressed at high levels in prostate cancer and other neoplasias in association with a more aggressive disease. Here we show that PTOV1 interacts directly with receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a regulator of protein kinase C and Jun signaling and also a component of the 40S ribosome. Consistent with this interaction, PTOV1 was associated with ribosomes and its overexpression promoted global protein synthesis in prostate cancer cells and COS-7 fibroblasts in a mTORC1-dependent manner. Transfection of ectopic PTOV1 enhanced the expression of c-Jun protein without affecting the levels of c-Jun or RACK1 mRNA. Conversely, knockdown of PTOV1 caused significant declines in global protein synthesis and c-Jun protein levels. High levels of PTOV1 stimulated the motility and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells, which required c-Jun, whereas knockdown of PTOV1 strongly inhibited the tumorigenic and metastatic potentials of PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In human prostate cancer samples, the expression of high levels of PTOV1 in primary and metastatic tumors was significantly associated with increased nuclear localization of active c-Jun. These results unveil new functions of PTOV1 in the regulation of protein translation and in the progression of prostate cancer to an invasive and metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2167213817,"We previously reported that the sympathetic neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) is potently angiogenic, primarily through its Y2 receptor, and that endogenous NPY is crucial for capillary angiogenesis in rodent hindlimb ischemia. Here we sought to identify the source of NPY responsible for revascularization and its mechanisms of action. At d 3, NPY–/– mice demonstrated delayed recovery of blood flow and limb function, consistent with impaired collateral conductance, while ischemic capillary angiogenesis was reduced (~70%) at d 14. This biphasic temporal response was confirmed by 2 peaks of NPY activation in rats: a transient early increase in neuronally derived plasma NPY and increase in platelet NPY during late-phase recovery. Compared to NPY-null platelets, collagen-activated NPY-rich platelets were more mitogenic (~2-fold vs. ~1.6-fold increase) for human microvascular endothelial cells, and Y2/Y5 receptor antagonists ablated this difference in proliferation. In NPY+/+ mice, ischemic angiogenesis was prevented by platelet depletion and then restored by transfusion of platelets from NPY+/+ mice, but not NPY–/– mice. In thrombocytopenic NPY–/– mice, transfusion of wild-type platelets fully restored ischemia-induced angiogenesis. These findings suggest that neuronally derived NPY accelerates the early response to femoral artery ligation by promoting collateral conductance, while platelet-derived NPY is critical for sustained capillary angiogenesis.—Tilan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2083597095,"Neuroblastoma arises from sympathoadrenal progenitors of the neural crest and expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB and its ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is correlated with poor prognosis. Although activated TrkB signaling promotes a more aggressive phenotype in established neuroblastoma cell lines, whether TrkB signaling is sufficient to transform neural crest-derived cells has not been investigated. To address the role of TrkB signaling in malignant transformation, we removed two immunoglobulin-like domains from the extracellular domain of the full-length rat TrkB receptor to create a ΔIgTrkB that is constitutively active. In the pheochromocytoma-derived cell line PC12, ΔIgTrkB promotes differentiation by stimulating process outgrowth; however, in the rat neural crest-derived cell line NCM-1, ΔIgTrkB signaling produces a markedly transformed phenotype characterized by increased proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, anoikis resistance and matrix invasion. Furthermore, expression of ΔIgTrkB leads to the upregulation of many transcripts encoding cancer-associated genes including cyclind1, twist1 and hgf, as well as downregulation of tumor suppressors such as pten and rb1. In addition, ΔIgTrkB NCM-1 cells show a 21-fold increase in mRNA for MYCN, the most common genetic marker for a poor prognosis in neuroblastoma. When injected into NOD SCID mice, control GFP NCM-1 cells fail to grow whereas ΔIgTrkB NCM-1 cells form rapidly growing and invasive tumors necessitating euthanasia of all mice by 15 days post injection. In summary, these results indicate that activated TrkB signaling is sufficient to promote the formation of a highly malignant phenotype in neural crest-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038120364,"The phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) pathway is involved in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, survival and glucose transport, and is implicated in various disease states, such as cancer and diabetes. Although there have been numerous studies dissecting the role of PI3K signaling in different cell types and disease models, the mechanism by which PI3K signaling regulates embryonic stem (ES) cell fate remains unclear. It is believed that in addition to proliferation and tumorigenesis, PI3K activity may also be important for ES cell self-renewal. Paling et al. reported that the inhibition of PI3K led to a reduction in the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor to maintain self-renewal, causing cells to differentiate. Studies in our lab have revealed that ES cells completely lacking glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) remain undifferentiated compared with wild-type ES cells. GSK-3 is negatively regulated by PI3K, suggesting that PI3K may have a vital role in maintaining pluripotency in ES cells through GSK-3. By using a modified Flp recombinase system, we expressed activated alleles of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 and protein kinase B to create stable, isogenic ES cell lines to further study the role of the PI3K signaling pathway in stem cell fate determination. In vitro characterization of the transgenic cell lines revealed a strong tendency toward the maintenance of pluripotency, and this phenotype was found to be independent of canonical Wnt signal transduction. In summary, PI3K signaling is sufficient to maintain the self-renewal and survival of stem cells. As this pathway is frequently mutationally activated in cancers, its effect on suppressing differentiation may contribute to its oncogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2069536196,"Background Impairment of lung function was reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relationship between lung function and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in participants without chronic pulmonary disease. Methodology and Principal Findings A total of 6,423 participants aged 40 years and above were recruited from Jiading District, Shanghai, China. Lung function, evaluated by forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was measured with standard spirometry. CIMT was measured with high-resolution ultrasonography by trained physicians. Mean values of FVC (% pred) and FEV1 (% pred) in participants with elevated cIMT were significantly lower than in those without (0.92±0.20 vs. 0.99±0.19, 0.83±0.24 vs. 0.90±0.22; both p-values < 0.0001). The levels of cIMT in the lowest quartile of FVC (% pred) and FEV1 (% pred) were markedly higher than in the second, third and fourth quartile, respectively (p < 0.0001 for all). The lowest quartile of FVC (% pred) and FEV1 (% pred) was associated with increased odds of elevated cIMT, with the fully adjusted odds ratio of 1.34 and 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.65, p = 0.006, 95% CI 1.15–1.72, p = 0.0008), respectively. Conclusions and Significance Impaired lung function is associated with elevated cIMT in middle-aged and elderly Chinese. These findings suggest the need to screen impairment of lung function in people without respiratory disease for the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in CVD prevention."

Despite their wide distribution across the HBB 4The abbreviations used are: HBBhemoglobin βHbhemoglobinHBAhemoglobin α. gene sequence (Fig. 1B, top), it is striking that codon 6 is the site most acutely populated with mutations across all β-globin variants known. Each of these variants represents a unique haplotype. The total number of distinct codon 6 mutations present among β-globin variants is 9, including 3 substitutions and 3 short deletions that are associated with different anemias and β-thalassemias (Table 1). In this report, we describe a feature unique to the sequence immediately surrounding HBB codon 6 that can account for its unusually high incidence of mutation. We then survey the occurrence of this “mutagenic” sequence feature in β-globin orthologs and identify it as a conserved mechanism for increased local variability among primates.TABLE 1Mutations reported in codon 6 of the β-globin gene, which comprises the first three loop residues of its only self-depurination siteLoop residuesVariantHaplotypeClinical presentationMalaria resistanceGAGHb AWild-typeNormal–AAGHb CHBB:c.19G>AAnemia+AAGHb C RothschildHBB:c.[19G>A;112T>A or 112T>C]Anemia+AAGHb KingsburyHBB:c.[19G>A;295G>A]Anemia+AAGHb C New CrossHBB:c.[19G>A;251G>A]Anemia+AAGHb Arlington ParkHBB:c.[19G>A;286A>G]Anemia+CAGHb MachidaHBB:c.19G>CNormal–TAGHb GrignoliHBB:c.19G>Tβ0-Thalassemia+—AGHb CD6-GHBB:c.19delGβ0-Thalassemia+—AGHb 5/6 (-TG)HBB:c.18_19delTGβ0-Thalassemia+GTGHb SHBB:c.20A>TAnemia+GTGHb Jamaica PlainHBB:c.[20A>T;205C>T]Anemia+GTGHb S ClichyHBB:c.[20A>T;26A>C]Anemia+GTGHb S OmanHBB:c.[20A>T;364G>A]Anemia+GTGHb S San MartinHBB:c.[20A>T;317T>C]Anemia+GTGHb S TravisHBB:c.[20A>T;428C>T]Anemia+GTGHb S Sao PauloHBB:c.[20A>T;196A>G]Anemia+GTGHb S ProvidenceHBB:c.[20A>T;249G>T or 249G>C]Anemia+GTGHb C HarlemHBB:c.[20A>T;220G>A]Anemia+GTGHb C ZiguinchorHBB:c.[20A>T;176C>G]Anemia+GTGHb S AntillesHBB:c.[20A>T;70G>A]Anemia+GTGHb C NdjamenaHBB:c.[20A>T;112T>G]Anemia+GTGHb S CameroonHBB:c.[20A>T;271G>A]Anemia+GTGHb S South EndHBB:c.[20A>T;399A>C]Anemia+GGGHb LavagnaHBB:c.20A>GNormal–GCGHb G MakassarHBB:c.20A>CNormal–G—GHb FSC-6 (-A)HBB:c.20delAβ0-Thalassemia+———Hb LeidenHBB:c.19_21delGAGAnemia– Open table in a new tab hemoglobin β hemoglobin hemoglobin α. Previously, we reported the discovery within the wild-type β-globin gene of a self-catalytic mechanism for site-specific depurination of G residues in DNA that is associated with an 18-base pair inverted repeat sequence centered at codon 6 (Fig. 1A) (3Amosova O.

As a consequence of its self-complementarity, such a palindromic sequence can extrude as a cruciform (5Amosova O. Kumar V. Deutsch A. Fresco J.

This sequence, in the form of the stem-loop catalytic intermediate, has the capacity to self-depurinate the 5′G residue of the loop, thereby giving rise to an apurinic site. That site can in turn undergo error-prone repair (6Simonelli V. Narciso L. Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Base excision repair intermediates are mutagenic in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4404-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) directly, or else once the apurinic site has been cleaved either by apurinic endonuclease (7Korolev V.G. Base excision repair: AP endonucleases and DNA polymerases.Russian J. Genet. 2005; 41: 1063-1070Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) or by spontaneous β-elimination (8Sugiyama H. Fujiwara T. Ura A. Tashiro T. Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. Saito I. Chemistry of thermal degradation of abasic sites in DNA: mechanistic investigation on thermal DNA strand cleavage of alkylated DNA.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). By this sequence of reactions, self-depurination can create a potential site for a substitution mutation mediated by an error-prone repair polymerase. Alternatively, the cleaved site can leave frayed ends in the chain backbone, especially because the residues immediately adjacent to either side of the cleavage site form the weaker T·A and A·T base pairs. The frayed residue(s) can then be removed by a 3′- or a 5′-exonuclease, thus creating potential sites for either downstream or upstream substitution mutations (via error-prone repair), or else for deletions/additions, made possible by the flexibility of the intact template strand or of the newly synthesized one (9Fresco J.R. Alberts B.M. The accommodation of noncomplementary bases in helical polyribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleic acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1960; 46: 311-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Base substitutions and short deletions leading to frameshifts are, in fact, recognized consequences of apurinic site repair (10Kunkel T.A. Mutational specificity of depurination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).

Mutations at the HBB locus from 93 human genomes were accessed through the PSU version of the University of California Santa Cruz browser (11Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. The human genome browser at UCSC.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6716) Google Scholar), but no additional HBB variants were identified. In this connection, although it was apparent 5 years ago that the incidence of codon 6 mutation among HBB variants was higher than in any other codon in the gene, it was nowhere as excessive as now shown in Fig. 1B, top. This increase, which no doubt reflects the advent of rapid methods and greater general interest in genome sequencing, likely portends the selective finding of even higher relative levels of substitutions and deletions within codon 6 in the coming years.

The human genome browser at UCSC.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6716) Google Scholar). The sequence centered at codon 6 is the only site within the β-globin gene that meets the requirements for self-catalyzed depurination mediated by cruciform extrusion of a specific stem-loop-forming sequence. Consistent with this capacity, the expected self-depurination hotspot has the highest incidence of mutation among the distinct variants documented by the Hb Var (1Hardison R.C. Chui D.H.K.

Hb Var: a relational database of human hemoglobin variants and thalassemia mutations at the globin gene server and all recent updates.Hum.

Human gene mutation database: a biomedical information and research resource.Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) databases (Fig. 1B, top). As many as 27 β-globin variants (i.e. haplotypes) have a mutated codon 6 (Table 1), far above the median of 4 variants for any other codon in the gene. The total number of distinct codon 6 mutations (i.e. each a different substitution or deletion) represented among these variants is 9 (Table 1), 2.25-fold higher than the median for the rest of the gene. Indeed, as expected from error-prone repair of an apurinic site, all 6 substitutions possible at positions 1 and 2 of codon 6 (GAG) have been found (Fig. 2B and Table 1), and at least three of them (Hb S, Hb C, and Hb Grignoli) have been associated with a particular clinical phenotype. For example, a G→A substitution at the first residue (HBB:c.19G>A), characteristic of hemoglobin C (Hb C), has been documented in 5 distinct variants of African origin. Likewise, an A→T substitution at the second residue (HBB:c.20A>T) underlies Hb S (sickle cell), observed in 14 variants that arose independently in African, Middle Eastern, Indian, and Latin American genetic backgrounds. Codon 6 is also the site of three disease-causing deletions. Single-nucleotide deletions at positions 1 and 2, exactly where they might be expected as a result of fraying after a backbone break at the apurinic site, have been reported to cause β0-thalassemia in patients of German and Mediterranean ancestry, respectively. Another deletion of the entire codon 6 (Hb Leiden) has been associated with hemolytic anemia in families from The Netherlands, China, Thailand, United States, South Africa, Mexico, and Yugoslavia. A fourth deletion spanning the last residue of codon 5 and the first of codon 6 (HBB:c.18_19delTG) also causes a β-thalassemia (Hb Var database) (1Hardison R.C. Chui D.H.K. Giardine B. Riemer C. Patrinos G.P. Anagnou N. Miller W. Wajcman H. Hb Var: a relational database of human hemoglobin variants and thalassemia mutations at the globin gene server and all recent updates.Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, mutations at position 3 of codon 6 have not been reported (see below). A substitution of G→A at the fourth residue of the loop, which is the first position of codon 7 (HBB:c.22G>A), has been documented in combination with β-thalassemia (Chinese/Thai origin) (15Tuchinda S. Beale D. Lehmann H. A new haemoglobin in a Thai family: a case of haemoglobin Siriraj-Beta thalassaemia.Br. Med. J. 1965; 1: 1583-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This mutation has the interesting effect of changing the loop to 5′GAGA, with no clinical consequence. As this is the sequence for self-depurination of the second residue of the loop, an A (16Fresco J. Amosova O. Wei P. Alvarez-Dominguez J. Glumcher D. Torres R. Pontarotti P. Evolutionary Biology: Concepts, Biodiversity, Macroevolution and Genome Evolution. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2011: 3-19Google Scholar), the capacity for further variation is not lost. Another substitution of the same loop residue, G→C (African American origin) creates a 5′GAGC loop which cannot self-depurinate and has no clinical significance (Hb Var database) (1Hardison R.C. Chui D.H.K. Giardine B. Riemer C. Patrinos G.P. Anagnou N. Miller W. Wajcman H. Hb Var: a relational database of human hemoglobin variants and thalassemia mutations at the globin gene server and all recent updates.Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Stem formation requires complementary base pairing between nearly all of the residues in the inverted complementary sequences flanking the loop (comprising on the 5′ side, codons 5, 4, and one residue in codon 3, and on the 3′ side, 2 residues in codon 7, 3 in codon 8, and 2 in codon 9; Fig. 2 and Table 2). Conceivably, any of these stem-forming residues might undergo mutation if, as a consequence of the apurinic site resulting from self-depurination of the 5′G residue of the loop, 3′ or 5′ exonucleases were to proceed far enough beyond the loop and into the stem as to make it vulnerable to error-prone repair. However, of 16 potential stem-forming residues (including the second residue of codon 3 and third residue of codon 9, because a mutation in either of these residues can create an eighth base pair in the stem), a total of only 18 substitutions and 3 deletions of 2 residues each (including the deletion spanning residue 3 of codon 5 in the stem and residue 1 of codon 6 in the loop) have been reported (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Of these, 3 add stability to the stem by converting the C-A mismatch at the third stem position (counting from the base of the loop) to a T·A or C·G base pair (2 mutations in codon 5 and 1 in codon 8). However they affect stem stability, none of the stem mutations is associated with a clinically abnormal phenotype, and most prevent stem-loop formation.TABLE 2Mutations reported in stem-forming codons 3–5 and 7–9 of the only self-depurination site in the β-globin geneCodons with mutationsMutation nameEffect on stem-loopClinical effectEthnic backgroundReferenceACT 4/1Hb Benin CityDisruptsNoneNigerian36Ivaldi G.

Except for codon 7, the incidence of substitutions in the potential stem-forming codons is below the average, which is very modest compared with that of codon 6 (Fig. 1B, top). Conservation analysis was used to trace the evolutionary emergence of the β-globin self-depurination sequence. Among the β-globin genes of 46 vertebrate species, the loop + first base pair motif (5′TGAGGA) is widely present among placental mammals (Fig. 3C, bottom). This motif can only confer self-depurination capacity when accompanied by a flanking inverted repeat sequence that enables stem-loop formation and extrusion. Interestingly, such a stem-forming sequence feature appears to have evolved more recently, exclusively among primates (and then only in hot damp climates where malaria occurs). For example, positions 1 and 2 of codon 9, which are highly variable among nonprimate mammals, have only been fixed recently as 5′TC in the primate clade, enabling base pairing with 5′GA at the third position of codon 3 and the first position of codon 4 (Figs. 2B and 3C, bottom). Likewise, an ancestral G at the first position of codon 5, preserved from the zebrafish to the tree shrew, has been replaced among primates by a C residue, resulting in a change from a G-A stem mismatch to the more favorable C-A mismatch, which has the potential to form a base pair with complementary stereochemistry in which the C is protonated near neutrality (17Purrello R.

Indeed, specific positions that contribute critically to stem formation and stability appear to have evolved rapidly in the primate subgroup, but not in the larger placental mammal or other related vertebrate groups (Fig. 3C, top). As a result, the very sequence comprising the β-globin site of self-depurination remains an evolutionarily constrained element, i.e. neutral to slowly evolving, when all known vertebrate sequences are aligned, when all mammalian ones are as well, but not when all those of primates are compared (Fig. 3B). This is unlike elsewhere in the gene (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, stem-forming sequence features are absent from the 4 other human β-like globins (HBD, HBE, HBG1 and HBG2) and from the α-globin paralogs HBA1 and HBA2 (Fig. 1C), further supporting a rather recent acquisition of self-depurination potential at the primate HBB locus. Additionally, whereas the 5′TGAGGA loop + first base pair motif appears only in the closely related HBE1 and HBD paralogs (Fig. 1C), stem-forming potential around this site is absent in all vertebrates examined. It is worth noting in this connection that the HBA paralogs have as many documented variants as HBB, but the incidence of codon mutation in these variants is evenly distributed, as expected from the fact that they have no predicted self-depurination sites (Fig. 1B, middle and bottom). Taken together, these findings suggest a link between evolving the capacity for site-specific self-depurination in β-globin and gaining heightened sequence variability at that site. Hence, once the primates acquired the stem-forming sequence that enables self-depurination in the loop, the loop sequence became a mutation hotspot of critical phenotypic consequence. Indeed, many mutations at this site that confer resistance to malaria have been retained in populations affected by the disease. Several features make the self-depurination site in the β-globin gene especially appropriate for investigation: the gene encodes the functionally important protein component of erythrocytes in all vertebrates; it contains but one such site, making its evolution easier to trace; and mutations at that site underlie several hemoglobinopathies which confer resistance to malaria (18Allison A.C. The discovery of resistance to malaria of sickle-cell heterozygotes.Biochem. Mol. Biol. Educ. 2002; 30: 279-287Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Allison A.C. Genetic control of resistance to human malaria.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have shown here that codon 6, the site vulnerable to self-depurination, has by far the highest incidence of documented substitutions and short deletions among human β-globin variants. Our implication is that this outstanding incidence is due in large measure to the coincidence of the self-depurination mechanism with this codon and its surrounding residues. Conceivably, however, this incidence could be ascribed not only to the self-depurination mechanism shown to be manifest there, but in addition to two other factors: significant ascertainment due to sampling bias and selection bias due to the protection against malaria conferred by some of those variants. It is certainly the case that malaria-protecting codon 6 mutations Hb S and Hb C, being clinically consequential and highly prevalent in the human population, have prompted extensive studies on haplotype variation. There are, however, mutations at other sites in the gene whose clinical relevance and prevalence in the population have also prompted such detailed examination. One such site is codon 26, where the Hb E (HBB:c.79G>A) mutation also protects against malaria and has been fixed at high frequency in malaria-affected populations (20Vichinsky E. Hemoglobin E syndromes.Hematol. Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2007; 2007: 79-83Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Chotivanich K. Udomsangpetch R. Pattanapanyasat K. Chierakul W. Simpson J. Looareesuwan S. White N. Hemoglobin E: a balanced polymorphism protective against high parasitemias and thus severe P. falciparum malaria.Blood. 2002; 100: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another is codon 121, where the Hb D mutation (HBB:c.364G>C) is indirectly associated with such protection, apparently because it very often occurs together with Hb S or β-thalassemia; and it too has been fixed at high frequency in malaria-affected populations (22Perea F.J. Casas-Castañeda M. Villalobos-Arámbula A.R. Barajas H. Alvarez F. Camacho A. Hermosillo R.M. Ibarra B. Hb D-Los Angeles associated with Hb S or β-thalassemia in four Mexican Mestizo families.Hemoglobin. 1999; 23: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although they have similarly been the subject of extensive investigation, neither of these mutations shows an incidence comparable with that of codon 6 (Fig. 1B, top). Indeed, it takes a mechanism with the potential for recurrence such as that inherent in self-depurination, to create a hotspot of the intensity seen at codon 6 (Fig. 1B, top). Such a potential clearly does not exist at codons 26 or 121, or anywhere else in the β-globin gene; nor does it exist anywhere in the α-globin genes (Fig. 1B, middle and bottom), which are devoid of SDP sites. More generally, whereas detailed large scale studies have focused primarily on a few clinically important codons, individual small scale studies have covered virtually all codons in the gene. This is likely because the incidence of clinically consequential mutations is uniform across the β-globin gene (Fig. 4). Thus, the extent to which"

Recently, peripheral blood derived progenitor cells have been identified to have in addition to their angiogenic potential also osteogenic characteristics, leading to the hypothesis that bone regeneration could be stimulated by local administration of these cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the angiogenic potential of locally administered progenitor cells to improve bone defect healing. Cells were separated from the peripheral blood of donor animals using the markers CD34 and CD133. Results of the in vitro experiments confirmed high angiogenic potential in the CD133(+) cell group. CD34(+) and CD133(+) cells were tested in an in vivo rat femoral defect model of delayed healing for their positive effect on the healing outcome. An increased callus formation and higher bone mineral density of callus tissue was found after the CD133(+) cell treatment compared to the group treated with CD34(+) cells and the control group without cells. Histological findings confirmed an increase in vessel formation and mineralization at day 42 in the osteotomy gap after CD133(+) cell transplantation. The higher angiogenic potential of CD133(+) cells from the in vitro experients therefore correlates with the in vivo data. This study demonstrates the suitability of angiogenic precursors to further bone healing and gives an indication that peripheral blood is a promising source for progenitor cells circumventing the problems associated with bone marrow extraction."

These abnormally expressed receptors likely play a role in the development of MPNSTs. Alterations in growth factor receptor-mediated signaling may also be caused by the activation of receptors characteristically present on normal Schwann cells but overexpressed in MPNST cells, which is the case for PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β) (5Badache A.

Activation of PDGFR-β in MPNST cell lines induces an increase in intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of calmodulin (CaM) kinase II, signaling events that do not happen when PDGFR-β is stimulated in normal Schwann cells (6Dang I.

The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB is a central downstream component of growth factor receptor-mediated signaling and plays an essential role in controlling normal cell survival, proliferation, and migration (7Franke T.F. PI3K/Akt: getting it right matters.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6473-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The question of how Akt signaling can mediate such diverse cellular functions may be explained in part by the three different Akt isoforms (Akt1 (α), Akt2 (β), and Akt3 (γ)) that make up the Akt family. These isoforms appear to play unique as well as overlapping roles in the cell (8Gonzalez E. McGraw T.E. The Akt kinases: isoform specificity in metabolism and cancer.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2502-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the Akt pathway can lead to tumor formation by altering critical biological outcomes within the cell. Akt activation occurs through both PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways. During PI3K-dependent activation, binding of a growth factor to its receptor tyrosine kinase recruits and activates PI3K, which then catalyzes the conversion of membrane phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Akt is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it is anchored through its pleckstrin homology domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and becomes activated through phosphorylation in the kinase domain at Thr-308 by PDK1 (protein-dependent kinase-1) and in the regulatory domain at Ser-473 by mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) (9Sarbassov D.D.

The PI3K-independent pathways that activate Akt are less well characterized and include direct interactions between Ras GTPase-activating protein and Akt (10Yue Y. Lypowy J. Hedhli N. Abdellatif M.

In this study, we examined the role of calcium/CaM in PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the NF1-derived MPNST cell line ST88-14, which overexpresses PDGFR-β and produces an abnormal increase in intracellular calcium as a result of PDGF-BB stimulation (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We found that calcium/CaM-dependent and -independent mechanisms act concurrently to influence Akt phosphorylation, but with different kinetics. Furthermore, we show that the calcium/CaM-dependent Akt phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB supports survival under conditions that promote apoptosis, suggesting a potential mechanism by which these cells evade normal programmed cell death and promote tumorigenesis. The NF1-derived MPNST cell line ST88-14 (obtained from Jonathan Fletcher, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) was grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS. The day before an experiment, cells were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/35-mm dish (immunoblotting experiments) or 1.5–2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish (immunoprecipitation experiments) and incubated overnight in DMEM and 5% FBS. Four hours prior to growth factor treatment, the serum-containing medium was replaced with DMEM without FBS to reduce the stimulatory effects of the serum. Human Schwann cells were prepared from human peripheral nerve (obtained from Dr. Patrick Wood, Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL) by the method of Casella et al. (15Casella G.T. Bunge R.P. Wood P.M. Improved method for harvesting human Schwann cells from mature peripheral nerve and expansion in vitro.Glia. 1996; 17: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The epineurium was removed from the nerves, and the nerves were cut into 2-mm segments and placed on 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing DMEM and 10% FBS. The nerve segments were allowed to incubate for 2 weeks in the presence of 2 μm forskolin (Calbiochem) and 10 ng/ml neuregulin β1 (a gift from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). The fascicles were dissociated with collagenase, and the dissociated cells were placed on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes. The cells were grown in DMEM and 5% FBS supplemented with 10 ng/ml neuregulin β1. Differential adhesion was used to remove contaminating fibroblasts each time the cells were passaged and before the cells were plated for an experiment. Four hours before growth factor addition, the growth medium was removed from the cells and replaced with DMEM without serum, neuregulin β1, or forskolin to reduce the stimulatory effects of these agents. The cells on 35-mm culture dishes were treated with PDGF-BB (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or stem cell factor (SCF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. For some experiments, the inhibitors LY294002 (50 μm), wortmannin (0.2 μm), BAPTA-AM (25 μm) (Calbiochem), W7 (10 μm), and W5 (10 μm) (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added 30 min prior to growth factor treatment. At the designated time points, cells were placed on ice, washed twice with cold PBS containing 1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4, and immediately solubilized in 50–100 μl of sample buffer. Cellular proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After blocking in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody: anti-NF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-ERK (pERK)1/2, anti-phospho-Akt (pAkt), anti-Akt, anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), anti-cleaved PARP (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); or anti-GAPDH (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The membrane was washed four times with TBS and 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce and PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Exposed films were semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry using NIH ImageJ software. At designated time points after growth factor treatment, ST88-14 cells (1.5–2 × 106 cells) were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis/immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and incubated with 2 μg of rabbit anti-CaM monoclonal antibody (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose (15 μl; Pierce) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with mixing. The agarose pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis/immunoprecipitation buffer. After the last wash, 15 μl of 2.5× reducing sample buffer was added to the agarose pellets. The eluted proteins were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blot analysis. The blots were immunostained for Akt and CaM. The protein bands on films were semiquantitatively analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software. ST88-14 cells were plated at a density of 150,000 cells/35-mm tissue culture dish. The following day, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once to remove traces of serum before adding low glucose minimum essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) without serum supplementation. The CaM inhibitor W7 or W5 or vehicle (Me2SO) was added 30 min prior to PDGF-BB stimulation. The cells were incubated for 24 h and then harvested in sample buffer. Cleavage of nuclear PARP was analyzed by Western blotting. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software. Student's t test was used to compare between two groups with significance at p < 0.05. Previous work from our laboratory (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested that the atypical increase in intracellular calcium resulting from PDGFR-β activation in NF1-derived Schwann cells may influence receptor-mediated signaling cascades, particularly the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Prior to examining PDGF-BB-induced signaling in NF1-derived ST88-14 cells, we assessed the basal levels of phosphorylation and expression of Akt and ERK1/2 to determine whether constitutively elevated Ras-GTP, inherent to NF1-derived cells, affects these pathways in unstimulated cells. ST88-14 cells were compared with normal human Schwann cells (nhSc) under serum-free conditions to remove contributions from serum-induced signaling. The ST88-14 cells expressed an undetectable level of neurofibromin (Fig. 1) and had 4-fold more Ras-GTP than nhSc (data not shown), consistent with the original characterization of the ST88-14 cell line as well as other NF1-derived MPNST Schwann cells (16DeClue J.E. Papageorge A.G. Fletcher J.A. Diehl S.R. Ratner N. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Abnormal regulation of mammalian p21ras contributes to malignant tumor growth in von Recklinghausen (type 1) neurofibromatosis.Cell. 1992; 69: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The basal levels of both Akt phosphorylated at Ser-473 (pAktSer-473) and total Akt were comparable between nhSc and ST88-14 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, ST88-14 cells had increased amounts of pERK1/2 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the amount of total ERK protein was markedly higher in nhSc, even though pERK was greater in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 1). These data imply that, at least in unstimulated ST88-14 cells, the NF1 phenotype has no appreciable effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway, whereas the MAPK pathway shows a substantial increase in basal activity relative to nhSc. We analyzed the time course of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation after activation by either SCF or PDGF-BB. Each of these growth factors has its receptor overexpressed in the ST88-14 cell line (4Badache A. Muja N. De Vries G.H.

Physiol. 1998; 177: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Over a 2-h time period, maximum phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 occurred within 5 min following stimulation of ST88-14 cells with either SCF (Fig. 2A) or PDGF-BB (Fig. 2B). However, pAktSer-473 returned to nearly unstimulated levels (0 min) within 1 h after SCF treatment (Fig. 2A), whereas a high level of pAktSer-473 in PDGF-BB-treated cells was sustained for >2 h (Fig. 2B). A similar comparison between nhSc and ST88-14 cells after stimulation with PDGF-BB revealed a transient phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in nhSc (Fig. 2C) relative to the sustained phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in ST88-14 cells (Fig. 2D). To determine whether sustained activation of the MAPK pathway also occurs in ST88-14 cells after PDGF-BB stimulation, the blots were immunostained for pERK1/2. Similar to the initial kinetics of SCF- or PDGF-BB-induced pAktSer-473 formation described above, maximum phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in ST88-14 cells occurred within 5 min. The initial phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not as rapid in nhSc, which appeared to peak between 5 and 30 min (Fig. 2C). The PDGF-BB-induced increase in pERK1/2 levels in ST88-14 cells was sustained at least 30 min longer than that in ST88-14 cells stimulated with SCF (Fig. 2, A and B) or in nhSc stimulated with PDGF-BB (Fig. 2, C and D). However, by 120 min, the amount of pERK1/2 in PDGF-BB-treated ST88-14 cells had returned to unstimulated levels (0 min) (Fig. 2, B and D). These observations indicate that, relative to Akt, the MAPK pathway in ST88-14 cells is noticeably less susceptible to sustained activation by PDGF-BB. On the basis of our previous findings that PDGF-BB stimulation elicits an increase in intracellular calcium in NF1-derived Schwann cell lines, including ST88-14 cells, and that this intracellular calcium increase does not occur in PDGF-BB-stimulated nhSc (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we designed experiments to determine whether the PDGF-BB-stimulated intracellular calcium increase was responsible for the sustained Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. ST88-14 cells were preincubated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM for 30 min prior to PDGF-BB stimulation. Fig. 3A shows that BAPTA-AM treatment significantly inhibited the sustained (120 min) phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 without affecting the transient (30 min) phosphorylation. This result indicates that PDGF-BB induces both a transient calcium-independent and a sustained calcium-dependent phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. To establish whether CaM is involved in the sustained calcium-mediated component of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation, we pre-incubated ST88-14 cells for 30 min with the CaM antagonist W7 (10 μm) before PDGF-BB treatment. Similar to BAPTA-AM-treated cells, only the sustained component (120 min) of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation was inhibited in the presence of W7 (Fig. 3B). For a control, we used the less potent CaM inhibitor W5, which appeared to have less of an effect (Fig. 3B). These combined data indicate that the sustained phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in PDGF-BB-stimulated ST88-14 cells is calcium/CaM-dependent, whereas transient Akt phosphorylation is not. The dependence of PDGF-BB-induced transient (calcium/CaM-independent) and sustained (calcium/CaM-dependent) Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation on PI3K activity was examined by preincubating cells for 30 min with 50 μm LY294002 prior to stimulation with PDGF-BB. In the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, there was almost a complete inhibition of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation over the 120-min time period (Fig. 4). A similar effect was obtained with 0.2 μm wortmannin (data not shown). These results indicate that both the calcium/CaM-independent and -dependent components of Akt phosphorylation require PI3K activity. Because both the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and the CaM antagonist W7 inhibited only the sustained (120 min) component of PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation, we considered the possibility that CaM interacts directly with Akt to form a functional complex that could be involved in maintaining Akt in a phosphorylated state. To establish whether direct interactions between CaM and Akt occur in a PDGF-BB-dependent manner, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments in which CaM was immunoprecipitated from ST88-14 cells treated with PDGF-BB for either 30 or 120 min. We consistently found that Akt was associated with CaM in unstimulated cells and that PDGF-BB stimulation increased the amount of this association over the 120-min time period (Fig. 5). These results indicate that PDGF-BB induces a direct and sustained association of CaM with Akt, which coincides with the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. Given that Akt activation promotes cell survival, we next investigated whether PDGF-BB stimulation could enhance ST88-14 cell survival under conditions that would be expected to drive the cells toward apoptosis and, if so, whether this survival stimulus is dependent on CaM. To induce apoptosis, cells were cultured in low glucose MEM under conditions of serum deprivation. Treatment with PDGF-BB alone or after a 30-min pretreatment with W7 or the control analog W5 was used to determine the dependence of PDGF-BB-induced cell survival on CaM. Cellular morphology (Fig. 6, A–F) and cleavage of nuclear PARP (Fig. 6, G and H) were used to evaluate the apoptotic status of the cells after 24 h. Relative to cells grown in medium containing serum (Fig. 6A), the cells maintained in serum-free/low glucose MEM for 24 h showed cell contraction and rounding (Fig. 6B, arrowheads), characteristic of cells undergoing cell death, with significant cleavage of PARP. PDGF-BB added to serum-free/low glucose MEM helped maintained normal cellular morphology (Fig. 6C) and prevented PARP cleavage, indicating that PDGF-BB promotes survival under these conditions. The anti-apoptotic effect of PDGF-BB was blocked by the CaM antagonist W7, which caused cell contraction and rounding (Fig. 6D, arrowheads) and produced PARP cleavage beyond that of the serum-free/low glucose medium alone. This result suggests that CaM may have an additional role in promoting survival that is independent of PDGF-BB stimulation. In contrast, cells pretreated with the control analog W5 (Fig. 6E) showed less cell contraction and rounding and PARP cleavage than the W7-treated cells. SCF, which produced only a transient phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (Fig. 2A), showed minimum effectiveness in reversing the outcomes of serum deprivation and low glucose, i.e. morphology associated with dying cells (Fig. 6F), and preventing PARP cleavage. Considered together with our evidence that W7 inhibits only the sustained portion of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), these results suggest that PDGF-BB-induced activation of CaM plays an important role in promoting survival of ST88-14 cells, most likely through sustained Akt activation. Neurofibromin-deficient cells generated from NF1 tumors characteristically hyperproliferate as a consequence of their constitutively elevated Ras activity and subsequent activation of signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth (1Carroll S.L.

Physiol. 1998; 177: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which, when coupled with aberrant intracellular signaling, can cause these cells to express phenotypic traits characteristic of tumors, such as unregulated growth and survival. In this study, we focused on the atypical intracellular calcium signaling coupled to the activation of overexpressed PDGFR-β (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that calcium/CaM plays a necessary role in a sustained but not transient Akt phosphorylation resulting from PDGF-BB stimulation. We also present evidence that PDGF-BB-induced activation of CaM has a prosurvival influence on ST88-14 cells placed under conditions that promote cell death, suggesting that PDGF-BB-induced sustained Akt activation may be a mechanism by which NF1-derived MPNST cells evade apoptosis. In our initial characterization, we found that the extent of Akt expression and phosphorylation in unstimulated ST88-14 cells was essentially the same as in nhSc, indicating that constitutively elevated Ras-GTP was not affecting the basal (unstimulated) levels of pAkt and that there was no amplification or overexpression of Akt by the ST88-14 cells. In contrast and consistent with elevated Ras-GTP as an upstream activator of the MAPK pathway, pERK was significantly increased in the unstimulated ST88-14 cells relative to nhSc, which is in agreement with previous characterizations of the ST88-14 cell line (16DeClue J.E.

Vik T.A. Ryder J.W. Srour E.F. Jacks T. Shannon K. Clapp D.W. Nf1 regulates hematopoietic progenitor cell growth and Ras signaling in response to multiple cytokines.J. Exp.

Aberrant regulation of Ras proteins in malignant tumour cells from type 1 neurofibromatosis patients.Nature. 1992; 356: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though ST88-14 cells had levels of pERK that were constitutively elevated, the amount of total ERK protein was reduced compared with that expressed by nhSc. Thus, relative to nhSc, the levels of pERK were higher in unstimulated ST88-14 cells even though the amount of total ERK protein was lower. This result might suggest that chronic elevation of pERK in ST88-14 cells results in a negative feedback mechanism that reduces the expression of ERK protein in an effort to limit ERK activation. Although nhSc typically do not express receptors for SCF, PDGFR-β is expressed by both nhSc and ST88-14 cells (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which allowed us to compare PDGF-BB activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway between the two cell types. Our results show that the duration of PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in ST88-14 cells extended beyond 120 min, whereas in PDGF-BB-stimulated nhSc, pAktSer-473 had returned to nearly unstimulated levels by 60 min. The longer duration of Akt phosphorylation was also specific to PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in the ST88-14 cells because stimulation with SCF resulted in a time course for pAkt formation that was transient, similar to that for PDGF-stimulated nhSc. A previous study from our laboratory showed that there is an increase in intracellular calcium in response to PDGF-BB stimulation of NF1-derived Schwann cell lines but not nhSc and that this calcium response is associated with CaM activation as indicated by CaM kinase II phosphorylation (6Dang I. De Vries G.H. Schwann cell lines derived from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors respond abnormally to platelet-derived growth factor-BB.J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the basis of this earlier work, we hypothesized that a calcium/CaM-dependent mechanism was responsible for sustained Akt phosphorylation. Our studies with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and the CaM antagonist W7 demonstrate that the PDGF-BB-induced calcium activation of CaM is responsible for the sustained portion of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation and that the transient phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 is a separate event independent of either calcium or CaM. This is a notable observation because it shows that Akt phosphorylation can be regulated concurrently by more than one mechanism, in this case, calcium/CaM-independent and -dependent mechanisms. Previous reports in which CaM was shown to be involved in Akt activation include CaM association with the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (21Joyal J.L. Burks D.J. Pons S. Matter W.F. Vlahos C.J. White M.F. Sacks D.B. Calmodulin activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28183-28186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and CaM activation of CaM kinase kinase, which then proceeds to phosphorylate Akt directly (14Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Calcium promotes cell survival through CaM-K kinase activation of the protein-kinase-B pathway.Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, in our hands, experiments to co-immunoprecipitate CaM with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K or to block sustained Akt phosphorylation with the specific CaM kinase kinase inhibitor STO609 provided no evidence for either of these two mechanisms occurring in PDGF-BB-stimulated ST88-14 cells (data not shown). More recent studies with mouse mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer cell lines have provided evidence for an EGF-induced direct association between CaM and Akt that may serve to translocate Akt to the plasma membrane, where it becomes activated (12Deb T.B. Coticchia C.M. Dickson R.B. Calmodulin-mediated activation of Akt regulates survival of c-Myc-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38903-38911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Coticchia C.M. Revankar C.M. Deb T.B. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Calmodulin modulates Akt activity in human breast cancer cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2009; 115: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our finding that PDGF-BB increases the formation of a CaM and Akt immunoprecipitable complex in ST88-14 cells is consistent with this type of functional complex being formed between the two molecules, although it remains to be determined whether the PDGF-BB-induced formation of this complex serves to translocate Akt to the plasma membrane or other sites within the cell. Nonetheless, our co-immunoprecipitation results, together with the inhibition of sustained Akt phosphorylation by W7 and, to a lesser extent, by the weaker antagonist W5, strongly suggest that this PDGF-BB-induced physical association between CaM and Akt is responsible for its sustained activation. A major difference between our results and those of Deb et al. (12Deb T.B. Coticchia C.M. Dickson R.B. Calmodulin-mediated activation of Akt regulates survival of c-Myc-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38903-38911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Coticchia et al. (13Coticchia C.M. Revankar C.M. Deb T.B. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Calmodulin modulates Akt activity in human breast cancer cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2009; 115: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is that, in mouse mammary and human breast cancer cell lines, treatment with the CaM antagonist W7 blocked all of Akt phosphorylation, whereas in our studies with ST88-14 cells, W7 inhibited only sustained Akt phosphorylation without a discernible effect on the transient portion. Thus, their results indicate that all of the EGF-induced Akt activation occurred through one CaM-dependent mechanism, whereas our results clearly indicate that two separate mechanisms are involved concurrently in the activation of Akt. Both the calcium/CaM-dependent and -independent mechanisms were sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, indicating that each is PI3K-dependent and requires Akt to associate with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate at the plasma membrane prior to activation by phosphorylation. It is worth considering in this context that two binding sites for calcium/CaM have been identified within Akt (11Dong B. Valencia C.A. Liu R. Ca2+/calmodulin directly interacts with the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25131-25140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of these sites is at the N terminus of the kinase catalytic domain, and the other is within the first half of the pleckstrin homology domain, which also is the domain necessary for Akt to associate with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate at the plasma membrane. It is possible that calcium/CaM binds the pleckstrin homology domain of activated Akt, thereby releasing it from the membrane and preventing or delaying its inactivation by an Akt phosphatase (22Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. PHLPP: a phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates Akt, promotes apoptosis, and suppresses tumor growth.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Although we could not ascertain definitively that Akt plays a direct role in the PDGF-BB-induced survival of serum-deprived ST88-14 cells, our results do show that the PDGF-BB-induced calcium/CaM response is necessary for this survival. By blocking the CaM-dependent sustained Akt phosphorylation with W7 or by stimulating the cells with SCF, which produced only a transient Akt response, we showed that transient activation of Akt is not sufficient to counteract the apoptotic response (PARP cleavage) induced by serum and glucose deprivation. Given the suggested role of CaM in directing Akt to specific intracellular sites (12Deb T.B. Coticchia C.M. Dickson R.B. Calmodulin-mediated activation of Akt regulates survival of c-Myc-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38903-38911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Coticchia C.M. Revankar C.M. Deb T.B. Dickson R.B. Johnson M.D. Calmodulin modulates Akt activity in human breast cancer cell lines.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2009; 115: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), together with recent evidence indicating that distinct subcellular pools of Akt are important for its specific functions (23Maiuri T. Ho J. Stambolic V. Regulation of adipocyte differentiation by distinct subcellular pools of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15038-15047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is possible that, in ST88-14 cells, CaM may serve to target activated Akt to a particular intracellular site(s) where anti-apoptotic substrates for Akt reside. It is not known whether there is an Akt isoform dependence for NF1, and information on this topic for other Ras-induced tumors is limited. One Ras-induced model in which Akt isoform specificity has been studied is mutant K-Ras-mediated lung tumorigenesis (24Hollander M.C. Maier C.R. Hobbs E.A. Ashmore A.R. Linnoila R.I. Dennis P.A. Akt1 deletion prevents lung tumorigenesis by mutant K-ras.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 1812-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which Akt1 was identified as the only Akt isoform required for tumor initiation and progression. This study is consistent with Akt1 knock-out mice being growth-impaired (25Cho H. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Feng F. Birnbaum M.J. Akt1/PKBα is required for normal growth but dispensable for maintenance of glucose homeostasis in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38349-38352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). However, other studies have linked Akt-dependent cell survival to Akt3 (26Liu X. Shi Y. Birnbaum M.J. Ye K. De Jong R. Oltersdorf T. Giranda V.L. Luo Y. Quantitative analysis of anti-apoptotic function of Akt in Akt1 and Akt2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells under normal and stressed conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31380-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or, in some tumor cell lines, all three Akt isoforms (27Koseoglu S. Lu Z. Kumar C. Kirschmeier P. Zou J. AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3-dependent cell survival is cell line-specific and knockdown of all three isoforms selectively induces apoptosis in 20 human tumor cell lines.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that the survival function of an Akt isoform may be cell line-specific. Indeed, with respect to potential therapeutic targets, it will be important to ascertain whether a particular Akt isoform is responsible for its sustained phosphorylation mediated by calcium/CaM in NF1 tumor cells. To date, emphasis has been placed primarily on how growth factors affect proliferation of NF1 tumor cells. Along this line, EGF has been shown to be the most potent growth factor for stimulating proliferation of NF1-derived Schwann cells (3DeClue J.E. Heffelfinger S. Benvenuto G. Ling B. Li S. Rui W. Vass W.C. Viskochil D. Ratner N. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in neurofibromatosis type 1-related tumors and NF1 animal models.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas PDGF-BB is only slightly stimulatory (5Badache A. De Vries G.H. Neurofibrosarcoma-derived Schwann cells overexpress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and are induced to proliferate by PDGF BB.J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and there is little if any stimulation of proliferation by SCF (4Badache A. Muja N. De Vries G.H. Expression of Kit in neurofibromin-deficient human Schwann cells: role in Schwann cell hyperplasia associated with type 1 neurofibromatosis.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, PDGF-BB, which does not appear to have a major role in proliferation of MPNST cells, may enhance their survival by stimulating a calcium/CaM-dependent mechanism involved in maintaining Akt in an active state. We propose that PDGF signaling allows NF1 Schwann cells to evade normal programmed cell death and that this aberrant survival is a component of tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2011977715,"Remote homology detection among proteins utilizing only the unlabelled sequences is a central problem in comparative genomics. The existing cluster kernel methods based on neighborhoods and profiles and the Markov clustering algorithms are currently the most popular methods for protein family recognition. The deviation from random walks with inflation or dependency on hard threshold in similarity measure in those methods requires an enhancement for homology detection among multi-domain proteins. We propose to combine spectral clustering with neighborhood kernels in Markov similarity for enhancing sensitivity in detecting homology independent of “recent” paralogs. The spectral clustering approach with new combined local alignment kernels more effectively exploits the unsupervised protein sequences globally reducing inter-cluster walks. When combined with the corrections based on modified symmetry based proximity norm deemphasizing outliers, the technique proposed in this article outperforms other state-of-the-art cluster kernels among all twelve implemented kernels. The comparison with the state-of-the-art string and mismatch kernels also show the superior performance scores provided by the proposed kernels. Similar performance improvement also is found over an existing large dataset. Therefore the proposed spectral clustering framework over combined local alignment kernels with modified symmetry based correction achieves superior performance for unsupervised remote homolog detection even in multi-domain and promiscuous domain proteins from Genolevures database families with better biological relevance.
