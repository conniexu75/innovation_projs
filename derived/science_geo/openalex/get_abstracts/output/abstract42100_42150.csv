https://openalex.org/W1501532586,"The present report describes, for the first time, the identification of two constitutive forms of heme oxygenase, designated as HO-1 and HO-2, in rat liver microsomal fractions. HO-1 was purified to homogeneity and exhibited a specific activity of up to 4000 nmol of bilirubin/mg of protein/h. HO-2 was partially purified to a specific activity of 250 nmol of bilirubin/mg of protein/h. In the native state, the relative activity of HO-2 surpassed that of HO-1 by 2-3-fold. However, a remarkable difference existed in the regulatory mechanism(s) for the production of the two enzyme forms. Whereas the activity of HO-1 was increased up to 100-fold in response to cobalt, cadmium, hematin, phenylhydrazine, and bromobenzene, that of HO-2 was fully refractory to these agents. The two forms differed in their apparent Km, thermolability, ammonium sulfate precipitation, antigenicity, electrophoretic mobility under nondenaturing conditions, and chromatographic behavior. Specifically, for HO-1 the apparent Km value was 0.24 microM, whereas that for HO-2 was 0.67 microM. HO-2 preparation was more susceptible to heat inactivation; nearly 65% activity was retained by HO-1 preparation after exposure to 60 degrees C for 10 min, whereas under the same conditions only about 25% of HO-2 activity was retained. When subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation the bulk of HO-1 activity precipitated between 0 and 35% saturation, whereas that of HO-2 was precipitated between 35 and 65% saturation. The two forms appeared as immunologically different entities, in so far as a crossreactivity between antibody raised against HO-1 in rabbit and HO-2 could not be detected. Similarities were observed in respect to cofactor requirements for activity, sensitivity to inhibitors, as well as their reactivity towards the substrates used in this study, i.e. hematin, hematoheme, and cytochrome c. Specifically both forms of the enzyme required NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase, NADPH or NADH, and O2 for activity, and reactions were inhibited by KCN, NaN3, and CO. Both forms cleaved the tetrapyrrole molecule exclusively at the alpha-meso bridge to form biliverdin IX alpha isomer. HO-1 and HO-2 utilized hematin and hematoheme as substrates but not intact cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W2039412078,"To characterize the precursor of mammalian thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a rat hypothalamic lambda gt11 library was screened with an antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide representing a portion of the rat TRH prohormone. The nucleotide sequence of the immunopositive complementary DNA encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 29,247. This protein contained five copies of the sequence Gln-His-Pro-Gly flanked by paired basic amino acids and could therefore generate five TRH molecules. In addition, potential cleavage sites in the TRH precursor could produce other non-TRH peptides, which may be secreted. In situ hybridization to rat brain sections demonstrated that the pre-proTRH complementary DNA detected neurons concentrated in the parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus, the same location as cells detected by immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that mammalian TRH arises by posttranslational processing of a larger precursor protein. The ability of the TRH prohormone to generate multiple copies of the bioactive peptide may be an important mechanism in the amplification of hormone production."
https://openalex.org/W2000789135,"We have studied the role of the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio in the early development of Drosophila, using mutants and experimental manipulations that alter nuclear density. Haploid embryos produced by either maternal or paternal effect mutations compensate for haploidy by an extra nuclear division during the syncytial blastoderm stage. Decreasing the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio in wild-type embryos by ligation can cause a similar extra blastoderm division. Conversely, increasing this ratio can cause the omission of a blastoderm division. The duration of mitotic cycles is affected by the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio four cycles before the terminal blastoderm division. Transcription patterns in haploid embryos indicate that transcriptional activation is not directly controlled by the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, but may be an effect of the lengthening of interphase periods."
https://openalex.org/W1969398003,"Following treatment of a human B cell lymphoma with an anti-idiotype antibody, a subpopulation of tumor cells remained that had lost the tumor-specific heavy chain idiotypic determinant. Nucleotide sequence analyses of eight independent heavy chain variable region isolates showed extensive point mutations, so that no two sequences were identical. Comparison of pretreatment and posttreatment sequences implicated an amino acid in CDR2 as being involved in the idiotypic determinant. Apparently the malignant B cells escaped the therapeutic effects of the anti-idiotype antibody through an ongoing process of somatic mutation in their immunoglobulin genes. Nonrandom clustering of amino acid replacements in CDR2 suggested that growth of the tumor may have been influenced by endogenous selective forces interacting with the tumor cell-surface immunoglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W1583125800,"Two forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450), designated P-450MP-1 and P-450MP-2, were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes on the basis of mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase activity. Purified P-450MP-1 and P-450MP-2 contained 12-17 nmol of P-450/mg of protein and had apparent monomeric molecular weights of 48,000 and 50,000, respectively. P-450MP-1 and P-450MP-2 were found to be very similar proteins as judged by chromatographic behavior on n-octylamino-Sepharose 4B, hydroxylapatite, and DEAE- and CM-cellulose columns, spectral properties, amino acid composition, peptide mapping, double immunodiffusion analysis, immunoinhibition, and N-terminal amino acid sequences. In vitro translation of liver RNA yielded polypeptides migrating with P-450MP-1 or P-450MP-2, depending upon which form was in each sample, indicating that the two P-450s are translated from different mRNAs. When reconsituted with NADPH-cytochrome-P-450 reductase and L-alpha-dilauroyl-sn-glyceryo-3-phosphocholine, P-450MP-1 and P-450MP-2 gave apparently higher turnover numbers for mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation than did the P-450 in the microsomes. The addition of purified rat or human cytochrome b5 to the reconstituted system caused a significant increase in the hydroxylation activity; the maximum stimulation was obtained when the molar ratio of cytochrome b5 to P-450 was 3-fold. Rabbit anti-human cytochrome b5 inhibited NADH-cytochrome-c reductase and S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase activities in human liver microsomes. In the presence of cytochrome b5, the Km value for S-mephenytoin was 1.25 mM with all five purified cytochrome P-450s preparations, and Vmax values were 0.8-1.25 nmol of 4-hydroxy product formed per min/nmol of P-450. P-450MP is a relatively selective P-450 form that metabolizes substituted hydantoins well. Reactions catalyzed by purified P-450MP-1 and P-450MP-2 preparations and inhibited by anti-P-450MP in human liver microsomes include S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation, S-nirvanol 4-hydroxylation, S-mephenytoin N-demethylation, and diphenylhydantoin 4-hydroxylation. Thus, at least two very similar forms of human P-450 are involved in S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation, an activity which shows genetic polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2115114862,"O-2A progenitor cells are bipotential glial precursors that give rise to both oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes on a precise schedule in the rat CNS. Studies in culture suggest that oligodendrocyte differentiation occurs constitutively, while type-2 astrocyte differentiation requires an exogenous inducer such as fetal calf serum. Here we describe a rat brain cell culture system in which type-2 astrocytes develop on schedule in the absence of exogenous inducers. Coincident with type-2-astrocyte development, the cultures produce an âˆ¼20 kd type-2-astrocyte-inducing factor(s). Purified cultures of type-1 astrocytes can produce a similar factor(s). Under conditions where they produce type-2-astrocyte-inducing factor(s), both brain and type-1 astrocyte cultures produce a factor(s) with ciliary neurotrophic (CNTF)-like activity. Purified CNTF, like the inducers from brain and type-1 astrocyte cultures, prematurely induces type-2 astrocyte differentiation in brain cultures. These findings suggest that type-2 astrocyte development is initiated by a CNTF like protein produced by type-1 astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2030175533,"A pupal cuticle protein gene has been found within an intron of a Drosophila gene that encodes three purine pathway enzymatic activities. The intronic gene is encoded on the DNA strand opposite the purine pathway gene and is itself interrupted by an intron. Whereas the purine pathway gene is active throughout development, the intronic cuticle protein gene is expressed primarily over a 3 hr period in the abdominal epidermal cells of prepupae that secrete the pupal cuticle. Therefore, a housekeeping gene and a developmentally regulated gene function in a nested arrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1608179836,"At relatively high concentrations of myosin light chain kinase, a second site on the 20,000-dalton light chain of smooth muscle myosin is phosphorylated (Ikebe, M., and Hartshorne, D. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10027-10031). In this communication the site is identified and kinetics associated with its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are described. The doubly phosphorylated 20,000-dalton light chain from turkey gizzard myosin was hydrolyzed with alpha-chymotrypsin and the phosphorylated peptide was isolated by reverse phase chromatography. Following amino acid analyses and partial sequence determinations the second site of phosphorylation is shown to be threonine 18. This site is distinct from the threonine residue phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The time courses of phosphorylation of serine 19 and threonine 18 in isolated light chains follow a single exponential indicating a random process, although the phosphorylation rates differ considerably. The values of kcat/Km for serine 19 and threonine 18 for isolated light chains are 550 and 0.2 min-1 microM-1, respectively. With intact myosin, phosphorylation of serine 19 is biphasic; kcat/Km values are 22.5 and 7.5 min-1 microM-1 for the fast and slow phases, respectively. In contrast, phosphorylation of threonine 18 in intact myosin is a random, but markedly slower process, kcat/Km = 0.44 min-1 microM-1. Dephosphorylation of doubly phosphorylated myosin (approximately 4 mol of phosphate/mol of myosin) and isolated light chains (approximately 2 mol of phosphate/mol of light chain) follows a random process and dephosphorylation of the serine 19 and threonine 18 sites occurs at similar rates."
https://openalex.org/W1499138436,"The purified G-proteins from bovine brain were examined for potential solubility in the absence of detergent. The isolated alpha o and alpha i subunits migrated through sucrose with rates consistent with the existence of monomeric species either in the presence or the absence of cholate. The beta gamma subunits or holo-G-proteins aggregated extensively if cholate was absent. Al3+, Mg2+, and F- prevented the aggregation of alpha o and alpha i caused by the addition of beta gamma and could also prevent the aggregation of alpha s when Gs was examined at higher temperature. The association of subunits with phospholipid vesicles was examined. Whereas beta gamma associated totally with phospholipid vesicles, purified alpha o showed little interaction. alpha o did bind to vesicles containing beta gamma (beta gamma vesicles) in a saturable fashion that indicated a stoichiometric association between the subunits. Treatment with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate could partially dissociate alpha o that was bound to beta gamma vesicles. These data suggest that beta gamma may be an anchor for association of alpha subunits with membranes and that regulation by these proteins may not be limited to the plasma membrane. This possibility and its implications are discussed. The reversible association of alpha o to beta gamma vesicles may provide a very sensitive system for the study of the interactions between these subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2020745281,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3), a protein of 140 amino acids, was chemically synthesized by means of an automated peptide synthesizer and was shown to have the biological activities attributed to native IL-3. Assays of synthetic analogues established that an amino terminal fragment has detectable IL-3 activity, but that the stable tertiary structure of the complete molecule was required for full activity. The results demonstrate that automated peptide synthesis can be applied to the study of the structure and function of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2043366161,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the result of dystrophin deficiency. We have determined the cell types likely to express the pathogenic effects of this neuromuscular disease by determining the pattern of dystrophin expression in normal cells. We find that all physiological types of muscle cells express dystrophin at similar levels, and that the dystrophin content of various tissues correlates with the myogenic cell population of each tissue. The dystrophin content of brain and spinal cord, however, is found not to correlate with any type of muscle cell, and it is suggested that neurons express dystrophin. The potential involvement of striated muscle fibers, the vasculature, and the nervous system in the etiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy makes it likely that the disease is a complex disorder of combined pathogenesis. We also find that the dystrophic chicken does not represent an animal model for dystrophin deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1967751087,"We investigated the role of N-cadherin cell adhesion molecules in the histogenesis of the chicken neural retina. In the undifferentiated retina of early embryos, N-cadherin is almost evenly distributed. With differentiation, N-cadherin was gradually localized in particular cell layers. In the 8.5 to 10.5 day embryos, N-cadherin was most abundant in the optic nerve fiber layer, the plexiform layers and the outer limiting membrane. Thereafter, this molecule gradually diminished from most parts of the retina, except in the outer limiting membrane. When incubated with Fab fragments of a polyclonal antibody to N-cadherin, retinas of early embryos tended to dissociate and could not be maintained as a tissue mass. Retinas from older embryos were not dissociated by the Fab, but their morphogenesis was severely affected. We conclude that N-cadherin is essential for maintaining the overall structure of the undifferentiated retina, but during development, its role becomes restricted to maintaining more specific regions of the tissue. We also suggest that there might be additional, unidentified cadherin-like molecules in the retina."

https://openalex.org/W1501349652,"Macro- and micronuclei of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila afford a unique opportunity to study histone acetylation under conditions where postsynthetic transcription-related acetylation and synthetic deposition-related acetylation are nonoverlapping. Recent studies have demonstrated that at least two general systems of acetylation operate in Tetrahymena. One is postsynthetic, macronuclear specific, and may be related to gene expression in that nucleus (Vavra, K. J., Allis, C. D., and Gorovsky, M. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2591-2598). The other is synthetic, common to macro- and micronuclei, and is likely related to histone deposition during replication (Allis, C. D., Chicoine, L. G., Richman, R., and Schulman, I. G. (1985a) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 82, 8048-8052). A unique feature of H3 and H4 in Tetrahymena is that neither are blocked at their amino termini. We have exploited this fact as well as the resolving capability of acid-urea gel electrophoresis and current microsequencing techniques to examine whether utilization of different NH2-terminal acetylation sites is random or nonrandom during the progression toward high acetylation states. Of the four acetylation sites which have been identified in H4 (in Tetrahymena these are lysines at positions 4, 7, 11, and 15), we find that lysine 7 is the exclusive site of postsynthetic acetylation in populations of monoacetylated H4 isolated from macronuclei. This site is retained in populations of diacetylated H4, which are acetylated exclusively at lysines 4 and 7. Our data also suggest that there is some preference for using lysine 11 (as compared to 15) as the third site of acetylation in triacetylated molecules. The data demonstrate that the postsynthetic acetylation-deacetylation process is surprisingly nonrandom for H4 in Tetrahymena macronuclei. We have also investigated the same question with macronuclear H3 (which contains acetylation sites at lysines 9, 14, 18, and 23). Our data demonstrate that unlike H4, lysines at position 9 or 14 are likely to be utilized as sites of acetylation within a population of monoacetylated H3. Both of these acetylation sites are retained in diacetylated H3 which suggests that if site 9 is used initially as the site of monoacetylation, 14 is used secondarily (and vice versa). Our data show, moreover, that there is a preference for utilizing lysine 18 as the third acetylation site (in triacetylated H3). Thus, these data show that H3 is also acetylated in a nonrandom fashion in macronuclei. Finally, we have determined which acetylation sites are utilized in macro- or micronuclear H4 when it is undergoing active synthesis and deposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2053677240,"The human T-cell gamma chain genes have been characterized in an attempt to better understand their role in immune response. These immunoglobulin-like genes are encoded in the genome in variable, joining, and constant segments. The human gamma genes include at least six variable region genes, two joining segments, and two constant-region genes in germline DNA. Variable and joining segments recombine during the development of T cells to form rearranged genes. The diversity of human gamma genes produced by this recombinational mechanism is greater than that produced by the murine genome but is more limited than that of other immunoglobulin-like genes."

https://openalex.org/W1579774823,"We have examined the interaction of the Escherichia coli trp aporepressor with its ligand, L-tryptophan, using both equilibrium dialysis and flow dialysis methods. Results obtained by the two procedures were equivalent and indicate that the trp aporepressor binds L-tryptophan with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 40 microM at 25 degrees C under standard binding assay conditions (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 M potassium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol). Molecular sizing of the purified trp aporepressor shows that in the absence of ligand the regulatory protein exists as a dimeric species with greater than 99% purity and an apparent molecular weight of 30,000. Under the storage and assay conditions used, the dimer appears quite stable, and essentially no monomer or higher multimeric species are detected. Analysis of binding data by Scatchard and direct linear plot methods shows two identical and independent ligand-binding sites/native trp aporepressor dimer. When examined as a function of temperature, L-tryptophan binding by trp aporepressor varied over 7-fold (Kd = 28 microM at 6.5 degrees C to Kd = 217 microM at 40 degrees C). At the optimal growth temperature for E. coli (37 degrees C), the dissociation constant was 160 microM for the ligand, L-tryptophan. From the relationship between temperature and L-tryptophan binding by trp aporepressor, the apparent enthalpy change delta H = -10.6 +/- 0.6 kcal mol-1 and the apparent entropy change delta S = -17 +/- 2 cal degree-1 mol-1 were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1964485386,"In rats infected with the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, the concentration of C-reactive protein in the serum increases after the lung stage of infection and is at its highest at the time of terminal worm rejection. The peak of platelet-mediated cytotoxicity induced by infected serum that has been heated (and is free of immunoglobulin E) as well as the time course for the development of platelet cytotoxic activity in infected rats was found to be correlated with the concentration of C-reactive protein. Rat and human platelets treated with homologous serum obtained during an acute phase of inflammation or with purified C-reactive protein were able to kill the immature forms of the worm in vitro. Platelets treated with C-reactive protein were furthermore capable of conferring significant protection against schistosomiasis in transfer experiments. Collectively these data indicate that a system that includes C-reactive protein and platelets participates in the natural resistance of the rat to schistosomal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2012838778,"Two Drosophila mutants KM75 and HH5, which are mutated in the act88F actin gene specific for the indirect flight muscles (IFM), synthesize heat shock proteins (hsps) constitutively in a tissue-specific manner. We have introduced cloned mutant act88F genes into a strain containing the wild-type act88F allele by P-element-mediated transformation. Flies transformed with a 4.05 kb KM75 act88F gene fragment encoding the p42 actin variant express both p42 and hsps specifically in the IFM. Using normal/mutant chimeric genes, the mutation sites of KM75 and HH5 were mapped within the sequence encoding the last 72 amino acids of actin. An in vitro mutated gene encoding a protein that lacks the 72 carboxy-terminal amino acids also induces constitutive hsp synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1551557288,"We have examined the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) on the fibrinolytic activity of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Endotoxin suppressed the net fibrinolytic activity of cell extracts and conditioned media in a dose-dependent manner (threshold dose, 0.1 ng/ml; maximal dose, 10-100 ng/ml). The effects of endotoxin required at least 6 h for expression. Cell extracts and conditioned media contained a 44-kDa urokinase-like plasminogen activator. Media also contained multiple plasminogen activators with molecular masses of 65-75 and 80-100 kDa. Plasminogen activators in extracts and media were unchanged by treatment of cells with endotoxin. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) abolished fibrinolytic activity of extracts and conditioned media. DFP-treated samples from endotoxin-treated but not untreated cells inhibited urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, but not plasmin. Inhibitory activity was lost by incubation at pH 3 or heating to 56 degrees C for 10 min. These treatments did not affect inhibitory activity of fetal bovine serum. Incubation of 125I-urokinase with DFP-treated medium from endotoxin-treated cells produced an inactive complex with an apparent molecular mass of 80-85 kDa. The complex could be detected by chromatography on Sephadex G-100, but not by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These findings suggest that low doses of endotoxin suppress fibrinolytic activity in endothelial cells by stimulating the production or expression of a fast-acting, relatively labile inhibitor of plasminogen activator."
https://openalex.org/W2098793652,"Gene expression may occur in unexpected ectopic sites when diverse genetic elements are juxtaposed as chimeric genes in transgenic mice. To determine the specific contribution of the promoter and reporter gene in ectopic expression, we have analyzed the expression of 14 different fusion genes in transgenic mice. Chimeric genes containing the mouse metallothionein-I promoter linked to either the rat or human growth hormone gene or the calcitonin/CGRP gene are expressed in a very similar pattern of neuronal regions. This ectopic expression is not a unique feature of the metallothionein promoter, since transferring the human growth hormone gene to four other heterologous promoters resulted in varying degrees of ectopic expression in overlapping subsets of cortical and hypothalamic neurons. The novel pattern of ectopic expression suggests that these otherwise unrelated neurons share a common developmental regulatory machinery for activation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1585912086,"Abstract The muscle tropomyosin I gene of Drosophila melanogaster undergoes alternative splicing in different muscles of the fly to generate two isoforms of the same protein. We report here the structural analysis and DNA sequence of the tropomyosin I gene. The gene spans 5 kilobase of DNA and is comprised of five exons and four introns. Exon 4 is alternatively spliced in RNA of different muscle, resulting in two isoforms of the same protein. The gene lacks a TATA box homology at the map position; it is usually found in the vast majority of eukaryotic genes characterized thus far. Instead, a series of three alternating TG stretches are located upstream from the site of initiation of transcription. The gene encodes a 5' untranslated leader of 103 base pairs, and the 3' untranslated region comprises between 30 and 50% of the transcripts. The DNA sequence is extremely G + C rich in the protein coding regions of the gene, and A + T rich in the non-coding, flanking, and intron regions. The DNA sequence upstream of the acceptor sites in the two introns which are subject to alternative splicing displays a stretch of homology which is noted. The 3' untranslated region of the fifth exon contains multiple polyadenylation sites. The 284 amino acid protein encoded by the gene is split by introns between residues 198/199 and 257/258. These sites correlate closely with two important functional domains in the tropomyosin molecule. A comparison of the first 257 amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal 27 amino acids of the Drosophila and vertebrate tropomyosins together, shows two distinct and mutually exclusive classes for these domains. The functional significance of the Drosophila tropomyosin isoforms is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540310065,"Porcine leukocytes convert exogenous arachidonic acid to a complex array of products derived via the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase pathways of metabolism. The major monohydroxylated metabolite following addition of 100 microM arachidonic acid is 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Of the more polar compounds on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, the most prominent is a previously uncharacterized arachidonate product which chromatographs near to the omega-oxidized metabolites of leukotriene B4. The structure of this new product was examined by high pressure liquid chromatography, UV, NMR, and also by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of several derivatives; it was identified as 12-oxododeca-5,8,10-(Z,Z,E)-trienoic acid. It is proposed that this C-12 trienal acid is formed from 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid by a cleavage reaction catalyzed by the leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase in the presence of excess arachidonic acid and under anaerobic conditions. These conditions are satisfied by addition of 100 microM arachidonic acid to the leukocyte suspension (3 X 10(7) cells/ml); 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid is formed as the major product, excess arachidonic acid is available, and the concomitant leukocyte respiratory burst quickly depletes the solution of oxygen. Preliminary experiments indicate that this aldehyde product has significant biological activity in the activation of leukocytes. In the course of an intense inflammatory reaction it is conceivable that the conditions for synthesis of this C-12 trienal acid and related aldehydes could prevail; such aldehydes would constitute an additional class of lipoxygenase product which exacerbates the process of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1491171897,"Extraction of the skin of newborn rat yielded two populations of galactosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycan: a Mr = 111,000-200,000 dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DS-PG) with a Mr congruent to 55,000 core glycoprotein and a Mr congruent to 10(6) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PGs) composed of two subpopulations with different size core-glycoproteins (Mr congruent to 480,000 and 520,000). Tryptic peptide mapping of chondroitinase-treated DS-PG and CS-PGs indicated that the peptide patterns observed with the two core molecules from CS-PGs were identical with each other but distinct from the peptide pattern of the DS-PG core molecule. It is likely therefore that the two forms of CS-PGs are derived from the same gene product by post-translational modification or partial degradation, but DS-PG is derived from a distinct gene product. Comparison of the concentration (hexuronate/DNA) of the proteoglycans in newborn and fetal rat skin showed an age-related change in proteoglycan composition; at 4 days before birth, the uronic acid proportions, DS-PG:CS-PGs, were about 14:1 and during the next 4 days, DS-PG increased 2.2-fold whereas CS-PGs decreased 4-fold. On a per DNA basis, the rate of [3H]serine incorporation into CS-PGs was 2.5 times the rate for DS-PG at 4 days before birth but decreased by 95% during the next 4 days. The rate for DS-PG also decreased but to a much lesser extent, so that by 2 days before birth, it began to exceed the rate for CS-PGs. The striking change in the concentration and labeling rate of CS-PGs can be interpreted either as a decrease of CS-PGs synthesis, or as an increase of CS-PGs breakdown, or both, a process which might be involved in the transition of extracellular matrix from a fetal type to a newborn or adult type."

The equilibrium constant for the combined glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and 6-phosphoglucono-gamma-lactonase reaction, [6-phosphogluconate3-] [NADPH] [H+]2/[Glc-6-P2-] [NADP+], was found to be at least 1 X 10(-9). Using these redetermined equilibrium constants, calculated values of pentose cycle intermediates, based on near equilibrium assumptions and the tissue content of Fru-6-P and glyceraldehyde 3-P, were found to be in good agreement with measured values for male Wistar rats injected with saline, 20 mumol/g pyruvate, 20 mumol/g gluconate, and 20 mumol/g ribose.

Using primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from normal and diabetic rats in a serum-free chemically defined medium, the present study addresses the chronic action of insulin to facilitate the direct effects of insulin and glucose on the short term regulation of the enzymes controlling glycogen metabolism. Primary cultures were maintained in the presence of insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol for 1-3 days. On day 1 in alloxan diabetic cultures, 10(-7) M insulin did not acutely activate glycogen synthase over a period of 15 min or 1 h, whereas insulin acutely activated synthase in cultures of normal hepatocytes. By day 3 in hepatocytes isolated from alloxan diabetic rats, insulin effected an approximate 30% increase in per cent synthase I within 15 min as was also the case for normal cells. The acute effect of insulin on synthase activation was independent of changes in phosphorylase alpha. Whereas glycogen synthase phosphatase activity could not be shown to be acutely affected by insulin, the total activity in diabetic cells was restored to normal control values over the 3-day culture period. The acute effect of 30 mM glucose to activate glycogen synthase in cultured hepatocytes from normal rats after 1 day of culture was missing in hepatocytes isolated from either alloxan or spontaneously diabetic (BB/W) rats. After 3 days in culture, glucose produced a 50% increase in glycogen synthase activity during a 10-min period under the same conditions. These studies clearly demonstrate that insulin acts in a chronic manner in concert with thyroid hormones and steroids to facilitate acute regulation of hepatic glycogen synthesis by both insulin and glucose."

A., Costello, C. E., Reinhold, V. N., Kurtz, L., and Kornfeld, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13762-13769). Here we present evidence that these methyl groups are derived from [methyl-3H]methionine, in vivo and [methyl-3H]S-adenosylmethionine in vitro. About 18% of the macromolecules secreted from vegetative cells labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine are released by digestion with preparations of endoglycosidase/peptide N-glycosidase F. The majority of the released molecules are sulfated, anionic high mannose-type oligosaccharides. Strong acid hydrolysis of the [3H]methyl-labeled molecules yields [3H]methanol with kinetics of release similar to those found for the generation of Man-6-P from chemically synthesized methylphosphomannose methylglycoside. Treatment of the [3H]methyl-labeled molecules with a phosphodiesterase from Aspergillus niger which is known to cleave this phosphodiester also releases [3H]methanol from a portion of the oligosaccharides. In vitro incorporation of [methyl-3H]S-adenosylmethionine into endogenous acceptors found in membrane preparations shows that the [3H]methyl group of the methylphosphomannose residues can be derived from this molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1586795168,"A431 cells incorporate 35SO4 into a protein of Mr 61,000 (P61). We examined sulfation of P61 by cells (in vivo) and by a cell-free system (in vitro) which requires only addition of A431 cell membranes and a 3â€˜-phosphoadenosine 5â€˜-phospho[35S]sulfate-generating system prepared from Krebs ascites cells. Sulfate is found exclusively in the form of tyrosine SO4 by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis following Pronase digestion. Endoglycosidase F digestion reduces the Mr by 2,000 but does not release the sulfate, indicating that P61 is a glycoprotein but that sulfate is not incorporated into the carbohydrate. Sulfated P61 is not found in the medium from cultured cells and remains associated with the membrane fraction following cell lysis. Treatment of membranes with 0.4 M NaCl, 0.3 M KCl, 15 mM EDTA, or pH 11.0 does not release sulfated P61. P61 is solubilized by Triton X-114 treatment of membranes and partitions into the detergent phase upon warming. Based on these characteristics, we conclude that P61 is an integral membrane protein. Trypsin digestion experiments with intact cells suggest that sulfated P61 is predominantly located in the plasma membrane. This is the first example of an integral membrane protein which is sulfated on tyrosine. The properties of the sulfation reaction are distinct from those reported for secreted proteins and are consistent with the possibility that this modification occurs at the plasma membrane rather than in the Golgi."

A unique carbon dioxide fixation pathway that gives rise to asymmetric labeling of acetyl coenzyme A has been demonstrated in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The effect of selected metabolic inhibitors on the labeled species in the pathway has been examined by NMR. These techniques establish a general, sensitive method for the delineation of convergent biosynthetic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1518588829,"Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) has been purified from beef heart mitochondria and compared with crystalline beef liver GDH. The specific activity of heart GDH was 127 units and of liver GDH 80 units. Heart GDH subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis had a protein corresponding to liver GDH and a smaller molecular weight protein. On agarose gel electrophoresis heart GDH activity was resolved into two fractions (with or without protease inhibitors) while liver had only one fraction. One of the heart fractions moved with liver GDH on electrophoresis. Thermal stability studies showed heart and liver GDH activity differed. Mouse antibodies to liver GDH precipitated both liver and heart GDH on double immunodiffusion. Mouse antibodies to liver GDH identified on nitrocellulose paper the polypeptide band of liver and heart GDH that were the same molecular weight but did not cross-react with the smaller molecular weight polypeptide present in heart GDH. Trypsin digestion of the two major protein bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified GDH from beef heart mitochondria did not show any overlapping peptides. We conclude beef heart GDH activity is composed of two isozymes. One is the same as beef liver GDH, and the other is a smaller molecular weight protein. We propose the terms GDH-LM for the liver GDH isozyme and GDH-HM for the smaller molecular weight isozyme present in heart mitochondria but not liver."
