https://openalex.org/W2157211770,"The success of genome-wide association (GWA) studies for the detection of sequence variation affecting complex traits in human has spurred interest in the use of large-scale high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and for marker-assisted selection in model and agricultural species. A cost-effective and efficient approach for the development of a custom genotyping assay interrogating 54,001 SNP loci to support GWA applications in cattle is described. A novel algorithm for achieving a compressed inter-marker interval distribution proved remarkably successful, with median interval of 37 kb and maximum predicted gap of <350 kb. The assay was tested on a panel of 576 animals from 21 cattle breeds and six outgroup species and revealed that from 39,765 to 46,492 SNP are polymorphic within individual breeds (average minor allele frequency (MAF) ranging from 0.24 to 0.27). The assay also identified 79 putative copy number variants in cattle. Utility for GWA was demonstrated by localizing known variation for coat color and the presence/absence of horns to their correct genomic locations. The combination of SNP selection and the novel spacing algorithm allows an efficient approach for the development of high-density genotyping platforms in species having full or even moderate quality draft sequence. Aspects of the approach can be exploited in species which lack an available genome sequence. The BovineSNP50 assay described here is commercially available from Illumina and provides a robust platform for mapping disease genes and QTL in cattle."

Here, we analyzed nine Drosophila piRNA pathway mutants for their impacts on both small RNA populations and the subcellular localization patterns of Piwi proteins. We find that distinct piRNA pathways with differing components function in ovarian germ and somatic cells. In the soma, Piwi acts singularly with the conserved flamenco piRNA cluster to enforce silencing of retroviral elements that may propagate by infecting neighboring germ cells. In the germline, silencing programs encoded within piRNA clusters are optimized via a slicer-dependent amplification loop to suppress a broad spectrum of elements. The classes of transposons targeted by germline and somatic piRNA clusters, though not the precise elements, are conserved among Drosophilids, demonstrating that the architecture of piRNA clusters has coevolved with the transposons that they are tasked to control.

Eukaryotic genomes harbor a wide variety of transposons, whose maintenance and spread throughout the population requires the colonization of new genomic locations in germ cells. For the host, the deleterious consequences of transposon propagation range from insertional mutagenesis and reductions in the long-term fitness of their progeny to an acute loss of germ cell integrity and sterility. Transposable elements can be broadly categorized as retrotransposons (class I), which move via an RNA intermediate, or DNA transposons (class II), which mobilize through a “cut-and-paste” mechanism (Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007Slotkin R.K. Martienssen R. Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 272-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Transposons within these classes differ in their structure, evolutionary origins, and both their tissue and developmental expression patterns. Many transposons are expressed in germ cells, where movement can lead to heritable expansions in their number. Examples in Drosophila include TAHRE, TART, HetA, copia, and the I element (Brennecke et al., 2008Brennecke J. Malone C.D. Aravin A.A. Sachidanandam R. Stark A. Hannon G.J.

Some transposons are exclusively or additionally expressed in somatic cells of the ovary, with gypsy, ZAM, and idefix occupying this category in the Drosophila ovary (Desset et al., 2008Desset S.

The diversity of transposition strategies and the overall similarities to host protein-coding genes pose a substantial challenge to their selective silencing (Malone and Hannon, 2009Malone C.D. Hannon G.J. Small RNAs as guardians of the genome.Cell. 2009; 136: 656-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In animals, suppression of mobile elements is accomplished by an elegant, small RNA-based immune system, which displays both genetically encoded and adaptive aspects. Its core components are Piwi family proteins, and their associated Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Like other members of the Argonaute family, Piwi proteins use bound small RNAs as guides for substrate recognition and target cleavage (Carmell et al., 2002Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. The Argonaute family: tentacles that reach into RNAi, developmental control, stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the major sources of piRNAs are discrete heterochromatic loci termed piRNA clusters (Supplemental Glossary available online) (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Discrete small RNA-generating loci as master regulators of transposon activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). These are characterized by an exceptional density of nested, fragmented, and immobilized transposon remnants. Thus, the generation of piRNAs from these loci inherently targets the three Drosophila Piwi proteins, Piwi, Aub, and AGO3, toward mobile elements. Most piRNA clusters contain transposon fragments in sense and antisense orientations and produce piRNAs from both genomic strands. Nevertheless, piRNAs overall tend to be antisense to transposons (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Discrete small RNA-generating loci as master regulators of transposon activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Piwi- and Aub-associated piRNAs reflect the antisense bias of the system, whereas AGO3-bound piRNAs are typically sense to transposons. Sense and antisense piRNAs bound by AGO3 and Aub, respectively, show a prevalent relationship with their 5′ ends, overlapping by precisely 10 nt. These observations coalesced into a model in which Piwi proteins engage in a Slicer-dependent amplification loop (the ping-pong cycle—Supplemental Glossary) between piRNA clusters and active elements (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J.

A slicer-mediated mechanism for repeat-associated siRNA 5′ end formation in Drosophila.Science. 2007; 315: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Cleavage of a transposon transcript by Aub, loaded with an antisense piRNA, triggers production of an AGO3-bound sense piRNA, whose 5′ end is offset by 10 nt. The AGO3-bound piRNA can then catalyze the production of more silencing-competent piRNAs, which associate with Aub, via cleavage of antisense transposon sequences within cluster transcripts. Overall, the ping-pong cycle optimizes the piRNA response against transposons active in a given cell and at a given developmental time point. Signatures of the ping-pong cycle are conserved throughout animals, suggesting that it is a fundamental property of the piRNA pathway (Aravin et al., 2007bAravin A.A. Sachidanandam R. Girard A.

Conservation of small RNA pathways in platypus.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Though the majority of Aub- and AGO3-bound piRNAs appear to be generated via the ping-pong cycle, only a small proportion of Piwi-bound piRNAs display ping-pong signatures. Yet, Piwi-bound piRNAs still exhibit a strong antisense bias. This has led to the concept of primary piRNA biogenesis, wherein Piwi acts as a possible recipient of cluster-derived piRNAs that are generated via yet unknown mechanisms. Primary piRNAs have been proposed as one initiator of the ping-pong cycle. However, a recent study has also highlighted the importance of maternally inherited piRNA populations (Brennecke et al., 2008Brennecke J. Malone C.D. Aravin A.A. Sachidanandam R. Stark A. Hannon G.J. An epigenetic role for maternally inherited piRNAs in transposon silencing.Science. 2008; 322: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). For two transposons that were examined, the I and P elements, the lack of a maternal piRNA program prevented silencing in progeny, and this was associated with the lack of a robust ping-pong response. Thus, primary and maternally deposited piRNAs serve as inputs into the pathway, which initiate a cycle of interactions between piRNA clusters and transposon mRNAs. We sought to determine whether this model applied universally, not only in germ cells but also in somatic support cells wherein a subset of transposons are regulated by Piwi, the sole family member expressed in this compartment. By comparing germline-specific piRNA populations to those derived from whole ovaries, we show that a distinct, ping-pong-independent piRNA pathway operates in somatic cells. Analysis of piRNA profiles from mutant ovaries strongly supports this model and indicates that the somatic pathway depends exclusively upon Piwi and the flamenco piRNA cluster. We also probed the roles of additional factors within the piRNA pathway, examining the impacts of nine such mutants on piRNA populations, on the operation of the pathway, and on the localization of pathway components in germ and somatic cells. We find that Piwi function in the germline depends on the RNA helicase Armitage. The ping-pong cycle acts independently of Piwi and Armitage but requires the function of Aubergine, the RNA helicases Spindle-E and Vasa, and the Tudor-domain protein Krimper. Through these studies, we begin to assemble a scaffold model of the piRNA pathway, which differs substantially in the germline and somatic compartments of the ovary. In the Drosophila ovary, all three Piwi-family members (Piwi, Aub, and AGO3) are expressed in germline cells (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R.

Specific association of Piwi with rasiRNAs derived from retrotransposon and heterochromatic regions in the Drosophila genome.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2214-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), while Piwi alone is expressed in gonadal somatic cells. This implied possible differences in the architecture of the piRNA pathway, and perhaps the elements that it controls, in germline and somatic tissues. We therefore sought to separately analyze piRNAs present in these two compartments. Germline cells within the Drosophila egg chamber are syncytial, and nearly all of the cytoplasmic contents of nurse cells are incorporated into late-stage oocytes (Spradling, 1993Spradling A.C. Germline cysts: communes that work.Cell. 1993; 72: 649-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the follicular epithelium is shed from the laid egg. Thus, we could infer somatic and germline piRNA pools by comparing small RNA libraries derived from wild-type ovaries to those from 0–2 hr old embryos, prior to the activation of the zygotic genome (Brennecke et al., 2008Brennecke J. Malone C.D. Aravin A.A. Sachidanandam R. Stark A. Hannon G.J. An epigenetic role for maternally inherited piRNAs in transposon silencing.Science. 2008; 322: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). piRNAs (see Figure S1 available online) were mapped to the Repbase collection of known Drosophila melanogaster elements (allowing up to three mismatches) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We chose to focus on the 86 elements most heavily targeted by the piRNA pathway. This corresponds to 75% of all elements and includes ∼99% of all transposon-derived piRNAs. piRNAs were also assigned to their generative clusters, including only those small RNAs mapping unambiguously to a single site within the Drosophila genome. Our key question was the extent to which piRNAs present in the mixed ovarian sample were maternally deposited. For the majority of transposons, the piRNA content of early embryos mirrored that of total ovary (Figure 1A). As exemplified by roo and the F element, not only the overall abundance but also the distribution of ovarian piRNAs targeting each transposon was faithfully retained in early embryos (Figure 1A, right). However, piRNAs targeting a number of transposons (e.g., ZAM and gypsy; Figure 1A, right; Figure S2A) were substantially underrepresented in the embryonic piRNA pool. The transposons targeted by these small RNAs are likely subject to selective control by the piRNA system in somatic cells. Elements with piRNA patterns characteristic of somatic control populate the gypsy family of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. Among these are ZAM, gypsy, and idefix, all of which are regulated by the flamenco piRNA cluster. Across the entire spectrum of transposons, a lack of maternally deposited piRNAs correlated strongly with the presence of corresponding transposon fragments in flamenco (Figure 1A, left). In contrast, elements with fragments lying within other piRNA clusters (e.g., the cluster at cytological position 42AB; Figure 1A, left) contribute piRNAs to both ovarian and early embryonic libraries, indicating active control in germline cells. These observations suggested tissue-specific regulation of certain element classes. This correlated with tissue-specific expression of piRNA clusters. Small RNAs derived from flamenco were highly depleted from early embryonic populations, irrespective of whether piRNA or siRNA pools were analyzed (Figure 1C). All remaining major clusters showed relatively equivalent contribution to ovary and embryo libraries. As with individual elements, the relative pattern of piRNAs mapping to clusters apparently expressed in germ cells was mirrored in embryo libraries (Figure 1D, right). The overall degree to which transposons display Piwi-biased association (Piwi bias—Supplemental Glossary) strongly correlated with lower representation in maternally deposited small RNA populations (Figures 1A, 1B, and S2A). Also, while the majority of piRNA clusters load small RNAs into all three Piwi family members, flamenco-derived piRNAs almost exclusively occupy Piwi complexes (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2B). These data suggest the existence of two separate piRNA pathways in germline and somatic cells of the gonad. In the soma, Piwi appears to be programmed exclusively or predominantly by the flamenco cluster to target elements from the gypsy family. In the germline, a variety of clusters collaborate with all three Piwi-clade proteins to control a broad range of elements and to contribute a heritable collection of piRNAs that maintains resistance across generations. Ping-pong constitutes a feed-forward loop that optimizes the piRNA response against elements active in a given strain and simultaneously creates characteristic relationships between small RNAs that reveal their participation in the cycle (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Discrete small RNA-generating loci as master regulators of transposon activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, Gunawardane et al., 2007Gunawardane L.S.

A slicer-mediated mechanism for repeat-associated siRNA 5′ end formation in Drosophila.Science. 2007; 315: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The strongest ping-pong interactions are found between sense-oriented piRNAs in AGO3 and antisense piRNAs in Aub (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Discrete small RNA-generating loci as master regulators of transposon activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). In contrast, the participation of Piwi in the ping-pong cycle is less obvious. We therefore probed the degree to which individual transposons participate in the ping-pong cycle and correlated this with their bias toward control by individual Piwi proteins. For each transposon, we quantified its ping-pong signature (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In short, this was defined as the likelihood, in percent, for the average piRNA mapping to an element to have a complementary ping-pong partner. If plotted against the degree to which an element has corresponding piRNAs in Piwi versus Aub/AGO3 complexes, we find that Piwi-biased elements show no significant evidence of ping-pong (Figure 2A). To probe the correlation between ping-pong signatures and maternal inheritance (Supplemental Glossary), we divided transposons into three groups (Figures 1A and 2A). Those with strong maternal deposition (red) are considered to have a dominant germline silencing component. Those with intermediate levels of maternal deposition (yellow) are considered to be expressed and targeted in both germline and follicle cells, while those with weak maternal deposition (green) are defined as having a dominant somatic silencing component (Supplemental Glossary). Strong ping-pong signatures correlate with germline silencing (Figure 2A). Somatically silenced elements, such as gypsy5, show no enrichment for ping-pong pairs (Figure 2B), while elements such as idefix with mixed germline and somatic silencing show a weak but evident ping-pong signature. Predominantly germline elements such as ProtoP-B and F element show strong ping-pong signals (Figure 2B). For F element, idefix, and gypsy5, we plotted the distribution of piRNAs along each element consensus and then split the total population into piRNAs with an identified ping-pong partner and those without (Figure 2C). While piRNAs that have a ping-pong partner do show an overall antisense bias, this is much more pronounced for piRNAs that appear to arise via primary biogenesis. While an understanding is emerging for how the antisense bias is created for gypsy5 (see below), we still cannot explain how strand information for germline elements is incorporated into the pathway as a whole. Although somatic Piwi lacks detectable ping-pong activity, we could not rule out roles for Piwi in the ping-pong cycle of germline elements. We therefore compared the impact of mutations in aub and piwi on ping-pong signatures. In a panel of 21 representative transposons with dominant germline expression, loss of Piwi showed no significant impact on ping-pong signals, while loss of Aub essentially ablated the cycle (Figure 2D). Elements targeted in somatic cells fail to enter the cycle (Figure 2D, right). Elements with apparently mixed expression patterns lose their ping-pong signatures in aub mutants but often show elevated signals in piwi mutants. This suggests that piwi and aub mutations impact different piRNA populations and that the germline-specific ping-pong cycle operates independently of Piwi. Piwi resides in the nuclei of both germ and follicle cells (Cox et al., 2000Cox D.N. Chao A. Lin H. piwi encodes a nucleoplasmic factor whose activity modulates the number and division rate of germline stem cells.Development. 2000; 127: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar). Aub and AGO3 concentrate in nuage, perinuclear RNP granules characteristic of germ cells (Figures 2E and S3) (Brennecke et al., 2007Brennecke J. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J.

Macdonald P.M. Aubergine encodes a Drosophila polar granule component required for pole cell formation and related to eIF2C.Development. 2001; 128: 2823-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the speculation that that the ping-pong cycle might operate in nuage (Klattenhoff and Theurkauf, 2008Klattenhoff C. Theurkauf W. Biogenesis and germline functions of piRNAs.Development. 2008; 135: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Loss of Aub leads to delocalization of AGO3 from nuage and to its accumulation in discrete cytoplasmic foci, a pattern not seen in piwi mutant germ cells (Figure 2E). These results underscore the link between Aub and AGO3 in germ cells and support a role for nuage in the ping-pong cycle. Many features distinguish flamenco from other generative loci. The flamenco locus shows an extreme orientation bias of the elements it harbors (Figure 1B), and unlike clusters expressed in germ cells, this bias seems to have been evolutionarily hardwired. flamenco comprises ∼180 KB of pericentromeric heterochromatin on the X chromosome, in which the majority of transposon fragments (∼85%) are similarly oriented (Figure 3A). Moreover, flamenco-derived piRNAs are produced exclusively from the plus strand of the genome, indicating transcription from the DIP1 gene toward the centromere. Analysis of P element insertions suggests that flamenco generates a long, continuously transcribed precursor, which is converted into a preponderance of antisense piRNAs by primary processing (Figure S4). In D. yakuba and D. erecta (Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007Clark A.G. Eisen M.B. Smith D.R. Bergman C.M. Oliver B. Markow T.A. Kaufman T.C. Kellis M. Gelbart W. et al.Drosophila 12 Genomes ConsortiumEvolution of genes and genomes on the Drosophila phylogeny.Nature. 2007; 450: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), putative flamenco loci could be identified via their proximity to DIP1, and genomic assemblies were sufficiently complete to allow informative analysis (Figure 3A). In both cases, the DIP1-proximal region was enriched in transposon fragments with a consistent genomic orientation, such that transcription from DIP1 across these loci would produce antisense transposon information (Figure 3A). To confirm that these syntenic regions actually represent functional piRNA clusters, we sequenced a small RNA library from D. erecta ovaries. Abundant, uniquely mapping species could be assigned to the putative D. erecta flamenco locus, and as in D. melanogaster, they were derived from only one genomic strand (Figure 3A). Moreover, these RNAs showed no substantial evidence of an active amplification cycle (1U/10A partners with a 10 nt, 5′ overlap) (data not shown). Thus, natural selection seems to have shaped the flamenco clusters of Drosophilids to encode antisense piRNAs that can efficiently target homologous elements in the absence of an active ping-pong mechanism. The transposons that are demonstrably impacted by flamenco mutations in ovary include ZAM, idefix, and gypsy (Desset et al., 2008Desset S. Buchon N. Meignin C. Coiffet M. Vaury C.

Gans M. Masson M. Terzian C. Flamenco, a gene controlling the gypsy retrovirus of Drosophila melanagaster.Genetics. 1995; 139: 697-711PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these elements are also impacted in nongonadal somatic cells by flamenco/COM mutations, though the mechanism underlying this regulation is unknown (Desset et al., 2008Desset S. Buchon N.

In Drosophila melanogaster the COM locus directs the somatic silencing of two retrotransposons through both Piwi-dependent and -independent pathways.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). D. melanogaster flamenco shows a strong enrichment for sequences derived from gypsy family LTR retrotransposons. In D. yakuba and D. erecta flamenco loci, the enrichment for gypsy-family elements is conserved, although the precise elements that colonize each of these species and that populate their respective flamenco orthologs differ (Figure 3B). In contrast, germline clusters, such as that found at 42AB, contain a much broader variety of transposon classes and families, suggesting that evolutionary pressure favored the capture of different elements by that locus (Figure 3B). The conserved nature of the flamenco cluster across 10–12 million years of Drosophilid evolution (Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007Clark A.G. Eisen M.B. Smith D.R. Bergman C.M. Oliver B.

https://openalex.org/W2101708445,"Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in animal germ cells. piRNAs are thought to derive from long transcripts spanning transposon-rich genomic loci and to direct an autoamplification loop in which an antisense piRNA, bound to Aubergine or Piwi protein, triggers production of a sense piRNA bound to the PIWI protein Argonaute3 (Ago3). In turn, the new piRNA is envisioned to produce a second antisense piRNA. Here, we describe strong loss-of-function mutations in ago3, allowing a direct genetic test of this model. We find that Ago3 acts to amplify piRNA pools and to enforce on them an antisense bias, increasing the number of piRNAs that can act to silence transposons. We also detect a second, Ago3-independent piRNA pathway centered on Piwi. Transposons targeted by this second pathway often reside in the flamenco locus, which is expressed in somatic ovarian follicle cells, suggesting a role for piRNAs beyond the germline."
https://openalex.org/W2077191430,"The difficulty associated with the cultivation of most microorganisms and the complexity of natural microbial assemblages, such as marine plankton or human microbiome, hinder genome reconstruction of representative taxa using cultivation or metagenomic approaches. Here we used an alternative, single cell sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genome assemblies of two uncultured, numerically significant marine microorganisms. We employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification to obtain hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA from individual, uncultured cells of two marine flavobacteria from the Gulf of Maine that were phylogenetically distant from existing cultured strains. Shotgun sequencing and genome finishing yielded 1.9 Mbp in 17 contigs and 1.5 Mbp in 21 contigs for the two flavobacteria, with estimated genome recoveries of about 91% and 78%, respectively. Only 0.24% of the assembling sequences were contaminants and were removed from further analysis using rigorous quality control. In contrast to all cultured strains of marine flavobacteria, the two single cell genomes were excellent Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) metagenome fragment recruiters, demonstrating their numerical significance in the ocean. The geographic distribution of GOS recruits along the Northwest Atlantic coast coincided with ocean surface currents. Metabolic reconstruction indicated diverse potential energy sources, including biopolymer degradation, proteorhodopsin photometabolism, and hydrogen oxidation. Compared to cultured relatives, the two uncultured flavobacteria have small genome sizes, few non-coding nucleotides, and few paralogous genes, suggesting adaptations to narrow ecological niches. These features may have contributed to the abundance of the two taxa in specific regions of the ocean, and may have hindered their cultivation. We demonstrate the power of single cell DNA sequencing to generate reference genomes of uncultured taxa from a complex microbial community of marine bacterioplankton. A combination of single cell genomics and metagenomics enabled us to analyze the genome content, metabolic adaptations, and biogeography of these taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2014626044,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are implicated in cancer pathogenesis and have recently shown promise as blood-based biomarkers for cancer detection. Epithelial ovarian cancer is a deadly disease for which improved outcomes could be achieved by successful early detection and enhanced understanding of molecular pathogenesis that leads to improved therapies. A critical step toward these goals is to establish a comprehensive view of miRNAs expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues as well as in normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Methodology We used massively parallel pyrosequencing (i.e., “454 sequencing”) to discover and characterize novel and known miRNAs expressed in primary cultures of normal human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) and in tissue from three of the most common histotypes of ovarian cancer. Deep sequencing of small RNA cDNA libraries derived from normal HOSE and ovarian cancer samples yielded a total of 738,710 high-quality sequence reads, generating comprehensive digital profiles of miRNA expression. Expression profiles for 498 previously annotated miRNAs were delineated and we discovered six novel miRNAs and 39 candidate miRNAs. A set of 124 miRNAs was differentially expressed in normal versus cancer samples and 38 miRNAs were differentially expressed across histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer. Taqman qRT-PCR performed on a subset of miRNAs confirmed results of the sequencing-based study. Conclusions This report expands the body of miRNAs known to be expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer and provides a useful resource for future studies of the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis and early detection of ovarian cancer."

Methodology/Principal Findings After a preliminary safety evaluation of low dose AMA-1/AS01B (10 µg/0.5 mL) in 5 adults, 30 malaria-naïve adults were randomly allocated to receive full dose (50 µg/0.5 mL) of AMA-1/AS01B (n = 15) or AMA-1/AS02A (n = 15), followed by a malaria challenge. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly on a 0-, 1-, 2-month schedule. All volunteers experienced transient injection site erythema, swelling and pain. Two weeks post-third vaccination, anti-AMA-1 Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMCs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were high: low dose AMA-1/AS01B 196 µg/mL (103–371 µg/mL), full dose AMA-1/AS01B 279 µg/mL (210–369 µg/mL) and full dose AMA-1/AS02A 216 µg/mL (169–276 µg/mL) with no significant difference among the 3 groups. The three vaccine formulations elicited equivalent functional antibody responses, as measured by growth inhibition assay (GIA), against homologous but not against heterologous (FVO) parasites as well as demonstrable interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses. To assess efficacy, volunteers were challenged with P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, and all became parasitemic, with no significant difference in the prepatent period by either light microscopy or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, a small but significant reduction of parasitemia in the AMA-1/AS02A group was seen with a statistical model employing qPCR measurements. Significance All three vaccine formulations were found to be safe and highly immunogenic. These immune responses did not translate into significant vaccine efficacy in malaria-naïve adults employing a primary sporozoite challenge model, but encouragingly, estimation of parasite growth rates from qPCR data may suggest a partial biological effect of the vaccine. Further evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of the AMA-1/AS02A formulation is ongoing in a malaria-experienced pediatric population in Mali.

https://openalex.org/W2009596550,"Background Flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) comprise a group of modular enzymes that function in oxygen and nitric oxide detoxification in Bacteria and Archaea. The FDPs in cyanobacteria have an extra domain as compared to major prokaryotic enzymes. The physiological role of cyanobacteria FDPs is mostly unknown. Of the four putative flavodiiron proteins (Flv1–4) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a physiological function in Mehler reaction has been suggested for Flv1 and Flv3. Principal Findings We demonstrate a novel and crucial function for Flv2 and Flv4 in photoprotection of photosystem II (PSII) in Synechocystis. It is shown that the expression of Flv2 and Flv4 is high under air level of CO2 and negligible at elevated CO2. Moreover, the rate of accumulation of flv2 and flv4 transcripts upon shift of cells from high to low CO2 is strongly dependent on light intensity. Characterization of FDP inactivation mutants of Synechocystis revealed a specific decline in PSII centers and impaired translation of the D1 protein in Δflv2 and Δflv4 when grown at air level CO2 whereas at high CO2 the Flvs were dispensable. Δflv2 and Δflv4 were also more susceptible to high light induced inhibition of PSII than WT or Δflv1 and Δflv3. Significance Analysis of published sequences revealed the presence of cyanobacteria-like FDPs also in some oxygenic photosynthetic eukaryotes like green algae, mosses and lycophytes. Our data provide evidence that Flv2 and Flv4 have an important role in photoprotection of water-splitting PSII against oxidative stress when the cells are acclimated to air level CO2. It is conceivable that the function of FDPs has changed during evolution from protection against oxygen in anaerobic microbes to protection against reactive oxygen species thus making the sustainable function of oxygen evolving PSII possible. Higher plants lack FDPs and distinctly different mechanisms have evolved for photoprotection of PSII."

This hypothesis is based on published studies showing elevated blood lead concentrations in subsistence hunter populations, retention of ammunition residues in the tissues of hunter-killed animals, and systemic, cognitive, and behavioral disorders associated with human lead body burdens once considered safe. Our objective was to determine the incidence and bioavailability of lead bullet fragments in hunter-killed venison, a widely-eaten food among hunters and their families. We radiographed 30 eviscerated carcasses of White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) shot by hunters with standard lead-core, copper-jacketed bullets under normal hunting conditions. All carcasses showed metal fragments (geometric mean = 136 fragments, range = 15–409) and widespread fragment dispersion. We took each carcass to a separate meat processor and fluoroscopically scanned the resulting meat packages; fluoroscopy revealed metal fragments in the ground meat packages of 24 (80%) of the 30 deer; 32% of 234 ground meat packages contained at least one fragment. Fragments were identified as lead by ICP in 93% of 27 samples. Isotope ratios of lead in meat matched the ratios of bullets, and differed from background lead in bone. We fed fragment-containing venison to four pigs to test bioavailability; four controls received venison without fragments from the same deer. Mean blood lead concentrations in pigs peaked at 2.29 µg/dL (maximum 3.8 µg/dL) 2 days following ingestion of fragment-containing venison, significantly higher than the 0.63 µg/dL averaged by controls. We conclude that people risk exposure to bioavailable lead from bullet fragments when they eat venison from deer killed with standard lead-based rifle bullets and processed under normal procedures. At risk in the U.S. are some ten million hunters, their families, and low-income beneficiaries of venison donations."
https://openalex.org/W2092085644,"Background The evidence of the multiple beneficial health effects of fish consumption is strong, but physiological mechanisms behind these effects are not completely known. Little information is available on the effects of consumption of different type of fish. The aim of this study was to investigate how fatty fish or lean fish in a diet affect serum lipidomic profiles in subjects with coronary heart disease. Methodology and Principal Findings A pilot study was designed which included altogether 33 subjects with myocardial infarction or unstable ischemic attack in an 8-week parallel controlled intervention. The subjects were randomized to either fatty fish (n = 11), lean fish (n = 12) or control (n = 10) groups. Subjects in the fish groups had 4 fish meals per week and subjects in the control group consumed lean beef, pork and chicken. A fish meal was allowed once a week maximum. Lipidomics analyses were performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Multiple bioactive lipid species, including ceramides, lysophosphatidylcholines and diacylglycerols, decreased significantly in the fatty fish group, whereas in the lean fish group cholesterol esters and specific long-chain triacylglycerols increased significantly (False Discovery Rate q-value <0.05). Conclusions/Significance The 8-week consumption of fatty fish decreased lipids which are potential mediators of lipid-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, and may be related to the protective effects of fatty fish on the progression of atherosclerotic vascular diseases or insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2038376862,"Background Cancer stem cells exhibit close resemblance to normal stem cells in phenotype as well as function. Hence, studying normal stem cell behavior is important in understanding cancer pathogenesis. It has recently been shown that human breast stem cells can be enriched in suspension cultures as mammospheres. However, little is known about the behavior of these cells in long-term cultures. Since extensive self-renewal potential is the hallmark of stem cells, we undertook a detailed phenotypic and functional characterization of human mammospheres over long-term passages. Methodology Single cell suspensions derived from human breast ‘organoids’ were seeded in ultra low attachment plates in serum free media. Resulting primary mammospheres after a week (termed T1 mammospheres) were subjected to passaging every 7th day leading to the generation of T2, T3, and T4 mammospheres. Principal Findings We show that primary mammospheres contain a distinct side-population (SP) that displays a CD24low/CD44low phenotype, but fails to generate mammospheres. Instead, the mammosphere-initiating potential rests within the CD44high/CD24low cells, in keeping with the phenotype of breast cancer-initiating cells. In serial sphere formation assays we find that even though primary (T1) mammospheres show telomerase activity and fourth passage T4 spheres contain label-retaining cells, they fail to initiate new mammospheres beyond T5. With increasing passages, mammospheres showed an increase in smaller sized spheres, reduction in proliferation potential and sphere forming efficiency, and increased differentiation towards the myoepithelial lineage. Significantly, staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity revealed a dramatic increase in the number of senescent cells with passage, which might in part explain the inability to continuously generate mammospheres in culture. Conclusions Thus, the self-renewal potential of human breast stem cells is exhausted within five in vitro passages of mammospheres, suggesting the need for further improvisation in culture conditions for their long-term maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1969461625,Previously we have shown that compacted DNA nanoparticles can drive high levels of transgene expression after subretinal injection in the mouse eye. Here we delivered compacted DNA nanoparticles containing a therapeutic gene to the retinas of a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. Nanoparticles containing the wild-type retinal degeneration slow (Rds) gene were injected into the subretinal space of rds(+/-) mice on postnatal day 5. Gene expression was sustained for up to four months at levels up to four times higher than in controls injected with saline or naked DNA. The nanoparticles were taken up into virtually all photoreceptors and mediated significant structural and biochemical rescue of the disease without histological or functional evidence of toxicity. Electroretinogram recordings showed that nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer restored cone function to a near-normal level in contrast to transfer of naked plasmid DNA. Rod function was also improved. These findings demonstrate that compacted DNA nanoparticles represent a viable option for development of gene-based interventions for ocular diseases and obviate major barriers commonly encountered with non-viral based therapies.

The protein product, TNF-alpha, activates the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB) transcription factor, and is critical for inflammatory and apoptotic responses in cancer progression. We hypothesized that the TNF and NF-kappaB pathways are important for NHL and that gene variations across the pathways may alter NHL risk.We genotyped 500 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 48 candidate gene regions (defined as 20 kb 5', 10 kb 3') in the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies and the NF-kappaB and related transcription factors, in 1946 NHL cases and 1808 controls pooled from three independent population-based case-control studies. We obtained a gene region-level summary of association by computing the minimum p-value (""minP test""). We used logistic regression to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for NHL and four major NHL subtypes in relation to SNP genotypes and haplotypes. For NHL, the tail strength statistic supported an overall relationship between the TNF/NF-kappaB pathway and NHL (p = 0.02). We confirmed the association between TNF/LTA on chromosome 6p21.3 with NHL and found the LTA rs2844484 SNP most significantly and specifically associated with the major subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (p-trend = 0.001). We also implicated for the first time, variants in NFKBIL1 on chromosome 6p21.3, associated with NHL. Other gene regions identified as statistically significantly associated with NHL included FAS, IRF4, TNFSF13B, TANK, TNFSF7 and TNFRSF13C. Accordingly, the single most significant SNPs associated with NHL were FAS rs4934436 (p-trend = 0.0024), IRF4 rs12211228 (p-trend = 0.0026), TNFSF13B rs2582869 (p-trend = 0.0055), TANK rs1921310 (p-trend = 0.0025), TNFSF7 rs16994592 (p-trend = 0.0024), and TNFRSF13C rs6002551 (p-trend = 0.0074). All associations were consistent in each study with no apparent specificity for NHL subtype.Our results provide consistent evidence that variation in the TNF superfamily of genes and specifically within chromosome 6p21.3 impacts lymphomagenesis. Further characterization of these susceptibility loci and identification of functional variants are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2155376686,"Background The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals, eliciting death rates as high as 90% among infected humans. Currently, replication defective adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine is being studied in a phase I clinical trial. Another Ebola vaccine, based on an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus has shown efficacy in post-exposure treatment of nonhuman primates to Ebola infection. In this report, we modified the common recombinant adenovirus serotype 5-based Ebola vaccine expressing the wild-type ZEBOV glycoprotein sequence from a CMV promoter (Ad-CMVZGP). The immune response elicited by this improved expression cassette vector (Ad-CAGoptZGP) and its ability to afford protection against lethal ZEBOV challenge in mice was compared to the standard Ad-CMVZGP vector. Methodology/Principal Findings Ad-CMVZGP was previously shown to protect mice, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates from an otherwise lethal challenge of Zaire ebolavirus. The antigenic expression cassette of this vector was improved through codon optimization, inclusion of a consensus Kozak sequence and reconfiguration of a CAG promoter (Ad-CAGoptZGP). Expression of GP from Ad-CAGoptZGP was substantially higher than from Ad-CMVZGP. Ad-CAGoptZGP significantly improved T and B cell responses at doses 10 to 100-fold lower than that needed with Ad-CMVZGP. Additionally, Ad-CAGoptZGP afforded full protections in mice against lethal challenge at a dose 100 times lower than the dose required for Ad-CMVZGP. Finally, Ad-CAGoptZGP induced full protection to mice when given 30 minutes post-challenge. Conclusions/Significance We describe an improved adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine capable of affording post-exposure protection against lethal challenge in mice. The molecular modifications of the new improved vaccine also translated in the induction of significantly enhanced immune responses and complete protection at a dose 100 times lower than with the previous generation adenovirus-based Ebola vaccine. Understanding and improving the molecular components of adenovirus-based vaccines can produce potent, optimized product, useful for vaccination and post-exposure therapy."

Recently it has been recognized as an emerging opportunistic pathogen. To study the evolutionary history of S. cerevisiae, the origin of clinical isolates and the importance of a virulence-associated trait, population genetics and phenotypic assays have been applied to an ecologically diverse set of 103 strains isolated from clinics, breweries, vineyards, fruits, soil, commercial supplements and insect guts.DNA sequence data from five nuclear DNA loci were analyzed for population structure and haplotype distribution. Additionally, all strains were tested for survival of oxidative stress, a trait associated with microbial pathogenicity. DNA sequence analyses identified three genetic subgroups within the recombining S. cerevisiae strains that are associated with ecology, geography and virulence. Shared alleles suggest that the clinical isolates contain genetic contribution from the fruit isolates. Clinical and fruit isolates exhibit high levels of recombination, unlike the genetically homogenous soil isolates in which no recombination was detected. However, clinical and soil isolates were more resistant to oxidative stress than any other population, suggesting a correlation between survival in oxidative stress and yeast pathogenicity.Population genetic analyses of S. cerevisiae delineated three distinct groups, comprising primarily the (i) human-associated brewery and vineyard strains, (ii) clinical and fruit isolates (iii) and wild soil isolates from eastern U.S. The interactions between S. cerevisiae and humans potentiate yeast evolution and the development of genetically, ecologically and geographically divergent groups."
https://openalex.org/W1977202771,"Background ABCC1 and ABCG2 are ubiquitous ATP-binding cassette transmembrane proteins that play an important role in multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we evaluated the possible interaction of vandetanib, an orally administered drug inhibiting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, with ABCC1 and ABCG2 in vitro. Methodology and Principal Findings MDR cancer cells overexpressing ABCC1 or ABCG2 and their sensitive parental cell lines were used. MTT assay showed that vandetanib had moderate and almost equal-potent anti-proliferative activity in both sensitive parental and MDR cancer cells. Concomitant treatment of MDR cells with vandetanib and specific inhibitors of ABCC1 or ABCG2 did not alter their sensitivity to the former drug. On the other hand, clinically attainable but non-toxic doses of vandetanib were found to significantly enhance the sensitivity of MDR cancer cells to ABCC1 or ABCG2 substrate antitumor drugs. Flow cytometric analysis showed that vandetanib treatment significantly increase the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and rhodamine 123, substrates of ABCC1 and ABCG2 respectively, in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). However, no significant effect was shown in sensitive parental cell lines. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that vandetanib did not change the expression of ABCC1 and ABCG2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, total and phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK1/2 remained unchanged after vandetanib treatment in both sensitive and MDR cancer cells. Conclusions Vandetanib is unlikely to be a substrate of ABCC1 or ABCG2. It overcomes ABCC1- and ABCG2-mediated drug resistance by inhibiting the transporter activity, independent of the blockade of AKT and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways."

We measured: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, phagocytic activity, lysosomal enzymes, exosome markers and selected complement pathway components. In the presence of a non-cytotoxic dose of B(a)P, there was extensive mtDNA damage but no nuclear DNA damage. RPE phagocytic activity was not altered but there were increased lysosomal activity, exocytotic activity and complement pathway components. Retinas from mice exposed to cigarette smoke contained markers for mtDNA damage, exosomes and complement pathway components surrounding Bruch's membrane. Markers for these processes are found in drusen from AMD patients. Thus, smoking may cause damage to mtDNA and increased degradative processes in the RPE. These altered cell biological processes in the RPE may contribute to the formation of drusen in individuals who are cigarette smokers and underlie susceptibility to genetic mutations associated with AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1972469808,"Background Individuals of many vertebrate species show different stress coping styles and these have a striking influence on how gene expression shifts in response to a variety of challenges. Principal Findings This is clearly illustrated by a study in which common carp displaying behavioural predictors of different coping styles (characterised by a proactive, adrenaline-based or a reactive, cortisol-based response) were subjected to inflammatory challenge and specific gene transcripts measured in individual brains. Proactive and reactive fish differed in baseline gene expression and also showed diametrically opposite responses to the challenge for 80% of the genes investigated.

ABC transporters form a large, ATP-dependent family of primary transporters, which can be found in all three kingdoms of life, and are involved in many vitally important transport processes across biological membranes. In bacteria, they represent 2% of all gene products. In humans, ∼50% of all ABC transporter genes are involved in diseases, including the most frequent lethal inherited disease, cystic fibrosis (1Holland I.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). The spectrum of substrates ranges from small inorganic ions such as chloride to intact proteins. ABC transporters display a modular architecture composed of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) 3The abbreviations used are: NBDnucleotide-binding domainTMDtransmembrane domaincwcontinuous waveDDMdodecyl maltosideTMtransmembrane. that contain all conserved sequence motifs and two transmembrane domains (TMDs), which can be arranged in any possible combination. Canonical ABC import systems, thus far confined to prokaryotes, require a fifth module for functionality, the extracytoplasmic substrate-binding protein or receptor. Binding protein-dependent ABC transporters mediate the uptake of a large variety of nutrients such as carbohydrates, amino acids, or peptides but are also involved in diverse physiological processes, including bacterial pathogenesis. For example, ABC importers that supply bacterial cells with essential iron ions (2Crosa J.H. Mey A.R. Eayne S.M. Iron Transport in Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2004Crossref Google Scholar) or transport signaling molecules for the formation of biofilms are important virulence factors (3Waters C.M. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 319-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). Thus, these transporters are potential targets for the development of new antimicrobial drugs. As a prerequisite, a detailed understanding at the molecular level of the mechanism by which ABC importers exert their functions is of utmost importance. Structural and biochemical data suggest that alternating access of the translocation pore to the intra- and extracellular space achieves a net transport of substrate. The “leitmotiv” of this model is that the alternation of the TMDs between an outward-facing and an inward-facing conformation is energized by the catalytic cycle of NBDs. The latter includes NBD dimer closure upon ATP binding, hydrolysis of ATP in the closed conformer and reopening toward a semi-closed, ADP-bound state (4Oldham M.L. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Curr. Opin.

A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and for the transmembrane gates displacement of the vitamin B12 importer BtuCD-F (10Goetz B.A. Perozo E. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we address molecular details of the signaling events occurring on opposite sides of the transporter and present new structural details on the coupling between the periplasmic MalF-P2 and the cytoplasmic MalK dimer in a functional transporter. To this end, we have employed site-directed spin-labeling-electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. A set of interspin distances for five spin-labeled double cysteine mutants in MalF-P2 was obtained by continuous wave (cw) and pulse EPR, thus unveiling mutual rearrangements during the transport cycle. Moreover, concomitant detection of conformational changes in singly spin-labeled MalK2 allowed us to monitor cofactor-induced inter-domain communication. Our study revealed first that MalE binding to MalF-P2 occurs independently of nucleotide binding to MalK2. Second, we could demonstrate a sequence of three conformations of MalF-P2 that corresponds to the nucleotide cycle of the MalK dimer. Finally, we monitored conformational changes simultaneously at the periplasmic and the cytoplasmic faces of the transporter, revealing reciprocal communication between the two domains as a major functional step of the transport process. The correlation of events occurring at both faces of the membrane was shown to be of different robustness with respect to the environment. Based on our results, we propose a model for coupling of ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation in the maltose transporter. Cell growth, membrane preparation, and purification of histidine-tagged complexes were performed as described by Landmesser et al. (11Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), except for omitting MgCl2 in the buffer. His6-MalE was purified according to Ref. 12Daus M.L. Berendt S. Wuttge S. Schneider E. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 1107-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. MalF*G*K2 complexes (where * denotes Cys-less background) were labeled with 2-fold (double cysteine mutants in MalF-P2), 3-fold (MalF*G*K(C40S/S83C)2), or 5-fold (MalF*(S205C/S252C)G*K(C40S/S83C)2) molar excess of methanethiosulfonate spin label (Alexis Corp., Lauden, Switzerland) for 1 h at 4 °C. Residual methanethiosulfonate spin label was removed by gel filtration (PD-10 columns, GE Healthcare). Spin labeling and measurements were performed in the same buffer used for purification (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% β-dodecyl maltoside, 20% (v/v) glycerol). Deuterated glycerol was used in some cases to optimize the signal to noise ratio of the DEER traces. Samples were concentrated using Vivaspin 100 centrifuge filters (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to achieve final concentrations of 100–200 μm. Cofactors were added before shock-freezing the sample in the quartz tube. Nucleotide binding of the complex was achieved by incubating the sample with 4 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA or 4 mm ADP and 4 mm MgCl2 (10 min of incubation at room temperature). Post-hydrolytic conformations were obtained by incubation of the sample with 4 mm ATP/4 mm MgCl2 for 20′ at 37 °C. MalE was added in double molar excess to the transporter in the presence of 2 mm maltose (10′ incubation at room temperature). For ATPase activity measurements and distance measurements, spin-labeled maltose transporter variants were reconstituted into liposomes at a 5:1 lipid to protein ratio (Escherichia coli polar extract, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Reconstitution using Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) was performed overnight at 4 °C in the presence and absence of liganded MalE. Proteoliposomes where then spun down at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, resuspended in the least possible volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Activity measurements of spin-labeled transport complexes were performed according to Ref. 11Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Complexes were assayed both in detergent solution and reconstituted both in the presence and absence of MalE. EPR spectra were recorded at X-band frequencies (9.3–9.4 GHz) with a Bruker Elexsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker super-high Q cavity and a continuous flow N2 cryostat. For room temperature and 160 K measurements, the microwave power was set to 0.6 and 0.03 milliwatts and the B-field modulation amplitude to 0.1 and 0.25 millitesla, respectively. Fitting of simulated dipolar broadened EPR powder spectra to the experimental ones detected at 160 K was performed according to Refs. 13Grote M. Bordignon E. Polyhach Y. Jeschke G. Steinhoff H.J.

Dipolar time evolution data were obtained at X-band frequencies with a Bruker Elexsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker Flexline split-ring resonator ER 4118X-MS3 and a continuous flow helium cryostat ESR900 (Oxford Instruments, Oxfordshire, UK) controlled by an Oxford Instruments temperature controller ITC 503S. All measurements were performed as described previously (13Grote M. Bordignon E. Polyhach Y. Jeschke G. Steinhoff H.J. Schneider E. Biophys.

Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Experimental data were collected at 50 K with observer pulse lengths of 16 ns for π/2 and 32 ns for π pulses, with the electron double resonance π pulse set to 12 ns. Proton or deuterium modulations were averaged. Data analysis of the DEER traces was performed with the software DeerAnalysis 2008.1 (16Jeschke G. Chechik V. Ionita P. Godt A. Zimmermann H. Banham J. Timmel C.R. Hilger D. Jung H. Appl. Magn. Res. 2006; 30: 473-498Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar). All results were found to be independent from the order of added cofactors, and the DEER traces were recorded at least twice from distinct protein preparations. Fig. 1 shows the sites of introduction of the spin labels in the structure of the maltose ABC importer (Protein Data Bank code 2R6G). Sites 205, 239, and 252 are located in the core of the MalF-P2 loop and were used to measure a triangular pattern of distances to monitor major conformational changes. Sites 92 and 273 are in the regions anchoring MalF-P2 to helices TM3 and TM4, respectively, and were chosen to detect eventual MalF-P2 movements with respect to the membrane plane. To simultaneously detect closure and opening of the nucleotide-binding interface and the MalF-P2 rearrangements in the intact transporter, two spin labels were introduced in MalK2 at positions 83/83′ in combination with MalF-P2 sites 205 and 252. All spin-labeled variants of MalFGK2 displayed MalE/maltose-stimulated ATPase activity both in detergent solution and proteoliposomes. However, in some cases, labeling caused a reduction in activity (see supplemental Table S1). Although MalE-independent activity was generally low in proteoliposomes (10% or less), the same complexes exhibited elevated values in detergent solution. As demonstrated in an earlier EPR study (13Grote M. Bordignon E. Polyhach Y. Jeschke G. Steinhoff H.J. Schneider E. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2924-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), ATP binding and hydrolysis by the complex solubilized in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) induced conformational changes in the MalK dimer in the absence of MalE. Thus, we examined possible effects of the MalK nucleotide cycle on MalF-P2 under the same conditions. Fig. 2 shows the pulse EPR data and selected cw EPR spectra detected for five doubly spin-labeled variants. We found that binding of ATP to MalK2 as well as subsequent hydrolysis failed to induce conformational changes in the core of the MalF-P2 domain (sites 205, 239, and 252). A bimodal distance distribution obtained for all doubly spin-labeled mutants sharing site 239 points to a certain degree of flexibility around this position in the absence of MalE. No evidence for ATP-induced dislocation of the P2 domain from the adjacent N-terminal transmembrane segment was found, as judged from the invariant distance between site 92 in helix TM3 and 205 in the P2 loop. On the other hand, small spectral changes were detected at room temperature for the 92/273 mutant indicating that nucleotide binding affects the dynamics of the periplasmically exposed face of the transmembrane domains. The broad interspin distance distribution and the low degree of reproducibility of the DEER traces for the 92/273 mutant indicate that residue 273 is located in a disordered region of the protein, contrary to what was expected from the x-ray data (see also supplemental Fig. S3). Addition of liganded MalE to the DDM-solubilized complex led to detectable changes in the MalF-P2 core (Fig. 2, first three panels). Changes both in spin label dynamics and in interspin distances are indicative for MalE binding to the apo complex. Hence, MalE is sufficient to trigger conformational changes in MalF-P2 even in the absence of ATP. The transition from bimodal to unimodal distance distributions for the doubly spin-labeled mutants sharing position 239 indicates that this region of the MalF-P2 domain is stabilized by MalE. In the presence of liganded MalE, MalF-P2 undergoes relevant conformational changes. In fact, upon ATP binding, we detected distinct interspin distance changes (Fig. 3) ranging from a 0.1 nm increase between 205–239 and 239–252 to a 1.2 nm decrease between sites 205 and 252. Addition of ADP-Mg2+ or incubation in the presence of ATP-Mg2+ induced an identical distance distribution assigned to the post-hydrolytic state as shown for the 205/252 mutant (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, the most relevant changes in the post-hydrolytic conformation with respect to the apo-state were found for 92/205 (−0.8 nm) and 205/252 (−0.5 nm) (Fig. 3). To correlate the EPR findings with the available x-ray data (8Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), an inactive transporter variant containing the E159Q mutation in MalK was spin-labeled at positions 205 and 252. This exchange is known to abolish ATP hydrolysis (17Daus M.L. Landmesser H. Schlosser A. Müller P. Herrmann A. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3856-3865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, the MalF-P2 conformations of the apo- and ATP-bound states in the inactive transporter were indistinguishable from those obtained with the active construct, whereas conditions favoring ATP hydrolysis did not induce the post-hydrolytic conformation. In contrast, direct binding of ADP and MgCl2 to MalK2 was sufficient to trigger the post-hydrolytic MalF-P2 conformation (supplemental Fig. S2). Hence, the transition from the ATP-bound to the post-hydrolytic MalF-P2 conformation is clearly blocked in the inactive E159Q transporter, thus unveiling the reciprocal communication across the membrane between the semi-open conformation of MalK2 and the post-hydrolytic conformation of MalF-P2. Based on these facts, we surmise that the x-ray structure of MalF-P2 can be compared with the ATP-bound conformation of MalF-P2 in the wild type transporter. The correlation between EPR-derived and x-ray Cβ-Cβ distances are presented in Fig. 3 and can be considered as an agreement taking into account the spin label average length (18Beier C. Steinhoff H.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2647-2664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Simulations performed on in silico labeled residues in MalF-P2 reveal a good qualitative agreement with the experimentally determined interspin distances, despite the generally high B-factors of the residues surrounding the spin labels (2R6G). The most relevant deviations were found for the mutant 239/252, with both spin labels close to the 243–244 missing residues in the structure, and for the 92/273 pair, where the EPR data clearly suggest a disordered region around position 273 (supplemental Fig. S3). Results on MalFGK2 spin-labeled at positions 205 and 252 reconstituted into liposomes resemble those obtained in detergent solution (Fig. 4A), indicating that the three observed conformations of MalF-P2 are representative for transporters in a physiological environment. It is worth mentioning that in the ATP-bound and post-hydrolysis states, a residual peak centered at 2.7 nm and corresponding to 50% of the total area was found (Fig. 4A). This apo state-like peak reflects the fraction of transporters still in the apo state in which the nucleotide binding domains face the lumen and hence remain unaffected by nucleotide addition (11Landmesser H. Stein A. Blüschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Effects of liganded MalE on MalK dimer closure were analogously investigated in the reconstituted complex carrying the spin label at Cys-83 in MalK2. In the absence of MalE, ATP binding induced only a minor distance decrease between the two MalK subunits, even smaller than that found in DDM solution (13Grote M. Bordignon E. Polyhach Y. Jeschke G. Steinhoff H.J. Schneider E. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2924-2938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This correlates to the strongly suppressed ATP hydrolysis rate (supplemental Table ST1). In contrast, addition of liganded MalE and ATP induced a tighter closure of the NBDs both in reconstituted and in DDM-solubilized complexes (Fig. 4B). A line shape analysis was performed on the cw EPR spectra of the DDM-solubilized transporters. The mean interspin distance of 1.5 nm was found in agreement with the short distances detected by DEER in proteoliposomes. A “triple mutant” spin-labeled both in MalK2 (sites 83/83′) and in MalF-P2 (sites 205 and 252) and reconstituted in liposomes showed broad DEER traces as expected (Fig. 4C). In the absence of liganded MalE, only minor changes were detected upon ATP binding. The presence of MalE/maltose (in the lumen of the proteoliposomes) induced a pronounced short distance peak indicative of a tighter NBD closure and a conformational switch in the P2 domain (supplemental Fig. S5). In this study, we analyze conformational changes and inter-subunit communication across the membrane in the maltose ABC transporter by EPR. To this end, transporter variants were spin-labeled both in the cytoplasmically located NBDs (MalK2) and in MalF-P2, the large periplasmic domain of MalF. Functional data on this domain are scarce. Insertion or deletion mutations within this region caused maltose-negative phenotypes (19Tapia M.I. Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2267-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Daus et al. (17Daus M.L. Landmesser H. Schlosser A. Müller P. Herrmann A. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3856-3865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) presented first evidence for conformational changes in the MalF-P2 loop during transport. Furthermore, recent biochemical data and an NMR analysis suggested that MalF-P2 is sufficient to bind MalE and stays in intimate contact to the receptor throughout the transport cycle (20Daus M.L. Grote M. Schneider E. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Jacso T. Grote M. Daus M. Schmieder P. Keller S. Schneider E. Reif B. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2216-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our data led to three main conclusions about the catalytic cycle of MalFGK2. First, binding of MalE to the transporter was demonstrated during the whole nucleotide cycle, with MalE reducing the intrinsic flexibility of MalF-P2 around site 239. Second, a sequence of three distinct MalF-P2 conformers was found analogous to the open, closed, and semi-open conformations of the MalK dimer. Third, and most importantly, we found a reciprocal dependence of conformational changes at the periplasmic and the cytoplasmic face of the transporter, i.e. reciprocal communication. Yet the effect of the conformational changes in MalK2 on MalF-P2 and vice versa is of different robustness with respect to the environment of the transporter. Rearrangements in MalF-P2 are strictly dependent on MalE and ATP both in micelles and membranes. In contrast, MalK dimer closure despite requiring MalE to be completed (9Orelle C. Ayvaz T. Everly R.M. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) can (at least in part) be triggered by ATP alone in detergent solution. This results in a futile ATP hydrolysis cycle unable to trigger the MalF-P2 conformational changes. The decoupling between MalF-P2 and MalK observed in DDM-solubilized complexes is suggested to be related to an enhanced flexibility of the TMDs in detergent micelles. These findings correspond very well to the elevated levels of MalE-independent ATPase activity that we observed in detergent solution (supplemental Table S1). Our results give first structural insights into the stimulatory effect of MalE on the ATPase activity. MalE binding is found to be correlated to structural rearrangements in MalF-P2, which need to be transferred through the TMDs to the cytoplasmic coupling helices to trigger the complete closure of the NBDs. Combining our findings with other structural and biochemical data, we present a dynamic model for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and substrate transfer in MalFGK2 (Fig. 5). According to this model, the transporter is present in an equilibrium of conformers, which is modulated by the concentrations of cofactors and interaction partners. Net transport of substrate is achieved by fine-tuning of the transition rates between the different conformational states. The main features of our model are as follows: (i) the general alternating access principle implying two different conformations of the TMDs (22Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar); (ii) the persistent interaction of liganded MalE with the apo-, ATP-, and ADP-bound conformers of MalFGK2; (iii) the existence of three distinct conformers both in MalF-P2 and MalK2; and (iv) the mutual dependence of conformational changes in MalF-P2 and MalK2, leading to a central conformer with closed NBDs and outward-facing TMDs. This intermediate state can presumably be stabilized only by preventing immediate ATP hydrolysis through mutations (8Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or absence of the Mg2+ cofactor, for example. Otherwise the equilibrium is strongly shifted toward the ADP-bound conformer with semi-open NBDs and TMDs flipped back toward the cytoplasmic open state, thus releasing maltose into the cytoplasm. It is intriguing that three distinct conformers are emerging in MalF-P2 and MalK2 located at the opposite sites of the membrane, whereas a two-step mechanism switching the TMDs from an outward- to an inward-facing conformation is at present the model for transport. Further studies characterizing the inter-domain relationships during substrate transport will be necessary to scrutinize the model and elaborate the details of the conformational changes triggered by the substrate-binding protein. To this end, spin-labeled MalE variants will be also employed and distances relative to singly spin-labeled positions in the P2-loop and key positions in the transmembrane region of the complex will be investigated. With respect to its details, this model naturally represents the specific situation of the maltose transporter. Yet also in the BtuCD-F complex, which might have a coupling mechanism distinct from that of the maltose and molybdate importers and which lacks a large anchoring loop for BtuF in BtuCD, both receptor and nucleotides are found to be necessary for the conformational changes in the gates (10Goetz B.A. Perozo E. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Hvorup R.N. Goetz B.A. Niederer M. Hollenstein K. Perozo E. Locher K.P. Science. 2007; 317: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Comparative site-directed spin-labeling EPR studies on the effects of MalE or BtuF on both transporters will help to elucidate the mechanism of substrate-induced activation. From our study, a likely unstable intermediate dependent on the simultaneous presence of two cofactors (receptor/substrate and ATP) is emerging as a key feature for the mechanism of import. M.

However, the mechanism that exogenous PrPSc infects cells and where pathologic conversion of PrPC to the PrPSc form occurs remains uncertain. Here we report that similar to the mechanism of HIV-1 TAT-mediated peptide transduction, processed mature, full length PrP contains a conserved N-terminal cationic domain that stimulates cellular uptake by lipid raft-dependent, macropinocytosis. Inhibition of macropinocytosis by three independent means prevented cellular uptake of recombinant PrP; however, it did not affect recombinant PrP cell surface association. In addition, fusion of the cationic N-terminal PrP domain to a Cre recombinase reporter protein was sufficient to promote both cellular uptake and escape from the macropinosomes into the cytoplasm. Inhibition of macropinocytosis was sufficient to prevent conversion of PrPC to the pathologic PrPSc form in N2a cells exposed to strain RML PrPSc infected brain homogenates, suggesting that a critical determinant of PrPC conversion occurs following macropinocytotic internalization and not through mere membrane association. Taken together, these observations provide a cellular mechanism that exogenous pathological PrPSc infects cells by lipid raft dependent, macropinocytosis."

These studies indicate that genetic effects explain 35 to 45% of the variance in borderline personality disorder and borderline personality features. However, effects of non-additive (dominance) genetic factors, non-random mating and cultural transmission have generally not been explored. In the present study an extended twin-family design was applied to self-report data of twins (N = 5,017) and their siblings (N = 1,266), parents (N = 3,064) and spouses (N = 939) from 4,015 families, to estimate the effects of additive and non-additive genetic and environmental factors, cultural transmission and non-random mating on individual differences in borderline personality features. Results showed that resemblance among biological relatives could completely be attributed to genetic effects. Variation in borderline personality features was explained by additive genetic (21%; 95% CI 17–26%) and dominant genetic (24%; 95% CI 17–31%) factors. Environmental influences (55%; 95% CI 51–60%) explained the remaining variance. Significant resemblance between spouses was observed, which was best explained by phenotypic assortative mating, but it had only a small effect on the genetic variance (1% of the total variance). There was no effect of cultural transmission from parents to offspring."

P140 modulates lupus patients' T cell response ex vivo and is currently included in phase IIb clinical trials. Its underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. Here we show that P140 peptide binds a unique cell-surface receptor, the constitutively-expressed chaperone HSC70 protein, known as a presenting-protein. P140 induces apoptosis of activated MRL/lpr CD4+ T cells. In P140-treated mice, it increases peripheral blood lymphocyte apoptosis and decreases B cell, activated T cell, and CD4−CD8−B220+ T cell counts via a specific mechanism strictly depending on γδ T cells. Expression of inflammation-linked genes is rapidly regulated in CD4+ T cells. This work led us to identify a powerful pathway taken by a newly-designed therapeutic peptide to immunomodulate lupus autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2134685266,"Consensus exists that lipids must play key functions in synaptic activity but precise mechanistic information is limited. Acid sphingomyelinase knockout mice (ASMko) are a suitable model to address the role of sphingolipids in synaptic regulation as they recapitulate a mental retardation syndrome, Niemann Pick disease type A (NPA), and their neurons have altered levels of sphingomyelin (SM) and its derivatives. Electrophysiological recordings showed that ASMko hippocampi have increased paired-pulse facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation. Consistently, electron microscopy revealed reduced number of docked vesicles. Biochemical analysis of ASMko synaptic membranes unveiled higher amounts of SM and sphingosine (Se) and enhanced interaction of the docking molecules Munc18 and syntaxin1. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that Se changes syntaxin1 conformation enhancing its interaction with Munc18. Moreover, Se reduces vesicle docking in primary neurons and increases paired-pulse facilitation when added to wt hippocampal slices. These data provide with a novel mechanism for synaptic vesicle control by sphingolipids and could explain cognitive deficits of NPA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2094612064,"Background Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is believed to be an important regulator of striatal neuron survival, differentiation, and plasticity. Moreover, reduction of BDNF delivery to the striatum has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease. Nevertheless, many essential aspects of BDNF responses in striatal neurons remain to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we assessed the relative contributions of multipartite intracellular signaling pathways to the short-term induction of striatal gene expression by BDNF. To identify genes regulated by BDNF in these GABAergic cells, we first used DNA microarrays to quantify their transcriptomic responses following 3 h of BDNF exposure. The signal transduction pathways underlying gene induction were subsequently dissected using pharmacological agents and quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression responses to BDNF were abolished by inhibitors of TrkB (K252a) and calcium (chelator BAPTA-AM and transient receptor potential cation channel [TRPC] antagonist SKF-96365). Interestingly, inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK also blocked the BDNF-mediated induction of all tested BDNF-responsive genes. In contrast, inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and CAMK exhibited less prevalent, gene-specific effects on BDNF-induced RNA expression. At the nuclear level, the activation of both Elk-1 and CREB showed MEK dependence. Importantly, MEK-dependent activation of transcription was shown to be required for BDNF-induced striatal neurite outgrowth, providing evidence for its contribution to striatal neuron plasticity. Conclusions These results show that the MEK/ERK pathway is a major mediator of neuronal plasticity and other important BDNF-dependent striatal functions that are fulfilled through the positive regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010555086,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis modulates levels and activity of key intracellular second messengers to evade protective immune responses. Calcium release from voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) regulates immune responses to pathogens. In this study, we investigated the roles of VGCC in regulating protective immunity to mycobacteria in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting L-type or R-type VGCC in dendritic cells (DCs) either using antibodies or by siRNA increased calcium influx in an inositol 1,4,5-phosphate and calcium release calcium activated channel dependent mechanism that resulted in increased expression of genes favoring pro-inflammatory responses. Further, VGCC-blocked DCs activated T cells that in turn mediated killing of M. tuberculosis inside macrophages. Likewise, inhibiting VGCC in infected macrophages and PBMCs induced calcium influx, upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and resulted in enhanced killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Importantly, compared to healthy controls, PBMCs of tuberculosis patients expressed higher levels of both VGCC, which were significantly reduced following chemotherapy. Finally, blocking VGCC in vivo in M. tuberculosis infected mice using specific antibodies increased intracellular calcium and significantly reduced bacterial loads. These results indicate that L-type and R-type VGCC play a negative role in M. tuberculosis infection by regulating calcium mobilization in cells that determine protective immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2070450130,"Polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome are hypothesized to be associated with risk of various diseases, including cancer. However, there has been conflicting evidence for associations between a common polymorphism in the mitochondrial genome (A10398G, G10398A in some prior reports) and breast cancer risk. Reactive oxygen species, a by-product of mitochondrial energy production, can lead to oxidative stress and DNA damage in both the mitochondria and their cells. Alcohol consumption, which may also lead to oxidative stress, is associated with breast cancer risk. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genome interact with alcohol consumption to alter breast cancer risk. We genotyped the A10398G polymorphism in a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1,561 cases, 2,209 controls). We observed an interaction between alcohol consumption (yes/no) and A10398G on breast cancer risk (p-int = 0.03). The risk associated with alcohol consumption was limited to carriers of the 10398G allele (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% Confidence Interval 1.10-2.08 comparing drinkers to non-drinkers). However, we were unable to replicate these findings in the Women's Health Study (WHS, 678 cases, 669 controls), although the power to detect this interaction in the WHS was low (power = 0.57). Further examination of this interaction, such as sufficiently powered epidemiological studies of cancer risk or associations with biomarkers of oxidative stress, may provide further evidence for GxE interactions between the A10398G mitochondrial polymorphism and alcohol consumption on breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2067459489,"Integrons are genetic platforms that accelerate lateral gene transfer (LGT) among bacteria. They were first detected on plasmids bearing single and multiple drug resistance determinants in human pathogens, and it is abundantly clear that integrons have played a major role in the evolution of this public health menace. Similar genetic elements can be found in nonpathogenic environmental bacteria and in metagenomic environmental DNA samples, and it is reasonable to suppose that integrons have facilitated microbial adaptation through LGT in niches outside infectious disease wards. Here we show that a heavily impacted estuary, exposed for almost a century to products of coal and steel industries, has developed a rich and unique cassette metagenome, containing genes likely to aid in the catabolism of compounds associated with industrial waste found there. In addition, we report that the most abundant cassette recovered in this study is one that encodes a putative LysR protein. This autoregulatory transcriptional regulator is known to activate transcription of linked target genes or unlinked regulons encoding diverse functions including chlorocatechol and dichlorophenol catabolism. Finally, only class 1 integrase genes were amplified in this study despite using different primer sets, and it may be that the cassettes present in the Tar Ponds will prove to be associated with class 1 integrase genes. Nevertheless, our cassette library provides a snapshot of a complex evolutionary process involving integron-meditated LGT likely to be important in natural bioremediation."
https://openalex.org/W2068727310,"Epidemiological and pedigree studies suggest that lung cancer results from the combined effects of age, smoking, impaired lung function and genetic factors. In a case control association study of healthy smokers and lung cancer cases, we identified genetic markers associated with either susceptibility or protection to lung cancer.We screened 157 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a discovery cohort of 439 subjects (200 controls and 239 lung cancer cases) and identified 30 SNPs associated with either the healthy smokers (protective) or lung cancer (susceptibility) phenotype. After genotyping this 30 SNP panel in a validation cohort of 491 subjects (248 controls and 207 lung cancers) and, using the same protective and susceptibility genotypes from our discovery cohort, a 20 SNP panel was selected based on replication of SNP associations in the validation cohort. Following multivariate logistic regression analyses, including the selected SNPs from runs 1 and 2, we found age and family history of lung cancer to be significantly and independently associated with lung cancer. Numeric scores were assigned to both the SNP and demographic data, and combined to form a simple algorithm of risk.Significant differences in the distribution of the lung cancer susceptibility score was found between normal controls and lung cancer cases, which remained after accounting for differences in lung function. Validation in other case-control and prospective cohorts are underway to further define the potential clinical utility of this model."
https://openalex.org/W2164678766,"DNA replication produces tangled, or catenated, chromatids, that must be decatenated prior to mitosis or catastrophic genomic damage will occur. Topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα) is the primary decatenating enzyme. Cells monitor catenation status and activate decatenation checkpoints when decatenation is incomplete, which occurs when Topo IIα is inhibited by chemotherapy agents such as the anthracyclines and epididophyllotoxins. We recently demonstrated that the DNA repair component Metnase (also called SETMAR) enhances Topo IIα-mediated decatenation, and hypothesized that Metnase could mediate resistance to Topo IIα inhibitors. Here we show that Metnase interacts with Topo IIα in breast cancer cells, and that reducing Metnase expression significantly increases metaphase decatenation checkpoint arrest. Repression of Metnase sensitizes breast cancer cells to Topo IIα inhibitors, and directly blocks the inhibitory effect of the anthracycline adriamycin on Topo IIα-mediated decatenation in vitro. Thus, Metnase may mediate resistance to Topo IIα inhibitors, and could be a biomarker for clinical sensitivity to anthracyclines. Metnase could also become an important target for combination chemotherapy with current Topo IIα inhibitors, specifically in anthracycline-resistant breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031747000,"Background Secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) produced in neurons in the basal forebrain is the primary regulator of reproductive maturation and function in mammals. Peptidergic signals relating to circadian timing and energy balance are an important influence on the reproductive axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the innervation of GnRH neurons by peptidergic neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to detect appositions of peptidergic fibers (NPY, β-endorphin, MCH) associated with energy balance and metabolic status in transgenic mice expressing a green fluorescent protein reporter construct in GnRH neurons. The frequency of these appositions was compared to those of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a hypothalamic neuropeptide likely to convey circadian timing information to the GnRH secretory system. The majority of GnRH neurons (73–87%) were closely apposed by fibers expressing NPY, β-endorphin, or MCH, and a significant proportion of GnRH neurons (28%) also had close contacts with VIP-ir fibers. Conclusions/Significance It is concluded that GnRH neurons in the mouse receive a high frequency of direct modulatory inputs from multiple hypothalamic peptide systems known to be important in conveying circadian information and signalling energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W1964423359,"It has been suggested that the chloroplast genomes of the grass family, Poaceae, have undergone an elevated evolutionary rate compared to most other angiosperms, yet the details of this phenomenon have remained obscure. To know how the rate change occurred during evolution, estimation of the time-scale with reliable calibrations is needed. The recent finding of 65 Ma grass phytoliths in Cretaceous dinosaur coprolites places the diversification of the grasses to the Cretaceous period, and provides a reliable calibration in studying the tempo and mode of grass chloroplast evolution.By using chloroplast genome data from angiosperms and by taking account of new paleontological evidence, we now show that episodic rate acceleration both in terms of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions occurred in the common ancestral branch of the core Poaceae (a group formed by rice, wheat, maize, and their allies) accompanied by adaptive evolution in several chloroplast proteins, while the rate reverted to the slow rate typical of most monocot species in the terminal branches.Our finding of episodic rate acceleration in the ancestral grasses accompanied by adaptive molecular evolution has a profound bearing on the evolution of grasses, which form a highly successful group of plants. The widely used model for estimating divergence times was based on the assumption of correlated rates between ancestral and descendant lineages. However, the assumption is proved to be inadequate in approximating the episodic rate acceleration in the ancestral grasses, and the assumption of independent rates is more appropriate. This finding has implications for studies of molecular evolutionary rates and time-scale of evolution in other groups of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2045249783,"p63 is a transcription factor required for the development and maintenance of ectodermal tissues in general, and skin keratinocytes in particular. The identification of its target genes is fundamental for understanding the complex network of gene regulation governing the development of epithelia. We report a list of almost 1000 targets derived from ChIP on chip analysis on two platforms; all genes analyzed changed in expression during differentiation of human keratinocytes. Functional annotation highlighted unexpected GO terms enrichments and confirmed that genes involved in transcriptional regulation are the most significant. A detailed analysis of these transcriptional regulators in condition of perturbed p63 levels confirmed the role of p63 in the regulatory network. Rather than a rigid master-slave hierarchical model, our data indicate that p63 connects different hubs involved in the multiple specific functions of the skin."
https://openalex.org/W2054525481,"At present, renal grafts are the most common solid organ transplants world-wide. Given the importance of renal transplantation and the limitation of available donor kidneys, detailed analysis of factors that affect transplant survival are important. Despite the introduction of new and effective immunosuppressive drugs, acute cellular graft rejection (AR) is still a major risk for graft survival. Nowadays, AR can only be definitively by renal biopsy. However, biopsies carry a risk of renal transplant injury and loss. Most important, they can not be performed in patients taking anticoagulant drugs.We present a non-invasive, entirely image-based method to assess AR in an allogeneic rat renal transplantation model using small animal positron emission tomography (PET) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). 3 h after i.v. injection of 30 MBq FDG into adult uni-nephrectomized, allogeneically transplanted rats, tissue radioactivity of renal parenchyma was assessed in vivo by a small animal PET-scanner (post operative day (POD) 1,2,4, and 7) and post mortem dissection. The mean radioactivity (cps/mm(3) tissue) as well as the percent injected dose (%ID) was compared between graft and native reference kidney. Results were confirmed by histological and autoradiographic analysis. Healthy rats, rats with acute CSA nephrotoxicity, with acute tubular necrosis, and syngeneically transplanted rats served as controls. FDG-uptake was significantly elevated only in allogeneic grafts from POD 1 on when compared to the native kidney (%ID graft POD 1: 0.54+/-0.06; POD 2: 0.58+/-0.12; POD 4: 0.81+/-0.06; POD 7: 0.77+/-0.1; CTR: 0.22+/-0.01, n = 3-28). Renal FDG-uptake in vivo correlated with the results obtained by micro-autoradiography and the degree of inflammatory infiltrates observed in histology.We propose that graft FDG-PET imaging is a new option to non-invasively, specifically, early detect, and follow-up acute renal rejection. This method is potentially useful to improve post-transplant rejection monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2103594050,"Background Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a lipophilic antioxidant that is synthesized by a mitochondrial complex integrated by at least ten nuclear encoded COQ gene products. CoQ increases cell survival under different stress conditions, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and treatment with cancer drugs such as camptothecin (CPT). We have previously demonstrated that CPT induces CoQ biosynthesis in mammal cells. Methodology/Principal Findings CPT activates NF-κB that binds specifically to two κB binding sites present in the 5′-flanking region of the COQ7 gene. This binding is functional and induces both the COQ7 expression and CoQ biosynthesis. The inhibition of NF-κB activation increases cell death and decreases both, CoQ levels and COQ7 expression induced by CPT. In addition, using a cell line expressing very low of NF-κB, we demonstrate that CPT was incapable of enhancing enhance both CoQ biosynthesis and COQ7 expression in these cells. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate here, for the first time, that a transcriptional mechanism mediated by NF-κB regulates CoQ biosynthesis. This finding contributes new data for the understanding of the regulation of the CoQ biosynthesis pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2047253372,"Pulmonary epithelial injury is central to the pathogenesis of many lung diseases, such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regulated epithelial repair is crucial for lung homeostasis and prevents scar formation and inflammation that accompany dysregulated healing. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in epithelial repair after injury. Vitronectin is a major ECM component that promotes epithelial repair. However, the factors that modify cell-vitronectin interactions after injury and help promote epithelial repair are not well studied. Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IaI) is an abundant serum protein. IaI heavy chains contain von Willebrand A domains that can bind the arginine-glycine-aspartate domain of vitronectin. We therefore hypothesized that IaI can bind vitronectin and promote vitronectin-induced epithelial repair after injury. We show that IaI binds vitronectin at the arginine-glycine-aspartate site, thereby promoting epithelial adhesion and migration in vitro. Furthermore, we show that IaI-deficient mice have a dysregulated response to epithelial injury in vivo, consisting of decreased proliferation and epithelial metaplasia. We conclude that IaI interacts not only with hyaluronan, as previously reported, but also other ECM components like vitronectin and is an important regulator of cellular repair after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2003031595,"Background The traditional approach to studying complex biological networks is based on the identification of interactions between internal components of signaling or metabolic pathways. By comparison, little is known about interactions between higher order biological systems, such as biological pathways and processes. We propose a methodology for gleaning patterns of interactions between biological processes by analyzing protein-protein interactions, transcriptional co-expression and genetic interactions. At the heart of the methodology are the concept of Linked Processes and the resultant network of biological processes, the Process Linkage Network (PLN). Results We construct, catalogue, and analyze different types of PLNs derived from different data sources and different species. When applied to the Gene Ontology, many of the resulting links connect processes that are distant from each other in the hierarchy, even though the connection makes eminent sense biologically. Some others, however, carry an element of surprise and may reflect mechanisms that are unique to the organism under investigation. In this aspect our method complements the link structure between processes inherent in the Gene Ontology, which by its very nature is species-independent. As a practical application of the linkage of processes we demonstrate that it can be effectively used in protein function prediction, having the power to increase both the coverage and the accuracy of predictions, when carefully integrated into prediction methods. Conclusions Our approach constitutes a promising new direction towards understanding the higher levels of organization of the cell as a system which should help current efforts to re-engineer ontologies and improve our ability to predict which proteins are involved in specific biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2003199401,"In response to various environmental stresses, the stress-responsive MAPKs p38 and JNK are activated and phosphorylate ATF2 and c-Jun transcription factors, thereby affecting cell-fate decision. Targeted gene disruption studies have established that JNK-c-Jun signaling plays a vital role in stress-induced apoptosis. The oncogenic phosphatase Wip1 acts as an important regulator in DNA damage pathway by dephosphorylating a spectrum of proteins including p53, p38, Chk1, Chk2, and ATM. In this study we show that Wip1 negatively regulates the activation of MKK4-JNK-c-Jun signaling during stress-induced apoptosis. The loss of Wip1 function sensitizes mouse embryonic fibroblasts to stress-induced apoptosis via the activation of both p38-ATF2 and JNK-c-Jun signaling. Here we reveal that Wip1 has dual roles in alternatively regulating stress- and DNA damage-induced apoptosis through p38/JNK MAPKs and p38/p53-dependent pathways, respectively. Our results point to Wip1 as a general regulator of apoptosis, which further supports its role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2153014205,"Polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1) is activated before mitosis by Aurora A and its cofactor Bora. In mitosis, Bora is degraded in a manner dependent on Plk1 kinase activity and the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF-betaTrCP. Here, we show that Plk1 is also required for the timely destruction of its activator Aurora A in late anaphase. It has been shown that Aurora A destruction is controlled by the auxiliary subunit Cdh1 of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). Remarkably, we found that Plk1-depletion prevented the efficient dephosphorylation of Cdh1 during mitotic exit. Plk1 mediated its effect on Cdh1, at least in part, through direct phosphorylation of the human phosphatase Cdc14A, controlling the phosphorylation state of Cdh1. We conclude that Plk1 facilitates efficient Aurora A degradation through APC/C-Cdh1 activation after mitosis, with a potential role for hCdc14A."
https://openalex.org/W2004195154,"Bacterial meningitis is an acute disease with high mortality that is reduced by early treatment. Identification of the causative microorganism by culture is sensitive but slow. Large volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are required to maximise sensitivity and establish a provisional diagnosis. We have utilised nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to rapidly characterise the biochemical profile of CSF from normal rats and animals with pneumococcal or cryptococcal meningitis. Use of a miniaturised capillary NMR system overcame limitations caused by small CSF volumes and low metabolite concentrations. The analysis of the complex NMR spectroscopic data by a supervised statistical classification strategy included major, minor and unidentified metabolites. Reproducible spectral profiles were generated within less than three minutes, and revealed differences in the relative amounts of glucose, lactate, citrate, amino acid residues, acetate and polyols in the three groups. Contributions from microbial metabolism and inflammatory cells were evident. The computerised statistical classification strategy is based on both major metabolites and minor, partially unidentified metabolites. This data analysis proved highly specific for diagnosis (100% specificity in the final validation set), provided those with visible blood contamination were excluded from analysis; 6-8% of samples were classified as indeterminate. This proof of principle study suggests that a rapid etiologic diagnosis of meningitis is possible without prior culture. The method can be fully automated and avoids delays due to processing and selective identification of specific pathogens that are inherent in DNA-based techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2026818183,"Aim The adiponutrin gene family consists of five genes (PNPLA1-5) coding for proteins with both lipolytic and lipogenic properties. PNPLA3 has previously been associated with adult obesity. Here we investigated the possible association between genetic variants in these genes and childhood and adolescent obesity. Methods/Results Polymorphisms in the five genes of the adiponutrin gene family were selected and genotyped using the Sequenom platform in a childhood and adolescent obesity case-control study. Six variants in PNPLA1 showed association with obesity (rs9380559, rs12212459, rs1467912, rs4713951, rs10947600, and rs12199580, p<0.05 after adjustment for age and gender). Three variants in PNPLA3 showed association with obesity before, but not after, adjustment for age and gender (rs139051, rs12483959, and rs2072907, p>0.05). When analyzing these SNPs in relation to phenotypes, two SNPs in the PNPLA3 gene showed association with insulin sensitivity (rs12483959: β = −0.053, p = 0.016, and rs2072907: β = −0.049, p = 0.024). No associations were seen for PNPLA2, PNPLA4, and PNPLA5. Conclusions Genetic variation in the adiponutrin gene family does not seem to contribute strongly to obesity in children and adolescents. PNPLA1 exhibited a modest effect on obesity and PNPLA3 on insulin sensitivity. These data, however, require confirmation in other cohorts and ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2149310591,"Background Vertebrate brains are composed of two hemispheres that receive input, compute, and interact to form a unified response. How the partially different processes of both hemispheres are integrated to create a single output is largely unknown. In some cases one hemisphere takes charge of the response selection – a process known as metacontrol. Thus far, this phenomenon has only been shown in a handful of studies with primates, mostly conducted in humans. Metacontrol, however, is even more relevant for animals like birds with laterally placed eyes and complete chiasmatic decussation since visual input to the hemispheres is largely different. Methodology/Principal Findings Homing pigeons (Columba livia) were trained with a color discrimination task. Each hemisphere was trained with a different color pair and therefore had a different experience. Subsequently, the pigeons were binocularly examined with two additional stimuli that combined the positive color of one hemisphere with a negative color that had been shown to the other, omitting the availability of a coherent solution and confronting the pigeons with a conflicting situation. Some of the pigeons responded to both stimuli, indicating that none of the hemispheres dominated the overall preference. Some birds, however, responded primarily to one of the conflicting stimuli, showing that they based their choice on the left- or right-monocularly learned color pair, indicating hemispheric metacontrol. Conclusions/Significance We could demonstrate for the first time that metacontrol is a widespread phenomenon that also exists in birds, and thus in principle requires no corpus callosum. Our results are closely similar to those in humans: monocular performance was higher than binocular one and animals displayed different modes of hemispheric dominance. Thus, metacontrol is a dynamic and widely distributed process that possibly constitutes a requirement for all animals with a bipartite brain to confront the problem of choosing between two hemisphere-bound behavioral options."
https://openalex.org/W1972837873,"Dried blood spot samples (DBSS) from newborns are widely used in neonatal screening for selected metabolic diseases and diagnostic possibilities for additional disorders are continuously being evaluated. Primary immunodeficiency disorders comprise a group of more than one hundred diseases, several of which are fatal early in life. Yet, a majority of the patients are not diagnosed due to lack of high-throughput screening methods.We have previously developed a system using reverse phase protein microarrays for analysis of IgA levels in serum samples. In this study, we extended the applicability of the method to include determination of complement component C3 levels in eluates from DBSS collected at birth. Normal levels of C3 were readily detected in 269 DBSS from healthy newborns, while no C3 was detected in sera and DBSS from C3 deficient patients.The findings suggest that patients with deficiencies of specific serum proteins can be identified by analysis of DBSS using reverse phase protein microarrays."
https://openalex.org/W2088226862,"Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) is an endogenous hematopoietic growth factor known for its role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the myeloic lineage. Only recently its significance in the CNS has been uncovered. G-CSF attenuates apoptosis and controls proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. G-CSF activates upstream kinases of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which is thought to facilitate the survival of neuronal precursors and to recruit new neurons into the dentate gyrus. CREB is also essential for spatial long-term memory formation. To assess the role and the potential of this factor on learning and memory-formation we systemically administered G-CSF in rats engaged in spatial learning in an eight-arm radial maze. G-CSF significantly improved spatial learning and increased in combination with cognitive training the survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampus as measured by bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin immunohistochemistry. Additionally, G-CSF improved re-acquisition of spatial information after 26 days. These findings support the hypothesis that G-CSF can enhance learning and memory formation. Due to its easy applicability and its history as a well-tolerated hematological drug, the use of G-CSF opens up new neurological treatment opportunities in conditions where learning and memory-formation deficits occur."
https://openalex.org/W1967836885,"The ribosomal protein L22 is a component of the 60S eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. As an RNA-binding protein, it has been shown to interact with both cellular and viral RNAs including 28S rRNA and the Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA, EBER-1. L22 is localized to the cell nucleus where it accumulates in nucleoli. Although previous studies demonstrated that a specific amino acid sequence is required for nucleolar localization, the RNA-binding domain has not been identified. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the nucleolar accumulation of L22 is linked to its ability to bind RNA. To address this hypothesis, mutated L22 proteins were generated to assess the contribution of specific amino acids to RNA binding and protein localization. Using RNA-protein binding assays, we demonstrate that basic amino acids 80-93 are required for high affinity binding of 28S rRNA and EBER-1 by L22. Fluorescence localization studies using GFP-tagged mutated L22 proteins further reveal that basic amino acids 80-93 are critical for nucleolar accumulation and for incorporation into ribosomes. Our data support the growing consensus that the nucleolar accumulation of ribosomal proteins may not be mediated by a defined localization signal, but rather by specific interaction with established nucleolar components such as rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2031672852,"We have developed a rat brain organotypic culture model, in which tissue slices contain cortex-subventricular zone-striatum regions, to model neuroblast activity in response to in vitro ischemia. Neuroblast activation has been described in terms of two main parameters, proliferation and migration from the subventricular zone into the injured cortex. We observed distinct phases of neuroblast activation as is known to occur after in vivo ischemia. Thus, immediately after oxygen/glucose deprivation (6–24 hours), neuroblasts reduce their proliferative and migratory activity, whereas, at longer time points after the insult (2 to 5 days), they start to proliferate and migrate into the damaged cortex. Antagonism of ionotropic receptors for extracellular ATP during and after the insult unmasks an early activation of neuroblasts in the subventricular zone, which responded with a rapid and intense migration of neuroblasts into the damaged cortex (within 24 hours). The process is further enhanced by elevating the production of the chemoattractant SDf-1α and may also be boosted by blocking the activation of microglia. This organotypic model which we have developed is an excellent in vitro system to study neurogenesis after ischemia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Its application has revealed a SOS response to oxygen/glucose deprivation, which is inhibited by unfavorable conditions due to the ischemic environment. Finally, experimental quantifications have allowed us to elaborate a mathematical model to describe neuroblast activation and to develop a computer simulation which should have promising applications for the screening of drug candidates for novel therapies of ischemia-related pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2083872339,"Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV2) and SV2-related protein (SVOP) are transporter-like proteins that localize to neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Both proteins share structural similarity with the major facilitator (MF) family of small molecule transporters. We recently reported that SV2 binds nucleotides, a feature that has also been reported for another MF family member, the human glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In the case of Glut1, nucleotide binding affects transport activity. In this study, we determined if SVOP also binds nucleotides and assessed its nucleotide binding properties.We performed in vitro photoaffinity labeling experiments with the photoreactive ATP analogue, 8-azido-ATP[gamma] biotin and purified recombinant SVOP-FLAG fusion protein. We found that SVOP is a nucleotide-binding protein, although both its substrate specificity and binding site differ from that of SV2. Within the nucleotides tested, ATP, GTP and NAD show same level of inhibition on SVOP-FLAG labeling. Dose dependent studies indicated that SVOP demonstrates the highest affinity for NAD, in contrast to SV2, which binds both NAD and ATP with equal affinity. Mapping of the binding site revealed a single region spanning transmembrane domains 9-12, which contrasts to the two binding sites in the large cytoplasmic domains in SV2A.SVOP is the third MF family member to be found to bind nucleotides. Given that the binding sites are unique in SVOP, SV2 and Glut1, this feature appears to have arisen separately."
https://openalex.org/W2025836555,"In any fine sensory organelle, a small influx of Ca(2+) can quickly elevate cytoplasmic Ca(2+). Mechanisms must exist to clear the ciliary Ca(2+) before it reaches toxic levels. One such organelle has been well studied: the vertebrate olfactory cilium. Recent studies have suggested that clearance from the olfactory cilium is mediated in part by plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA).In the present study, electrophysiological assays were devised to monitor cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) in single frog olfactory cilia. Ca(2+) was allowed to enter isolated cilia, either through the detached end or through membrane channels. Intraciliary Ca(2+) was monitored via the activity of ciliary Ca(2+)-gated Cl(-) channels, which are sensitive to free Ca(2+) from about 2 to 10 microM. No significant effect of MgATP on intraciliary free Ca(2+) could be found. Carboxyeosin, which has been used to inhibit PMCA, was found to substantially increase a ciliary transduction current activated by cyclic AMP. This increase was ATP-independent.Alternative explanations are suggested for two previous experiments taken to support a role for PMCA in ciliary Ca(2+) clearance. It is concluded that PMCA in the cilium plays a very limited role in clearing the micromolar levels of intraciliary Ca(2+) produced during the odor response."
https://openalex.org/W2063927335,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key metabolic regulator implicated in a variety of cellular processes. It functions as a glycolytic enzyme, a protein kinase, and a metabolic switch under oxidative stress. Its enzymatic inactivation causes a major shift in the primary carbohydrate flux. Furthermore, the protein is implicated in regulating transcription, ER-to-Golgi transport, and apoptosis. We found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells null for all GAPDH paralogues (Tdh1, Tdh2, and Tdh3) survived the counter-selection of a GAPDH-encoding plasmid when the NAD(+) metabolizing deacetylase Sir2 was overexpressed. This phenotype required a fully functional copy of SIR2 and resulted from hyper-recombination between S. cerevisiae plasmids. In the wild-type background, GAPDH overexpression increased the plasmid recombination rate in a growth-condition dependent manner. We conclude that GAPDH influences yeast episome stability via Sir2 and propose a model for the interplay of Sir2, GAPDH, and the glycolytic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2032826857,"Several chronic respiratory diseases exhibit hyperactive immune responses in the lung: abundant inflammatory mediators; infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and other immune cells; and increased level of proteases. Such diseases include cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe/neutrophilic asthma. Paradoxically, patients with these diseases are also susceptible to detrimental bacterial infection and colonization. In this paper, we seek to explain how a positive feedback mechanism via IL-8 could lead to desensitization of epithelial cells to pathogen recognition thus perpetuating bacterial colonization and chronic disease states in the lung. Such insight was obtained from mathematical modeling of the IRAK/TRAF6 signaling module, and is consistent with existing clinical evidence. The potential implications for targeted treatment regimes for these persistent respiratory diseases are explored."
https://openalex.org/W2138178992,"A phyletic vector, also known as a phyletic (or phylogenetic) pattern, is a binary representation of the presences and absences of orthologous genes in different genomes. Joint occurrence of two or more genes in many genomes results in closely similar binary vectors representing these genes, and this similarity between gene vectors may be used as a measure of functional association between genes. Better understanding of quantitative properties of gene co-occurrences is needed for systematic studies of gene function and evolution. We used the probabilistic iterative algorithm Psi-square to find groups of similar phyletic vectors. An extended Psi-square algorithm, in which pseudocounts are implemented, shows better sensitivity in identifying proteins with known functional links than our earlier hierarchical clustering approach. At the same time, the specificity of inferring functional associations between genes in prokaryotic genomes is strongly dependent on the pathway: phyletic vectors of the genes involved in energy metabolism and in de novo biosynthesis of the essential precursors tend to be lumped together, whereas cellular modules involved in secretion, motility, assembly of cell surfaces, biosynthesis of some coenzymes, and utilization of secondary carbon sources tend to be identified with much greater specificity. It appears that the network of gene coinheritance in prokaryotes contains a giant connected component that encompasses most biosynthetic subsystems, along with a series of more independent modules involved in cell interaction with the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2064298344,"Antigen-based (as opposed to whole organism) vaccines are actively being pursued for numerous indications. Even though different formulations may produce similar levels of total antigen-specific antibody, the composition of the antibody response can be quite distinct resulting in different levels of therapeutic activity.Using plasmid-based immunization against the proto-oncogene HER-2 as a model, we have demonstrated that affinity-selected epitope mimetics (mimotopes) can provide a defined signature of a polyclonal antibody response. Further, using novel computer algorithms that we have developed, these mimotopes can be used to predict epitope targets.By combining our novel strategy with existing methods of epitope prediction based on physical properties of an individual protein, we believe that this method offers a robust method for characterizing the breadth of epitope-specificity within a specific polyserum. This strategy is useful as a tool for monitoring immunity following vaccination and can also be used to define relevant epitopes for the creation of novel vaccines."
