https://openalex.org/W2004753781,"Populations of the ecologically important sea urchin Diadema antillarum suffered severe mass mortalities throughout the Caribbean. This mortality was first observed at Panama in January 1983; by January 1984 it had spread to the rest of the Caribbean and to Bermuda. The sequence of mortality events in most areas is consistent with the hypothesis that the causative agent was dispersed by major surface currents over large distances. However, some of the late die-offs in the southeastern Caribbean do not fit this pattern. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that the phenomenon is due to a water-borne pathogen. If so, this is the most extensive epidemic documented for a marine invertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W2083642178,"One probable extinction and one range reduction of eastern Pacific reef-building hydrocoral (Millepora) species mark the first documented cases of species eliminations resulting from the worldwide 1980s coral reef bleaching events. Two of 12 Panamanian coral species were eliminated suddenly from their former ranges by prolonged high sea temperatures during the 1982-83 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event. Three conditions contributed to their demise: high sensitivity to sea warming, populations confined to a small geographic area, and bathymetric restriction to the euphotic zone (≤20 meters depth) where El Niño sea warming had its greatest effect."
https://openalex.org/W1978014553,"Over evolutionary time, the morphology of angiosperm pollen has evolved toward an increasing number of apertures, among other things. From a neo-Darwinian point of view, this means that (i) some polymorphism for aperture number must exist and (ii) there must be some fitness increase associated with increasing the aperture number. Pollen types with different aperture numbers often occur in the same species. Such is the case in Viola diversifolia. Comparison of pollen with three and four apertures in this species showed that four-apertured grains germinated faster than three-apertured ones but that the four-apertured ones experienced other disadvantages. These results obtained on the gametophyte can be interpreted in terms of strategies of the sporophyte."
https://openalex.org/W2058348257,"The development of line-narrowing techniques, such as magic-angle spinning (MAS) and high-power decoupling, has led to powerful high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance approaches for solid samples. In favorable cases (for instance, where high abundances of protons are present) cross polarization (CP) provides a means of circumventing the time bottleneck caused by inefficient spinlattice relaxation in many solids. The combined CP-MAS approach for carbon-13 with proton decoupling has become a popular and routine experiment for organic solids. For many nuclides with spin quantum number /> (1/2) the central nuclear magnetic resonance transition can be employed in high-resolution experiments that involve rapid sample spinning. A continuing stream of advances holds great promise for the use of high-resolution techniques for the characterization of solids by a wide range of nuclides."
https://openalex.org/W1991634567,"Improvements in process control, which determine production efficiency and product quality, are critically dependent upon on-line process analysis. The technology of the required instrumentation will be substantially expanded by advances in sensing devices. In the future, the hardware will consist of sensor arrays and miniaturized instruments fabricated by microlithography and silicon micromachining. Chemometrics will be extensively used in software to provide error detection, selfcalibration, and correction as well as multivariate data analysis for the determination of anticipated and unanticipated species. A number of examples of monolithically fabricated sensors now exist and more will be forthcoming as the new paradigms and new tools are widely adopted. A trend toward not only on-line but even in-product sensors is becoming discernible."
https://openalex.org/W2082000107,"Classical and semiclassical methods are unrivaled in providing an intuitive and computationally tractable approach to the study of atomic, molecular, and nuclear dynamics. An important advantage of such methods is their ability to uncover in a single picture underlying structures that may be hard to extract from the profusion of data supplied by detailed quantum calculations. Modern trends in semiclassical mechanics are described, particularly the combination of group theoretical methods with techniques of nonlinear dynamics. Application is made to intramolecular energy transfer and to the electronic structure of atomic Rydberg states in external electric and magnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2022599588,"Voyager 1 carried a diverse collection of magnetospheric probes through the inner Jovian magnetosphere in March 1979. The ensuing data analysis and theoretical investigation provided a comprehensive description of the Jovian nebula, a luminous torus populated with newly released heavy ions drawn from Io's surface. Recent refinements in Earth-based imaging instrumentation are used to extend the Voyager in situ picture in temporal and spatial coverage. An analysis of [SIII] and [SII] optical emissions observed during the Jovian apparitions of 1981 through 1983 reveals three distinct torus components. Regularities have been identified in the ion partitioning and ion densities in the hot outer and inner tori, sharply defined radial structure is found in the plasma near Io, and the relative permanence of the cool inner torus is inferred. An extended cloud of neutral material is required as a source of fresh ions in the nebula."

This fluid contains aggregates of merocyanine molecules and exhibits marked contraction under light illumination. The mechanism of the photocontraction is dependent upon a specialized microstructure, which may be termed a ""quasi-liquid."""

https://openalex.org/W2063910431,"Sea level measurements by the Seasat altimeter were used to study the temporal variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current between July and October 1978. Large-scale zonal coherence in the cross-stream sea level difference was observed, indicating a general increase in the surface geostrophic velocity of the current around the Southern Ocean. The result demonstrates the power of satellite altimetry to monitor the variability of large-scale ocean currents."

https://openalex.org/W1989377594,"Alternating hard and soft layers characterize the Gull Rock and Tuit Members of the late Eocene Blanche Point Formation, South Australia. Originally the formation was mainly a mixture of volcanic ash, sponge spicules, and calcareous fossil remains, with hard layers produced later by selective silicification. It resembles Cretaceous sediments from western Europe and the eastern coast of the United States, and in each case it appears that alteration of volcanic ash produced smectite and clinoptilolite with release of silica that subsequently crystallized as opal-CT. The occurrence of similar deposits from New Zealand to as far west as Albany, Western Australia, indicates extensive volcanic activity south of Australia in the late Eocene resulting from rifting and separation from Antarctica."

https://openalex.org/W2074729157,"Although gas chromatography has been called a mature technology, advances are still being made in the development of faster columns as well as detectors which yield more information on solutes. In liquid chromatography short columns packed with 3-micrometer particles are already popular for fast analyses, while long narrow-bore columns are being developed for high-resolution separations. An increasing range of detection modes is enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of liquid chromatography. Electrophoresis continues to be of central importance to molecular biology. Computer-aided analysis and display of electropherogram patterns is helping researchers to better comprehend the wealth of data from two-dimensional electrophoresis. A new mode of two-dimensional electrophoresis is permitting separation of whole chromosomes containing as many as 3 million base pairs."
