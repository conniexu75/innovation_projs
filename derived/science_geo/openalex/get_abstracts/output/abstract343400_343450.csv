https://openalex.org/W2026719519,"The number of genetically distinct herring stocks is determined by the number of distinct, geographically stable larval retention areas. Spawning sites in these areas may be highly localized or dispersed. Absolute population size mostly depends on the retention area available to the density-dependent larval-postlarval stage. Although the extreme seasonal range of spawning time shown by Atlantic herring is not fully accounted for by a new hypothesis, current theory is not supported by the hypothesis or by empirical data. The management implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2054634921,"Prescribed fire, a practice applied annually to about 10(6) hectares of forests in the southeastern United States, had limited effects on soils, nutrient cycling, and hydrologic systems of a coastal plain pine forest. Hydrologic fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and basic cations, from burned pine litter to ground and stream waters, are not likely to have appreciable impacts on water quality in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain."
https://openalex.org/W1977478110,"Noninvasive imaging methods for medical diagnosis and biological investigations, have evolved from qualitative radiological techniques to quantitative methods of measuring biochemical and physiological processes in human body. In particular, new developments in emission tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and in vivo spectroscopy offer new horizons for medical research and clinical activities. These methods and their potentials are reviewed and contrasted."
https://openalex.org/W2013798083,Ash from the massive 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens readily gave off large amounts of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide gases at room temperature. These findings suggest that the sulfur that enhances the Junge sulfate layer in the stratosphere after volcanic eruptions could be carried directly to the upper atmosphere as carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide adsorbed on ash particles from major volcanic eruptions.
https://openalex.org/W2079603841,"On the central portion of the west Florida continental shelf, radionuclide activities show unusually wide variations: radium-226 activities up to 350 disintegrations per minute per 100 liters, radon-222 activities up to 1300 disintegrations per minute per 100 liters, and deficiencies of radon-222 as low as â€“10 disintegrations per minute per 100 liters. Florida's phosphate-rich strata seem to be the principal source of the radionuclides, with the transfer occurring directly from sediments or indirectly in streams, ground-water flow, and geothermal springs. Winter storm fronts may enhance radon degassing in the shelf waters."
https://openalex.org/W2017184974,The presence of newly discovered diapirs of presumed salt origin is documented for the continental margin of northeastern Kenya and southeastern Somalia. These structures are probably a manifestation of a significant thickness of Lower Jurassic evaporites deposited during the rift and early-drift stages of the separation of Madagascar from the African continent.

https://openalex.org/W2013878284,"A single heat transfer measurement technique was used to determine the thermal insulating capabilities of four materials used in outdoor clothing-goose down, wool, polyester, and polyolefin. It was found that all provide very similar degrees of insulation."
https://openalex.org/W2031319436,"The existence of an internal hydrogen bond in a compound representative of a syn diol epoxide (a possible intermediate in chemical carcinogenesis by certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) has been demonstrated by x-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies. This internal hydrogen bond was found in 3,4-epoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol and was shown to persist in dioxane-water solutions containing up to 80 mole percent water. In this structure, the 1-hydroxy and 2-methyl groups are shown to occupy axial positions. In the anti diol epoxide, which has no internal hydrogen bond, analogous groups are equatorial. Crystals of the compound were unstable in the x-ray beam while the data were being collected (even at low temperatures), presumably as a result of decomposition."
