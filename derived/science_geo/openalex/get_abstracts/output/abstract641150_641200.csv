https://openalex.org/W2974449448,"Staggering decline of bird populations Because birds are conspicuous and easy to identify and count, reliable records of their occurrence have been gathered over many decades in many parts of the world. Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg et al. report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend.

https://openalex.org/W2979911343,"Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal the transcriptional state of cells, yet provides little insight into the upstream regulatory landscape associated with open or accessible chromatin regions. Joint profiling of accessible chromatin and RNA within the same cells would permit direct matching of transcriptional regulation to its outputs. Here, we describe droplet-based single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE-seq), a method that can link a cell's transcriptome with its accessible chromatin for sequencing at scale. Specifically, accessible sites are captured by Tn5 transposase in permeabilized nuclei to permit, within many droplets in parallel, DNA barcode tagging together with the mRNA molecules from the same cells. To demonstrate the utility of SNARE-seq, we generated joint profiles of 5,081 and 10,309 cells from neonatal and adult mouse cerebral cortices, respectively. We reconstructed the transcriptome and epigenetic landscapes of major and rare cell types, uncovered lineage-specific accessible sites, especially for low-abundance cells, and connected the dynamics of promoter accessibility with transcription level during neurogenesis."

Scheffers et al. looked across tens of thousands of vertebrate species and found that one in every five species is affected by trade of some sort. The impacts of trade tend to be concentrated in certain phylogenetic groups, thus the potential for long-term impact on certain lineages is substantial. This analysis allows for prediction of potential for trade where it does not yet occur, facilitating proactive prevention. Science , this issue p. 71"
https://openalex.org/W2979882137,"Accurate prediction of antigen presentation by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules would be valuable for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapies. Current computational methods trained on in vitro binding data are limited by insufficient training data and algorithmic constraints. Here we describe MARIA (major histocompatibility complex analysis with recurrent integrated architecture; https://maria.stanford.edu/ ), a multimodal recurrent neural network for predicting the likelihood of antigen presentation from a gene of interest in the context of specific HLA class II alleles. In addition to in vitro binding measurements, MARIA is trained on peptide HLA ligand sequences identified by mass spectrometry, expression levels of antigen genes and protease cleavage signatures. Because it leverages these diverse training data and our improved machine learning framework, MARIA (area under the curve = 0.89–0.92) outperformed existing methods in validation datasets. Across independent cancer neoantigen studies, peptides with high MARIA scores are more likely to elicit strong CD4+ T cell responses. MARIA allows identification of immunogenic epitopes in diverse cancers and autoimmune disease. A neural network trained on diverse datasets improves prediction of HLA class II epitope presentation."

Chen et al. studied tree species in a subtropical forest in China and found an important role for soil-dwelling fungi in this variation.

Inhibitors are effective against the mutant B-Raf, but, paradoxically, they activate wild-type B-Raf, limiting their therapeutic potential. Kondo et al. determined the structure of a phosphorylated B-Raf dimer in complex with the scaffold protein 14-3-3 by cryo–electron microscopy. Although both kinases are in the active conformation, one is blocked by the C-terminal tail of the other. This configuration inhibits one active site but also stabilizes the dimer in the active conformation. Understanding this mechanism provides a framework for development of inhibitors that do not activate wild-type Raf. Science , this issue p. 109"

Thus, independent of immune cells, SFB confer protection against certain enteric viral infections and associated diarrheal disease. Rotavirus (RV), a nonenveloped double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, remains a major world-wide scourge, causing life-threatening diarrhea in hundreds of thousands of children annually (Tate et al., 2016Tate J.E. Burton A.H. Boschi-Pinto C. Parashar U.D. World Health Organization–Coordinated Global Rotavirus Surveillance NetworkGlobal, Regional, and National Estimates of Rotavirus Mortality in Children <5 Years of Age, 2000-2013.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2016; 62: S96-S105Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). RV enters its host orally and primarily infects ileal villous epithelial cells, which exist amidst a large diverse ecosystem of microorganisms collectively called the gut microbiota (Boshuizen et al., 2003Boshuizen J.A. Reimerink J.H. Korteland-van Male A.M. van Ham V.J. Koopmans M.P. Büller H.A. Dekker J. Einerhand A.W. Changes in small intestinal homeostasis, morphology, and gene expression during rotavirus infection of infant mice.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13005-13016Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The gut microbiota protects against pathogenic bacteria. For example, antibiotic-treated hosts are highly prone to colonization and disease by bacterial pathogens (Ribet and Cossart, 2015Ribet D. Cossart P. How bacterial pathogens colonize their hosts and invade deeper tissues.Microbes Infect. 2015; 17: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Such colonization resistance is thought to reflect that specific families of bacteria prevent colonization by specific classes of pathogens (Kamada et al., 2013Kamada N. Chen G.Y. Inohara N. Núñez G. Control of pathogens and pathobionts by the gut microbiota.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extent to which the microbiota affects enteric viral infection is less clear. Ablation of the microbiota in mice via germ-free (GF) or antibiotic approaches impedes infection with mouse mammary tumor virus, poliovirus, reovirus, and RV (Kane et al., 2011Kane M. Case L.K. Kopaskie K. Kozlova A. MacDearmid C. Chervonsky A.V. Golovkina T.V.

However, administration of bacterial products, including LPS, CpG DNA, and flagellin, can protect against viral infection (Jørgensen et al., 2003Jørgensen J.B. Johansen L.H. Steiro K. Johansen A. CpG DNA induces protective antiviral immune responses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.).J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11471-11479Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2014Zhang B.

Prevention and cure of rotavirus infection via TLR5/NLRC4-mediated production of IL-22 and IL-18.Science. 2014; 346: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In particular, we discovered that flagellin induces TLR5-mediated innate lymphoid cell (ILC) interleukin-22 (IL-22) production and NLRC4-mediated IL-18 release, which prevents and cures RV infection (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang B. Chassaing B. Shi Z. Uchiyama R. Zhang Z. Denning T.L. Crawford S.E. Pruijssers A.J. Iskarpatyoti J.A. Estes M.K. et al.Viral infection.

Such protection is independent of adaptive immunity in that it is maintained in Rag1-knockout (KO) mice, which, like humans with severe immunodeficiencies, develop chronic RV infection (Bogaert et al., 2016Bogaert D.

Virol. 2019; 91: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When breeding Rag1-KO mice for our studies, we unintentionally developed a breeding colony of Rag1-KO mice that was highly resistant to RV infection. We hypothesized that these mice had acquired microbiota that resulted in ILC activation, which conferred resistance to RV. In fact, we found that their RV resistance was independent of ILCs, nor did it require interferon (IFN), which is critical for control of most viruses. Rather, their RV resistance was mediated by segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which altered both RV and the ileum in a manner that prevented or cured RV infection, suggesting a new mechanism by which the gut microbiota can improve health. RV primarily infects villus epithelial cells, causing severe diarrhea in young hosts and moderate distress in adults (Ramig, 2004Ramig R.F. Pathogenesis of intestinal and systemic rotavirus infection.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although RV is typically cleared within 10 days, immunodeficient humans and mice, including C57BL/6 Rag1-KO mice, develop chronic RV infection (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1987Riepenhoff-Talty M. Dharakul T. Kowalski E. Michalak S. Ogra P.L. Persistent rotavirus infection in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency.J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3345-3348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, Rag1-KO mice, purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), perpetually shed RV antigens into their feces following oral inoculation with RV, indicating chronic infection (Figure 1A). In contrast, Rag1-KO mice bred at Georgia State University (GSU) after being purchased from JAX did not shed RV antigens. We speculated that these mice had acquired microbiota that made them resistant to RV infection. A second colony of Rag1-KO mice, for which husbandry was performed by the authors of this study, using autoclaved food and water became chronically infected with RV when inoculated with this virus. We refer to such RV-susceptible Rag1-KO mice as “JAX-RAG” and the aforementioned RV-resistant Rag1-KO mice as “GSU-RAG.” Co-housing of JAX-RAG and GSU-RAG mice or orally administering GSU-RAG feces to JAX-RAG mice resulted in JAX-RAG mice acquiring RV resistance, implicating the gut microbiota (Figures 1B and 1C). To determine whether transmissible microbes were sufficient to yield RV resistance as opposed to requiring both resident and transferred species, we transplanted GSU-RAG fecal suspensions into GF Rag1-KO mice. GF Rag1-KO mice receiving JAX-RAG feces developed chronic RV infection, whereas GF Rag-1KO mice receiving GSU-RAG feces were fully resistant to RV (Figure 1D). Furthermore, administration of GSU-RAG feces, but not JAX-RAG feces, to JAX-RAG mice with established chronic RV infection resulted in cessation of RV antigen shedding, indicating cure of chronic RV infection (Figure 1E). Quantification of RV genomes in the ileum by PCR confirmed the absence of RV infection (Figure 1F). Infection of suckling RAG pups with RV results in watery diarrhea (Kuklin et al., 2000Kuklin N.A. Rott L. Darling J. Campbell J.J. Franco M. Feng N. Müller W. Wagner N. Altman J. Butcher E.C. Greenberg H.B. alpha(4)beta(7) independent pathway for CD8(+) T cell-mediated intestinal immunity to rotavirus.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RV-induced diarrhea was almost eliminated by GSU-RAG but not JAX-RAG feces (Figures 1G and 1H). Moreover, both control groups (i.e., PBS- and JAX-RAG feces-treated), but not the GSU-RAG feces-treated group, displayed RV antigen by immunostaining (Figure 1I), providing additional evidence that GSU-RAG feces prevented RV infection in a highly susceptible host. Thus, transmissible agents present in GSU-RAG feces protect against RV infection and its major associated disease. Regardless of husbandry procedures, wild-type (WT) C57 BL/6 mice bred at GSU remained prone to RV infection, suggesting that the protective agent in GSU-RAG mice was held in check by adaptive immunity. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether administration of GSU-RAG feces protected WT mice against RV infection. Administration of GSU-RAG feces to adult (8-week-old) WT mice 1 week before RV inoculation resulted in a marked reduction, albeit not complete absence, of RV infection relative to mice receiving JAX-RAG feces (Figure 2A). Analogous partial protection against RV infection and associated diarrhea was observed in neonate WT mice (Figures 2B and S1B). In accord with the notion that the transient nature of this protection reflected clearance of the protective agent, shortening the time from fecal transplant (FT) to RV administration from 7 days to 2 or 4 days markedly enhanced the level of protection (Figure 2C). Another factor influencing the extent of protection was age, in that 3-week-old WT mice appeared to be fully protected against RV administered 2–7 days post-FT (Figure 2D). Assay of serum anti-RV antibodies 14 days post-inoculation observed that, in WT FT recipients, lack of RV shedding correlated with lack of RV antibodies, providing further evidence that mice not shedding RV antigens had never been infected by this virus (Figures S1C and S1D). Analogous to studies in Rag1-KO mice, administering GSU-RAG but not JAX-RAG feces protected adult GF-WT mice from RV infection in both the C57BL/6 and Swiss-Webster genetic backgrounds, confirming that fecally transmissible microbes are sufficient to protect against RV (Figures 2E and S1A).Figure S1GSU Rag1-KO Mouse Fecal Microbiota Partially Protects GF Swiss-Webster Mice from RV Infection, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Two groups of GF Swiss-Webster mice groups received FT from JAX or GSU Rag1-KO mice.

We next investigated whether the capacity of GSU-RAG microbes to protect Rag1-KO mice against RV reflected absence of T and/or B lymphocytes. Mice deficient in T cell receptor β (TCRβKO), which lack conventional T cells, and μMT mice, which lack functional B cells, were administered JAX-RAG (control) or GSU-RAG feces and, 1 week later, orally inoculated with RV. Either humoral or cell-mediated immunity affords RV clearance (Corthésy et al., 2006Corthésy B. Benureau Y. Perrier C. Fourgeux C. Parez N. Greenberg H. Schwartz-Cornil I. Rotavirus anti-VP6 secretory immunoglobulin A contributes to protection via intracellular neutralization but not via immune exclusion.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10692-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Jaimes et al., 2005Jaimes M.C. Feng N. Greenberg H.B. Characterization of homologous and heterologous rotavirus-specific T-cell responses in infant and adult mice.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4568-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Accordingly, both TCRβKO and μMT mice administered control JAX-RAG feces exhibited a week-long course of RV infection (Figures 2F and 2G). In contrast, both strains of mice transplanted with GSU-RAG feces were protected against RV infection. This suggests that microbes in GSU-RAG feces that might otherwise protect against RV infection are normally constrained by a mechanism involving humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We next considered the possibility that JAX-RAG and GSU-RAG mice might display differences in intestinal leukocytes that mediated resistance to RV. Flow cytometry analysis of the lamina propria (LP) revealed elevated neutrophils in GSU-RAG mice (Figures S2A and S2B). However, neutrophil numbers did not change following FT, arguing against this parameter mediating RV resistance. Administering mice bacterial flagellin activates ILC production of IL-22, which impedes RV infection (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang B. Chassaing B. Shi Z. Uchiyama R. Zhang Z. Denning T.L. Crawford S.E. Pruijssers A.J. Iskarpatyoti J.A. Estes M.K. et al.Viral infection. Prevention and cure of rotavirus infection via TLR5/NLRC4-mediated production of IL-22 and IL-18.Science. 2014; 346: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that organisms present in the GSU-RAG microbiota might also activate IL-22 production, which would protect against RV infection. However, transplanting GSU-RAG feces into JAX-RAG mice did not increase IL-22 expression (Figure S2C), nor did such transfer result in elevations in IL-18, which acts in concert with IL-22 to prevent or cure RV infection in response to flagellin. Moreover, antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-22, which blocks flagellin’s protection against RV infection (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang B. Chassaing B. Shi Z. Uchiyama R. Zhang Z. Denning T.L. Crawford S.E. Pruijssers A.J. Iskarpatyoti J.A. Estes M.K. et al.Viral infection. Prevention and cure of rotavirus infection via TLR5/NLRC4-mediated production of IL-22 and IL-18.Science. 2014; 346: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), did not reduce RV resistance in GSU-RAG mice (Figure 2H). RV is relatively resistant to type I IFN (Barro and Patton, 2007Barro M. Patton J.T. Rotavirus NSP1 inhibits expression of type I interferon by antagonizing the function of interferon regulatory factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but constrained by type III IFN, also known as IFN-λ (Pott et al., 2011Pott J. Mahlakõiv T. Mordstein M. Duerr C.U. Michiels T. Stockinger S. Staeheli P. Hornef M.W. IFN-lambda determines the intestinal epithelial antiviral host defense.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7944-7949Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), which can provide sterilizing antiviral immunity in the absence of adaptive immunity (Nice et al., 2015Nice T.J. Baldridge M.T. McCune B.T. Norman J.M. Lazear H.M. Artyomov M. Diamond M.S. Virgin H.W. Interferon-λ cures persistent murine norovirus infection in the absence of adaptive immunity.Science. 2015; 347: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). IFN-λ and IL-22 have closely related receptors and cooperate in host defense against RV (Hernández et al., 2015Hernández P.P. Mahlakoiv T. Yang I. Schwierzeck V. Nguyen N. Guendel F. Gronke K. Ryffel B. Hoelscher C. Dumoutier L. et al.Interferon-λ and interleukin 22 act synergistically for the induction of interferon-stimulated genes and control of rotavirus infection.Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, even though transplanting GSU-RAG feces did not elicit IFN-λ expression (Figure S2C), we determined whether GSU feces could protect against or clear RV via a mechanism requiring IFN-λ. Antibody-mediated neutralization of IFN-λ, via an established protocol (Ferguson et al., 2019Ferguson S.H. Foster D.M. Sherry B. Magness S.T. Nielsen D.M. Gookin J.L. Interferon-λ3 Promotes Epithelial Defense and Barrier Function Against Cryptosporidium parvum Infection.Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 8: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) did not impair the capacity of GSU-RAG feces to prevent or treat RV infection (Figures 2I and 2J). As an alternate means of investigating a potential role of IFN-λ, we used mice with genetic ablations of both Rag1 and IFN-λ-receptor 1 (R1) that were established and maintained at Washington University (Wash-U). Interestingly, such Rag1/IFN-λ-R1-DKO mice (Baldridge et al., 2017Baldridge M.T. Lee S. Brown J.J. McAllister N. Urbanek K. Dermody T.S. Nice T.J. Virgin H.W. Expression of Ifnlr1 on Intestinal Epithelial Cells Is Critical to the Antiviral Effects of Interferon Lambda against Norovirus and Reovirus.J. Virol. 2017; 91 (e02079-16)Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as well as the control Rag1-KO mice bred in this vivarium, phenocopied GSU-RAG mice in that they were resistant to RV infection (Figure S2D). These results suggest that the tendency of Rag1-KO mice to acquire microbes that confer resistance to RV infection is not specific to GSU and, moreover, that such RV resistance is not mediated by IFN-λ. We also considered the possibility that GSU-RAG FT might elevate type II IFN expression, but our results did not support this possibility (Figure S2C). Although flagellin also increases ILC production of IL-17 (Van Maele et al., 2010Van Maele L. Carnoy C. Cayet D. Songhet P. Dumoutier L. Ferrero I. Janot L. Erard F. Bertout J. Leger H. et al.TLR5 signaling stimulates the innate production of IL-17 and IL-22 by CD3(neg)CD127+ immune cells in spleen and mucosa.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), neutralization of IL-17 did not reduce the resistance of GSU-RAG mice to RV infection (Figure 2K). Moreover, Rag1/IL2Rγ-DKO mice, which lack innate and adaptive lymphocytes, remained RV-resistant following administration of GSU-RAG feces, indicating lack of ILC involvement (Figure 2L). Last, we examined the capacity of LP cells from GSU-RAG mice to dampen RV infection in JAX-RAG mice chronically infected with RV. However, we found that transfer of these cells had no effect; only transfer of WT cells with a functional Rag-1 gene cleared RV infection (Figure S2E). We next examined whether GSU-RAG feces had the capacity to directly disable RV. Aliquots of cell culture-adapted RV, rhesus RV (RRV), were incubated at 37°C with 5-μm- or 0.2-μm-filtered feces from JAX-RAG or GSU-RAG mice (as discussed below, only the 5-μm-filtered feces can protect mice against RV). Four hours later, the RV microbiota suspensions were passed through 0.2-μm filters, and the RRV-containing filtrate adsorbed to HT-29 epithelial cells, which support RV replication. Twenty hours later, cells inoculated with RRV that had been pre-exposed to JAX-RAG feces expressed RRV antigen, as assessed by immunoblotting (Figure 3A) and cell death (Figure 3B), indicating productive infection. Pre-exposure to 5-μm-filtered but not 0.2-μm-filtered GSU-RAG feces reduced RV infection, with markedly lower levels of RV genomes (Figure 3C). In contrast, the JAX-RAG microbiota did not alter RRV infection in vitro (Figure S3A). These results suggest that microorganism(s) present in the GSU-RAG microbiota reduced RRV infectivity. Such a reduction correlated with reduced levels of RV attachment to epithelial cells, as determined by qRT-PCR of epithelial cells inoculated with RV at 4°C (Figure S3B). To investigate the nature of microbiota-mediated RV neutralization, we examined the relative effects of GSU-RAG and JAX-RAG feces on RV levels by qRT-PCR over time following incubation in feces, but we found that fecal samples from both types of mice moderately and similarly degraded RV genomes. Moreover, GSU-RAG and JAX-RAG feces did not differ significantly in the capacity to bind RV (Figures S3C and S3D). These results are in accord with the possibility that microbes present in GSU feces alter a surface component of RV in a manner that impedes initial interactions with epithelial cells.Figure S3The GSU-RAG Microbiota May Directly Interact with Viruses to Reduce Infectivity, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A-B) RRV viral particles were pre-incubated with 5μm filtered GF, JAX or GSU Rag1-KO mice fecal samples at 37°C for 4 hours.

To determine whether exposure to GSU-RAG feces diminishes infection of other viruses, we quantified viral loads in cultured cells inoculated with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or influenza A virus (A/WSN/1933 [H1N1]) reporter virus strains (Yan et al., 2015Yan D.

The capacity of GSU-RAG feces to suppress viral infection in vitro was not specific for RV but also extended to VSV and influenza A virus (IAV) (Figures 3D and 3E). We also tested whether the GSU-RAG microbiota alters infection with reovirus, which, like RV, replicates in the murine intestine. Reovirus (T1L strain) was incubated with 5-μm-filtered feces from JAX-RAG or GSU-RAG mice and orally inoculated into type I IFN receptor-deficient mice, which are highly susceptible to this virus. 100% of mice inoculated with JAX-RAG feces-treated reovirus died within 8 days of inoculation, whereas most mice inoculated with GSU-RAG feces-treated reovirus survived this period (Figure 3F). Moreover, transplanting GSU-RAG feces substantially reduced reovirus loads relative to mice transplanted with JAX-RAG feces, especially early after inoculation (Figure 3G). These results suggest that microbes in GSU-RAG feces may have broad antiviral activity. We next sought to define the protective component of GSU-RAG microbiota. We prepared frozen and thawed aliquots of pooled GSU-RAG feces that maintained the capacity to confer protection against RV infection (Figure 4A). Such aliquots were subjected to filtration, heating, and antimicrobial compounds. The protective agent passed through a 5-μm but not a 0.22-μm filter, withstood heating at 60°C but not 75°C (Figures 4A and 4B), and was inactivated ex vivo by a cocktail of antibacterial but not anti-fungal agents (Figure 4C). Individually, ampicillin, neomycin, and streptomycin, but not kanamycin, eliminated the capacity of GSU-RAG feces to confer RV resistance (Figure 4D). However, prolonged consumption of antibiotics by GSU-RAG mice did not render them susceptible to RV infection (Figure S4A). Together, these results suggest that GSU-RAG mice were protected from RV infection by heat-stable, possibly spore-forming, bacteria that are readily transmitted to immunodefic"

SETD1A is a confirmed SCZ risk gene, and SETD1A mutations confer a large increase in disease risk (Singh et al., 2016Singh T. Kurki M.I. Curtis D. Purcell S.M. Crooks L. McRae J. Suvisaari J. Chheda H. Blackwood D. Breen G. et al.Swedish Schizophrenia StudyINTERVAL StudyDDD StudyUK10 K ConsortiumRare loss-of-function variants in SETD1A are associated with schizophrenia and developmental disorders.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), thus providing an excellent genetic substrate for disease modeling. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mutant mice carrying a LoF allele in the endogenous Setd1a ortholog that models the various identified SETD1A SCZ LoF risk alleles to uncover the role of SETD1A in gene regulation, neuronal architecture, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral paradigms dependent on learning. We also used this mouse model to examine whether malfunction of neural circuits and neurocognitive deficits emerging due to Setd1a deficiency can be reversed by pharmacological interventions during adulthood, paving the way for the development of new therapeutics. Setd1a is expressed throughout the adult mouse brain, with higher expression in neocortex (Allen Brain Atlas; https://portal.brain-map.org/). Real-time qRT-PCR analysis on mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) detected Setd1a mRNA at various developmental stages (Figure S1A). Immunostaining of the prelimbic area in medial PFC of 6-week-old mice revealed that Setd1a-positive cells are distributed in all cortical layers except L1 and merge with neuronal nuclei (NeuN+) cells (Figure S1B). Setd1a protein exhibits mixtures of punctate and diffuse fibrillary nuclear staining in all NeuN+ neuron and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons (INs) in the medial PFC superficial layers but only a few small puncta in CNPase- (oligodendrocytes) and GFAP-positive (astrocytes) cells in the cortical plate and corpus callosum (Figure S1C). Setd1a localizes to euchromatin and does not overlap with heterochromatin regions in either NeuN+ or PV+ neurons (Figure S1C). We employed a mouse model carrying a Setd1a LoF allele (Figures S1D and S1E). Reduction of Setd1a RNA and protein levels to approximately half of wild-type (WT) levels was confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunoblots of adult frontal cortex (Figures S1F and S1G). Although Setd1a−/− is embryonic lethal (Bledau et al., 2014Bledau A.S. Schmidt K. Neumann K. Hill U. Ciotta G. Gupta A. Torres D.C. Fu J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Anastassiadis K. The H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1a is first required at the epiblast stage, whereas Setd1b becomes essential after gastrulation.Development. 2014; 141: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Setd1a+/− mice were indistinguishable from WT littermates in terms of body size, weight, and posture (not shown). Cognitive impairment is a core feature of SCZ (Barch and Ceaser, 2012Barch D.M. Ceaser A. Cognition in schizophrenia: core psychological and neural mechanisms.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Setd1a deficiency in mice affects performance in a variety of cognitive tasks. First, we established that Setd1a+/− mice show normal activity in the open-field assay (Figures S1H and S1I). We assessed spatial working memory (WM) performance using a T-maze delayed non-match to place (DNMTP) task. Setd1a+/− mice learned the task and performed almost as well as WT littermates during training (Figures 1A and 1B ). In the subsequent WM test, however, Setd1a+/− mice manifested a marked impairment (correct responses: 63.63% ± 3.03%, p = 0.0038 at 10 s; 64.58% ± 3.10%, p = 0.0172 at 30 s) compared to WT littermate controls (76.39% ± 2.68% at 10 s, 76.39% ± 3.38% at 30 s) (Figure 1C). In contrast, memory performance of Setd1a+/− mice was intact in a series of other cognitive tasks (Figures S1J–S1L). WM can be affected by the synaptic properties of PFC neurons (Barak and Tsodyks, 2014Barak O. Tsodyks M. Working models of working memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 25: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from L2 neurons to the apical and basal dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons (PNs) are critical for controlling the computations and output of L5 PNs (Quiquempoix et al., 2018Quiquempoix M. Fayad S.L. Boutourlinsky K. Leresche N. Lambert R.C. Bessaih T.

Loonis R. Kornblith S. Lundqvist M. Miller E.K. Laminar recordings in frontal cortex suggest distinct layers for maintenance and control of working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sci. 1995; 769: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We performed field recordings in brain slices to examine the synaptic properties in L5 neurons in response to the stimulation of L2. The input-output relation across experiments and the fiber volley amplitude was comparable between genotypes, indicating normal basic synaptic transmission (Figures S2A–S2C). To determine whether short-term synaptic plasticity was impaired we employed a paired-pulse ratio (PPR) protocol at various inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) as previously described for two other genetic models (Crabtree et al., 2017Crabtree G.W. Sun Z. Kvajo M. Broek J.A. Fénelon K. McKellar H. Xiao L. Xu B. Bahn S. O’Donnell J.M. Gogos J.A.

MacDermott A.B. et al.The pattern of cortical dysfunction in a mouse model of a schizophrenia-related microdeletion.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14825-14839Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At ISIs of less than 200 ms, both genotypes exhibited a significant facilitation, but Setd1a+/− mice showed overall significantly decreased PPR values (Figures 1G and S2J; N = 7, n = 23; Setd1A+/−, N = 7, n = 23; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.04), indicating an increased initial probability of presynaptic transmitter release. During PFC-dependent WM tasks, PFC neurons in local ensembles receive trains of inputs from neighboring cells in the 20- to 60-Hz frequency range (Miller et al., 1996Miller E.K. Erickson C.A. Desimone R. Neural mechanisms of visual working memory in prefrontal cortex of the macaque.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5154-5167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the effect of Setd1a deficiency on synaptic plasticity within this physiological frequency range by applying 40 stimuli at 5, 20, and 50 Hz. In response to these stimulus trains, a rapid depression of synaptic strength was observed in both genotypes (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Compared to WT mice, Setd1a+/− mice show significantly greater depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) responses at 5 Hz (Figures 1H and S2K; WT, N = 7, n = 23; Setd1a+/−, N = 7, n = 22; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.03) and 20 Hz (Figures 1H and S2K; WT, N = 7, n = 20; Setd1a+/−, N = 7, n = 19; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.04), but not at 50 Hz (Figures 1H and S2K; WT, N = 7, n = 18; Setd1A+/−, N = 7, n = 16; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.95). To determine the impact of Setd1a deficiency on the potentiation of synaptic efficacy of L5 cortical synapses, short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) were induced (Crabtree et al., 2017Crabtree G.W. Sun Z. Kvajo M. Broek J.A. Fénelon K. McKellar H. Xiao L. Xu B. Bahn S. O’Donnell J.M. Gogos J.A.

We also tested whether PFC neurons displayed alterations in intrinsic excitability. Neuronal excitability is known to critically regulate network information flow (Titley et al., 2017Titley H.K.

In contrast, we found the minimal current required for AP generation (rheobase) was unaltered (Figure S2E). Notably, neuronal input resistance, membrane time constant, and resting membrane potential were all found to be unaltered and thus did not underlie the observed enhanced neuronal excitability (Figures S2F–S2H). Both initial and terminal inter-spike intervals were significantly reduced (Figure S2M), while AP afterhyperpolarization was not altered (Figure S2N). Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies employing voltage steps revealed that Setd1a+/− mice displayed reduced outward currents near AP threshold voltages (−40 mV to −30 mV; Figures S2I and S2O). These reductions in hyperpolarizing currents may in part explain the enhanced AP generation. Adult 8-week-old Setd1a+/− mice manifest normal gross brain morphology and only a modestly diminished overall density of neurons (identified by their NeuN immunoreactivity) in L2/3 and L5. Quantitative analysis of different IN subpopulations identified by their immunohistochemical markers revealed a reduced number of PV+ INs in L5 and Reelin+ INs in L2/3 and L5 in the prelimbic area of medial PFC (Figures S3A–S3C, S3E, and S3H). The numbers of VIP- and SST-positive INs were unchanged (Figures S3D, S3G, S3F, and S3I). Further analysis (Figures S3J–S3M) showed that alterations in the laminar organization are, at least in part, due to alterations in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during corticogenesis (Bledau et al., 2014Bledau A.S. Schmidt K. Neumann K. Hill U. Ciotta G. Gupta A. Torres D.C. Fu J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Anastassiadis K. The H3K4 methyltransferase Setd1a is first required at the epiblast stage, whereas Setd1b becomes essential after gastrulation.Development. 2014; 141: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Alterations in the numbers of INs may also reflect homeostatic responses to altered circuit activity. We also investigated whether Setd1a deficiency affects development of cortical axons, dendrites, and spines. Plasmids encoding EGFP were electroporated in utero into the dorsolateral ventricular zone of the mouse forebrain at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), and embryos were allowed to be born and develop to postnatal day 8.5 (P8.5), when all cells labeled with EGFP completed their migration into L2/3. As shown previously (Mukai et al., 2015Mukai J. Tamura M. Fénelon K. Rosen A.M. Spellman T.J. Kang R. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gordon J.A. Gogos J.A. Molecular substrates of altered axonal growth and brain connectivity in a mouse model of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2015; 86: 680-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), callosal axons crossed the midline, coursed beneath the gray matter of the contralateral somatosensory cortex, penetrated the gray matter, and ascended to L1–L3 and 5 (Figures 2A and 2B ). The total number of callosal axon-terminal branches within the contralateral cortical L1–L4 was decreased by disruption of Setd1a (N = 10, n = 30), compared to WT brains (N = 10, n = 30, p < 0.0001) (Figures 2C and 2D). Notably secondary branch number was robustly decreased in Setd1a+/− brains (N = 10, n = 30) versus WT brains (N = 10, n = 30; p < 0.007) (Figures 2C and 2D). Similar deficits in axonal branching were observed in cortical primary cultures (Figures 2E–2I). We looked for deficits in dendrite and spine development in the basal dendrites of L5 neurons in the prelimbic area of medial PFC by intercrossing Setd1a+/− mice with a reporter Thy1-GFP/M line (Figure S3N). Setd1a+/− mice did not show a simplification in the dendritic arbors by Sholl analysis (Figures S3O–S3Q). Analysis of spines in 8-week-old mice showed that mushroom spine density was modestly reduced in the basal dendrites of L5 Setd1a+/− (N = 10, n = 20) compared to WT neurons (N = 10, n = 20, p < 0.002; Figures 2J and 2K). Mushroom spines showed a small decrease in the head width (N = 10, n = 605, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test p < 0.0001] and length (N = 10, n = 605, K-S test p < 0.02) in Setd1a+/− compared to WT neurons (N = 10, n = 644) (Figures 2L and 2M). Similar analysis at the basal dendrites of L2/3 neurons of Setd1a+/− (N = 7, n = 21) and WT littermates (N = 7, n = 21), labeled with EGFP via AAV2-Syn-EGFP virus injection into the prelimbic area of medial PFC revealed a modest reduction is mushroom spine density (p < 0.035; Figures 2N and 2O). Reduction in head width (N = 8, n = 373, K-S test p < 0.034), but not length (p = 0.259), was also observed in Setd1a+/− L2/3 neurons compared to WT neurons (N = 9, n = 379) (Figures 2P and 2Q). Given that Setd1a is a lysine methyltransferase that regulates transcription, we sought to identify direct genomic targets of Setd1a in the PFC by chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq; see STAR Methods). We performed ChIP-seq analysis in chromatin prepared from micro-dissected PFCs of 6-week-old mice for histone modifications that mark active promoters (H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac) and active or poised enhancers (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) using the same chromatin preparations. Using stringent criteria (irreproducibility discovery rate [IDR] < 0.02), we identified 25,658 Setd1a peaks genome-wide. Despite the fact that Setd1a mediates the trimethylation of H3K4 (Shilatifard, 2012Shilatifard A. The COMPASS family of histone H3K4 methylases: mechanisms of regulation in development and disease pathogenesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), only a minority (34%) of Setd1a peaks are located at promoter elements, as observed by the overlap of Setd1a with H3K4me3 peaks (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4A; Table S1). The majority of Setd1a peaks (66%) overlap with enhancer marks and not H3K4me3 (Figures 3B and S4A; Data S1). Further analysis of the genomic distribution of the non-promoter Setd1a peaks revealed that 45% reside within intergenic regions while 51% reside in intronic sites with enhancer-like chromatin properties (Figures 3B and S4A). A minority (4%) reside within exons, 3′ UTRs or within 1 kb from the transcription endpoint. To assess if Setd1a-bound regulatory elements have pan-neuronal or cortical-specific functions, we compared the H3K27ac ChIP-seq from the PFC with Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) H3K27ac ChIP-seq from the olfactory bulb (OB) and cerebellum (Shen et al., 2012Shen Y. Yue F. McCleary D.F. Ye Z. Edsall L. Kuan S. Wagner U. Dixon J. Lee L. Lobanenkov V.V. Ren B. A map of the cis-regulatory sequences in the mouse genome.Nature. 2012; 488: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Setd1a-bound PFC promoters, as a whole, have H3K27ac in the OB and less so in the cerebellum (Figure 3C). In contrast, the majority of the enhancer peaks (74%) are enriched for H3K27ac specifically in the PFC (Figures 3C), suggesting that cortex-specific transcription factors (TFs) recruit Setd1a at enhancers whereas more generally expressed TFs recruit Setd1a to promoters. De novo motif analysis of the Setd1a peaks using hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment (HOMER) revealed Mef2 consensus motifs as the most enriched DNA motif within the enhancer peaks (Figure 3D; Data S1) and Sp1 consensus motifs as the most enriched in the promoters (Figure 3D; Data S1). ChIP-seq experiments with an antibody that recognizes PFC-expressed Mef2a/c/d isoforms showed a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 targets specifically at enhancers, with 11,688 of the 16,889 Setd1a peaks being occupied by Mef2 (Figure 3E and S4B). CoIP experiments with nuclear extracts prepared from the cortical plate revealed an interaction between Setd1a and Mef2a/c (Figure 3F). To determine if this regulatory relationship is conserved across evolution, we examined the PhastCons conservation score in the Euarchontoglires clade of Setd1a-bound enhancers. This analysis revealed both conserved (∼46%) and nonconserved (∼54%) Setd1a targets. Among the former, we detected conservation of Mef2 binding sites, providing additional support for a role of Mef2 in Setd1a recruitment (Figures S4C and S4D). To investigate if the interaction between Setd1a and Mef2 is conserved in humans in disease-relevant brain areas, we mapped Setd1a peaks from the mouse genome (mm10) to the corresponding positions in the human genome (hg38), focusing in particular to PFC-specific bound regions. We mapped 3,813 mouse genomic regions (out of 12,499) to the human genome (Data S1). To enrich for functional elements, we explored the chromatin accessibility of these peaks in the human brain. We analyzed a previously published assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) dataset from 14 regions of human postmortem brains (Fullard et al., 2018Fullard J.F. Hauberg M.E. Bendl J. Egervari G. Cirnaru M.D. Reach S.M. Motl J. Ehrlich M.E. Hurd Y.L. Roussos P. An atlas of chromatin accessibility in the adult human brain.Genome Res. 2018; 28: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), focusing specifically on neuronal and non-neuronal cells of dorsal and ventral PFC, hippocampus, medial dorsal thalamus, and putamen. Of the 3,813 conserved human peaks, 1,765 encompass significant ATAC-seq peaks in at least one of the considered brain areas. Interestingly, these sites are accessible in neuronal cell types and not glia. Moreover, we found that a minority of peaks are accessible across all five regions of the brain (14%), while the majority are mostly accessible in cortical regions and hippocampus (86%) (Figure S4E). To investigate the functionality of these sites in human neurons, we performed motif analysis on the accessible conserved Setd1a regions with HOMER and identified MEF2 motifs as one of the most enriched motifs (p = 1e-41; Data S1). These data suggest that the role of Mef2 and Setd1a in transcriptional regulation is conserved between mouse and human and that intergenic Setd1a peaks likely originate from neuronal cortical populations (see also below). To elucidate whether Setd1a-dependent genome regulation in mice is linked to neuropsychiatric etiology, we determined more directly if conserved Setd1a genomic binding sites are enriched for genes and genomic intervals implicated in SCZ. We first performed an interval-based analysis to assess enrichment of Setd1a peaks of the 108 loci identified by an SCZ genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium., 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar). We focused only on PFC-specific enhancer peaks that are conserved and accessible in the human brain (see above). We applied a permutation test (N = 20,000 permutations) implemented in the RegioneR program and found a significant overlap (p = 0.0055, Z = 2.9) between these Setd1a peak intervals and the 108 SCZ-GWAS-associated intervals (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium., 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.Biological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar) (Figures 4A; Data S2). This was true specifically for intronic Setd1a peaks (see Figures S5A–S5D). To confirm the specificity of this finding, we conducted an identical analysis on data from other GWASs of CNS and non-CNS disea"

The KoRV-A gammaretrovirus infects the soma and germline and is sweeping through wild koalas by a combination of horizontal and vertical transfer, allowing direct analysis of retroviral invasion of the germline genome. Gammaretroviruses produce spliced Env mRNAs and unspliced transcripts encoding Gag, Pol, and the viral genome, but KoRV-A piRNAs are almost exclusively derived from unspliced genomic transcripts and are strongly sense-strand biased. Significantly, selective piRNA processing of unspliced proviral transcripts is conserved from insects to placental mammals. We speculate that bypassed splicing generates a conserved molecular pattern that directs proviral genomic transcripts to the piRNA biogenesis machinery and that this innate piRNA response suppresses transposition until antisense piRNAs are produced, establishing sequence-specific adaptive immunity."

Fast excitatory neurotransmission and its activity-dependent dynamics are fundamental for normal operation of the brain and rely on AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These ligand-gated ion channels mediate the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) required for propagation of the electrical signal and adapt their number in the postsynapse to the degree of synaptic activity (Bredt and Nicoll, 2003Bredt D.S.

Availability of AMPARs in either reserve pool ultimately depends on the assembly of functional receptor channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). AMPARs in the mammalian brain are macromolecular complexes whose subunit architecture, functional properties, and cell biology are defined by their interactome, the ensemble of their protein building blocks (Schwenk et al., 2012Schwenk J.

The resulting AMPAR assemblies subdivide into two mutually exclusive populations with preferential localization either to the plasma membrane or the ER (Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A. Buchert R.

Bole-Feysot C. et al.AMPA-receptor specific biogenesis complexes control synaptic transmission and intellectual ability.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A key component of the latter is the FRRS1l (aka C9orf4) protein, which, in complex with CPT1c (carnitine O-palmitoyl-transferase 1c), influences the biogenesis of AMPARs (Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A.

The importance of FRRS1l is illustrated by the consequences of several loss-of-function mutations, which, in humans, lead to severe intellectual disability with defects in learning and cognition (Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A.

The molecular mechanism(s) causing these profound impairments in brain function are not yet understood and neither are the processes controlling the assembly of functional AMPARs in the ER of native neurons in the mammalian brain (Greger and Esteban, 2007Greger I.H.

An overview of trafficking and assembly of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels (Review).Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we used the identified subset of ER-specific AMPAR interactors together with proteomics, biochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavioral analyses of wild-type and FRRS1l knockout mice to study the assembly of AMPAR complexes in their native environment and to analyze the impact of receptor biogenesis on synaptic transmission and plasticity. We have recently identified a subset of proteins within the AMPAR interactome, FRRS1l, CPT1c, Sac1, ABHDs 6 and 12 (α/β-hydrolase domain-containing), and porcupine (PORCN), that co-assemble with the pore-forming GluA1–4 subunits within the ER, but not at the plasma membrane(s) (Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A. Buchert R. Schwenk J. Boudkkazi S. Zolles G. Siquier-Pernet K. Schaber I. Bildl W. Saadi A. Bole-Feysot C. et al.AMPA-receptor specific biogenesis complexes control synaptic transmission and intellectual ability.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore used these proteins as markers in attempts to isolate membrane fraction(s) from the mouse brain that delineate the distinct GluA assembly intermediates forming in the ER during receptor biogenesis (Figure 1A). In a multistep fractionation combining differential and sucrose-gradient centrifugations of brain membranes after homogenization and hypotonic lysis (Figure S1A), we isolated a low-density fraction in which all markers were highly enriched together with the ER-resident calnexin (fraction A2.1; Figures 1B and S1). In contrast, only small amounts of the marker proteins were observed in the synaptic and/or synaptosomal fraction (fraction A1.3), in which the AMPAR core subunits GluA1–4, TARPs, and CNIHs showed strongest enrichment together with the synaptic markers GluN1, the major pore-forming subunit of NMDA receptors, and protein PSD95/DLG4 (Figures 1B and S1B). Accordingly, the entirety of AMPARs affinity isolated after solubilization from either membrane fraction with anti-GluA1-4 antibodies (ABs) exhibited largely different interactomes closely mirroring the two mutually exclusive populations of AMPARs reported previously (Figure 1C; Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A. Buchert R. Schwenk J. Boudkkazi S. Zolles G. Siquier-Pernet K. Schaber I. Bildl W. Saadi A. Bole-Feysot C. et al.AMPA-receptor specific biogenesis complexes control synaptic transmission and intellectual ability.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Further analysis of all fractions arising from our isolation protocol (Figure S1A) by high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) combined with compartment-specific marker proteins confirmed that the AMPAR assemblies in the “ER fraction” originated from ER membranes of the mouse brain (Figure S2). Next, we used the ER fraction to investigate size and composition of the AMPAR assemblies therein by protein separation on blue native gels (BN-PAGE) followed by denaturing SDS-PAGE and western probing. The results showed that the majority of all GluA1–4 proteins are incorporated into high-molecular-mass assemblies (∼0.7–1 MDa) together with FRRS1l, ABHD6, and/or CNIH-2 (Figure 1D, left line). In line with previous results from cultured neurons (Greger et al., 2003Greger I.H. Khatri L. Kong X. Ziff E.B. AMPA receptor tetramerization is mediated by Q/R editing.Neuron. 2003; 40: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), small amounts of GluAs appeared in the intermediate (∼0.4 MDa) and low (<0.2 MDa) molecular mass range, where they co-segregated with ABHD6 and FRRS1l or with sole ABHD6, respectively (Figure 1D, middle and right lines). These latter two assemblies were enhanced when we used the ER fraction of FRRS1l knockout mice as a source material (Figure 1E). Under these conditions, GluA1–4 proteins additionally focused at an apparent molecular mass consistent with GluA monomers, and the high-molecular-mass GluA assemblies were reduced to a population closely co-segregating with CNIH-2 (Figure 1E, right and left lines, respectively). Together, these results indicated that, in ER membranes, GluA1–4 proteins form different complexes with distinct molecular size and subunit composition and prompted the hypothesis of stepwise assembly of AMPARs assisted by distinct partner proteins. This hypothesis was further pursued in heterologous expression experiments that attempted to recapitulate the steps of neuronal receptor assembly described above in cultured tsA201 cells and Xenopus oocytes. In either system, (exogenous) proteins were intentionally overexpressed to override endogenous quality control mechanisms (Schwappach, 2008Schwappach B. An overview of trafficking and assembly of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels (Review).Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). First, we co-expressed GluAs 1 and 2, the most abundant pore combination in the rodent brain (Schwenk et al., 2014Schwenk J. Baehrens D. Haupt A. Bildl W. Boudkkazi S. Roeper J. Fakler B. Schulte U. Regional diversity and developmental dynamics of the AMPA-receptor proteome in the mammalian brain.Neuron. 2014; 84: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), either alone or together with ABHD6 and monitored both subunit assembly and formation of functional receptors by native PAGE combined with western blotting (cells) and electrophysiological recordings (oocytes). GluA1/2 co-expression resulted in robust glutamate-evoked currents, and the two GluA proteins co-assembled into complexes with an apparent molecular mass closely matching that expected for (hetero)-tetramers (Figure 2A, upper left and right panels; Schwenk et al., 2012Schwenk J. Harmel N. Brechet A. Zolles G. Berkefeld H. Müller C.S. Bildl W. Baehrens D. Hüber B. Kulik A. et al.High-resolution proteomics unravel architecture and molecular diversity of native AMPA receptor complexes.Neuron. 2012; 74: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Strikingly, addition of ABHD6 abolished tetramer formation by trapping both GluA1 and GluA2 in monomeric GluA-ABHD6 complexes (Figure 2A, left lower panel); concomitantly, no currents could be measured upon glutamate application (Figure 2A, right panel, red trace), while currents through voltage-gated K+ channels that do not interact with ABHD6 were unaffected by ABHD6 co-expression (Figure S3). Interestingly, monomeric GluA complexes were also observed in GluA1/2 transfections where they reflected co-assembly of exogenous GluA1/2 with tsA-endogenous ABHD6 (Figures 2A, upper left panel, and S4A); the amount of endogenous ABHD6, however, was not large enough to effectively prevent tetramer formation of the exogenous GluA proteins. In a second step, we additionally co-expressed FRRS1l and CPT1c (Figures S4B and S4C), as these proteins are able to form stable binary complexes (with each other) in the ER (Brechet et al., 2017Brechet A. Buchert R. Schwenk J. Boudkkazi S. Zolles G. Siquier-Pernet K. Schaber I. Bildl W. Saadi A. Bole-Feysot C. et al.AMPA-receptor specific biogenesis complexes control synaptic transmission and intellectual ability.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15910Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Addition of FRRS1l/CPT1c profoundly changed the assembly pattern on BN gels. FRRS1l/CPT1c co-expression released GluAs from the ABHD6-mediated monomeric state and, instead, promoted their assembly into dimers and tetramers (Figure 2B, left panel). This dimerization results from the particular binding characteristics of FRRS1l/CPT1c that effectively interacted with pairs of GluA-ABHD6, but not sole GluA-ABHD6 complexes (Figure 2B). As a result, dimer formation that also occurred in the absence of FRRS1l/CPT1c, albeit with low efficiency, is strengthened (Figure 2A, lower left panel). GluA dimers are subsequently assembled into tetramers, most likely as dimers of dimers, because trimeric GluA assemblies were never observed. The exact stoichiometries of FRRS1l/CPT1c and ABHD6 within GluA tetramers could not be resolved but appear to be variable, as indicated by the extension (0.8–1 MDa) of the western blot signal (Figure 2B). Despite triggering formation of GluA tetramers, FRRS1l/CPT1c failed to promote surface delivery of AMPARs, as no currents were recorded upon application of glutamate (Figure 2B, right panel, red trace). This changed when, in a third step, CNIH-2 was added. Co-expression of CNIH-2 resulted in robust glutamate-elicited currents, together with the appearance of AMPAR assemblies composed of GluA tetramers and CNIH-2 (Figure 2C). The latter were clearly discernable from FRRS1l/CPT1c/ABHD6-containing GluA assemblies due to their lower molecular mass, similar to the observations from brain ER (Figures 1D and 1E). Further experiments showed that TARP-2 replacing CNIH-2 was also able to promote surface delivery of AMPARs, although with somewhat lesser efficiency (Figure 2C, right panel). Together, these results indicated that functional AMPARs are assembled stepwise starting out from monomeric GluA-ABHD6 complexes. Effective formation of dimers and tetramers required association with FRRS1l/CPT1c, and delivery of functional receptors to the plasma membrane only occurred upon co-assembly of CNIH-2 or TARP-2 and dissociation of FRRS1l/CPT1c and ABHD6. Noteworthy, the effects of ABHD6 and FRRS1l/CPT1c did not require enzymatic activities, as experiments with the respective mutants yielded results identical to wild-type proteins (Figure S4D). Based on the central role of FRRS1l/CPT1c in controlling GluA oligomerization, we turned to FRRS1l-deficient mice for investigating the significance of biogenesis for signaling and dynamics of surface AMPARs in the context of the rodent brain. Quantitative assessment of the GluA1–4 proteins in unsolubilized membranes from whole brain(s) surprisingly indicated that removal of FRRS1l markedly reduced the amount of all four GluA proteins, totaling to a loss of ∼45% of all pore-forming AMPAR subunits (Figure 3A, upper panel). This reduction was specific, as other proteins present in brain membranes and synapses were not affected or appeared slightly increased (Figure 3A, lower panel). In addition, full proteomic analysis revealed several profound alterations in the AMPAR interactome induced by the homozygous knockout: (1) the binding of CPT1c to GluAs was abolished in line with common binding of FRRS1l and CPT1c to GluAs (Figures 1 and 2); (2) the majority of surface constituents, including GluAs, TARPs 3, 5, 7, and 8, CNIHs, GSG1l, Shisa 6 and 9, PRRT1, or LRRT4, were decreased by 30%–80% (Figures 3B and 3C) and TARPs 2 and 4 appeared unaltered or mildly reduced; (3) the ER constituents ABHDs 6 and 12 and PORCN were increased, reflecting the additional immature GluA assemblies seen in the ER fraction (Figure 1E); and (4) the smaller reduction determined for GluAs2–4 compared to GluA1 resulted from their increased amounts in the ER (Figure S5). Remarkably, all changes in the AMPAR interactome were restricted to the protein level, as steady-state mRNA levels encoding the respective constituents remained unaltered (Figure S6; see also Stewart et al., 2019Stewart M. Lau P. Banks G. Bains R.S. Castroflorio E. Oliver P.L. Dixon C.L. Kruer M.C. Kullmann D.M. Acevedo-Arozena A. et al.Loss of Frrs1l disrupts synaptic AMPA receptor function, and results in neurodevelopmental, motor, cognitive and electrographical abnormalities.Dis. Model. Mech. 2019; 12 (dmm036806)Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The impact of the profound changes obtained for surface AMPAR constituents was further pursued by investigating the distribution of AMPARs at the plasma membrane. Freeze-fracture replicas from hippocampal CA1 regions used for this purpose demonstrated markedly decreased numbers of AMPARs in synapses and on extra-synaptic sites of dendrites and/or dendritic shafts, where densities of immuno-gold particles labeling GluAs1–4 were reduced by about one- and two-thirds, respectively (Figure 4A). In addition, the knockout of FRRS1l altered the clustered appearance of AMPARs on dendritic membranes by decreasing their overall number but also the size of the clusters and the number of AMPARs per cluster (Figure 4A). The knockout-induced alterations of AMPAR numbers were closely recapitulated in patch-clamp recordings. Thus, patches excised from somata of FRRS1l−/− CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) showed a reduction in glutamate-elicited current amplitudes of 75% compared to patches from wild-type (WT) PCs (Figure 4B), and amplitudes of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSC"

Lord et al. created a switching system in bacteria based on stochastic competition between two proteins: one is a transcriptional repressor, and the other is an antagonist that binds the repressor and locks it in an inactive state. They show that this system controls switching of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis from a motile, unicellular state to an immobile, multicellular state, and that the control system is transferable to another distantly related bacterium.

https://openalex.org/W2977233715,"Perceptual decisions are often based on multiple sensory inputs whose reliabilities rapidly vary over time, yet little is known about how the brain integrates these inputs to optimize behavior. The optimal solution requires that neurons simply add their sensory inputs across time and modalities, as long as these inputs are encoded with an invariant linear probabilistic population code (ilPPC). While this theoretical possibility has been raised before, it has never been tested experimentally. Here, we report that neural activities in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of macaques performing a vestibular-visual multisensory decision-making task are indeed consistent with the ilPPC theory. More specifically, we found that LIP accumulates momentary evidence proportional to the visual speed and the absolute value of vestibular acceleration, two variables that are encoded with close approximations to ilPPCs in sensory areas. Together, these results provide a remarkably simple and biologically plausible solution to near-optimal multisensory decision making."

https://openalex.org/W2979347585,"Synthetic microbial consortia have an advantage over isogenic synthetic microbes because they can apportion biochemical and regulatory tasks among the strains. However, it is difficult to coordinate gene expression in spatially extended consortia because the range of signaling molecules is limited by diffusion. Here, we show that spatio-temporal coordination of gene expression can be achieved even when the spatial extent of the consortium is much greater than the diffusion distance of the signaling molecules. To do this, we examined the dynamics of a two-strain synthetic microbial consortium that generates coherent oscillations in small colonies. In large colonies, we find that temporally coordinated oscillations across the population depend on the presence of an intrinsic positive feedback loop that amplifies and propagates intercellular signals. These results demonstrate that synthetic multicellular systems can be engineered to exhibit coordinated gene expression using only transient, short-range coupling among constituent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2979813145,"Localized protein synthesis is fundamental for neuronal development, maintenance, and function. Transcriptomes in axons and soma are distinct, but the mechanisms governing the composition of axonal transcriptomes and their developmental regulation are only partially understood. We found that the binding motif for the RNA-binding proteins Pumilio 1 and 2 (Pum1 and Pum2) is underrepresented in transcriptomes of developing axons. Introduction of Pumilio-binding elements (PBEs) into mRNAs containing a β-actin zipcode prevented axonal localization and translation. Pum2 is restricted to the soma of developing neurons, and Pum2 knockdown or blocking its binding to mRNA caused the appearance and translation of PBE-containing mRNAs in axons. Pum2-deficient neurons exhibited axonal growth and branching defects in vivo and impaired axon regeneration in vitro. These results reveal that Pum2 shapes axonal transcriptomes by preventing the transport of PBE-containing mRNAs into axons, and they identify somatic mRNAs retention as a mechanism for the temporal control of intra-axonal protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2981181511,"Hanwoo, an important indigenous and popular breed of beef cattle in Korea, shows rapid growth and has high meat quality. Its yearling weight (YW) and carcass traits (backfat thickness, carcass weight- CW, eye muscle area, and marbling score) are economically important for selection of young and proven bulls. However, measuring carcass traits is difficult and expensive, and can only be performed postmortem. Genomic selection has become an appealing procedure for genetic evaluation of these traits (by inclusion of the genomic data) along with the possibility of multi-trait analysis. The aim of this study was to compare conventional best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) and single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) methods, using both single-trait (ST-BLUP, ST-ssGBLUP) and multi-trait (MT-BLUP, MT-ssGBLUP) models to investigate the improvement of breeding-value accuracy for carcass traits and YW. The data comprised of 15,279 phenotypic records for YW and 5,824 records for carcass traits, and 1,541 genotyped animals for 34,479 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Accuracy for each trait and model was estimated only for genotyped animals by five-fold cross-validation. ssGBLUP models (ST-ssGBLUP and MT-ssGBLUP) showed ~19% and ~36% greater accuracy than conventional BLUP models (ST-BLUP and MT-BLUP) for YW and carcass traits, respectively. Within ssGBLUP models, the accuracy of the genomically estimated breeding value for CW increased (19%) when ST-ssGBLUP was replaced with the MT-ssGBLUP model, as the inclusion of YW in the analysis led to a strong genetic correlation with CW (0.76). For backfat thickness, eye muscle area, and marbling score, ST- and MT-ssGBLUP models yielded similar accuracy. Thus, combining pedigree and genomic data via the ssGBLUP model may be a promising way to ensure acceptable accuracy of predictions, especially among young animals, for ongoing Hanwoo cattle breeding programs. MT-ssGBLUP is highly recommended when phenotypic records are limited for one of the two highly correlated genetic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2979536026,"Currently, influenza vaccine manufacturers need to produce 1–5 x 107 PFU of each vaccine strain to fill one dose of the current live-attenuated-influenza-vaccine (LAIV). To make a single dose of inactivated vaccine (15 ug of each hemagglutinin), the equivalent of 1010 PFU of each vaccine strains need to be grown. This high dose requirement is a major drawback for manufacturing as well as rapidly sourcing sufficient doses during a pandemic. Using our computer-aided vaccine platform Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE), we created a vaccine candidate against pandemic H1N1 A/CA/07/2009 (CodaVax-H1N1) with robust efficacy in mice and ferrets, and is protective at a much lower dose than the current LAIV. CodaVax-H1N1 is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (CA07) were “de-optimized” and a LAIV was generated ex silico using DNA synthesis. In DBA/2 mice, vaccination at a very low dose (100 or approximately 1 PFU) with CodaVax-H1N1 prevented disease after lethal challenge with wild-type H1N1. In BALB/c mice, as little as 103 PFU was protective against lethal challenge with mouse-adapted H1N1. In ferrets, CodaVax-H1N1 was more potent compared to currently licensed LAIV and still effective at a low dose of 103 PFU at preventing replication of challenge virus."
https://openalex.org/W2979670723,"Abstract The Hippo signaling pathway controls organ development and is also known, in cancer, to have a tumor suppressing role. Within the Hippo pathway, we here demonstrate, in human gliomas, a functional interaction of a transmembrane protein, prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1) with large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1). We show that PMEPA1 is upregulated in primary human gliomas. The PMEPA1 isoform PMEPA1a was predominantly expressed in glioma specimens and cell lines, and ectopic expression of the protein promoted glioma growth and invasion in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, PMEPA1a associated with the Hippo tumor suppressor kinase LATS1. This interaction led to a proteasomal degradation of LATS1 through recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4), which led to silencing of Hippo signaling. Alanine substitution in PMEPA1a at PY motifs resulted in failed LATS1 degradation. Targeting of a downstream component in the Hippo signaling pathway, YAP, with shRNA, interfered with the growth promoting activities of PMEPA1a in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the presented work shows that PMEPA1a contributes to glioma progression by a dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway and thus represents a promising target for the treatment of gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2979700094,"While staying in an animal shelter, cats may suffer from chronic stress which impairs their health and welfare. Providing opportunities to hide can significantly reduce behavioural stress in cats, but confirmation with physical parameters is needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of a hiding box on behavioural stress levels (scored by means of the Cat-Stress-Score) and a physical parameter, namely body weight, during the first 12 days in quarantine for cats newly arrived cats at a Dutch animal shelter. Twenty-three cats between 1 and 10 years of age were randomly divided between the experimental (N = 12) and control group (N = 11) with and without a hiding box. Stress levels were assessed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12 according to the non-invasive Cat-Stress-Score (CSS). Body weights were measured on days 0, 7 and 12. Finally, adoption rates and length of stay (LOS) were determined. Major findings of the study are: (1) the mean Cat-Stress-Score decreased with time for all cats, but cats with a hiding box showed a significant faster decrease in the CSS, reaching a lower CSS-steady state seven days earlier than the control group; (2) nearly all cats in both groups lost significant body weight during the first two weeks; (3) hiding boxes did not significantly influence weight loss; (4) no differences were found in the adoption rates and the LOS between both groups. Hiding enrichment reduces behavioural stress in shelter cats during quarantine situations and can therefore be a relatively simple aid to shelter adaptation. It offers no prevention however against feline weight loss, which indicates a serious health risk for shelter cats."
https://openalex.org/W2979807217,"Canonical Gremlin1 (GREM1) signaling involves binding to and sequestering bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the extracellular matrix, preventing the activation of cognate BMP receptor. Exquisite temporospatial control of the GREM1-BMP interaction is required during development, and perturbation of this balance leads to abnormal limb formation and defective kidney development. In addition to inhibition of BMP signaling, several other noncanonical signaling modalities of GREM1 have been postulated. Some literature reports have suggested that GREM1 can bind to and activate vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in endothelial cells, human kidney epithelial cells, and others. These reports suggest that the GREM1 → VEGFR2 signaling can drive angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We report here that, despite exhaustive attempts, we did not observe GREM1 activation of VEGFR2 in any of the cell lines reported by the above-mentioned studies. Incubation of endothelial colony–forming cells (ECFCs) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant VEGF triggered a robust increase in VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, no VEGFR2 phosphorylation was detected when cells were incubated with recombinant GREM1 over a range of time points and concentrations. We also show that GREM1 does not interfere with VEGF-mediated VEGFR2 activation, suggesting that GREM1 does not bind with any great affinity to VEGFR2. Measurements of ECFC barrier integrity revealed that VEGF induces barrier function disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification of the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells.

Measurements of ECFC barrier integrity revealed that VEGF induces barrier function disruption, but recombinant human GREM1 had no effect in this assay. We believe that these results provide an important clarification of the potential interaction between GREM1 and VEGFR2 in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2980101794,"Background Community healthcare workers (CHWs) play an important role in promoting HIV-care retention. Notwithstanding inconsistencies in the outcomes of CHW programmes, these programmes are known to have a positive effect on retention of mother-baby pairs in HIV-care in sub-Saharan Africa. Aim The aim of this analysis was to assess the effect of mothers2mothers (m2m) Ugandan Mentor Mother (MM) programme on the retention of mother-baby pairs in HIV-care. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data obtained from the m2m Uganda MM programme in nine East Central districts. The primary data was generated through a quasi-experimental study of women attending prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) clinics in Uganda between January 2011 and March 2014; where those who were enrolled at PMTCT sites with the MM intervention (n = 1161) were compared with those who received standard PMCTCT services without the MM intervention (n = 1143). Frequencies and descriptive statistics were calculated for categorical and continuous measures respectively. Risk factors for retention in care were determined by clustered generalised estimating equations and reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results Retention in the PMTCT cascade was significantly higher for mother-baby pairs in the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm across all measured time points (96.7% vs 65.8% at 6 weeks after birth, p<0.001; 81.5% vs 42% at 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding, p<0.001; and 71.2% vs 20.6% at 18 months after birth, p<0.001). Relative to the control group, women in the intervention group were less likely to be lost to follow up following treatment initiation (AOR 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.15). There was no difference in the proportion of the retained mother-baby pairs who received prescribed PMTCT interventions at different time points but a significantly higher number of mother-baby pairs in the intervention arm were retained at different time points. Conclusion HIV positive mothers and their HIV exposed children in the mothers2mothers Ugandan Mentor Mother programme had higher retention in HIV care at every step along the PMTCT cascade. We therefore recommend adoption of this peer-to-peer model in sub-Saharan Africa to complement retention in care strategies and health system interventions especially among priority and key populations."
https://openalex.org/W2980220155,"High levels of self-control are found to be associated with greater life satisfaction. To further understand this relationship, the current study examined two questions: (1) whether too much self-control reduces, rather than increases, life satisfaction, as argued by some scholars; and (2) whether engaging in prosocial behavior explains the ""self-control-life satisfaction"" link. To this end, we conducted survey research among adolescents (N = 1,009), university students (N = 2,620), and adult workers (N = 500). All participants answered the same self-control and life satisfaction measures, whereas prosocial behavior was assessed using different scales across samples. Results of two-line regressions failed to reveal significant inverted-U shaped association between self-control and life satisfaction across samples. Moreover, results of mediation analyses showed that across samples, high levels of self-control were related to greater life satisfaction and this association was partly mediated by prosocial behavior. In conclusion, there is no evidence showing that too much self-control impairs life satisfaction. Engaging in prosocial behavior partly explains how high self-control relates to greater well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2981058987,"Gastrointestinal (GI) problems give rise to 10 percent of initial patient visits to their physician. Although blockages and infections are easy to diagnose, more than half of GI disorders involve abnormal functioning of the GI tract, where diagnosis entails subjective symptom-based questionnaires or objective but invasive, intermittent procedures in specialized centers. Although common procedures capture motor aspects of gastric function, which do not correlate with symptoms or treatment response, recent findings with invasive electrical recordings show that spatiotemporal patterns of the gastric slow wave are associated with diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment response. We here consider developing non-invasive approaches to extract this information. Using CT scans from human subjects, we simulate normative and disordered gastric surface electrical activity along with associated abdominal activity. We employ Bayesian inference to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of estimating gastric surface activity from cutaneous recordings. We utilize a prior distribution on the spatiotemporal activity pertaining to sparsity in the number of wavefronts on the stomach surface, and smooth evolution of these wavefronts across time. We implement an efficient procedure to construct the Bayes optimal estimate and demonstrate its superiority compared to other commonly used inverse methods, for both normal and disordered gastric activity. Region-specific wave direction information is calculated and consistent with the simulated normative and disordered cases. We apply these methods to cutaneous multi-electrode recordings of two human subjects with the same clinical description of motor function, but different diagnosis of underlying cause. Our method finds statistically significant wave propagation in all stomach regions for both subjects, anterograde activity throughout for the subject with diabetic gastroparesis, and retrograde activity in some regions for the subject with idiopathic gastroparesis. These findings provide a further step towards towards non-invasive phenotyping of gastric function and indicate the long-term potential for enabling population health opportunities with objective GI assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4210280215,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and aberrant posttranslational modifications of APP can alter APP processing and increase Aβ generation. In the AD brain, seven different residues, including Ser-675 (APP695 numbering) in the APP cytoplasmic domain has been found to be phosphorylated. Here, we show that expression of a phosphomimetic variant of Ser-675 in APP (APP-S675E), in human neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells, reduces secretion of the soluble APP ectodomain (sAPPα), even though the total plasma membrane level of APP was unchanged compared with APP levels in cells expressing APPwt or APP-S675A. Moreover, the level of an alternative larger C-terminal fragment (CTF) increased in the APP-S675E cells, whereas the CTF form that was most abundant in cells expressing APPwt or APP-S675A decreased in the APP-S675E cells. Upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of the astacin metalloprotease meprin β, the levels of the alternative CTF decreased and the CTF ratio was restored back to APPwt levels. Our findings suggest that APP-Ser-675 phosphorylation alters the balance of APP processing, increasing meprin β-mediated and decreasing α-secretase-mediated processing of APP at the plasma membrane. As meprin β cleavage of APP has been shown to result in formation of highly aggregation-prone, truncated Aβ2-40/42 peptides, enhanced APP processing by this enzyme could contribute to AD pathology. We propose that it would be of interest to clarify in future studies how APP-Ser-675 phosphorylation promotes meprin β-mediated APP cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2980285554,"Unless they adapt, populations facing persistent stress are threatened by extinction. Theoretically, populations facing stress can react by either disruption (increasing trait variation and potentially generating new traits) or stabilization (decreasing trait variation). In the short term, stabilization is more economical, because it quickly transfers a large part of the population closer to a new ecological optimum. However, stabilization is deleterious in the face of persistently increasing stress, because it reduces variability and thus decreases the ability to react to further changes. Understanding how natural populations react to intensifying stress reaching terminal levels is key to assessing their resilience to environmental change such as that caused by global warming. Because extinctions are hard to predict, observational data on the adaptation of populations facing extinction are rare. Here, we make use of the glacial salinity rise in the Red Sea as a natural experiment allowing us to analyse the reaction of planktonic Foraminifera to stress escalation in the geological past. We analyse morphological trait state and variation in two species across a salinity rise leading to their local extinction. Trilobatus sacculifer reacted by stabilization in shape and size, detectable several thousand years prior to extinction. Orbulina universa reacted by trait divergence, but each of the two divergent populations remained stable or reacted by further stabilization. These observations indicate that the default reaction of the studied Foraminifera is stabilization, and that stress escalation did not lead to the emergence of adapted forms. An inherent inability to breach the global adaptive threshold would explain why communities of Foraminifera and other marine protists reacted to Quaternary climate change by tracking their zonally shifting environments. It also means that populations of marine plankton species adapted to response by migration will be at risk of extinction when exposed to stress outside of the adaptive range."
https://openalex.org/W2980663902,"In oncological drug development, animal studies continue to play a central role in which the volume of subcutaneous tumours is monitored to assess the efficacy of new drugs. The tumour volume is estimated by taking the volume to be that of a regular spheroid with the same dimensions. However, this method is subjective, insufficiently traceable, and is subject to error in the accuracy of volume estimates as tumours are frequently irregular.This paper reviews the standard technique for tumour volume assessment, calliper measurements, by conducting a statistical review of a large dataset consisting of 2,500 tumour volume measurements from 1,600 mice by multiple operators across 6 mouse strains and 20 tumour models. Additionally, we explore the impact of six different tumour morphologies on volume estimation and the detection of treatment effects using a computational tumour growth model. Finally, we propose an alternative method to callipers for estimating volume-BioVolumeTM, a 3D scanning technique. BioVolume simultaneously captures both stereo RGB (Red, Green and Blue) images from different light sources and infrared thermal images of the tumour in under a second. It then detects the tumour region automatically and estimates the tumour volume in under a minute. Furthermore, images can be processed in parallel within the cloud and so the time required to process multiple images is similar to that required for a single image. We present data of a pre-production unit test consisting of 297 scans from over 120 mice collected by four different operators.This work demonstrates that it is possible to record tumour measurements in a rapid minimally invasive, morphology-independent way, and with less human-bias compared to callipers, whilst also improving data traceability. Furthermore, the images collected by BioVolume may be useful, for example, as a source of biomarkers for animal welfare and secondary drug toxicity / efficacy."

Further studies indicated that the truncated product results from internal translation initiation (hereafter referred to as “internal initiation”) and not protease cleavage during E. coli expression (12Reddy P.T.

In E. coli, ATG (AUG in RNA) is the predominant translation initiation (“start”) codon and initiates ∼83% of open reading frames (ORFs) in the E. coli genome. Less frequently, other initiation codons are also used, including GTG (GUG) (14%) and TTG (UUG) (3%) (14Blattner F.R. Bloch 3rd, G. Plunkett C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J.

Although GTG and TTG encode valine and leucine, respectively, they can also function as start codons because they are capable of binding the anticodon of initiator tRNAfMet. Using N-terminal Edman sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis it was shown that the internal initiation site within the heavy chain of the eNISTmAb arises from a GTG codon (encoding Val214 in the full-length protein) (12Reddy P.T.

Canonical translation initiation complexes in E. coli form through the binding of a 30S ribosomal subunit to a ribosome-binding site on the mRNA ∼6–8 bases upstream of the start codon (15Laursen B.S.

This interaction is base pair (bp)-specific and identified in the mRNA and 16S rRNA as the Shine–Dalgarno (SD) sequence (AGGAGG) and the anti-SD sequence, respectively (17Shine J. Dalgarno L.

In the present study, the nucleotides of the DNA sequences surrounding the GTG internal initiation site from the eNISTmAb were systematically narrowed to produce a shortened mRNA that supports efficient internal translation initiation activity in the widely used E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. Detailed examination of the minimal sequence revealed the presence of a weak SD sequence. The sequence required for internal initiation was characterized using site-directed mutagenesis, computational mRNA 2D structure prediction, and antisense oligonucleotide translation inhibition. These findings were then extended to an additional E. coli–produced mAb, adalimumab, which contains the same amino acid sequence as the drug Humira. The implications of these results for E. coli heterologous protein expression and codon optimization are discussed. When the NISTmAb was expressed in SHuffle cells (eNISTmAb), a truncated product from the heavy chain was observed (Fig. 1, lane 1, marked by an asterisk) (12Reddy P.T. Brinson R.G. Hoopes J.T. McClung C. Ke N. Kashi L. Berkmen M. Kelman Z. Platform development for expression and purification of stable isotope labeled monoclonal antibodies in Escherichia coli.mAbs. 2018; 10 (10.1080/19420862.2018.1496879, 30060704): 992-1002PubMed Google Scholar). Using N-terminal Edman sequencing it was found that the N terminus of the truncated product starts at residue Val214 of the eNISTmAb heavy chain, where Val is replaced with an initiator Met (Fig. S1A). When the putative internal initiation codon GTG (Val) was mutated to GTT (Val), no truncated product could be observed (Fig. 1, lane 2) (12Reddy P.T. Brinson R.G. Hoopes J.T. McClung C. Ke N. Kashi L. Berkmen M. Kelman Z. Platform development for expression and purification of stable isotope labeled monoclonal antibodies in Escherichia coli.mAbs. 2018; 10 (10.1080/19420862.2018.1496879, 30060704): 992-1002PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of adalimumab in SHuffle E. coli yielded a similar truncated product (Fig. 1, lane 3, marked by an asterisk). N-terminal Edman sequencing of this truncated product revealed that the truncation starts at residue Val215 of the adalimumab heavy chain with the N terminus being an initiator Met (Fig. S1B). Additionally, as with the eNISTmAb, when the GTG codon was mutated to GTT no truncated heavy chain was observed (Fig. 1, lane 4). Aligning the amino acid and DNA sequences surrounding the GTG internal initiation site in the construct encoding adalimumab heavy chain to the corresponding eNISTmAb sequences revealed that the protein sequences encoded by the full-length regions are 98% identical (58 of 59 residues); however, the DNA sequences are less conserved, with only 78% identity (Fig. S2). The low DNA sequence identity between the constructs likely resulted from differences in the codon-optimization algorithms employed by the two gene synthesis companies that synthesized the ORFs by “back-translation” from the desired amino acid sequences. To identify the common mRNA sequence required for the internal initiation, the region upstream (85 nucleotides) and downstream (92 nucleotides) of the GTG codon in eNISTmAb was constructed in-frame with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter under the control of a T7 promoter and cloned into the pET-21a expression vector (Fig. S3). The construct was designed to ensure that only translation initiating from the GTG internal initiation site would result in GFP fluorescence when assayed (Figure 2, Figure 3). The reporter construct with GTG as the initiation codon resulted in appreciable fluorescence, whereas substituting GTG for any of the other three codons encoding Val (GTA, GTC, and GTT) abolished fluorescence (Fig. 3A). This observation was expected as the latter three codons are not known to serve as translation start sites. These results also demonstrate that no other in-frame initiation sites within the construct produce a fluorescent product. As an additional positive control, the universal initiation codon ATG was substituted for GTG. This construct resulted in a very strong fluorescence/optical density at 600 nm (OD600) value of ∼6-fold greater than the clone containing GTG. To test the possibility that a cryptic promoter leads to transcription of a truncated heavy chain mRNA with the GTG codon as the first functional start codon, a construct lacking the T7 promoter and containing the ATG initiation codon was generated, denoted as “ATG pro−” in Fig. 3. No fluorescence was observed with this construct transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Fig. 3A), and similar results were observed with SHuffle cells (data not shown). Taken together with Fig. 1 data, these results strongly suggest that the expression of the truncated heavy chain is generated by an internal initiation site. An orthogonal analysis of GFP expression from the NNN constructs was conducted via flow cytometry (Fig. 3B). Unlike bulk measurements of steady-state levels of GFP measured in a spectrophotometer, flow cytometry measures relative GFP expression at the single-cell level and reveals the population distribution of GFP expression that, in a minimally heterogeneous culture, should reflect the relative GFP expression measured in bulk. As expected, GFP median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the ATG population (19,737) was more than an order of magnitude greater than that of the GTG population (1,147), and other NNN constructs showed per-cell GFP MFIs comparable with both the ATG pro− construct and untransformed E. coli BL21(DE3). The “full-length” (−85, +93) ATG reporter construct provided a stronger signal than the GTG construct (Fig. 3); therefore, it was used as a template to generate deletion constructs with narrowed portions of the sequence flanking the start codon and to compare relative translation efficiencies (Fig. 4B, construct I). A construct lacking the promoter, ATG pro−, showed no fluorescence and was used as a negative control (Fig. 4B, construct II). The deletion mutant constructs were analyzed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the plate reader assay, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4. Deleting the entire region upstream of the ATG abolished GFP fluorescence (Fig. 4B, construct V), whereas deleting the entire region downstream of the ATG decreased GFP intensity to roughly 9% of the full-length construct (Fig. 4B, construct VII). This indicated that only the upstream nucleotides are required for translation initiation, whereas the downstream nucleotides contribute to the efficiency of translation initiation. Subsequent deletions to identify a minimal region that retains the full-length construct’s GFP expression resulted in a narrowed region of −40 to +27 (with respect to the first position of the start codon, Fig. 4B, construct IX), termed “ATG-Short.” A variant of the ATG-Short construct was generated substituting GTG as the start codon to determine its ability to support translation relative to its GTG full-length parent construct. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, both the ATG and GTG full-length variants support expression of the GFP and therefore internal initiation. However, both “short” constructs exhibited slightly lower GFP expression, which may be attributed to lessened efficiency of translation compared with the full-length constructs. No fluorescence could be observed when substituting GTC for ATG (Fig. 5, A and B). These results show that the ATG-Short and GTG-Short constructs (−40 to +27) support internal initiation from both ATG and GTG codons as demonstrated for the full-length constructs (Fig. 5). As discussed above, expressing adalimumab in E. coli yields a similar truncated heavy chain product where Val215 is replaced by an initiator Met in the truncated product. Constructs of the corresponding “ATG-full-length” (−85, +93) and ATG-Short (−40, +27) regions from the adalimumab heavy-chain ORF exhibited the same behavior as observed for eNISTmAb; however, the adalimumab constructs showed a larger difference in normalized fluorescence/OD600 between the full-length and short constructs initiating with ATG or GTG (Fig. 5D). The deletion analyses identified a short region flanking the internal initiation codon that retained ∼100% activity of the full-length construct. However, it was also found that deleting the entire downstream region did not completely abolish translation but rather reduced it by about 90% when the entire upstream region was included (Fig. 4B, construct VII) and by about 95% when a minimal upstream region was included (Fig. 4B, construct X). This decrease may be attributed to the presence of a hairpin loop secondary structure with a 6-bp stem adjacent to the initiation region formed from the GFP mRNA (Fig. S4, highlighted green sequence). Therefore, to achieve maximum fluorescence signal and report on translation initiation from the eNISTmAb without possible interference from GFP mRNA secondary structure, the ATG-Short construct was used for the remainder of the study (Fig. 4B, construct IX). Examination of the region upstream of the internal initiation codon in eNISTmAb identified a sequence, GAG (Fig. 6A, highlighted yellow), located 10 bases upstream of the initiation codon that partially complements the 16S rRNA anti-SD. Further upstream of this putative weak SD, the mRNA contains an A/U-rich region (Fig. 6A, highlighted pink). This A/U-rich region could be involved in binding ribosomal protein S1. The S1 protein is known to contain a RNA-binding domain, have higher affinity for U- and A/U-rich tracts (22Hajnsdorf E. Boni I.V. Multiple activities of RNA-binding proteins S1 and Hfq.Biochimie. 2012; 94 (10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.010, 22370051): 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and has been shown to support translation of E. coli transcripts with weak, too strong, or absent SD sequences (23Sørensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. Ribosomal protein S1 is required for translation of most, if not all, natural mRNAs in Escherichia coli in vivo.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280 (10.1006/jmbi.1998.1909, 9677288): 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Komarova A.V. Tchufistova L.S. Supina E.V. Boni I.V. Protein S1 counteracts the inhibitory effect of the extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence on translation.RNA. 2002; 8 (10.1017/S1355838202029990, 12358433): 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two motifs (SD and A/U) are required for translation initiation, each was targeted for site-directed mutagenesis using the eNISTmAb ATG-Short construct (Figure 4, Figure 5) as a template. The SD mutation changed the putative weak SD sequence, GAG, to its complement, CTC, which greatly diminished GFP expression with respect to the parent ATG-Short construct (Fig. 6B). The A/U mutation changed the A/U-rich tract TTAATCATAAA to TCAACCACAAG and substantially reduced GFP expression (Fig. 6B), although to a lesser extent than did the SD mutation. The A/U-rich region identified upstream of the weak SD sequence may participate in recruiting ribosomal protein S1 and was predicted to form a single-stranded RNA loop atop a low-energy helix including the SD and initiation codon (Figs. 7A and S4A). To complement the mutation analysis shown in Fig. 6, the region was targeted for in vitro translation inhibition with an antisense oligonucleotide as described in “Experimental procedures” and schematically shown in Fig. 7B. Two additional RNA oligonucleotides were tested alongside the antisense oligonucleotide to serve as controls, and fluorescence values over time were compared with a reaction containing no RNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 7C). The data suggest that the A/U-rich region in single-stranded form plays a role in translation initiation, as fluorescence is reduced about 20-fold upon complementation with the “antisense” oligo compared with “sense,” “random,” and no-oligo-control reactions. This observation gives credence to the implication that the A/U-rich region improves translation initiation and may need to be single-stranded for the recruitment of the ribosomal S1 protein. Monoclonal antibodies are the largest sector of the biopharmaceutical industry and growing in market share. Although most therapeutic antibodies are produced in mammalian cells, recent approaches for the expression of antibodies in E. coli have been reported. These methods were developed to produce proteins for both biophysical studies (12Reddy P.T. Brinson R.G. Hoopes J.T. McClung C. Ke N. Kashi L. Berkmen M. Kelman Z. Platform development for expression and purification of stable isotope labeled monoclonal antibodies in Escherichia coli.mAbs. 2018; 10 (10.1080/19420862.2018.1496879, 30060704): 992-1002PubMed Google Scholar) and the production of therapeutic drugs (9Ferrara N.

Improvements to mAb expression systems will be required for the number of mAbs produced in E. coli to increase in the future. In the present study, the SHuffle E. coli strain and codon-optimized constructs allowed for the heterologous expression of two humanized mAbs: the eNISTmAb, generated against respiratory syncytial virus, and adalimumab (the amino acid sequence of the drug Humira), generated against tumor necrosis factor-α. When these mAbs were expressed in E. coli SHuffle, a truncated variant of the heavy chain was observed in addition to the full-length heavy-chain product. This truncated product was the result of internal translation initiation. These results highlight a current limitation of the codon-optimization algorithms employed by two gene synthesis companies: avoidance of internal translation initiation sites. Codon optimization is routinely performed on coding DNA sequences for heterologous expression to account for variation in codon usage and tRNA abundances across different organisms (24Komarova A.V. Tchufistova L.S. Supina E.V. Boni I.V. Protein S1 counteracts the inhibitory effect of the extended Shine-Dalgarno sequence on translation.RNA. 2002; 8 (10.1017/S1355838202029990, 12358433): 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Codon optimization can inadvertently generate ribosome-binding sites and translation start sites, resulting in the formation of truncated products. Importantly, this phenomenon was predicted to be more likely when a coding sequence of eukaryotic origin is used heterologously in E. coli (25Whitaker W.R. Lee H. Arkin A.P. Dueber J.E. Avoidance of truncated proteins from unintended ribosome binding sites within heterologous protein coding sequences.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4 (10.1021/sb500003x, 24931615): 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that mutation of start codons and SD sequences within a gene can effectively eliminate these internal initiation sites (25Whitaker W.R. Lee H. Arkin A.P. Dueber J.E. Avoidance of truncated proteins from unintended ribosome binding sites within heterologous protein coding sequences.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4 (10.1021/sb500003x, 24931615): 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Jennings M.J. Barrios A.F. Tan S.

Purif. 2016; 121 (10.1016/j.pep.2015.12.001, 26739786): 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the phenomenon is not specific to the genes encoding the heavy chains of mAbs, and it is likely that other observations of truncated products during the expression of heterologous genes in E. coli were incorrectly attributed to in vivo degradation or degradation during purification (for example, see Ref. 27Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. A unique organization of the protein subunits of the DNA polymerase clamp loader in the archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH.J. Biol.

The data presented here illustrate that a GTG codon encoding Val within heavy-chain mAb genes serves as an internal translation initiation site, leading to truncated products. It is likely that this phenomenon is not unique to mAb heavy chains but may also occur in other proteins expressed in E. coli. It is clear that the presence of GTG is not sufficient for translation initiation, and moreover the RNA sequences and/or secondary structures play a role. The results of this study suggest that when mAb genes are designed for protein expression in E. coli, a GTG codon for the Val analogous to Val214 in the eNISTmAb (Val215 in adalimumab) should be avoided. Although GTG represents ∼37% of the Val codons in the E. coli ORFs, the other Val codons (GTA, GTC, and GTT) appear in significant abundance (see Fig. 8 fo"

Kidney transplant recipients must take an active part in their health following the transplantation, since a new organ requires new medication and focus on lifestyle to prevent side-effects and signs of organ rejection. Consequently, it is of major clinical relevance to explore how kidney transplant recipients understand and relate to health literacy. Ten kidney transplant recipients were interviewed at three weeks and again at six months post-transplantation. Design and analysis were inspired by constructivist grounded theory. The results of the study are presented through a model consisting of three phases: the trigger phase, the information phase, and the response phase. The participants were influenced by context and personal factors as they moved between three phases, as information seekers, recipients, and sharers. This study illustrates health literacy as an active process. It gives new insight into what motivates kidney recipients to find, share, and receive information, and how a hierarchy of resources is built and used."

Here we report that vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibition differentially affects regulation of AMPK in tumor and nontumor cells and that this differential regulation contributes to the selectivity of V-ATPase inhibitors for tumor cells. In nonmalignant cells, the V-ATPase inhibitor archazolid increased phosphorylation and lysosomal localization of AMPK. We noted that AMPK localization has a prosurvival role, as AMPK silencing decreased cellular growth rates. In contrast, in cancer cells, we found that AMPK is constitutively active and that archazolid does not affect its phosphorylation and localization. Moreover, V-ATPase–independent AMPK induction in tumor cells protected them from archazolid-induced cytotoxicity, further underlining the role of AMPK as a prosurvival mediator. These observations indicate that AMPK regulation is uncoupled from V-ATPase activity in cancer cells and that this makes them more susceptible to cell death induction by V-ATPase inhibitors. In both tumor and healthy cells, V-ATPase inhibition induced a distinct metabolic regulatory cascade downstream of AMPK, affecting ATP and NADPH levels, glucose uptake, and reactive oxygen species production. We could attribute the prosurvival effects to AMPK's ability to maintain redox homeostasis by inhibiting reactive oxygen species production and maintaining NADPH levels.

In the 1920s Otto Warburg discovered that tumor cells have an altered metabolism by using glycolysis as the main energy source even in the presence of oxygen, called aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Since then, many modifications in oncogenes and tumor suppressors, like HIF1α, Akt, Ras, and p53, have been directly connected to regulation of the expression and activity of important components of tumor metabolism, presenting tumor metabolism as one hallmark of cancer (1Pavlova N.N. Thompson C.B. The emerging hallmarks of cancer metabolism.Cell Metab. 2016; 23 (26771115): 27-4710.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). Despite ongoing research to identify the different aspects of cancer metabolism, the metabolic alterations that are critical for tumor progression remain largely unknown. Recently, the highly conserved energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2The abbreviations used are: AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseV-ATPasevacuolar H+-ATPaseACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseROSreactive oxygen speciesarcharchazolidAICAR5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. came into focus as a metabolic hub regulating many different pathways involved in tumor metabolism. It belongs to a family of serine/threonine kinases and consists of a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (2Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J. Chen Z.P. Murthy S. Walter M. Gupta A.

Trans. 2003; 31 (12546677): 162-16810.1042/bst0310162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK is activated by a variety of metabolic or oncogenic stress conditions, like nutrient starvation or hypoxia, and directs the cell toward metabolic changes that produce ATP and restore energy homeostasis (3Hardie D.G. Ross F.A. Hawley S.A. AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol.

By sensing the AMP:ATP ratio, it can increase catabolic processes that generate ATP, like fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis, and inhibit anabolic processes that consume ATP, such as protein and lipid synthesis. Based on the finding that LKB1, the upstream kinase activating AMPK, is frequently inactivated in tumor cells, AMPK has historically been proposed as a tumor suppressor. This assumption was confirmed by showing that genetic loss of AMPK accelerates tumor growth in an experimental model of lymphangioma and by the fact that pharmacological activation of AMPK leads to growth inhibition of several tumor cell lines (4Zakikhani M.

V-ATPase is a highly conserved multisubunit proton pump located at endolysosomal membranes of most eukaryotic cells. It is responsible for maintaining pH homeostasis and essential for intracellular trafficking and receptor recycling (9Hinton A. Sennoune S.R. Bond S. Fang M. Reuveni M. Sahagian G.G. Jay D.

It has been introduced as a promising antitumor target, as inhibition of V-ATPase by several drugs, like concanamycin or the myxobacterial compound archazolid, leads to apoptosis induction, inhibition of migration, and invasion in a variety of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo without affecting nonmalignant cells (10Wiedmann R.M. von Schwarzenberg K.

Furthermore, it has also been revealed that V-ATPase has additional functions besides regulating pH and endocytosis. Apart from being involved in AMPK regulation, it has been shown to play a role in mTOR-mediated amino acid sensing and lead to induction of glycolysis (12Zoncu R. Bar-Peled L. Efeyan A. Wang S.

The important role of V-ATPase in AMPK homeostasis and the controversial discussion of AMPK activity in the tumor context prompted us to investigate in detail the connection of V-ATPase inhibition and AMPK activation in tumor cell survival. In this study, we used archazolid as a highly potent tool to specifically block V-ATPase and found a differential effect on AMPK activation in tumor and nontumor cells that results in different metabolic regulation and sensitivity to apoptosis induction. In nontumor cells, AMPK is mostly inactive. Treatment with archazolid, however, led to profound activation of AMPK with a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by the drug. Tumor cells, on the contrary, showed constitutive activation of AMPK irrespective of archazolid treatment, but V-ATPase–independent activation of AMPK also protected from apoptosis induction. We propose that AMPK regulation in tumor cells is uncoupled from V-ATPase function, depriving them of AMPK-mediated protection and rendering them more sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by V-ATPase inhibitors. Hence, distinct AMPK regulation in cancer and nonmalignant cells accounts for the tumor cell specificity of V-ATPase inhibitors. To test whether inhibition of V-ATPase leads to AMPK activation, we treated different tumor (MDA-MB-231, MCF7, T24, and HUH7) and nontumor (HEK293, MCF10A, and HMLE) cells with archazolid and analyzed phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172. We found that all tumor cells had constitutively activated AMPK and that archazolid had no effect on the activation level (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Astonishingly, however, V-ATPase inhibition led to profound activation of AMPK in all nontumor cells, which typically showed low basal AMPK activation (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). To test whether this effect is specific for V-ATPase inhibition or a general stress-induced effect, we starved the cells of glucose and subsequently analyzed AMPK activation. As shown in Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C, there was activation of AMPK in all tested cell lines and no difference between tumor and nontumor cells. These results suggest that the differential effect seen on AMPK phosphorylation is not induced by a general stress response but specific for V-ATPase inhibition. To further confirm archazolid-induced AMPK activation, we analyzed phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). As a downstream target of AMPK, ACC is a good marker for AMPK activity. Here we could show the same effect as with AMPK: activation in nontumor HEK293 cells and no change in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S2). To make sure that V-ATPase was inhibited in all cell lines to the same extent, we used a pH-sensitive Lysotracker and could see a similar effect with archazolid treatment (Fig. S3). To further analyze AMPK status in tumor and nontumor tissue, we used patient-derived breast tumor samples and normal breast tissue from the same patients, respectively, and analyzed the activity of AMPK via Western blotting. Interestingly, we found that tumor cells had an increased level of total AMPK and also a slightly higher level of phosphorylated AMPK (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1D), indicating that AMPK activation is beneficial for cancer cells. It is known that V-ATPase interacts with the scaffolding protein AXIN1 in nontumor cells starved of glucose at the lysosome and that this interaction is required to activate AMPK (8Zhang C.S.

Therefore, we tested whether archazolid leads to interaction of V-ATPase and AXIN1 in tumor cells. We found that treatment with archazolid leads to increased interaction of AXIN1 and V-ATPase in the nontumor cell line HEK293 but not in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2A). A similar effect could be shown for colocalization of AXIN1 and lysosomes (Fig. S4). Furthermore, using lysosomal fractionation, we could show that AMPK is increasingly located at the lysosome in archazolid-treated HEK293 cells but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2B). For AMPK activation, it is essential that LKB1 is also located at the lysosome. Finally, we found that archazolid leads to transfer of LKB1 to the lysosome in HEK293 cells, in contrast to tumor cells, where no difference between treated and nontreated cells could be observed, as shown by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C). These results further suggest that there is a difference in AMPK activation by V-ATPase inhibition in tumor and nontumor cells. AMPK is activated because of an increased ratio of AMP:ATP. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of V-ATPase inhibition on ATP content. We found that tumor cells were only slightly affected, but the nontumor cell lines HEK293 and MCF10A showed a significant reduction in ATP levels after archazolid treatment, as shown by a luminescence assay (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, classical AMPK activation is induced by an increased level of AMP. Therefore, we analyzed changes in AMP by HPLC (Fig. S5). Interestingly, we could not find a clear increase in either nontumor HEK293 cells or in MDA-MB-231 cells, which might indicate a different activation mode by V-ATPase inhibition. However, we found increased glucose uptake and slight but nonsignificant up-regulation of glucose receptor 1 (GLUT1) in HEK293 cells, which can be a consequence of AMPK activation. In contrast, the tumor cell lines showed only a slight effect (MDA-MB-231) or even a decrease (MCF7) in glucose uptake (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating distinct metabolic regulation of tumor and nontumor cells by V-ATPase inhibition. As AMPK activation is quite controversially discussed as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene, we analyzed whether archazolid-induced AMPK phosphorylation is prosurvival or proapoptotic. Therefore, we silenced AMPK in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4B) and treated the cells with archazolid. We found that HEK293 cells with silenced AMPK had a decreased growth rate after archazolid treatment compared with control cells (Fig. 4A), which suggests a protective role for AMPK activity. If AMPK activation protects cells from archazolid induced cytotoxicity, then further inducing AMPK in tumor cells should decrease archazolid-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with the AMP analog AICAR in combination with archazolid, which increased phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 4C and Fig. S6A). Interestingly, we found that apoptosis induction was significantly reduced by combining archazolid with AICAR compared with archazolid-treated cells alone (Fig. 4D). This was accompanied by decreased cleavage of PARP-1, confirming decreased apoptosis induction and a protective role for AMPK (Fig. 4E and Fig. S6B). To confirm that this effect is really AMPK-dependent, we repeated the experiment with silenced AMPKα1 and found that AICAR does not protect MDA-MB-231 cells from archazolid-induced apoptosis, confirming the protective role of AMPK (Fig. 4F and Fig. S6C). As one known prosurvival role of AMPK is the control of redox homeostasis by preventing ROS accumulation and maintaining NADPH levels, we analyzed whether archazolid treatment leads to disturbance of redox homeostasis. As shown in Fig. 5A, V-ATPase inhibition led to induction of ROS in tumor cells but a decrease in ROS in nontumor cells. Furthermore, archazolid led to an increase in the NADPH/NADP ratio in HEK293 cells, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells showed a decreased ratio (Fig. 5B), suggesting a disturbed redox balance in tumor cells. Activation of AMPK keeps the redox balance by decreasing fatty acid synthesis (7Jeon S.M. Chandel N.S. Hay N. AMPK regulates NADPH homeostasis to promote tumour cell survival during energy stress.Nature. 2012; 485 (22660331): 661-66510.1038/nature11066Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the transcription of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and Steaoryl-CoA-Desaturase 1 (SCD1), two major players in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, in tumor and nontumor cells. Interestingly, we found that archazolid treatment led to strong up-regulation of both enzymes in tumor cells but not in nontumor cells (Fig. 5C). To connect these effects to the prosurvival effect of AMPK, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with the ROS scavenger tiron and analyzed apoptosis induction (Fig. 5D). We found that combination of archazolid with tiron decreased apoptosis induction. Further supporting this hypothesis is that the combination of AICAR and archazolid decreases ROS production in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5E). Finally, silencing AMPK in HEK293 cells led to up-regulation of ROS after archazolid treatment, confirming that AMPK activation is responsible for protection from ROS-induced apoptosis via V-ATPase inhibition (Fig. 5F). This work provides evidence that V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid leads to differential metabolic regulation in tumor and nontumor cells, which results in increased sensitivity of tumor cells to the treatment. Our major findings are that V-ATPase inhibition leads to AMPK activation only in healthy cells, which protects them from archazolid-induced cytotoxicity. In tumor cells, as depicted in Fig. 6, this protection is missing, which results in increased apoptosis induction caused by a distinct effect on the downstream AMPK cascade, including ATP, glucose uptake, NADPH level, and ROS production. As these effects could be abrogated by activating AMPK in tumor cells independent of V-ATPase, a novel role of AMPK in V-ATPase inhibition–induced cytotoxicity was unraveled. This provides new and interesting insights into the regulation of stress responses in different cell types and a better understanding of the mechanism of action of V-ATPase inhibition regarding metabolism. One major problem in cancer therapy is to find compounds that specifically target cancer cells and leave nonmalignant cells unaffected, minimizing toxic side effects and making chemotherapy more bearable for cancer patients. Intensive research has led to the introduction of several compounds that target, e.g., growth factor receptors that are overexpressed in tumors, like cetuximab (EGF-receptor) (14Troiani T.

Despite the success experienced with these compounds, selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents is still a major challenge. V-ATPase is a promising antitumor target, and its inhibition has been shown to have a pronounced effect on tumor cells but leave nontumor cells almost unaffected, as we and others have shown (11von Schwarzenberg K.

We even introduced more tumor and nontumor cells lines to prove a clear difference in sensitivity toward V-ATPase inhibition in tumor versus nontumor cells (Fig. S7). The antitumor effect of V-ATPase inhibition was mostly attributed to disturbance of endocytotic recycling processes, and several publications by our group and others elucidated several underlying mechanisms (11von Schwarzenberg K.

In recent years, however, it became obvious that V-ATPase also plays a pivotal role in nutrient sensing. Zoncu et al. (12Zoncu R. Bar-Peled L. Efeyan A. Wang S. Sancak Y. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 senses lysosomal amino acids through an inside-out mechanism that requires the vacuolar H+-ATPase.Science. 2011; 334 (22053050): 678-68310.1126/science.1207056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) showed that V-ATPase is required for mTOR-mediated amino acid sensing at the lysosome by building a complex between mTORC1, V-ATPase, and Ragulator. Interestingly, Zhang et al. (8Zhang C.S. Jiang B. Li M. Zhu M. Peng Y. Zhang Y.L. Wu Y.Q. Li T.Y. Liang Y. Lu Z. Lian G. Liu Q. Guo H. Yin Z.

Their group impressively showed that the V-ATPase–Ragulator complex serves as a docking site for LKB1-mediated AMPK activation with the aid of the scaffolding protein AXIN1 by forming the V-ATPase–Ragulator/LKB1–AMPK complex at the lysosome (8Zhang C.S.

It has also been shown that another V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, can activate AMPK in myoblasts (21Dalle Pezze P. Ruf S. Sonntag A.G. Langelaar-Makkinje M. Hall P. Heberle A.M.

Commun. 2016; 7 (27869123): 1325410.1038/ncomms13254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with their findings, we showed that inhibiting V-ATPase function pharmacologically with archazolid led to activation of AMPK in HEK293 and other nontumor cells, an increase in binding of V-ATPase to AXIN1, and increased lysosomal localization of the AMPK–LKB1 complex. Interestingly, in tumor cells, archazolid had no influence on AMPK phosphorylation, and binding of V-ATPase to AXIN1 was decreased after archazolid treatment, although all tumor cells already showed phosphorylated AMPK in controls. This finding is consistent with other groups showing high constitutive AMPK activity in tumor cells, like prostate cancer metastases or glioblastoma tumors (22Ros S. Santos C.R. Moco S. Baenke F.

Functional metabolic screen identifies 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 as an important regulator of prostate cancer cell survival.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2 (22576210): 328-34310.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0234Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Jang T.

Differential activation was not due to stress resistance or other resistance mechanisms in tumor cells, as glucose deprivation lead to increased activation of AMPK in all cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2980235726,"Extensive research has been applied to discover new techniques and methods to model protein-ligand interactions. In particular, considerable efforts focused on identifying candidate binding sites, which quite often are active sites that correspond to protein pockets or cavities. Thus, these cavities play an important role in molecular docking. However, there is no established benchmark to assess the accuracy of new cavity detection methods. In practice, each new technique is evaluated using a small set of proteins with known binding sites as ground-truth. However, studies supported by large datasets of known cavities and/or binding sites and statistical classification (i.e., false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives) would yield much stronger and reliable assessments. To this end, we propose CavBench, a generic and extensible benchmark to compare different cavity detection methods relative to diverse ground truth datasets (e.g., PDBsum) using statistical classification methods."

In this study we have explored the effect of genetic variations in PARP-1 gene in brain tumorigenesis. This case control study comprised of 500 brain tumor cases along with 500 healthy controls. Three polymorphisms of PARP-1 gene, rs1136410 (Val762Ala), rs1805404 (Asp81Asp) and rs1805414 (Ala284Ala) were analyzed using AS-PCR method followed by DNA sequencing. Joint effect model, haplotype analysis and linkage disequilibrium of these polymorphisms was assessed using Haploview 4.2. In rs1136410 (Val762Ala) heterozygous mutant genotype (CT) was observed notably lower (OR: 0.44., 95% CI: 0.33-0.57., p<0.0001) in brain tumor patients compared to controls and ~2 fold increased frequency of homozygous mutant genotype (CC) was observed in brain tumor patients versus controls (OR: 1.51., 95%CI: 1.16-1.96, p = 0.001). In rs1805414 (Ala284Ala), frequency of heterozygous mutant genotype (CT) was observed lower (OR: 0.77., 95% CI: 0.60-0.99., p = 0.05) in patients versus controls.

The reviewer didn't say a thing about the underlying science—but isn't that what peer review is supposed to evaluate? Regardless, the reviewer recommended that our manuscript be rejected. This happened about 10 years ago. But as a nonnative English speaker who needs to publish in English, I still think about the experience today.

> “You are not a martyr or the savior of people who did not grow up speaking English.” 

I expected my paper to fare well. I knew the science was strong. I had the resources and backup data to make whatever scientific changes the reviewers suggested. I also knew that my English skills weren't great. But I had a native English-speaking co-author and an adviser who was proficient in English, and they both thoroughly revised the manuscript.

When I received those comments from the reviewer, I was crushed. I felt our work wasn't being judged fairly. Had the reviewer assumed that, because my co-authors and I were all affiliated with the same Mexican research institute, none of us was proficient in English? My co-author told me I shouldn't take the comments personally, and that they did not reflect on the quality of my work, but that didn't make me feel any better. How could I succeed in academia if I could not manage to publish a paper in English?

Luckily, the other two reviewers made useful suggestions about the science, and the editor invited us to submit a revised version. I modified the science based on the helpful reviewers' feedback and made the grammar and style corrections demanded by the rude reviewer, and my first first-author paper was accepted.

Since then, no reviewers have had a problem with my English—maybe because I moved to the United States and started publishing with co-authors who have American-sounding names. I also put a lot of work into improving my language skills, including participating in writing workshops and reading books about writing in English.

But many of my colleagues in Mexico tell me stories of dealing with reviewers who are harsh and patronizing about their English. And I know that other researchers around the world experience similar insults.

Reviewers, you don't need to be rude. Here are three principles for providing constructive reviews, even when you think an article is poorly written.

First and foremost, do not make assumptions about the quality of a paper based on the authors' names and affiliations. This form of bias is rooted in racism.

Second, you are a reviewer—not an editor. Focus on the research. If the English is so poor you cannot review the paper or provide feedback on the science, tell the editor so that they can decide how to proceed.

Third, if the paper is not written in sound English, it is OK to correct grammatical errors and help improve the writing. But remember that you are not a martyr or the savior of people who did not grow up speaking English. Be kind. For example, you can write, “I cannot understand what the authors are trying to communicate here.” You can also suggest editing help from someone with “full professional proficiency in English.” Don't demand “a native English speaker”; that is not synonymous with being a good writer.

As reviewers, we help ensure that high-quality science gets published. We can—and should—do this without forgetting that behind every paper are people who worked hard to put together a manuscript reporting their cherished research. As scientists, we know that writing is hard. Keep in mind that writing in a second language is even harder.

https://openalex.org/W2979745848,"Cells use multiple mechanisms to regulate their metabolic states in response to changes in their nutrient environment. One example is the response of cells to glucose. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing in glucose-depleted medium, the re-availability of glucose leads to the down-regulation of gluconeogenesis and the activation of glycolysis, leading to ""glucose repression."" However, our knowledge of the mechanisms mediating the glucose-dependent down-regulation of the gluconeogenic transcription factors is limited. Using the major gluconeogenic transcription factor Rds2 as a candidate, we identify here a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pib1 in regulating the stability and degradation of Rds2. Glucose addition to cells growing under glucose limitation results in a rapid ubiquitination of Rds2, followed by its proteasomal degradation. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we establish Pib1 as the ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rds2 ubiquitination and stability. Notably, this Pib1-mediated Rds2 ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation, is specific to the presence of glucose. This Pib1-mediated ubiquitination of Rds2 depends on the phosphorylation state of Rds2, suggesting a cross-talk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation to achieve a metabolic state change. Using stable isotope-based metabolic flux experiments, we find that the loss of Pib1 results in an imbalanced gluconeogenic state, regardless of glucose availability. Pib1 is required for complete glucose repression and enables cells to optimally grow in competitive environments when glucose again becomes available. Our results reveal the existence of a Pib1-mediated regulatory program that mediates glucose repression when glucose availability is restored."
https://openalex.org/W2979482780,"Lipids are ubiquitous molecules, serving as the structural building blocks for membranes, messengers in cell signaling, or compounds for energy storage. Their functional versatility relies in part on the presence of one or more double bonds in the long lipid carbon chains. The more double bonds there are in a lipid, the more unsaturated it is; and the more unsaturated lipids there are in a membrane, the more flexible the membrane tends to be. Cells take advantage of this property by fine-tuning the levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in membranes to external conditions and required membrane function. Many organisms, including humans, produce unsaturated fatty acids by desaturating saturated fatty acids, as Rudolf Schoenheimer and David Rittenberg reported in the 1930s working with mammalian cells (1Schoenheimer R. Rittenberg D. Deuterium as an indicator in the study of intermediary metabolism: V. The desaturation of fatty acids in the organism.J. Biol. Chem. 1936; 113 (http://www.jbc.org/content/113/2/505.full.pdf?sid=02ec67ce-5684–45c2-bba4-f47412e5c0b0): 505-510Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Konrad Bloch and Daniel Bloomfield showed in the 1960s studying yeast (2Bloomfield D.K. Bloch K. The formation of Δ9-unsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235 (http://www.jbc.org/content/235/2/337.full.pdf 13801633): 337-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When it comes to making unsaturated fatty acids, cells growing in the presence of molecular oxygen have an advantage; they can use this powerful oxidant to insert a double bond into a fatty acid chain via a dehydrogenation reaction. But what about organisms that cannot grow in the presence of molecular oxygen? This question piqued the curiosity of Bloch, who had a longstanding interest in oxygen as a biosynthetic reagent and was also aware that molecular oxygen is toxic to some microorganisms. In the 1950s, he had taken a summer course taught by the eminent microbiologist Cornelius van Niel. The course acquainted Bloch with many microorganisms, including obligately anaerobic bacteria that thrive only in the absence of oxygen (3Bloch K. Summing up.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56 (https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.000245 3304130): 1-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Howard Goldfine worked with Bloch on bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is now emeritus professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “[The course] caused him to wonder what goes on in anaerobes, because obviously, they could not use molecular oxygen [for making unsaturated fatty acids],” Goldfine says. Bloch sought to answer this question by studying fatty acid biosynthesis in two species of anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium kluyveri and Clostridium butyricum (strain 6015, now known as Clostridium beijerinckii). “Clostridia are present anywhere where there's no oxygen,” Goldfine says. “If you look in mud several inches below the surface, you'll find clostridia, and they're happily growing.” The work of Bloch, Goldfine, and colleagues on unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in clostridia resulted in two JBC papers, recognized as Classics here (4Goldfine H. Bloch K. On the origin of unsaturated fatty acids in clostridia.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (http://www.jbc.org/content/236/10/2596.full.pdf?sid=2023ec0f-bafb-4973-acd9-e69b436b85d8 13899759): 2596-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Scheuerbrandt G.

The studies reported that C. kluyveri and C. butyricum 6015 (C. beijerinckii) produce unsaturated fatty acids via a biosynthetic route distinct from that present in aerobic cells. Goldfine's association with Bloch began through their shared interest in anaerobic metabolism. Goldfine had worked on anaerobic bacteria in Earl Stadtman's lab at the National Heart Institute of the National Institutes of Health, prompting Bloch to explore whether Goldfine might be interested in working with him. “He was coming down to NIH for a study section, and he asked if we could have lunch together, and then he asked, would I be interested in coming to visit his lab?” Goldfine remembers. Goldfine was familiar with Bloch's work on cholesterol and fatty acids, for which Bloch won the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine with Feodor Lynen in 1964 (6Kresge N. Simoni R.D. Hill R.L. The biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol: Konrad Bloch.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 (http://www.jbc.org/content/280/10/e7.full?sid=17233771–608b-44fe-abfe-6b1b683e5253): e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). So Goldfine enthusiastically jumped at the opportunity, resulting in a 3-year stay in the Bloch laboratory. “I was really very, very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Bloch, because he was a man of really great depth and understanding,” Goldfine says. “It was a turning point in my career.” Goldfine's expertise was soon tested: removing all oxygen from the experimental system to study unsaturated fatty acid formation in clostridia posed a challenge all its own. Initially, Goldfine tried to grow the bacteria in a helium atmosphere in a vacuum desiccator, “but that did not completely remove oxygen, because there could be a trace of oxygen in the helium,” he recalls. So Goldfine resorted to a chemical trick and skillful lab acrobatics. He poured a 5% potassium carbonate solution into the desiccator base, above which he placed the flasks holding the bacteria in growth media, along with a beaker containing pyrogallic acid. After sealing and helium-purging the desiccator, Goldfine gingerly tilted it to tip the pyrogallol into the potassium carbonate solution. The resulting mixture then removed any traces of oxygen from the helium-filled desiccator. Tools such as mass spectrometry to analyze the bacterial lipids were not readily available at the time. Instead, the researchers relied on Bloch's longstanding expertise in using 14C labeling and detection. After feeding the 14C-labeled lipid precursor acetate to the bacterial cultures, Bloch and Goldfine extracted the lipids from the cells, used gas chromatography to separate fatty acids, identified them with standards, and assessed them for 14C labeling in a scintillation counter. In the first study (4Goldfine H. Bloch K. On the origin of unsaturated fatty acids in clostridia.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (http://www.jbc.org/content/236/10/2596.full.pdf?sid=2023ec0f-bafb-4973-acd9-e69b436b85d8 13899759): 2596-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Goldfine and Bloch reported incorporation of two-thirds of the 14C-labeled acetate into saturated lipids and one-third into monounsaturated lipids, showing that bacteria can produce unsaturated fatty acids in the absence of molecular oxygen. This finding raised the question how the clostridia could create double bonds in fatty acids. One possibility was that the bacterial cells possessed the means to desaturate a bond in an existing saturated fatty acid, as previously found in other organisms, but by using an oxidant other than molecular oxygen. Or the clostridia might deploy a different, yet unknown mechanism to generate a lipid double bond. To test these possibilities, Goldfine and Bloch fed a series of 14C-labeled saturated fatty acids ranging in length from 8 to 18 carbons to the cells. They found that the clostridia do not make unsaturated fatty acids by desaturating bonds in their saturated counterparts. Instead, they produce a single double bond during elongation of the saturated fatty acids octanoic acid (C8) and decanoic acid (C10), resulting in long-chain (C12 to C18) monounsaturated fatty acids. Interestingly, the clostridia did not use saturated fatty acid chains longer than 10 carbons for making unsaturated fatty acids. This indicated that these bacteria use short- and medium-chain fatty acids (up to 8 or 10 carbons long) as precursors of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids through the same biochemical route, but make longer-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids via two distinct pathways. Peering into the clostridial lipid products a little more, Bloch and colleagues saw something odd. “C. beijerinckii [presented] an additional problem because the unsaturated fatty acids have two isomers,” says Goldfine. The unsaturated fatty acid hexadecenoic acid isomers had a double bond either at the C7 or C9 (Δ7 or Δ9) position, and octadecenoic acid isomers either at C9 or C11 (Δ9 or Δ11). To find out how these isomers are made, and as described in the second JBC paper (5Scheuerbrandt G. Goldfine H. Baronowsky P.E. Bloch K. A novel mechanism for the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (http://www.jbc.org/content/236/10/PC70.full.pdf?sid=2023ec0f-bafb-4973-acd9-e69b436b85d8 14498314): PC70-PC71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Bloch, Goldfine, and another member of the Bloch lab, Günter Scheuerbrandt, fed 14C-labeled octanoic and decanoic acids to C. beijerinckii and again measured 14C incorporation into hexadecenoic and octadecenoic acids. They tweaked their procedure to include exposure of the unsaturated fatty acids to potassium metaperiodate-potassium permanganate (KIO4–KMnO4), a strong oxidant that breaks lipid double bonds. This enabled them to trace the origins of both ends of the unsaturated products and home in on the mechanism that creates the different fatty acid isomers. “I distinctly remember, Paul Baronowsky—he was a graduate student at the time—standing at the blackboard at the end of the lab writing that pathway,” Goldfine says. “'This is how you get the double bond here. And if you do it with another precursor, you get the double bond there.’ He drew it all out beautifully.” Their carefully designed experiments and analyses revealed that the individual isomers do not arise from interconversions among them. Instead, the researchers found that octanoic acid is the precursor to the long-chain fatty acids having a double bond at the C9 or C11 position and decanoic acid is the precursor to those with a double bond at the C7 or C9 position (Fig. 1). The authors' findings supported an earlier proposal by famed chemist Klaus Hofmann at the University of Pittsburgh. Working with lactobacilli, Hofmann and colleagues had speculated that bacteria may produce long-chain unsaturated fatty acids by chain elongation from a short-chain precursor (7Hofmann K. O'Leary W.M. Yoho C.W. Liu T.-Y. Further observations on lipide stimulation of bacterial growth.J. Biol.

On the basis of their published and unpublished findings, Bloch and colleagues proposed that in clostridia and several other bacteria, including lactobacilli and Escherichia coli, the long-chain unsaturated fatty acids are produced by an anaerobic pathway involving elongation of octanoic acid or decanoic acid, immediately followed by a β,γ elimination of water from a hydroxy acid intermediate and further elongation of the lipid chain without reduction of the double bond (5Scheuerbrandt G. Goldfine H. Baronowsky P.E. Bloch K. A novel mechanism for the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (http://www.jbc.org/content/236/10/PC70.full.pdf?sid=2023ec0f-bafb-4973-acd9-e69b436b85d8 14498314): PC70-PC71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

This work culminated in two papers confirming that the anaerobic bacterial pathway indeed involves enzymatic dehydration of medium-chain β-hydroxy acids rather than oxidative dehydrogenation of a saturated acid (11Kass L.R.

Thus, innovative rejiggering of lab equipment, foundational biochemistry methods, and several incisive blackboard sketches yielded results that uncovered how anaerobes make unsaturated fatty acids and that have stood the test of time to this day. “The pathway that is in the second JBC [Classics] paper has held up for 60 years, it's pretty astonishing,” concludes Goldfine."

https://openalex.org/W2980234558,"How does the knowledge shared by interlocutors during interaction modify the way speakers speak? Specifically, how does prosody change when speakers know that their addressees do not share the same knowledge as them? We studied these effects in an interactive paradigm in which French speakers gave instructions to addressees about where to place a cross between different objects (e.g., You put the cross between the red mouse and the red house). We manipulated (i) whether the two interlocutors shared or did not necessarily share the same objects and (ii) the informational status of referents. We were interested in two types of prosodic variations: global prosodic variations that affect entire utterances (i.e., pitch range and speech rate variations) and more local prosodic variations that encode informational status of referents (i.e., prosodic phrasing for French). We found that participants spoke more slowly and with larger pitch excursions in the not-shared knowledge condition than in the shared knowledge condition while they did not prosodically encode the informational status of referents regardless of the knowledge condition. Results demonstrated that speakers kept track of what the addressee knew, and that they adapted their global prosody to their interlocutors. This made the task too cognitively demanding to allow the prosodic encoding of the informational status of referents. Our findings are in line with the idea that complex reasoning usually implicated in constructing a model of the addressee co-exists with speaker-internal constraints such as cognitive load to affect speaker’s prosody during interaction."
