https://openalex.org/W2027810531,"Rho and rac, two members of the ras-related superfamily of small GTPases, regulate the polymerization of actin to produce stress fibers and lamellipodia, respectively. We report here that cdc42, another member of the rho family, triggers the formation of a third type of actin-based structure found at the cell periphery, filopodia. In addition to stress fibers, rho controls the assembly of focal adhesion complexes. We now show that rac and cdc42 also stimulate the assembly of multimolecular focal complexes at the plasma membrane. These complexes, which are associated with lamellipodia and filopodia, contain vinculin, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase, but are distinct from and formed independently of rho-induced focal adhesions. Activation of cdc42 in Swiss 3T3 cells leads to the sequential activation of rac and then rho, suggesting a molecular model for the coordinated control of cell motility by members of the rho family of GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2007986629,"Protein kinases activated by dual phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr (MAP kinases) can be grouped into two major classes: ERK and JNK. The ERK group regulates multiple targets in response to growth factors via a Ras-dependent mechanism. In contrast, JNK activates the transcription factor c-Jun in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines and exposure of cells to several forms of environmental stress. Recently, a novel mammalian protein kinase (p38) that shares sequence similarity with mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases was identified. Here, we demonstrate that p38, like JNK, is activated by treatment of cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress. The mechanism of p38 activation is mediated by dual phosphorylation on Thr-180 and Tyr-182. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of activated cells. Together, these data establish that p38 is a member of the mammalian MAP kinase group.

At least four genetically distinct signaling pathways have been defined in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(2Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 90-95Google Scholar). One pathway leads to activation of the FUS3 and KSS1 MAP kinases and is required for the response to mating pheromone(3Errede B. Levin D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 283-286Google Scholar). A second MAP kinase pathway (MPK1) functions during cell wall biosynthesis(4Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell.

Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The fourth MAP kinase pathway (SMK1) is required for the control of sporulation(7Krisak L. Strich R. Winters R.S. Hall J.P. Mallory M.J. Kreitzer D. Tuan R.S. Winter E. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2151-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Significantly, these MAP kinase pathways appear to function independently because mutations that disrupt one pathway do not alter signal transduction mediated by the other pathways(2Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 90-95Google Scholar). This independent function may arise from the substrate specificity of the MAP kinase cascades. In addition, it has been established that there is an important role for tethering proteins (e.g. STE5) that bind multiple components of the MAP kinase cascade to create a functional signal transduction module(8Choi K.-Y.

Although detailed information is available for yeast, the organization of MAP kinase pathways in mammals is more poorly understood.

Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Importantly, the signal transduction pathways that lead to ERK and JNK activation are biochemically and functionally distinct(11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel mammalian MAP kinase (p38) was identified by Han et al.(19Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). This MAP kinase isoform has been implicated in the mechanism of activation of MAPKAP kinase-2 (20Rouse J.

The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanism of p38 activation and to establish the relationship of the p38 MAP kinase pathway to the ERK and JNK signal transduction pathways. Tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1α were from Genzyme Corp. Lipolysaccharide (LPS) was isolated from lyophilized Salmonella minesota Re595 bacteria as described (23Mathison J.C. Wolfson E. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Phorbol myristate acetate was from Sigma. EGF was purified from mouse salivary glands(24Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9462-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies M2 and PY20 were obtained from IBI-Kodak and ICN, respectively. [32P]ATP was prepared using a Gammaprep A kit (Promega Biotech) and [32P]phosphate (DuPont NEN). Recombinant ATF2 proteins have been described(25Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). GST-IκB was provided by Dr. D. Baltimore (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). GST-c-Myc(26Alvarez E. Northwood I.C.

O'Brien K.M. Cerione R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and GST-c-Jun (11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar) fusion proteins have been described. GST-p38 MAP kinase was prepared using the expression vector pGEX and a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing the coding region of the p38 MAP kinase cDNA. The GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using gluthathione-agarose(28Smith S.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies that recognize JNK and p38 MAP kinase were raised in rabbits using GST-p38 and GST-JNK1 as antigens. The plasmid pCMV-Flag-JNK1 (11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar) and the expression vectors for human MKP-1 (CL100) and PAC-1 (29Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) have been described. The plasmid pCMV-Flag-p38 MAP kinase was prepared using the expression vector pCMV5 (30Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the p38 cDNA. The Flag epitope (-Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Aps-Lys-; Immunex Corp.) was inserted between codons 1 and 2 of p38 by insertional overlapping polymerase chain reaction(31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). A similar polymerase chain reaction procedure was employed to replace Thr180 and Tyr182 with Ala and Phe, respectively. The sequence of all plasmids was confirmed by automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 373A machine. COS-1 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human CD14 (32Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient transfection assays were performed using the lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). Phosphate labeling was performed by incubation of cells (4 h) in phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories Inc.) supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [32P]phosphate (DuPont NEN) and 1% fetal bovine serum. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and probed with monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (PY20) and the Flag epitope (M2). Immunecomplexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham International PLC). The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The epitope-tagged protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation 1 h at 4°C with the M2 antibody pre-bound to protein-G Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 15 min at 22°C. Endogenous p38 and JNK was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies pre-bound to protein-A Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer. Recombinant GST-ATF2 fusion proteins (5 μg) pre-bound to gluthathione-agarose beads were incubated with cell lysates (80 μg) in 500 μl of lysis buffer. After 1 h of incubation at 4°C, the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. Protein kinases in the cell lysate and bound to the beads were detected by Western blot analysis. Kinase assays were performed using immunoprecipitates of p38 MAP kinase and JNK. The immunecomplexes were washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM orthovanadate). The assays were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of substrate protein and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 25 μl. The reactions were terminated after 30 min at 30°C by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was examined after SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.) analysis. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by partial acid hydrolysis and thin layer electrophoresis(11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). Coverslips (22 × 22 mm No. 1; Gold Seal Cover Glass; Becton Dickinson) were pre-treated by boiling in 0.1 N HCl for 10 min, rinsed in distilled water, autoclaved, and coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma). The coverslips were placed at the bottom of 35-mm multiwell tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson). Transfected COS-1 cells were plated directly on the coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed once and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose. The cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and the coverslips removed from the tissue culture wells. Cells were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at 22°C. The cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and washed three times in DWB solution (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0), 2% horse serum, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100) for 5 min. The primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, Eastman-Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) was diluted 1:250 in DWB and applied to the cells in a humidified environment at 22°C for 1 h. The cells were washed three times and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was applied at a 1:250 dilution for 1 h at 22°C in a humidified environment. The cells were washed three times in DWB and mounted onto slides with Gel-Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) for immunofluorescence analysis. Control experiments were performed to assess the specificity of the observed immunofluorescence. No fluorescence was detected when the transfected cells were stained in the absence of the primary M2 monoclonal antibody. In addition, we did not observe fluorescence in experiments using mock-transfected cells. Together, these data demonstrate that the immunofluorescence observed detects the epitope-tagged p38 MAP kinase. Digital images of the fluorescence distribution in single cells were obtained using a Nikon 60x Planapo objective (numerical aperture = 1.4) on a Zeiss IM-35 microscope equipped for epifluorescence as described previously(33Carrington W.A. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Fosbett K. Grinstein S. Non-invasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 53-72Google Scholar, 34Fay F.S. Carrington W. Fogarty K.E. J. Microsci. 1989; 153: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Images of various focal planes were obtained with a computer controlled focus mechanism and a thermoelectrically cooled charged-coupled device camera (model 220; Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ). The exposure of the sample to the excitation source was determined by a computer-controlled shutter and wavelength selector system (MVI, Avon, MA). The charge-coupled device camera and microscope functions were controlled by a microcomputer, and the data acquired from the camera were transferred to a Silicon Graphics model 4D/GTX workstation (Mountainview, CA) for image processing. Images were corrected for non-uniformities in sensitivity and for the dark current of the charge coupled device detector. The callibration of the microscopy blurring was determined by measuring the instrument's point spread function as a series of optical sections at 0.125-μm intervals of a 0.3-μm diameter fluorescently labeled latex bead (Molecular Probes Inc.). The image restoration algorithm used is based upon the theory of ill-posed problems and obtains quantitative dye density values within the cell that are substantially more accurate than those in an unprocessed image (33Carrington W.A. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Fosbett K. Grinstein S. Non-invasive Techniques in Cell Biology. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 53-72Google Scholar, 34Fay F.S. Carrington W. Fogarty K.E. J. Microsci. 1989; 153: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After image processing, individual optical sections of cells were inspected and analyzed using computer graphics software on a Silicon Graphics workstation. The p38 MAP kinase shares amino acid sequence similarity with the MAP kinase family of proteins including ERK, JNK, and HOG1(1Davis R.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In order to characterize the enzymatic activity of p38, we employed recombinant p38 expressed in Escherichia coli to examine the phosphorylation of several proteins that have been demonstrated to be substrates for the ERK and/or JNK groups of MAP kinases. In initial studies we examined the phosphorylation of the ERK substrates myelin basic protein (35Erickson A.K. Payne D.M. Martino P.A. Rossomando A.J. Shabanowitz J. Weber M.J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19728-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the EGF-R(36Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Wartmann M. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15266-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was observed that p38 phosphorylated both of these proteins (Fig. 1A). In contrast, phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun (11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 12Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) was not detected. These data indicate that the substrate specificity of p38 is similar to the ERK group of MAP kinases. However, not all ERK substrates were phosphorylated by p38. For example, the ERK substrates cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (37Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar) and c-Myc (26Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not phosphorylated by p38 (Fig. 1A). Together, these data demonstrate that the substrate specificity of p38 differs from both the ERK and JNK groups of MAP kinases. Although the ERK substrates myelin basic protein and the EGF-R were phosphorylated by p38, it was unclear whether these proteins represent preferred substrates for this protein kinase. We therefore tested several additional proteins as potential substrates for p38. This analysis demonstrated a low level of phosphorylation of IκB (Fig. 1A). However, the transcription factor ATF2 was found to be an excellent p38 substrate. Phosphorylation of ATF2 caused by p38 resulted in an electrophoretic mobility shift during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The site(s) of phosphorylation were mapped to the NH2-terminal activation domain of ATF2 by deletion analysis (data not shown). Interestingly, JNK phosphorylates ATF2 on Thr-69 and Thr-71(25Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that p38 phosphorylates ATF2 on the same sites. It was found that the replacement of Thr-69 and Thr-71 with Ala residues blocked the phosphorylation of ATF2 caused by p38 (Fig. 1A). We conclude that p38 phosphorylates ATF2 within the NH2-terminal activation domain on Thr-69 and Thr-71. Significantly, the phosphorylation of ATF2 on these sites causes increased transcriptional activity(25Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription factor ATF2 is a potential target of signal transduction by p38 MAP kinase and JNK. It is known that JNK binds to the activation domain of the substrate c-Jun(11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 12Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

A. 1992; 89: 5341-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). By analogy to JNK, it is possible that p38 MAP kinase binds to ATF2. To test this hypothesis, we incubated cell extracts with immobilized GST or GST-ATF2 (activation domain; residues 1-109). The complexes were extensively washed and the bound protein kinases were detected by Western blotting. This analysis demonstrated that both p38 MAP kinase and JNK bind to the ATF2 activation domain 2Control experiments demonstrated that JNK, but not p38 MAP kinase, bound to the activation domain of c-Jun. (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cultured cells with EGF or phorbol ester causes maximal activation of the ERK subgroup of MAP kinases(41Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cobb M.H. Robbins D.J. Boulton T.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, these treatments cause only a small increase in JNK protein kinase activity(11Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 12Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Together, these data indicate that the regulation of p38 may be more similar to JNK than ERK. This hypothesis was confirmed by investigation of the effect of JNK activators on p38 protein kinase activity. It was observed that environmental stress (UV radiation and osmotic shock) caused a marked increase in the activity of both p38 and JNK (Figure 4, Figure 5). It was also observed that p38 and JNK were activated in cells treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1) or endotoxic LPS (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Together, these data indicate that p38 MAP kinase, like JNK, is activated by a stress-induced signal transduction pathway. However, activation of p38 MAP kinase by alternative pathways is not excluded by these data.Figure 3EGF weakly activates p38 MAP kinase.

Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, the p38 MAP kinase contains the related sequence Thr-Gly-Tyr (19Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 20Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). To test whether this motif is relevant to the activation of p38, we examined the effect of the replacement of Thr-Gly-Tyr with Ala-Gly-Phe. The wild-type and mutant forms of p38 were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 9A). Western blot analysis using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that exposure to UV radiation caused an increase in the Tyr phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 9A). The increased Tyr phosphorylation was confirmed by phosphoamino acid analysis of p38 isolated from [32P]phosphate-labeled cells (Fig. 9B). This analysis also demonstrated that UV radiation caused increased Thr phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 9B). Significantly, the increased phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr was blocked by mutation of the dual phosphorylation motif Thr-Gly-Tyr (Fig. 4, A and B). To examine the signficance of the dual phosphorylation of p38, we measured the protein kinase activity of the wild-type and mutated enzymes. UV radiation caused a marked increase in the activity of wild-type (Thr-Gly-Tyr) p38 (Fig. 9C). In contrast, the mutated (Ala-Gly-Phe) p38 was found to be catalytically inactive (Fig. 9C). Together, these data demonstrate that p38 is activated by dual phosphorylation within the motif Thr-Gly-Tyr. It has recently been demonstrated that ERK activity is regulated by the mitogen-induced dual specificity phosphatases MKP1 and PAC1(29Ward Y. Gupta S. Jensen P. Wartmann M. Davis R.J. Kelly K. Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 44Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 by dual phosphorylation (Fig. 9) suggests that p38 MAP kinase may also be regulated by dual specificity phosphatases. We therefore examined the effect of MKP1 and PAC1 on p38 MAP kinase activation. It was observed that the expression of PAC1 or MKP1 inhibited p38 activity (Fig. 10). The inhibitory effect of MKP1 was greater than PAC1. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant phosphatase did not inhibit p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 10). Control experiments demonstrated that these phosphatases did not alter the level of expression of p38 MAP kinase (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase can be regulated by the dual specificity phosphatases PAC1 and MKP1. The subcellular distribution of p38 MAP kinase was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Epitope-tagged p38 MAP kinase was detected using the M2 monoclonal antibody. Control experiments demonstrated that no staining of mock-transfected cells was detected. However, specific staining of cells transfected with epitope-tagged p38 MAP kinase was observed (Fig. 11). The p38 MAP kinase was detected at the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. Marked changes in cell surface and nuclear p38 MAP kinase were not observed following UV irradiation, but an increase in the localization of cytoplasmic p38 MAP kinase to the perinuclear region was detected (Fig. 11). Together, these data demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase is present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of cells and that activation by UV irradiation does not cause marked redistribution of p38 MAP kinase from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. 3A caveat that must be placed on the interpretation of the immunofluorescence experiments is that the images obtained represent the cellular distribution of over-expressed p38 MAP kinase. The distribution of endogenous p38 MAP kinase may be different. The absence of nuclear redistribution of p38 MAP kinase contrasts with observations reported for the ERK group of MAP kinases(45Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J.

However, the absence of detectable phosphorylation of cPLA2, c-Myc, and c-Jun together with the strong phosphorylation of ATF2 indicates that the substrate specificity of p38 differs from both the JNK(11Dérijard B.

It is therefore likely that the p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway has a distinct function in the cell. Indeed, it has recently been established that p38 may function in a signal transduction pathway that leads to phosphorylation of small heat shock proteins (20Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). EGF and phorbol ester are potent activators of the ERK signal transduction pathway(10Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, we found that these treatments did not cause a marked increase in p38 protein kinase activity. These data indicate that the mechanism of activation of p38 is not identical to the ERK group of MAP kinases. In contrast, the pattern of activation of p38 was found to be similar to JNK, a MAP kinase that is potently activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress(1Davis R.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Thus p38, like JNK, may be regulated, in part, by a stress-activated signal transduction pathway (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). This conclusion is consistent with the observation that both p38 and JNK1 are able to complement a defect in the expression of the HOG1 stress-activated MAP kinase in yeast(15Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 19Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Although p38 and JNK both appear to be activated by a stress-induced signal transduction pathway, a significant question remains concerning the organization of these pathways. The comparison of the regulation of p38 and JNK activation reveals a marked similarity between these protein kinases, but differences in the time course and extent of activation were also observed (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). These differences indicate that the p38 and JNK pathways may be distinct. Indeed, p38 and JNK could represent parallel stress-activated signal transduction pathways(49Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that p38 and JNK are activated by a common pathway. A rigorous test of these hypotheses requires the molecular cloning of the dual specificity kinase kinases that activate p38 and JNK. Recently, two MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK4) that activate p38 MAP kinase have been identified(49Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). MKK3 is specific for p38 MAP kinase(49Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). In contrast, MKK4 activates both JNK (49Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Thus, p38 and JNK are activated by related MAP kinase kinases (Fig. 12). The original identification of p38 demonstrated that this protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in LPS-treated cells(19Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 51Han J. Lee J.-D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

This study demonstrates that p38 is a member of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation on Tyr and Thr by a stress-induced signal transduction pathway. Endotoxic LPS, an activator of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, can therefore be considered to be a form of environmental stress that elicits septic shock(52Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin.

Immunoprecipitation was performed by 1-h incubation at 4°C of 0.3-ml aliquots of lysate with mouse monoclonal antibodies (5 μg/aliquot) against the FLAG octapeptide (M2; Kodak), p55-R (nos. 18 and 20(16Engelmann H.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions with the wild type or a mutated Fas-IC were produced and adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads as described(12Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E.

Binding of metabolically labeled FLAG-MORT1 fusion protein and luciferase to GST-Fas-IC was assessed by incubating the beads for 2 h at 4°C with extracts of HeLa cells, metabolically labeled with [35S]Met (60 μCi/ml), that express FLAG-MORT1 or luciferase. The extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mM sodium vanadate (1 ml/5 × 105 cells). MORT1, Fas-IC, p55-IC, and luciferase cDNAs were inserted into a tetracycline-controlled expression vector and transfected to HtTA-1 cells (15Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) together with the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase cDNA, placed under control of SV40 promoter (the pSBC-2 vector(19Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene. 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)). Cell death was assessed 40 h after transfection, either by the neutral red uptake assay (20Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar) or, for specifically assessing the death in those cells that expressed the transfected cDNAs, by determining the amounts of placental alkaline phosphatase (21Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) secreted into the growth medium during the last 5 h of incubation. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA of HeLa cells (Oligotex-dT mRNA kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Northern analysis, using the MORT1 cDNA as a probe, was performed by conventional methods as described before (12Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of MORT1 was determined in both directions by the dideoxy chain termination method. The cDNA described in this study was cloned by a two-hybrid system screen(13Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar), using the intracellular domain of human Fas/APO1 (Fas-IC) as bait. Sequence analysis indicated that it encodes a novel protein (see below). Applying the two-hybrid test to further evaluate the specificity of the binding of this protein (which will be referred to as MORT1, for mediator of receptor-induced toxicity) to Fas-IC and to define the particular region in Fas-IC to which it binds led to the following findings (Table 1). (a) The protein binds both to human and to mouse Fas-IC but not to several other tested proteins, including three receptors of the TNF/NGF receptor family (p55 and p75 TNF receptors and CD40). (b) Replacement mutations at position 225 (Ile) in the death domain of mouse Fas/APO1 (the lprcg mutation), shown to abolish signaling both in vitro and in vivo(9Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar), also prevent binding to MORT1. (c) The MORT1 binding site in Fas/APO1 occurs within the death domain of this receptor. (d) MORT1 binds to itself. This self-binding and the binding of MORT1 to Fas/APO1 involve different regions of the protein. A fragment of MORT1, corresponding to residues 1-117, binds to the full-length MORT1 but does not bind to Fas/APO1. Conversely, a fragment corresponding to residues 130-245 binds to Fas/APO1 but does not bind to MORT1 (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab Expression of MORT1 molecules fused at their N terminus with the FLAG octapeptide (FLAG-MORT1) in HeLa cells yielded proteins of four distinct sizes of approximately 27, 28, 32, and 34 kDa. All four proteins bound to Fas-IC upon incubation with a GST-Fas-IC fusion protein. As in the yeast two-hybrid test, MORT1 did not bind to a GST-Fas-IC fusion protein with a replacement at the lprcg mutation site (I225A, Fig. 1). FLAG-MORT1 also showed an ability to bind to the intracellular domain of Fas/APO1 as well as to the intracellular domain of a Fas/APO1 chimera whose extracellular domain was replaced with that of p55-R (p55-Fas) when coexpressed with these receptors in HeLa cells. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, immunoprecipitation of FLAG-MORT1 from extracts of the transfected cells also resulted in precipitation of the coexpressed Fas/APO1 or p55-Fas. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of these receptors resulted in the coprecipitation of FLAG-MORT1. Northern analysis using MORT1 cDNA as a probe (Fig. 4A) revealed a single hybridizing transcript in HeLa cells. The size of this transcript (approximately 1.8 kilobases) is close to that of the MORT1 cDNA (1670 nucleotides). In sequence analysis of MORT1, the cDNA was found to contain an open reading frame of 245 amino acids (Fig. 4B). A homology search using the PredictProtein Service (PHDsec) and the PRODOM program of the GCG package revealed a significant similarity between a region of approximately 65 residues in MORT1, within that part of the molecule that binds to Fas/APO1, and a region of the same length within the death domains of Fas/APO1 and p55-R (Fig. 4C). This part of the death domain also shows similarity to a region in the intracellular domain of the low affinity NGF receptor (23Johnson D. Lanahan A. Buck C.R. Sehgal A. Morgan C. Mercer E. Bothwell M. Chao M. Cell. 1986; 47: 545-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), a receptor whose extracellular domain is known to contain another conserved sequence motif common to Fas/APO1, the TNF receptors, and other members of the TNF/NGF receptor family. It is also similar to a conserved region in the ankyrins, structural proteins that link spectrin-based membrane skeletal proteins to the cytoplasmic domains of integral plasma membrane proteins(24Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 25Lambert S. Bennet V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This region is located in the N-terminal part of the ankyrin regulatory domain, just upstream to the section of the domain whose expression is subject to modulation by alternative splicing and below the spectrin binding and membrane binding domains. The death domain motif is distinct from the ankyrin repeat motif that is found in the membrane binding domain of the ankyrins. High expression of p55-IC results in the triggering of a cytocidal effect(12Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Expression of Fas-IC in HeLa cells also has a small cytotoxic effect, which could be only detected with a sensitive assay (compare Fig. 3A to 3B). These cytotoxic effects are most likely prompted by the propensity of the death domains in the receptors to self-associate. Since MORT1 also self-associates, we examined the effect of its induced expression on cell viability. As shown in Fig. 3, expression of MORT1 in HeLa cells resulted in significant cell death, greater than that caused by Fas-IC expression. The specific association of MORT1 with the death domain in Fas/APO1 and the fact that even a slight change of structure in that region, which prevents signaling (the lprcg mutation), also abolishes the binding of MORT1 indicate that MORT1 plays a role in triggering cell death. This idea is further supported by the observation that MORT1 alone can trigger a cytocidal effect. What kind of role this protein serves is not clear. It may (i) function as modulator in the self-association of Fas/APO1 by its binding ability to Fas/APO1 as well as to itself, (ii) serve as a docking site for additional proteins that are involved in Fas/APO1 signaling, or (iii) constitute a part of a distinct signaling system that interacts with Fas/APO1 signaling. Our finding that MORT1 contains a death domain motif cannot yet provide a clue to its function. The occurrence of this motif in the NGF receptor, which, when inducing death does so only in the absence of ligand(26Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), as well as in the ankyrins suggests that this motif plays a more general role than that implied in the name death domain. One general kind of activity of this motif, found so far in three of the proteins containing it, Fas/APO1, p55-R, and MORT1, is the ability to self-interact or interact with other proteins that contain this motif. Further studies of the identity of the cellular proteins with which MORT1 interacts and of the contribution of the specific sequence and structural features of the death domain motif to these interactions should elucidate the role of MORT1 in signaling as well as the general functions of the sequence features that define the death domain motif. A further 5′-extending sequence of MORT1, cloned from a human monocyte library by polymerase chain reaction (31 nucleotides, included in the submission to the EMBL Data Bank), did not contain ATG. In addition, we found that MORT1 cDNA can be effectively expressed in HeLa cells without an N-linked ATG-containing sequence. In that form it yields two distinct protein sizes of approximately 27 and 28 kDa. These findings suggest that the translation start site of MORT1 is Met-38 (Fig. 4B). The products of 32 and 34 kDa in Figure 1:, Figure 2: may be due to initiation of translation at the translation start site of the FLAG octapeptide. We thank Ada Dibeman for careful handling of the cultured cells and Tanya Goncharov for help in establishing the alkaline phosphatase secretion assay for cytotoxicity evaluation."

A protein tyrosine phosphatase, FAP-1, capable of interacting with the cytosolic domain of Fas, was identified. The carboxyl terminal 15 amino acids of Fas are necessary and sufficient for interaction with FAP-1. FAP-1 expression is highest in tissues and cell lines that are relatively resistant to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. Gene transfer-mediated elevations in FAP-1 partially abolished Fas-induced apoptosis in a T cell line. These findings are consistent with an inhibitory effect of FAP-1 on Fas signal transduction."

These beads were then positioned, using laser tweezers, to assess F-actin movements during target interactions. We found retrograde F-actin flow was attenuated specifically along the target interaction axis in direct proportion to the rate of growth cone advance.

We conclude that the serglycin secreted from secretory granules of hematopoietic cells is a novel ligand for CD44, and could regulate lymphoid cell adherence and activation. INTRODUCTIONCD44, which exhibits significant sequence homology to the phylogenically conserved amino-terminal domain of cartilage link proteins, is an important cell surface adhesion molecule expressed on lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (Jalkanen et al., 1986; Stamenkovic et al., 1989; Goldstein et al., 1989; for reviews, see Haynes et al.(1989) and Lesley et al. (1993a)). Recent studies reveal that this molecule has many isoforms with various inserts in the membrane proximal portion (for review, see Herrlich et al.(1993)). Ligands for CD44 have been shown to be extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronic acid (Aruffo et al., 1990), fibronectin (Jalkanen and Jalkanen, 1992), and collagen types I and VI (Wayner et al., 1987; Carter and Wayner, 1988). In addition, the chondroitin sulfate-modified invariant chain has recently been suggested to be a ligand for CD44 (Naujokas et al., 1993). The CD44 molecule is thought to participate in various adhesive events including lymphocyte recirculation (Jalkanen et al., 1987), lymphohemopoiesis (Miyake et al., 1990), and tumor cell invasiveness (Gunthert et al., 1991). Monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD44 molecule enhance the proliferation of T cells (Shimizu et al., 1989; Denning et al., 1990). In addition, some anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies can trigger effector functions of murine and human T cell clones (Seth et al., 1991; Galandrini et al., 1993). Therefore, one of the important functions of CD44 in the immune system seems to be the activation of lymphocytes, although the natural ligand interacting with CD44 remains to be determined.An anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody, Hermes-3, that does not interfere with hyaluronate binding (Culty et al., 1990), inhibits the binding of human lymphocytes to high endothelial venules on frozen lymph node sections, indicating the involvement of CD44 in lymphocyte homing (Jalkanen et al., 1987). It was also reported that the binding of murine lymphocytes to high endothelial venules is resistant to hyaluronidase treatment (Culty et al., 1990), indicating that hyaluronate is not a ligand for CD44 in lymphocyte-high endothelial venule interaction. In the search for a novel ligand for CD44, we identified a sulfated macromolecule, gp600, in the culture supernatant of a murine T cell line, and reported that gp600 is a proteoglycan consisting of a small core protein (18-22 kDa) and chondroitin sulfate-like glycosaminoglycans (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994).Proteoglycans found ubiquitously in tissues are composed of a protein core and glycosaminoglycan side chains (for reviews, see Ruoslahti (1989) and Kolset and Gallagher(1990)). In hematopoietic cells, a member of the proteoglycan family termed serglycin is found in the secretory granules (for review, see Stevens et al.(1988)). Serglycins can be classified into 2 groups on the basis of the nature of the glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate serglycins and chondroitin sulfate serglycins. Various types of serglycin have been characterized, e.g. a heparin sulfate type in serosal mast cells, a chondroitin 4,6-sulfate type in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, a chondroitin 4-sulfate type in natural killer cells, eosinophils, and HL-60 leukemic promyelocytes, and a chondroitin 6-sulfate type in megakaryocytes and platelets (Stevens et al., 1988a; Kolset and Gallagher, 1990). Serglycin is distinct from all other cell surface- and matrix-localized proteoglycans both in its high degree of sulfation and its resistance to proteolysis. Although the molecular masses of these proteoglycans are heterogenous (60-750 kDa) due to differences in their glycosaminoglycan side chains, the gene responsible for the peptide core, which is composed primarily of tandem serine-glycine repeats, is a single gene (Tantravahi et al., 1986). The serglycin peptide core is estimated to be Mr 16,000-18,000 (Bourdon et al., 1985; Stevens et al., 1988b; Avraham et al., 1989), similar to that of gp600 (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994). The expression of serglycin seems to be restricted to the yolk sac, hematopoietic cells, and some tumor cells. Serglycin has been suggested to participate in the packaging of basically charged serine proteases in secretory granules and the regulation of their enzymatic activity (Stevens et al., 1988a). It has also been postulated that serglycin plays a role in cell-mediated cytotoxicity, since these proteoglycans are exocytosed when an effector cell kills tumor target cells (MacDermott et al., 1985). However, the functions of serglycin have not been fully defined.In the present study, since the various characteristics of gp600 so far identified remarkably resemble those of chondroitin sulfate serglycin, we isolated and biochemically characterized gp600 in detail to determine whether gp600 is indeed serglycin. We show that the amino acid sequence of the core protein of purified gp600 is identical to that of serglycin and that chondroitin 4-sulfate, a major glycosaminoglycan of gp600, is essential for CD44 binding. Furthermore, we indicate that CD44-serglycin interaction is involved in lymphoid cells adhesiveness and activation. This study provides further understanding not only of the physiological functions of CD44 but also those of serglycin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and CellsKM201 is directed against mouse CD44 and inhibits CD44 binding to hyaluronate (Miyake et al., 1990). Anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody IRAWB14 (Lesley et al. 1992), which induces hyaluronate binding to CD44, was kindly provided by Dr. J. Lesley (Department of Cancer Biology, The Salk Institute). Human IgG was purchased from Cappel. F(ab′)2 fraction of biotin-conjugated goat anti-human IgG was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.CTLL2, CTLL2 transfectants (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994) of mouse CD44, and mouse thymoma cell line BW5147 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Iansa), 10 mM Hepes, 2 mML-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10−4M 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) 100 × nonessential amino acids (Flow Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). For the culture of CTLL2 and its transfectants, 1 nM recombinant mouse interleukin-2 was added to the complete medium (Karasuyama et al., 1989). In the case of large scale culture of CTLL2, serum-free medium EX-cell 300™ (JRH Bioscience) was used. The culture of bone marrow-derived mast cells was performed as described previously (Razin et al., 1984).Purification of Gp600Gp600 was monitored by the presence of uronic acid, and also by its ability to bind to a soluble fusion protein of CD44 and IgG (CD44-IgG) (Aruffo et al., 1990). Conditioned medium from CTLL2 cells was centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 × g, and supernatant was recovered. The sample was concentrated in a Millipore concentrator (Minitan™ system, Mr 30,000 cut-off). The initial volume of 16 liters was concentrated to 450 ml, diluted with a buffer containing 4 M urea, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.2 M NaCl (TSKG-DEAE equilibration buffer), and concentrated again to 450 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a TSKG-DEAE (Toso) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and eluted with a 60-ml linear NaCl gradient (0.2-1 M) in the same buffer. Gp600 was observed at approximately 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing gp600 were pooled, concentrated using a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon), and dialyzed against distilled H2O. The dialyzed sample was adjusted to 6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.1% CHAPS, 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyCTLcytotoxic T cellBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and −6)-carboxyfluorescein. and loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a TSKG-3000 column (Toso) previously equilibrated with 6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.1% CHAPS. In this step, gp600 was recovered in the void fraction. The fractions containing gp600 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against distilled H2O. The dialyzed sample was treated with DNase I to remove contaminating nucleic acid. The resulting sample was diluted with the same volume of buffer containing 6 M guanidine, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.1% CHAPS, and applied onto TSKG-3000 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Gp600 was recovered in the void fraction. Fractions containing gp600 were concentrated, dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, and subjected to hydroxylapatite chromatography (HA-1000). By this hydroxylapatite column chromatography, the gp600 activities were clearly resolved into two fractions, the flow-through fraction and a fraction eluting at approximately 150 mM phosphate buffer. Since the first fraction was purer than the second, we focused on the flow-through fraction. The fraction was dialyzed against distilled H2O, adjusted to 4 M urea, 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.2 M NaCl, and loaded onto a TSKG-DEAE column. Gp600 was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2-1 M) in the same buffer. The final preparation was dialyzed against distilled H2O and lyophilized. The purity of the preparation was assessed by electrophoresis after radiolabeling the sample with Na125I. Uronic acid was determined according to the method of Bitter and Muir(1962).Preparation of CD44-IgG Fusion ProteinThe CD44-IgG expression plasmid (Aruffo et al., 1990) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Seed (Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital). CD44-IgG fusion protein was generated as described previously (Aruffo et al., 1990). Purification was performed using Protein G-Sepharose column chromatography.ELISAPurified gp600 and defined glycosaminoglycans were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates overnight at 4°C. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. CD44-IgG fusion protein or control human IgG (20 μg/ml final concentration) was added and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The plates were washed and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-human IgG for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with avidin-peroxidase for 30 min. The plates were developed after the addition of the o-phenylendiamine substrate and read with a microplate reader. A background value defied as the signal in the absence of CD44-IgG was subtracted from the experimental values to yield the specific signal.Cell Adhesion AssayThe cell adhesion assay was performed using BCECF-labeled cells as described previously (Toyama-Sorimachi et al., 1993). Gp600 (100 μg/ml) was coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (Sumitomo H-plate). After incubation overnight at 4°C, the wells were filled with PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated for 2 h at room temperature to block nonspecific protein absorption. Cell lines were washed and resuspended in serum-free RPMI containing 5 μM BCECF-AM. After incubation for 45 min at 37°C, the cells were washed with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then resuspended in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free PBS. BCECF-labeled cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were then added and the plates were incubated in the presence or absence of anti-CD44 antibody or control antibodies. Each experiment was run in duplicate or triplicate. Nonadherent cells were removed by inverting the plate. Adherent lymphocytes were solubilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and the fluorescence intensity of each well was measured with a Fluoroscan II (Flow Laboratories). The background level, defined as the binding to BSA, was subtracted from all values to yield the specific signal.Enzyme TreatmentEnzymes used for proteoglycan digestion were as follows; chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris), chondroitinase ACII (from Arthrobacter aurescens), hyaluronidase (from Streptomyces hyalurolytics), heparinase (from Flavobacterium heparinum), heparitinase (from Flavobacterium heparinum), and α-L-fucosidase (from Charonia lampus). All these enzymes were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Treatment of immobilized gp600 with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase was carried out as described previously (ToyamaSorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994). Chondroitinase ABC and ACII were used at 20 μg/ml and 100 milliunits/ml, respectively, and hyaluronidase was used at 20 μg/ml (40 turbidity reducing units/ml). Heparinase, heparitinase, and fucosidase were used at 10 milliunits/ml.Amino Acid Sequence AnalysisAmino acid sequence analysis of the purified gp600 core protein was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 475A gas-phase sequencer. The analysis was kindly performed by Dr. S. Tsubuki, Department of Molecular Biology, the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science.Flow Cytometry AnalysisFlow cytometry analysis was performed as described previously (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994). In a competition assay (Table 1), cells were preincubated with various concentrations of proteoglycans, and then incubated with 5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated hyaluronic acid (Seikagaku Kogyo). Chondroitin sulfates E and K were kindly provided by Dr. N. Seno, Department of Molecular Biology, the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. At least 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed on an EPICS-CS flow cytofluorometer (Coulter).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Disaccharide AnalysisAfter treatment of the prepared gp600 with chondroitinase ABC, unsaturated disaccharide analysis was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as reported previously (Sugawara et al., 1989, 1992). HPLC analysis was performed with a Waters model 600E (Millipore Corp.) on an amino silica gel column (NH2-125-N, Senshu Scientific, Tokyo; 4.6-mm inner diameter × 150 mm), with a programmed gradient elution from 16 to 500 mM NaH2PO4.Immunofluorescence Staining of Secretory GranulesCells were mounted onto slide glass by cytospin and air dried. After fixation with 3% formalin, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified CD44-IgG at room temperature for 60 min. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% of BSA, the samples were incubated with affinity purified biotin-conjugated anti-human IgG at 1:200 dilution. After washing, the samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled avidin at 1:1000 dilution. Samples were examined by fluorescence microscopy.Granzyme Release AssayMouse CTL clones 557 and 560 were kindly provided by Dr. S. Aizawa (Department of Physiology and Pathology, National Institute of Radiological Science). Release of granzyme A from CTL cytoplasmic granules was induced by plastic immobilized anti-CD3. ELISA plates were first coated overnight at 37°C with 50 μl of various concentrations of anti-CD3 (2C11) in PBS. Wells were washed with PBS, and triplicate aliquots of 2 × 105 cytolytic clonal T cells were dispensed into the wells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10 μg/ml IRAWB14 and 1% BSA in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml purified gp600. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min, the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Control cells were incubated in the absence of anti-CD3. Granzyme A activity was tested by adding 180 μl of the substrate (0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 × 10−4M Nα-CBZ-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT), 2.2 × 10−4M dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid)) to 20 μl of cell supernatant or to cell lysates solubilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Pasternack and Eisen, 1985). The absorbance at 405 nm was determined using an ELISA reader after a 1-h incubation at room temperature. The amount of granzyme secreted over the spontaneous release was plotted as the percent of the total enzyme content of the effector cells.RESULTSPurification of Gp600As a ligand for CD44, we recently identified a chondroitinase-sensitive proteoglycan, gp600, found in the culture supernatant of the mouse CTL line, CTLL2 (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994). To further characterize gp600, we purified it from the conditioned medium of CTLL2. In the final purification step, gp600 eluted as a single peak from a TSKG-DEAE column (Fig. 1). Nucleic acid represented less than 1% of the material in this peak. Overall, 1.21 mg of the proteoglycan was obtained from 16 liters of CTLL2 conditioned medium with 3.4% recovery. The activity to bind to CD44 was concentrated by 9,500-fold (Table 1).Figure 1DEAE-ion exchange chromatography profile of gp600 obtained by hydroxylapatite chromatography. The gp600 fraction from hydroxylapatite chromatography was applied to a TSKG-DEAE column. After washing, the column was eluted at 20°C with a linear gradient of NaCl as indicated. Fractions were analyzed for uronic acid; A530 (•), A280 (○), and A260 (□).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Specific Binding of CD44 to Gp600We first investigated the binding ability of purified gp600 to CD44 by ELISA. This was performed by examining the binding of soluble CD44-IgG to gp600 immobilized on a plastic plate. CD44-IgG bound to gp600 in a dose-dependent manner, while no significant binding was observed with control human-IgG (Fig. 2).Figure 2Binding of soluble CD44 to purified gp600. Increasing amounts of purified gp600 were immobilized on an ELISA plate, and the binding of CD44-IgG (•) and control human IgG (□) to gp600 was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined CD44 binding to gp600 by a cell binding assay. CD44 positive or negative cell lines were labeled with fluorescent dye, and the adherence of cells to immobilized gp600 was assessed by measuring fluorescence intensity. CD44 positive BW5147 cells adhered to both gp600 and hyaluronate in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations (Fig. 3). In contrast, CD44 negative CTLL2 cells failed to adhere to either gp600 or hyaluronate, but transfection of CTLL2 cells with CD44 cDNA (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994) resulted in a marked increase in adhesion. The binding of CD44 positive cells to both gp600 and hyaluronate was completely inhibited by an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody KM201 (Fig. 3) but not by control rat IgG or isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies (data not shown), indicating that cell adhesion to gp600 is mediated by CD44. Hyaluronidase had no effect on the binding of CD44 positive cell lines to gp600, although the binding to hyaluronate was completely eliminated by enzyme treatment (Fig. 3, right column), clearly indicating that hyaluronate is not involved in the interaction between CD44 and gp600.Figure 3CD44-dependent cell adhesion to immobilized gp600. CD44 positive (BW5147 and CTLL2MCD44-1) and negative (CTLL2) cell lines were labeled with fluorescent dye, and their binding to immobilized gp600 (left column) or hyaluronate (right column) was examined.

Ten amino acid residues were identified, identical to those found in the published sequence of mouse serglycin (Fig. 4B) (Avraham et al., 1989). Furthermore, a remarkable sequence similarity to rat (Bourdon et al., 1985) and human (Stevens et al., 1988b) serglycin was observed. No other significant sequence homology was found in the homology search (EMBL protein data base, release 27.0). The determined sequence contained a portion of the tandem serine-glycine repeats highly conserved among human, mouse, and rat serglycin. The fact that the assumed serine residues were not detected by amino acid sequencing may be due to extensive glycosylation of the serine residues and/or a relatively lower recovery of serine derivatives. A minor sequence, YDDYG, found in mouse serglycin, was also identified. Corroborating these findings, the molecular size of the core protein of gp600 is 18-22 kDa, quite similar to that of serglycin (Toyama-Sorimachi and Miyasaka, 1994). Polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed transcription of the serglycin gene in CTLL2 cells as well as its CD44 transfectants (data not shown). These results indicate that the core protein of gp600 is identical to that of serglycin.Figure 4Identification of gp600 core protein as serglycin. A, preparation of the gp600 core protein by degradation of the glycosaminoglycans with chondroitinase ABC. The core protein of gp600 was radiolabeled with Na125I by the lactoperoxidase method. A small amount of radiolabeled gp600 (104 cpm) was mixed with 1 mg of purified, unlabeled gp600 for detection of the core protein. After overnight treatment with chondroitinase ABC, the core protein was precipitated by adding acetone/ethanol. Gp600 (•) or gp600 treated with chondroitinase ABC (○) was applied to a gel filtration column. Fractions (No. 39-46) from gel filtration chromatography were pooled for NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. B, comparison of the amino acid sequences (single letter code) of the gp600 core protein with serglycin peptide cores expressed in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), rat basophilic leukemia-1 (RBL) cells, and human HL-60 cells. Numbers indicate the residue numbers in the respective sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Serglycin is known to localize in the secretory granules of granular leukocytes. Therefore, we examined immunohistologically whether soluble CD44 binds to intracellular secretory granules in CTLL2. It was revealed that CD44-IgG stained the cytoplasmic granules of CTLL2 distinctly while no significant fluorescence was observed with control human IgG (Fig. 5). A similar observation was obtained with interleukin-3-dependent mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (Fig. 5), which produce chondroitin sulfate-type serglycin in their secretory granules (Razin et al., 1982; Stevens et al., 1985). These results support the notion that CD44 binds to serglycin.Figure 10Immunofluorescence staining of intracellular granules of CTLL2 and mouse bone marrowderived mast cells with CD44-IgG.

To determine whether the chondroitinase-sensitive sugar chain on gp600 is necessary for CD44 binding, binding of CD44-IgG to gp600 was assayed by ELISA before and after the treatment of gp600 with various mucopolysaccharide degrading enzymes. The CD44-IgG reactivity was lost following digestion of gp600 with chondroitinase ABC or ACII but not with heparinase, heparitinase, fucosidase, or hyaluronidase (Fig. 6A). The effect of chondroitinase ABC was abolished in the presence of dermatan sulfate and Zn2+ which together inhibit specifically the enzymatic activity of chondroitinase ABC. These results indicate that the chondroitin sulfate sugar chains on gp600, which can be digested by chondroitinase ABC or ACII, are essential for recognition by CD44.Figure 6Quantitation of CD44-IgG binding to gp600 by ELISA after treatment with mucopolysaccharide degrading enzymes. A, binding of CD44-IgG to immobilized gp600. Purified gp600 (100 μg/ml) was coated on plastic plates before (lane 1) or after treatment with chondroitinase ABC (lane 2), chondroitinase ACII (lane 3), chondroitinase ABC in the presence of 100 mM Zn2+ and 1 mg/ml dermatan sulfate (lane 4), hyaluronidase (lane 5), heparinase (lane 6), heparitinase (lane 7), or fucosidase (lane 8). In lane 9, BSA was used instead of gp600. CD44-IgG binding was examined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, binding of CD44-IgG to various glycosaminoglycans. ELISA plates were coated with 1 mg/ml purified gp600 (lane 1), chondroitin (lane 2), hyaluronate (lane 3), chondroitin 4-sulfate (lane 4), chondroitin 6-sulfate (lane 5), dermatan sulfate (lane 6), heparan sulfate (lane 7), keratan sulfate (lane 8), keratan polysulfate (lane 9), heparin (lane 10), or BSA (lane 11) at 4°C overnight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the kind of chondroitin sulfate involved in CD44 recognition, disaccharide analysis was performed. Gp600 was completely digested with chondroitinase ABC and the disaccharides obtained were subjected to HPLC analysis. The digest eluted at the position of 4-sulfated disaccharides, and neither non-sulfated nor disulfated disaccharides were detected (Fig. 7). The mass spectrum of the digest also supported this observation (data not shown). These results indicate that gp600 is a chondroitin 4-sulfate type serglycin, and that chondroitin 4-sulfate chains on gp600 are essential for CD44 binding.Figure 7Disaccharide analysis of gp600 glycosaminoglycans by HPLC.

The elution positions of authentic unsaturated chondro-disaccharides are indicated. A, oligosaccharide obtained from gp600; B, A plus authentic ΔDi-4S. Disaccharide standard used are: ΔDi-0S, Δ4,5-GlcA(β1-3)GalNAc; ΔDi-6S, Δ4,5-GlcA(β1-3)GalNAc(6-O-sulfate); ΔDi-4S, Δ4,5-GlcA(β1-3)GalNAc(4-O-sulfate); ΔDi-diSD, Δ4,5GlcA(2-O-sulfate)(β1-3)GalNAc(6-O-sulfate); ΔDi-diSE, Δ4,5-GlcA(β1-3)GalNAc(4,6-O-sulfate); ΔDi-triS, Δ4,4-GlcA(2-O-sulfate)(β1-3) GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested the reactivity of CD44-IgG with various chondroitin sulfates by ELISA. Although the binding of CD44-IgG to gp600/serglycin and hyaluronic acid was readily detected, no significant binding to either chondroitin 4-sulfate or chondroitin 6-sulfate was observed (Fig. 6B). Similarly, these chondroitin sulfate preparations did not interfere with the binding of fluoresceinated hyaluronate to CD44-positive BW5147 cells, although gp600 strongly inhibited hyaluronate binding to CD44-positive cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Dose-dependent blockage of hyaluronate binding was observed with gp600, and almost complete blockage was obtained at 500 μg/ml (Table 2). These results suggest that the gp600 binding domain on CD44 overlaps with or is close to the hyaluronate binding portion. Chondroitin sulfates A and E were slightly effective at 500 μg/ml, but other chondroitin sulfates were inactive. The finding that none of the defined chondroitin 4-sulfates tested so far was recognized by CD44 suggests that the association of chondroitin sulfates with the core protein is important for CD44 binding.T"

Immunolocalizations confirmed that Xenopus oocytes injected with bovine MIP cRNA express the protein and target it to the plasma membrane. Control oocytes or oocytes expressing MIP or CHIP exhibited small, equivalent membrane currents that could be reversibly increased by osmotic swelling. When compared with water-injected control oocytes, the coefficient of osmotic water permeability (Pf) of MIP oocytes was increased 4-5-fold with a low Arrhenius activation energy, while the Pfof CHIP oocytes increased > 30-fold. To identify structures responsible for these differences in Pf, recombinant MIP proteins were expressed. Analysis of MIP-CHIP chimeric proteins revealed that the 4-kDa cytoplasmic domain of MIP did not behave as a negative regulator. Individual residues in MIP were replaced by residues conserved among the Aquaporins, and introduction of a proline in the 5th transmembrane domain of MIP raised the Pfby 50%. Thus oocytes expressing MIP failed to exhibit ion channel activity and consistently exhibited water transport by a facilitated pathway that was qualitatively similar to the Aquaporins but of lesser magnitude.

The cDNA encoding MIP was isolated from a bovine lens cDNA library, and hydrophobicity plots predicted that MIP is an integral membrane protein with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini and six bilayer-spanning domains (Gorin et al., 1984Gorin M.B.

In planar lipid bilayers, MIP forms single channels of various conductances (up to 3 nanosiemens) and a weak selectivity for anions (Ehring et al., 1990Ehring G.R. Zampighi G. Horwitz J. Bok D.

In spite of these studies with reconstituted MIP protein, studies of MIP in native membranes or expressed in oocytes have failed to confirm a physiologic function for MIP. For example, although MIP was initially considered to be the gap-junction protein, immunological, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies failed to identify electric coupling of lens fiber cells via MIP (Swenson et al., 1989Swenson K.I.

The model describes two tandem repeats with the first and second half of the molecule oriented at 180° to each other, and each half contains the sequence asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) in intracellular loop B and extracellular loop E. In the hourglass model, it was predicted that loop B and loop E fold back into the membrane, forming a single water-selective pore. The striking sequence homology with the Aquaporins suggests that MIP may also be involved in water movement through the lens fiber cell membranes.

BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 489-490PubMed Google Scholar) exchanging at Arg-226 of MIP and Arg-234 of CHIP, using the following antisense primers: MIP-CHIP-2, 5′-GTCTGTGAGGTCACTGCTG-CGAGGGAAGAGGAGAAAG-3′; CHIP-MIP-2, 5′-CTCAGAAACACTCTTGAGC-CGTGGGGCCAGGATGAAG-3′.The chimeric protein, MIP-CHIP (loop A), contains the first exofacial loop (A) of CHIP (amino acids 34-51) in place of the first exofacial loop of MIP (amino acids 33-43) and was constructed with an 82-base pair insertional-substitutional oligonucleotide primer (not shown) in a site-directed mutagenesis reaction. All mutations were confirmed by enzymatic nucleotide sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Capped RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T3 RNA polymerase with XbaI-digested MIP, CHIP, or mutant expression vector DNA, and the RNA was purified as described (Yisraeli and Melton, 1989Yisraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Preparation of Oocytes and Measurement of PfFemale Xenopus laevis were anesthetized on ice, and stage V and VI oocytes were removed and prepared (Lu et al., 1990Lu L.

The day after isolation, oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water or 0.5-25 ng of cRNA in 50 nl of water. Injected oocytes were maintained for 2-3 days at 18°C prior to osmotic swelling, membrane isolation, or voltage clamp experiments. Oocyte swelling was performed at 22°C following transfer from 200 mos M (osmin) to 70 mos M (osmout, CHIP) or either 70 or 20 mos M (osmout, MIP) modified Barth's solution diluted with water. Sequential oocyte images were digitized at 5-s intervals for a total of 1 min, and the volumes of the sequential images were calculated as described (Preston et al., 1993Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in relative volume with time, d(V/ V0)/ dt, was fitted by computer to a quadratic polynomal, and the initial rates of swelling were calculated. The osmotic water permeability (Pf, μm/s) was calculated from osmotic swelling data between 5 and 10 s, initial oocyte volume (V0= 9 × 10−4 cm3), initial surface area (S = 0.045 cm2), and the molar ratio of water (Vw= 18 cm3/mol)(Zhang et al., 1990Zhang R.

Biol. 1989; 107: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were isolated from groups of 4-30 oocytes, solubilized in 1.25% (w/v) SDS at 60°C for 10 min, electrophoresed into 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose (Davis and Bennett, 1984Davis J.Q.

Rabbits were injected with 400 μg of conjugated synthetic peptide mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant. After 4 weeks, and every 3 weeks thereafter, the rabbits were boosted with 200 μg of conjugated synthetic peptide mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The produced anti-MIP antiserum was tested for specificity and cross-reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Immunolocalization of MIP in Xenopus OocytesOocytes were frozen for immunofluorescence microscopy in Tissue-Tek mounting medium (Miles Inc.). Sections of 5 μm were cut by cryostat, collected on gelatin-coated slides, and fixed at room temperature for 5 min in 1% (w/v) periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde fixative (McLean and Nakane, 1974McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar). Sections were washed 3 times with TBS (0.9% NaCl, 25 m M Tris, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-MIP antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 in TBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum. After 3 washes with TBS, the sections were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma Immuno Chemicals) at a dilution 1:50 in TBS containing 10% (v/v) goat serum. After 3 more washes in TBS, the sections were embedded in Mounting Medium (Sigma) and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy.ElectrophysiologyStudies were carried out as described (Preston et al., 1992Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp with Clampex software. Water- and cRNA-injected oocytes were voltage-clamped at a holding membrane potential of −70 mV, repolarized to −90 mV, and depolarized to +50 mV in 20 mV step intervals. The membrane potential was returned to the holding potential between each step.RESULTSImmunolocalizationOocytes from X. laevis have provided the standard system for expression of water channels and measurement of their functional activity by a swelling assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression of MIP and insertion of the protein into the oocyte plasma membrane was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections. Oocytes injected with MIP cRNA showed a strong anti-MIP immunolabeling of the plasma membrane, whereas the cytoplasm showed only weak immunostaining (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblot analysis of isolated oocyte plasma membranes also showed a single strong signal at 27 kDa, confirming that MIP is targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B).FIG. 2A, immunofluorescence microscopy of control oocytes and oocytes expressing MIP. Frozen sections were prepared from Xenopus oocytes injected with 50 nl of water or 50 nl of water containing 10 ng of MIP cRNA and probed with anti-MIP antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”).

B, immunoblot of total protein (TP, equivalent of 0.2 oocytes) and plasma membranes (PM, equivalent of 15 oocytes) from oocytes expressing MIP.

Zampighi G. Horwitz J. Bok D. Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that MIP is an ion channel was tested by measuring the conductance of oocyte membranes expressing MIP with a two-microelectrode voltage clamp. In the absence of osmotic swelling, no differences in conductance were measured in oocytes injected with water, MIP cRNA, or CHIP cRNA (Fig. 3). The oocytes were placed in hypotonic medium, and, after being osmotically swollen to a similar size, membrane currents were again measured. Oocytes injected with water, MIP cRNA, or CHIP cRNA exhibited a similar increase in conductance. After replacing oocytes in isotonic buffer to cause shrinkage to the initial volume, the conductance decreased again to the initial values, although the shrinking process for water-injected oocytes was too slow for analysis (not shown).FIG. 3Membrane ion conductance. Voltage clamp was used to measure currents at voltages from −90 mV to +50 mV of water-injected control oocytes, oocytes injected with 25 ng of MIP cRNA, or oocytes injected with 0.5 ng of CHIP cRNA. The currents were determined in 200 mos M modified Barth's solution. The oocytes were swollen by replacing modified Barth's solution with a hypotonic medium, and current measurements were repeated. Control oocytes were placed in H2O, and the current was measured after 30 min. Oocytes expressing MIP and CHIP were placed in modified Barth's solution diluted from 200 to 70 mos M, and currents were measured after 20 and 30 s. Oocytes were shrunk back to their normal volume by replacing the hypotonic medium with isotonic modified Barth's solution, and currents in oocytes expressing MIP and CHIP were measured after 8 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Water Permeability of MIPOsmotic water permeability (Pf) of Xenopus oocytes was measured in hypotonic medium 3 days after injection with 50 nl of water or 10 ng of MIP or CHIP cRNA. Water-injected control oocytes swelled minimally (Pf= 10 ± 3.2 μm/s). Oocytes injected with MIP cRNA displayed a 4-5-fold increase in water permeability above the basal level of control oocytes (Pf= 45 ± 8.2 μm/s). A more than 30-fold increase in Pfwas exhibited by oocytes injected with the same amount of CHIP cRNA (Pf= 351 ± 43 μm/s, Fig. 4, A and B). Although the Pfof MIP-injected oocytes was only ∼15% of CHIP-injected oocytes, the MIP-injected oocytes had significantly greater Pfthan the control oocytes (p < 0.05, Fig. 4 A), a difference that was consistently reproduced in each of 14 independent experiments.FIG. 4A, increased osmotic water permeability of Xenopus oocytes expressing MIP and CHIP. Oocytes were injected with water or 10 ng of in vitro transcribed cRNA encoding MIP or CHIP. After 72 h, Ps were determined by video microscopic measurement of the rate of swelling after transfer to hypotonic medium. Shown are the means ± S.D. for 8 oocytes.

Water Movement Through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes: Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Water permeability of oocytes injected with 25 ng of MIP cRNA was measured at multiple temperatures; consistent with facilitated water transport, the activation energy was low (EA= 3.9 kcal/mol ± 1.4 kcal/mol, average of 4 experiments, Fig. 5). Indicative of diffusional water movement, the activation energies of water-injected oocytes were measured in two experiments (EA= 10 and 18 kcal/mol).FIG. 5Arrhenius activation energy (E) of osmotic water permeabilities of control oocytes and oocytes expressing MIP. The E was determined by measuring the P at 10, 20, and 30°C. Control oocytes were injected with water and MIP oocytes were injected with 25 ng of MIP cRNA. In this experiment, each point represents 7-10 control oocytes or 11-15 MIP oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chimeric MIP-CHIP ProteinsDomains of MIP and CHIP that might be of importance for the specific functional characteristics of the two proteins were exchanged, and the functional consequences were measured (Table I, Fig. 1). The MIP-CHIP (loop A) chimera represents a MIP molecule with residues 33-43 in loop A replaced by the residues 34-51 from the loop A of CHIP. The MIP-CHIP-1 and CHIP-MIP-1 chimeras contain the amino-terminal half of one molecule and the carboxyl-terminal half of the other spliced at a site in loop C where the tandem repeats are normally joined. The MIP-CHIP-2 and CHIP-MIP-2 chimeras are spliced at a site in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the molecules. When membranes of oocytes expressing each of these constructs were analyzed by immunoblot, polypeptides of the anticipated size were identified, and the levels of expression were comparable with oocytes expressing native MIP and CHIP proteins (not shown).Unlike all of the known Aquaporins, MIP does not contain a potential N-glycosylation site in either loop A or loop C, and no glycosylation of MIP was detected when the polypeptide was expressed in oocytes (Fig. 2 B). The MIP-CHIP (loop A) construct contains the CHIP glycosylation site at residue asparagine 42 in loop A. Despite the presence of a potential glycosylation site, oocytes expressing this construct still did not exhibit an increase in Pf, and immunoblots revealed a 27-kDa polypeptide but not higher molecular mass bands, indicating that N-glycosylation had still not occurred (not shown).Oocytes expressing MIP-CHIP-1 and CHIP-MIP-1 chimeras did not exhibit a significant increase in Pfabove water-injected controls, suggesting that these chimeric proteins cannot form functional water channels. Oocytes expressing MIP-CHIP-2 also exhibited Pfs similar to control oocytes. In contrast, oocytes expressing CHIP-MIP-2 were found to have Pfs similar to oocytes expressing wild-type CHIP (Fig. 6), indicating that the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of MIP does not interfere with the water-transporting domains of CHIP.FIG. 6Osmotic water permeability of oocytes expressing chimeric MIP-CHIP proteins.

A putative mercury-sensitive cysteine residue was introduced into MIP at position 181, which conforms to the mercury-sensitive cysteine 189 in CHIP, but the substitution MIP(A181C) did not confer mercury sensitivity to MIP (Fig. 7). The cysteine at position 14 in the amino-terminal domain of MIP was replaced by a valine, since other Aquaporins do not contain a cysteine at this position, but the Pfof C14V mutant MIP was not different from wild-type MIP (Fig. 8 A). MIP contains a proline in the second extracellular loop (residue 123 in loop C), a site where other members of the MIP family do not contain this residue. Introducing a proline at this position in CHIP (D131P) also did not change the Pf(Fig. 8 A).FIG. 7Osmotic water permeability and Hg2+ inhibition of oocytes expressing CHIP, MIP, or MIP (A181C). Oocytes were injected with 1 ng of CHIP cRNA or 10 ng of MIP cRNA or 10 ng of MIP(A181C) cRNA.

The P was measured 3 days after injection. Shown are the means ± S.D. *, p < 0.05 compared to water-injected oocytes, **, p < 0.05 compared with wild-type MIP. B, immunoblot comparison of total protein (TP, equivalent of 0.2 oocytes) or plasma membranes (PM, equivalent of 20 oocytes) from oocytes expressing MIP or the indicated MIP mutants.

When a proline was introduced in MIP (V160P), the substitution reproducibly enhanced the Pfby 50 ± 20% relative to the Pfof oocytes expressing wild-type MIP (Fig. 8 A). Notably, the amount of MIP protein expressed in oocytes was not different after injection of equal amounts of MIP cRNA and MIP(V160P) cRNA (Fig. 8 B). Although not large, this increase in Pfwas confirmed in each of five different experiments. A “gain of function” mutation suggests that the Pfof MIP can be increased by introducing subtle"

https://openalex.org/W1991785322,"Sensory transduction in olfactory receptors and photoreceptors is mediated by cyclic nucleotide-activated ion channels. We have studied the gating mechanism in olfactory and rod channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We report that the differences in cyclic nucleotide affinity and efficacy between these channels resulted from sequence differences outside the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, especially in the amino-terminal domain, influencing the free energy of the closed to open allosteric conformational change. In addition, Ni2+ inhibited activation of the olfactory channel, decreasing both the maximum current and the apparent affinity for cyclic nucleotides. Ni2+ exerted its effect by binding preferentially to the closed configuration of the channel, thereby destabilizing the opening conformational change. We have localized this inhibition to a single histidine (H396) following the last transmembrane segment, suggesting a role for this region in channel gating."

Moreover, recent reports have shown that the two TN-C isoforms bind to the cell surface through different receptors; in fact, the large TN-C isoform strongly interacts with annexin II in glioma and endothelial cells (29Chung C.Y.

Since extracellular matrix degradation is a crucial step in tumor invasion, a differential susceptibility of the different TN-C isoforms to the proteolytic enzymes released by neoplastic cells may take part in this mechanism. In particular, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to be produced by several tumor tissues and are involved in proteolytic degradation of tumor extracellular matrix. In fact, it has been reported that various murine and human tumor-derived cell lines transcribe, synthesize and secrete MMP enzymes (32McDonnell S. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). These enzymes are also synthesized and secreted by normal cells under conditions that may be associated with physiologic tissue remodeling. Here, we have compared the susceptibility of small and large TN-C isoforms to degradation by MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9. Results show that the large TN-C isoform is much more sensitive to MMP proteolytic activity. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with TN-C cDNA constructs (11Siri A. Carnemolla B. Saginati M.

Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two clones, HxB.L and HxB.S produce the large and the small TN-C splice variants, respectively (large TN-C and small TN-C). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone Europe Ltd. Cramlington, UK) containing 10% fetal calf serum obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Preparation and characterization of seven mAbs used has already been reported (35Balza E. Siri A. Ponassi M. Caocci F. Linnala A. Virtanen I. Zardi L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Three new mAbs, BC-8, BC-9, and BC-10, not previously described, have been characterized in this study using the procedure previously described (35Balza E. Siri A. Ponassi M. Caocci F. Linnala A. Virtanen I. Zardi L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) based on analysis of mAb reaction in immunoblotting with different TN-C-β-galactosidase fusion proteins. Recombinant MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9 were purified from conditioned culture medium of transfected NSO mouse myeloma cells essentially as previously described (36Koklitis P.A. Murphy G. Sutton C. Angal S. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Crabbe T. Willenbrock F. Eaton D. Hynds P. Carne A.F. Murphy G. Docherty A.J.P.

J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The purified proenzymes were activated by treatment with 1 m M aminophenyl-mercuric acetate for 1 h at 25°C (MMP-2) or 37°C (MMP-3, −7, and −9). Small and large TN-C splicing variants were purified from conditioned culture medium of BHK-transfected cell lines using an immunoadsorbent prepared with the mAb BC-4 as already reported (12Carnemolla B. Borsi L. Bannikov G. Troyanovsky S. Zardi L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Each isoform was more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the amount of TN-C was evaluated using the absorption coefficient A277(1 mg/ml, 1 cm) of 0.97 (1Erickson H.P. Bourdon M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). 300 μg of the two TN-C isoforms were incubated with either 5 μg of active MMP-7, 13 μg of active MMP-2, or 15 μg of active MMP-3 or MMP-9 in 100 m M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 m M NaCl, 5 m M CaCl2for 24 h at 37°C. The digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting carried out as previously reported (39Carnemolla B. Balza E. Siri A. Zardi L. Nicotra M.R. Bigotti A. Natali P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing of the fragments was performed by TIB MolBiol (Genoa, Italy). Fragments to be analyzed were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted on an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The bands were revealed by staining with Ponceau S (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and isolated by cutting the membrane. MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9 were used to digest the large TN-C isoform under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” The products obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and are shown in Fig. 1 A. The digests were also analyzed by immunoblotting using 10 mAbs specific for different epitopes of TN-C (see Fig. 3) and the NH2-terminal sequences of the major fragments were determined. Three different patterns were observed. MMP-7 degraded 100% of large TN-C molecules and three major fragments with molecular masses of 170, 65, and 16 kDa, were generated (fragments L-170, L-65, and L-16) (Fig. 1). Analysis of these bands by immunoblotting with specific mAbs is shown in Fig. 2 and Table I. According to molecular mass and reaction with the different mAbs, the L-170 band was identified as a fragment including the EGF-like repeats and the FN like repeats 1 to A2. From the molecular mass and mAb reactivity we deduced that the L-65 fragment contains the fibrinogen-like COOH-terminal knob plus the FN like repeats 6 to 8. The mAb BC-7, specific for an epitope located in the amino-terminal portion of the molecule, reacted with the L-16 band. Since no other band with a higher molecular mass was stained by this mAb, the results show that the cleavage of the amino-terminal sequence occurred in 100% of the large TN-C molecules.Table I:Reactivity of TN-C fragments with different monoclonal antibodiesTable I:Reactivity of TN-C fragments with different monoclonal antibodiesDigests obtained with MMP-7 and MMP-2 were analyzed in immunoblotting with 10 different TN-C-specific mAbs. Positive (+) or negative. (-) reaction of each resistant fragment identified in Fig. 1, A and B, is reported. The localization within the TN-C molecule of the epitopes recognized by the various mAbs is reported in Fig. 3. The numbers of NH2-terminal residue of four major fragments are reported. Digests obtained with MMP-7 and MMP-2 were analyzed in immunoblotting with 10 different TN-C-specific mAbs. Positive (+) or negative. (-) reaction of each resistant fragment identified in Fig. 1, A and B, is reported. The localization within the TN-C molecule of the epitopes recognized by the various mAbs is reported in Fig. 3. The numbers of NH2-terminal residue of four major fragments are reported. Three mAbs reacting with epitopes located in the splicing areas, α-A3, α-B, α-D, were negative both with fragment L-170 and with fragment L-65 (Table I), indicating that the MMP-7 completely degraded the FN-like repeats A3 to D included in the splicing area under these conditions. The model of the fragment generated by MMP-7 is depicted in Fig. 3. Amino-terminal sequences of the fragments L-170 and L-65 confirmed this degradation pattern (Fig. 3). MMP-2 and MMP-3 cleaved about 60% of the large TN-C isoform into two major fragments of about 190 and 120 kDa (fragments L-190 and L-120), respectively. The polypeptide pattern of the large TN-C digested by MMP-2 was analyzed on a 4-18% SDS-PAGE gradient using the conditions described under “Materials and Methods” and is shown in Fig. 1 A. Analysis of these fragments with specific mAbs (Table I) has demonstrated that the L-190 includes the amino-terminal end of the molecule, the EGF-like and the FN-like repeats 1 to A2. The 120-kDa fragment includes the FN-like repeats A4 to D and 6 to 8 as shown by mAb reaction and, according to the molecular mass, the fibrinogen like COOH-terminal sequence. The absence of reaction of mAb α-A3 with either L-190 or L-120 fragments suggests that its epitope in the A3 repeat is completely digested by these MMPs. The model of the fragment generated by MMP-2 is depicted in Fig. 3. Amino-terminal sequences of the fragment L-120 confirmed the pattern of degradation (Fig. 3). MMP-9 did not show detectable degradation of the large TN-C isoform (data not shown). All of the results of large TN-C-resistant fragment analysis by immunoblotting are summarized in Table I and in Fig. 3, which also shows the localization within the TN-C molecules of the epitopes recognized by the various mAbs and the amino-terminal sequences of the fragments. Small TN-C Isoform Digestion Digestion of the small TN-C isoform was carried out using the same enzymes and under the same conditions as for large TN-C. The results have shown that small TN-C is much more resistant than the large isoform. MMP-2, MMP-3 (small and large form) and MMP-9 do not cleave small TN-C. Only MMP-7 cleaves 100% of the molecules, giving two fragments detectable in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). One has an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa and the second of about 16 kDa (S-170 and S-16), respectively. Analysis with specific mAbs showed that the S-16 kDa is the NH2-terminal knob, while the S-170 fragment includes all the remaining part of the molecule from the beginning of the EGF-like repeats to the fibrinogen like COOH-terminal sequence. The model of the fragment generated by MMP-7 is depicted in Fig. 4. Amino-terminal sequence of the fragment S-170 confirmed this pattern of degradation (Fig. 4). The results are summarized in Table I. Degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a crucial step of tumor invasion and progression (33Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Although many proteases can cleave ECM molecules, MMPs are believed to be the main physiologically relevant mediators of matrix degradation (33Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 40Matrisian L.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 41Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). The human MMP family consists of at least 11 highly homologous zinc endopeptidases which are active at neutral pH and collectively cleave most, if not all, constituents of the ECM. More recently, it has been elegantly demonstrated that a mixed substrate of TN-C and FN collaborate in the up-regulation of collagenase (MMP-1), stromelysin (MMP-3), and gelatinase-B (MMP-9) gene expression by rabbit fibroblasts (42Tremble P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Werb Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), this phenomenon being dependent on an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal fibronectin-like type III repeats. Thus, transient alteration of the composition of the ECM by TN-C presence up-regulates the expression of genes involved in cell migration, tissue remodeling and invasion in regions of tissues undergoing morphological modifications. TN-C expression has been documented in a wide variety of solid tumor tissues (1Erickson H.P. Bourdon M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 17Sakakura T. Kusakabe M. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 111-116PubMed Google Scholar, 43Koukoulis G.K. Gould V.E.

Cancer. 1989; 4: 66-68Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, much evidence has shown an increased expression of the TN-C isoform with a higher molecular mass with the onset of neoplastic transformation both in vitro and in vivo (12Carnemolla B. Borsi L. Bannikov G. Troyanovsky S. Zardi L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Borsi L. Carnemolla B. Nicol G. Spina B. Tanara G. Zardi L. Int. J.

Neuroimmunol. 1992; 36: 41-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that proliferating cells produce only the large TN-C isoform, while resting cells mainly produce the small isoform (18Borsi L. Balza E. Castellani P. Carnemolla B. Ponassi M. Querzé G. Zardi L. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of TN-C sensitivity to proteolytic degradation may provide information about the mechanisms involved in ECM degradation. Little information is available about this topic. Friedlander et al. (45Friedlander D.R. Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2329-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) digested TN-C with chymotrypsin and separated the resistant fragments by gel filtration. Taylor et al. (46Taylor H.C. Lightner V.A. Beyer W.F. McCaslin D. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 41: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) described TN-C digestion by α-chymotrypsin and trypsin. However, the exact location of cleavage sites in the TN-C structure were not determined in these reports. More recently, Chiquet et al. (47Chiquet M. Vrucinic-Filipi N. Schenk S. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) analyzed resistant fragments obtained by digestion with pepsin and Pronase of chicken TN-C preparations enriched in small or large splicing variants. These authors have localized the resistant fragment in the TN-C molecule using specific mAbs and have shown that the large isoform is cleaved inside the spliced region. We have studied the degradation patterns of small and large human TN-C isoforms obtained with different MMPs, a group of enzymes which are known to be more highly expressed in neoplastic and remodeling tissues than in the corresponding normal adult tissues (33Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). We have been able to precisely localize the cleavage sites through the analysis of resistant fragments with mAbs whose epitope localization within the TN-C molecule was already known. Results were confirmed by determination of the NH2-terminal sequences of the major fragments and have shown that the presence of the spliced sequence strikingly modifies TN-C sensitivity to these enzymes. In fact, while large TN-C can be cleaved by MMP-7, −2, and −3 inside this sequence, small TN-C contains only a sensitive site close to the NH2-terminal knob that is cleaved by MMP-7. Degradation by MMPs of TN-C purified from human melanoma cells has recently been reported by Imai et al. (48Imai K. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Nakanishi I. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They found that TN-C produced by melanoma cells (essentially the large isoform) is sensitive to MMP-1, 3 and 7 degradation while it is resistant to MMP-2 and MMP-9. The data on MMP-2 digestion do not entirely agree with ours, even though degradation by this enzyme is only partial in our hands as well. However, these authors neither report information about the localization within the TN-C molecule of the cleavage sites nor compare the sensitivity of the two major TN-C isoforms to these enzymes. The greater sensitivity of the large TN-C isoform to MMP degradation, together with the higher expression of this isoform observed in neoplastic and remodeling tissues (25Tucker R.P. Brunso-Bechtold J.K. Jenrath D.A. Khan N.A. Poss P.M. Sweatt A.J. Xu Y. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 89-100PubMed Google Scholar, 49Mackie E.J. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 125-132PubMed Google Scholar), may support the hypothesis that the large TN-C isoform is a specific component of the provisional extracellular matrix and may contribute to the generation of a more suitable environment for cellular proliferation and migration. Furthermore, degradation by MMPs of TN-C could modify its biological activities. In fact, proteolytic cleavage may represent a tool to either abolish or unmask specific TN-C functional sites.

https://openalex.org/W1978208333,"Growth hormone (GH) has been shown to stimulate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases designated ERKs (extracellular signal regulated kinases) 1 and 2. One pathway by which ERKs 1 and 2 are activated by tyrosine kinases involves the Src homology (SH)-2 containing proteins SHC and Grb2. To gain insight into pathways coupling GH receptor (GHR) to MAP kinase activation and signaling molecules that might interact with GHR and its associated tyrosine kinase JAK2, we examined whether SHC and Grb2 proteins serve as signaling molecules for GH. Human GH was shown to promote the rapid tyrosyl phosphorylation of 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa SHC proteins in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts. GH also promoted binding of GHR and JAK2 to the SH2 domain of 46/52-kDa SHC protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Constitutively phosphorylated JAK2, from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with murine JAK2 cDNA, bound to SHC SH2-GST fusion protein, demonstrating that the SHC SH2 domain can bind tyrosyl-phosphorylated JAK2 in the absence of GHR. Regions of GHR required for GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHC were examined using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing mutated rat GHR. In cells expressing GHR1-638 and GHR1-638(Y333,338F), GH stimulated phosphorylation of all 3 SHC proteins whereas GH stimulated phosphorylation of only the 66- and 52-kDa SHC proteins in cells expressing GHR1-454. GH had no effect on SHC phosphorylation in cells expressing GHR1-294 or GHRΔP, the latter lacking amino acids 297-311 containing the proline-rich motif required for JAK2 activation by GH. In contrast to SHC, Grb2 appeared not to interact directly with GHR or JAK2. However, Grb2 was shown to associate rapidly with SHC proteins in a GH-dependent manner. These findings suggest that GH stimulates: 1) the association of SHC proteins with JAK2•GHR complexes via the SHC-SH2 domain, 2) tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHC proteins, and 3) subsequent Grb2 association with SHC proteins. These events are likely to be early events in GH activation of MAP kinases and possibly of other responses to GH.

Two members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of receptor/tyrosine kinases, p180erbB3 and p180erbB4, serve as receptors for the HRG ligand. While HRG appears to be capable of stimulating the autophosphorylation activity of p180erbB4, the co-expression of p185erbC2erbC2neu with p180erbB3 is necessary for the HRG-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both of these receptors. On the basis of the sequences surrounding their putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, we predict that the different HRG-responsive receptors couple to different intracellular SH2 domain-containing proteins. Hence, the different receptors may mediate different cellular responses to the HRG ligand. In the present study we show that HRGβ1 is mitogenic for erbB3-transfected DHFR/G8 cells, an NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast derivative that overexpresses p185erbC2neu. HRG stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of these cells with an EC50 of 70 ± 7 pM. HRG was not mitogenic for parental DHFR/G8 cells that do not express the ErbB3 protein. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, an enzyme believed to be important in cellular growth regulation by growth factors and oncogenes, is predicted to couple to tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB3. We observed that HRG stimulated the association of PI 3-kinase with both p185erbC2neu and ErbB3 in transfected DHFR/G8 cells, but not in the parental cell line.

HRG was originally proposed to be a ligand for p185erbC2neu on the basis of its ability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of that receptor, as well as its ability to become covalently cross-linked to p185erbC2neu in various cancer cells. However, HRG does not interact with p185erbC2neu in all cells that express this receptor(8Peles E. Ben-Levy R. Tzahar E. Liu N. Wen D. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that p180erbB3 is a receptor for HRG(9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W.

Interestingly, it appears that p180erbB3 is incapable of mediating transmembrane signaling in response to HRG, probably because it possesses an impaired intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity(11Guy P.M.

We have observed that the co-expression of p180erbB3 with p185erbC2neu is necessary for the heregulin-stimulated phosphorylation of both receptors, and for the creation of a high-affinity binding site for HRG (10Sliwkowski M.X.

On the basis of these observations, we have proposed that a ligand-stimulated receptor heterodimerization event is responsible for transmembrane signaling(12Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C.

HRG also appears to be a ligand for p180erbB4, although in this case a receptor heterodimerization event is not required to mediate signal transduction(13Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M.

The diverse responses elicited by HRG undoubtedly arise from differences in the cellular signaling pathways emanating from activated receptors. Hence, interest has developed in characterizing the intracellular proteins that might participate in cellular responses to HRG. p180erbB3 is unique among the EGF receptor family members in that it possesses several putative phosphorylation sites that fit the consensus for binding phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, an enzyme implicated in the regulation of cellular growth and transformation(16Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). It has been observed that the treatment of some cells with EGF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p180erbB3 and the recruitment of PI 3-kinase to this receptor(17Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 18Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that p180erbB3 may play a role in coupling PI 3-kinase to the action of EGF-like growth factors, in a manner analogous to that whereby insulin receptor substrate-1 couples PI 3-kinase to insulin action (19White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of the studies described in this report was to determine whether ErbB3 mediates HRG-dependent cell growth and whether PI 3-kinase associates with the ErbB3 protein in response to HRG stimulation. Anti-p185erbB2 monoclonal antibody 3E8, rHRGβ1177-244 and iodinated growth factor were the generous gifts of Dr. M. Sliwkowski (Genentech, Inc.). [3H]Thymidine was purchased from Amersham. Anti-p85 (N-SH2) was described previously(17Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Anti-ErbB3 peptide antibody 3184 was raised to the same peptide as antibody 3185(9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C.

Affinity-purified anti-ErbB3 peptide antibody 3183 was prepared as described previously(11Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

D33 cells were prepared by transfecting DHFR/G8 cells with bovine erbB3 under the MMTV promoter using the pMAMneo plasmid (Clontech), as described previously(9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and colonies were screened for ErbB3 expression by [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 binding. Briefly, stably transfected and selected cells were grown in six-well dishes to 70-90% confluence. Cells were then simultaneously treated with dexamethasone and serum starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% calf serum. Serum-starved cells were then treated for 30 min at room temperature with [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 (0.1 nM, 1400 Ci/mmol) in the absence and presence of 50 nM unlabeled rHRGβ1177-244. Wells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells solubilized in RIPA buffer. Scatchard analysis and covalent cross-linking of [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 to cells were carried out as described previously(9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of either Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES/Na, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 250 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride) or RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 250 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride). Lysates were cleared by a 15-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of anti-p185erbB2 monoclonal 3E8(20Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar), 1.5 μg of affinity-purified anti-ErbB3 peptide antibody 3184, or 3 μg of antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, and analyzed by 6 or 7% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-ErbB3 3183, anti-p85 (N-SH2), or antiphosphotyrosine. Lipid kinase assays with immunoprecipitates were carried out as described previously(17Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). 8 × 104 cells were plated in 6-well dishes, grown for 24 h, and then serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% calf serum for another 48 h. Cells were then simultaneously treated with 40 ng/ml dexamethasone and growth factors (in triplicate) for 12 h. 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (85 Ci/mmol) was then added to each well, and cells were incubated another 6 h. Cells in wells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized in 0.1 M NaOH. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For experiments including wortmannin, either Me2SO (final concentration 0.1%) or wortmannin (Sigma) in Me2SO was added 30 min prior to the addition of growth factors. Since the presence of p185erbB2neu is required for ErbB3 to mediate a biochemical response to HRG(10Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to express ErbB3 in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress p185erbB2neu. DHFR/G8 is a clone of NIH3T3 cells that was originally stably transfected with rat erbB2/neu cDNA(21Hung M.-C. Schechter A.L. Chevray P.-Y.M. Stern D.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These cells express high levels of p185erbB2neu (3 × 105 molecules per cell), but are not phenotypically transformed. DHFR/G8 cells were transfected with bovine erbB3 cDNA under the MMTV promoter, and stably transfected clones were selected by G418 resistance. As an initial screen for ErbB3 expression, clones were analyzed for their ability to specifically bind [125I]rHRGβ1177-244, the bacterially-expressed EGF-like domain of human HRG(5Holmes W.E.

Fig. 1 shows the binding of 0.1 nM [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 to several of the selected cell lines, in the presence and absence of an excess of unlabeled rHRGβ1177-244. The DHFR/G8 parental cells had no detectable affinity for [125I]rHRGβ1177-244, indicating that these cells do not express significant levels of either ErbB3 or ErbB4. However, many of the selected cell lines were capable of specifically binding the iodinated growth factor. Clone D33 was selected for further analysis. Scatchard analysis revealed that these cells bind the labeled growth factor with a Kd of ∼20 pM, and express modest levels (2-3 × 104 receptors/cell) of HRG receptors. 2R. W. Akita and M. X. Sliwkowski, unpublished observations. Fig. 2A shows the covalent cross-linking of [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 to the surface of DHFR/G8 parental cells and D33 transfectants. We observed that the 7-8 kDa iodinated growth factor cross-linked to three protein species in D33 cells, producing radiolabeled bands at ∼175, ∼190, and >300 kDa (right lane). The appearance of these bands could be blocked with 50 nM unlabeled rHRGβ1177-244 (middle lane), indicating that the labeled bands represent receptors for HRG. In addition, no labeled bands were observed after cross-linking [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 to the parental DHFR/G8 cells (left lane), indicating that ErbB3 expression is required for [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 binding activity. All three bands could be immunoprecipitated from RIPA lysates of D33 cells with anti-ErbB3 (not shown). These observations together with our previous results (9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sliwkowski M.X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the 175- and 190-kDa bands represent [125I]rHRGβ1177-244 cross-linked to monomeric ErbB3 (see below), while the >300-kDa band represents a ligand-bound heterodimer of the ErbB3 with p185erbB2neu. To further demonstrate the expression of ErbB3 in transfected cells, we analyzed anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates from DHFR/G8 and D33 cells by immunoblotting with anti-ErbB3 antibodies. RIPA lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ErbB3 antibody 3184, precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-ErbB3 antibody 3183. As shown in Fig. 2B, a strong band of ∼170 kDa and a weaker band of ∼185 kDa was observed, but only in the D33 transfectants. Interestingly, treatment of D33 cells with HRG caused a shift in the mobility of both bands, consistent with a stimulation of ErbB3 phosphorylation. Immunoblotting of similar anti-ErbB3(3184) immunoprecipitates with antiphosphotyrosine revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of both bands was markedly increased after treatment of D33 cells with rHRGβ1177-244 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the cross-linking and immunoblotting data suggest that ErbB3 is expressed in transfected DHFR/G8 cells as a doublet. A similar doublet was observed when wild type NIH3T3 cells were transfected with bovine erbB3(9Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies indicate that ErbB3 in human cancer cells migrates as a single ∼180-kDa species (22Kraus M.H. Pedi P. Starks V. Muraro R. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2900-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and when we expressed this same bovine erbB3 clone in COS cells, a single 180-kDa species was also observed(10Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the presence of the 171-kDa band varied in extent from one experiment to the next, we suspect that NIH3T3 cells and their derivatives may partially proteolyze or only partially glycosylate the ErbB3 protein. We have observed that both bands may be immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an antibody made to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of ErbB3 (not shown). This suggests that the faster migrating species is not deleted in its tail region, and that all the putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites are present in this form. To test whether ErbB3 is capable of mediating mitogenesis in NIH3T3 derivatives, we examined the uptake of [3H]thymidine by serum-starved DHFR/G8 and D33 cells after HRG, PDGF, or serum treatment. Fig. 3A shows the results of a representative experiment. While some variation was observed from one experiment to the next, 10% calf serum reproducibly stimulated the uptake of [3H]thymidine in both DHFR/G8 and D33 cells by 4-15-fold. 10 ng/ml PDGF consistently stimulated thymidine uptake by both cell lines to an extent of 40-60% of that observed with serum. 5 nM rHRGβ1177-244 also stimulated the thymidine uptake to an extent of 40-60% of that observed with serum, but only in the D33 transfectants. A dose-response analysis for rHRGβ1177-244-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake by D33 cells yielded a half-maximal response at 70 nM (Fig. 3B), in rough agreement with the observed dissociation constant. These observations indicate that ErbB3 is capable of mediating a mitogenic response to HRG when expressed in rodent fibroblasts. ErbB3 possesses six putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its carboxyl-terminal tail region that fit the YXXM motif known to mediate associations with the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase(23Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Other members of the class I subfamily do not contain this phosphorylated motif, suggesting that ErbB3 may be unique in its ability to directly associate with PI 3-kinase. Indeed, we and others have observed that treatment of some human cancer cells with EGF stimulates the association of PI 3-kinase with ErbB3 but not EGF receptor or p185erbB2neu(17Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 18Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the involvement of PI 3-kinase in HRG signaling, we first examined stringently washed antireceptor immunoprecipitates for lipid kinase activity. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4A, DHFR/G8 and D33 cells were treated without and with rHRGβ1177-244 and then Nonidet P-40 lysates were prepared. Antiphosphotyrosine, anti-p185erbB2neu, and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates from lysates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity, and the stimulation of lipid kinase activity associated with the various immunoprecipitates by rHRGβ1177-244 was determined for the two cell lines. We observed that HRG stimulated the association of PI 3-kinase with antiphosphotyrosine and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates in the D33 transfectants by ∼5-fold, and its association with anti-p185erbB2neu immunoprecipitates by ∼2-fold. No stimulation was observed in any of the immunoprecipitations from the DHFR/G8 parental cells. The stimulation of associated PI 3-kinase activity with immunoprecipitates correlated with a stimulation of association with the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4B, antiphosphotyrosine, anti-p185erbB2neu, and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates from DHFR/G8 and D33 cells were analyzed for the presence of p85 by immunoblotting. We observed an increased level of p85 in the various immunoprecipitates only in the D33 cells that had been treated with rHRGβ1177-244. Since immunoblotting with antireceptor antibodies revealed identical levels of receptor in the anti-p185erbB2neu and anti-ErbB3 immunoprecipitates (not shown), these results indicate that PI 3-kinase is recruited to both the ErbB3 and p185erbB2neu receptors upon activation with HRG (see “Discussion”). To determine whether PI 3-kinase might contribute to HRG-stimulated mitogenesis, we examined the effect of wortmannin on [3H]thymidine uptake in D33 cells. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that has been demonstrated to covalently bind to the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. At a concentration of 100 nM wortmannin specifically targets PI 3-kinase, and inhibits >90% of its lipid kinase activity. 3B. C. Duckworth, L. Rameh, A. Kazlauskas, and L. C. Cantley, manuscript in preparation. We treated D33 cells for 30 min without or with 100 nM wortmannin prior to the initiation of a thymidine uptake assay. (The conditions of the assay were identical to those used in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3A.) We observed that wortmannin only modestly inhibited the basal and serum-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake in D33 cells. However, wortmannin reproducibly inhibited PDGF-stimulated thymidine uptake by ∼75% and rHRGβ1177-244-stimulated uptake by ∼45% (Table 1). These results suggest that the activation of PI 3-kinase activity by HRG significantly contributes to the mitogenic response of erbB2- and erbB3-transfected fibroblasts to this growth factor.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A number of reports suggest that members of the HRG family are mitogenic for a variety of cell types, including cultured Schwann cells (7Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D.J.

The observed differences in cellular responses to the HRGs must arise from differences in the signaling pathways engaged by the growth factor in the different cells. An obvious point of divergence concerns the receptors present at the surfaces of HRG-responsive cells. Members of the HRG family can bind to either p180erbB3 or p180erbB4(9Carraway III, K.L.

HRG stimulation of p180erbB4 is similar to that of the activation of EGF receptor by EGF; ligand binding stimulates receptor autophosphorylation. On the other hand, although HRG binds with relatively high affinity to p180erbB3, interaction of the ligand with this receptor appears not to be sufficient for the stimulation of p180erbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation, probably because p180erbB3 has an impaired kinase activity(11Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). It appears that the presence of p185erbB2neu is necessary for p180erbB3 to respond to HRG(10Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably the outcome of a ligand-stimulated receptor heterodimerization event(12Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimeric complex is capable of mediating a proliferative response to HRG. To address this question, we employed the DHFR/G8 cell line, an NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast derivative that expresses high levels of p185erbB2neu(21Hung M.-C. Schechter A.L. Chevray P.-Y.M. Stern D.F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p185erbB2neu is very high, these cells are not transformed and their growth responses to serum and PDGF are quite similar to wild-type NIH3T3 cells (not shown). These observations suggest that the abundance of p185erbB2neu and its basal phosphorylation do not significantly affect the growth properties of the cells. Hence, these cells provide an ideal system for examining cellular responses to HRG after introduction of the ErbB3 receptor. We observed that the treatment of erbB3-transfected DHFR/G8 cells with HRGβ1 resulted in a marked stimulation of ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, because of its high degree of basal autophosphorylation it was impossible to discern an effect of HRG treatment on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p185erbB2neu (not shown). Our results indicate that ErbB3 mediates a mitogenic response of rodent fibroblasts to HRGβ1 by acting as a receptor for the HRG ligand. Although ErbB3 expression in this system is necessary, it appears that it is not sufficient to mediate the mitogenic response; the presence of p185erbB2neu also appears to be required for growth signaling. We have observed that clones of erbB3-transfected NIH3T3 cells give a very weak and often undetectable mitogenic response to HRGβ1, 4K. L. Carraway III, S. P. Soltoff, A. J. Diamonti, and L. C. Cantley, unpublished observations. consistent with the observation that there is a relatively low amount of endogenous p185erbB2neu in these cells. Since the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the ErbB3 receptor appears to be impaired relative to other members of the class I receptor family(11Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and since p185erbB2neu is already heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells, it is possible that the mitogenic effect of HRG is due exclusively to the cross-phosphorylation of ErbB3 by p185erbB2neu(12Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). On the basis of peptide selection experiments with various SH2 domains(23Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), it appears that p180erbB3 has the potential to interact with a different subset of intracellular signaling proteins than the other three members of the EGF receptor family(12Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Among the proteins predicted to interact uniquely with the p180erbB3 receptor is p85, the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase(12Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 17Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We have observed that both p85 and PI 3-kinase activity associate with ErbB3 in HRG-treated D33 cells. The observation that wortmannin significantly inhibits HRG-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake in D33 cells strongly suggests that PI 3-kinase is a major contributor to the HRG/ErbB3 mitogenic pathway. Interestingly, PI 3-kinase also appears to associate with p185erbB2neu in these cells, even though no p85 binding sites exist in this receptor. We propose that the observed association of PI 3-kinase with p185erbB2neu results from the co-immunoprecipitation of a HRG-stimulated heterodimeric complex of ErbB3 with p185erbB2neu. This notion is supported by our very recent observations that HRG promotes the co-immunoprecipitation of p185erbB2neu with anti-ErbB3 and vice versa. 5S. P. Soltoff, K. L. Carraway III, and L. C. Cantley, manuscript in preparation. On the basis of the observations presented here, we conclude that the ErbB2-ErbB3 receptor complex is capable of mediating a mitogenic response in rodent fibroblasts, and that PI 3-kinase is involved in this response. Future experiments will be aimed at determining the role of the p180erbB4 receptor in mediating cellular responses to HRG.

In experiments with mammalian cells, RCC1, the abundant nuclear guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the guanosine triphosphatase Ran/TC4, was shown to be required for nucleocytoplasmic transport of precursors of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), intranuclear transport of U3 snRNA, and processing of ribosomal RNAs, but not for export of transfer RNAs. It is proposed that guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Ran/TC4 associates with ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) during intranuclear movement, and that GTP hydrolysis promotes deposition of RNPs at targeted sites such as NPCs or nucleoli."

In kinetoplastid protozoa, RNA editing is a post-transcriptional RNA-processing event that occurs in the mitochondrion and results in the addition and deletion of uridine residues at specific sites in mRNA transcripts. Editing produces the sequence information necessary for functional RNAs by correcting frameshifts, creating start codons, or in some cases, forming complete reading frames(1Stuart K. Annu. Rev.

The genetic information necessary to direct the insertion or deletion of uridine residues in these mRNAs is present in small, 55-70-nucleotide primary transcripts called guide RNAs (gRNAs). 1The abbreviations used are: gRNAguide RNADTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPEIpolyethyleneimineRNPribonucleoprotein particleAMP-CPPadenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphateAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateAppGadenylyl (5′,5′) guanosineAppNadenylyl (5′,5′) nucleoside.

The uridine tail may donate or accept uridines during the editing process through the formation of a chimeric gRNA/mRNA molecule consisting of the gRNA covalently linked via the poly(U) tail to the 3′ segment of the mRNA(10Blum B.

The gRNA also contains a short 7-10-nucleotide anchor region at its 5′-end which is complementary to the pre-edited sequences immediately 3′ to the editing site. The anchor region recognizes and base pairs with unedited mRNA and directs the initiation of the editing process.

Göringer H.U. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Nature. 1992; 356: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), two models have been proposed for the mechanism of kinetoplastid mRNA editing. The first, similar to the mechanism of mRNA splicing, involves successive rounds of trans-esterification(10Blum B. Sturm N.R. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. Cell. 1991; 65: 543-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Cech T.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 667-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this model the 3′-hydroxyl of the poly(U) tail of the guide makes a nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bond at the editing site, producing a free 5′ mRNA segment and a chimeric RNA. This chimera is resolved in a second trans-esterification event involving the 3′-hydroxyl of the free 5′ mRNA segment to produce an edited mRNA that has one or more uridines inserted or deleted and a gRNA that has the corresponding change in the length of its poly(U) tail. The second model proposes multiple rounds of cleavage-ligation and draws analogies from the mechanism of tRNA splicing. In this scheme, the gRNA-mRNA chimera is formed by endonuclease and RNA ligase activities(15Harris M. Decker C. Sollner-Webb B. Hajduk S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2591-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The pre-edited mRNA is cleaved by an endonuclease at the editing site and RNA ligase joins the gRNA to the 3′-fragment of the mRNA producing the chimeric molecule. The chimera is resolved by a second round of cleavage and ligation. Support for the cleavage-ligation mechanism comes from the identification of mitochondrial RNPs which are thought to be involved in RNA editing(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These were shown by glycerol gradient sedimentation of mitochondrial extract to consist of two ribonucleoprotein particles which sedimented as 19 S and 35-40 S complexes containing RNA ligase, chimera formation, and terminal uridylyl-transferase activities. Uridylyl-transferase presumably is required for addition of the nonencoded poly(U) tail to the gRNA. These results led us to examine the role of the RNA ligase in chimera formation. The mechanism of RNA ligation has been studied for ligases from wheat germ(17Konarska M. Filipowicz W. Gross H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Konarska M. Filipowicz W. Domdey H. Gross H.J.

Cell. 1983; 32: 537-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and T4-infected Escherichia coli cells (reviewed in (20Uhlenbeck O.C. Gumport R.I. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, Vol. 15. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 31-58Google Scholar)). Even though the enzymes differ in the structures of their substrates and products, their overall mechanisms are quite similar. The T4 enzyme, for example, joins RNAs with a 5′-phosphate to 3′-hydroxyl termini in three distinct and reversible steps:1. E + ATP ⇌ E-AMP + PPi 2. E-AMP + pN- ⇌ E + AppN- 3. -NOH+ AppN- ⇌ -NpN- + AMP The first step involves the adenylylation of the enzyme (E), by the transfer of AMP from ATP, via phosphoamide linkage with a lysine residue on the protein. In the second step, AMP from the adenylylated enzyme is transferred to the 5′-phosphate of the RNA molecule forming an activated RNA molecule with a 5′,5′-phosphoanhydride bond. In the third and final step, the 3′-hydroxyl of the same or different RNA molecule attacts the activated RNA forming a phosphodiester bond and releasing AMP. In this report we provide the first direct evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial RNA ligase in the production of RNA editing intermediates. The RNA ligase activity present in the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei has similar substrate requirements and the same overall mechanism as previously characterized RNA ligases. We identify adenylylated RNA ligase intermediates in the 19 S and 35-40 S complexes, along with chimera activity, and demonstrate their involvement in the mechanism of in vitro chimera formation. The involvement of RNA ligase in the in vitro reaction provides strong evidence for a cleavage-ligation type mechanism of RNA editing. All radioisotopes were from DuPont NEN. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and snake venom phosphodiesterase were from Worthington. T4 kinase and RNA ligase were from Life Technologies, Inc. Polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer sheets and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate were obtained from Aldrich. Sodium periodate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium phosphate, yeast pyrophosphatase, and all nucleotides and ATP analogs were obtained from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from BioWhittaker. Procyclic T. brucei TREU 667 were grown at 26°C in semidefined medium (23Cunningham J. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or in SDM-79 medium (24Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected when they reached a density of 1-1.5 × 107 cells/ml (or 2-2.5 × 107 cells/ml when grown in SDM-79). Mitochondria were isolated as described by Braley et al.(25Braley P. Simpson L. Kretzer F. J. Protozool. 1974; 21: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Rohrer et al.(26Rohrer S.P. Michelotti E.F. Torri A.F. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1987; 49: 625-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial extract was prepared and sedimented on a 10-30% glycerol gradient as described by Pollard et al.(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) except that 1 × 1010 cell equivalents of mitochondria were loaded onto each gradient and centrifuged for 8 h. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 20 μl of each glycerol gradient fraction, 6.5 μM [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and buffer (final concentrations, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM DTT, and 50 mM potassium chloride). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 26°C and stopped with the addition of 3 volumes of acetone (−20°C). Precipitated protein was recovered and washed with 70% acetone, and the pellet was dried. Pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer(21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), boiled for 3 min, and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Adenylylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 400 μl of a glycerol gradient fraction, corresponding to the peak of RNA ligase, was incubated with [α-32P]ATP under the conditions described above for 15 min at 26°C. The reactions were then loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 fine column (0.8 × 23 cm) previously equilibrated with 10% glycerol gradient buffer(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fractions (200 μl) were collected, and radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. The peak fractions eluting in the void volume (containing the adenylylated proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE and PEI cellulose TLC) were pooled and treated as described in the text. When investigating the release of AMP from the ligase, the incubation with [α-32P]ATP was followed by an additional 15-min incubation with unlabeled ATP (0.5 mM final concentration). This was done to maximize the adenylylated ligase as well as to displace bound, labeled ADP. ADP generated by an ATPase activity present in the extract interferes with the TLC analysis. Free nucleotides were also removed by dialysis. The extract, which was adenylylated with [α-32P]ATP and chased with ATP as described above, was dialyzed against 1 liter (three changes) of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM potassium chloride, 5% glycerol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4°C for 16 h. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) containing 20 μl of glycerol gradient extract (complex I), 6.5 μM [α-32P]ATP, buffer (final concentrations: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM DTT, and 50 mM potassium chloride), and 8 pM 5′-P nonligatable substrate (prepared as described below) were incubated for 90 min at 26°C. Reactions were treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37°C, and RNAs were run on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Incubation of the isolated adenylylated proteins (as described in Fig. 2, B and C) also resulted in the formation of an adenylylated RNA intermediate. However, with the use of extract directly off the glycerol gradient and excess [α-32P]ATP, we were able to increase the yield for further analysis. The adenylylated substrate was also chemically synthesized essentially as described by Sninsky et al.(22Sninsky J.J. Last J.A. Gilham P.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 3157-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). [5′-32P]RNA substrate (1.5 × 105 cpm) was dried down and dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 M AMP, 0.1 M MgCl2 (pH 5.0) and mixed with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (40 mg). The reaction was incubated for 24 h at 26°C and diluted with 100 μl of H2O, and the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The resulting RNA was then treated with 0.1 unit of bacterial alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37°C. After proteinase K treatment, extraction with phenol-chloroform, followed by chloroform, the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Substrates for the RNA ligase assay (containing 5′-P and 3′-OH) consisted of an in vitro generated T3 transcript of BSSK+ plasmid cleaved by AccI. The 5′- and 3′-terminal nucleotides were identified as G and A, respectively, by nuclease P1 and T2 analysis (data not shown). The 100-nucleotide RNA was bacterial alkaline phosphatase-treated and kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase and in the presence of either ATP or [γ-32P]ATP. The substrate was made nonligatable by oxidation of the free 3′-terminal hydroxyl group with a 100-fold excess of sodium periodate (NaIO4) in 0.15 M sodium acetate pH 5.3(27Douthwaite S. Garrett R.A. Wagner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Fraenkel-Conrat H. Steinschneider A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12B: 243-246Google Scholar). After 2 h at 4°C, sucrose (500-fold molar excess over NaIO4) was added to inactivate excess NaIO4, and the RNAs were precipitated two times with ethanol. Two RNA ligase assays were used. The first, measured by the ability to label an RNA substrate with [5′-32P]pCp, was performed essentially as described by Pollard et al.(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Synthetic pre-edited cytochrome b mRNA (1-5 μg) was incubated with 20 μl of extract, 10 μCi of pCp and buffer (final concentrations: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, 15% glycerol, and 0.5 mM ATP, except were noted) in a final volume of 30 μl at 26°C for 1.5 h. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 170 μl of stop buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9) and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. After extraction with phenol-chloroform, and chloroform, the RNAs were precipitated and then run on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Products were visualized by autoradiography. In the second RNA ligase assay, reaction mixtures (40 μl) contained 35 μl of the G-50 fraction incubated with 15,000 cpm of [5′-32P]RNA substrate (BSSK+ transcript described above) plus buffer (final concentration, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 0.25 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol) at 26°C for 90 min. Reactions were terminated, and RNAs were recovered and electrophoresed as above. This second RNA ligase assay allowed the visualization of AMP release without interference from [5′-32P]pCp in the TLC analysis. Chimera formation assays were performed as described by Harris and Hajduk(12Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Synthetic cytochrome b gRNA (100,000 cpm), uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mM), was incubated with unlabeled synthetic pre-edited cytochrome b mRNA (10 pM) in the presence of 20 μl of extract in buffer (final concentrations: 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mM ATP, except where noted) in a final volume of 30 μl at 26° for 1.5 h. Reactions were terminated with stop buffer, the RNAs extracted and precipitated as above and electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. The gel was visualized by autoradiography. Nuclease P1 incubations used 1 unit of enzyme in 5 μl of 20 mM NH4OAc, pH 5, for 2 h at 37°C. The reactions were then heated at 80°C for 4 min, dried down, and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mM MgCl2. Subsequent digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase was with the addition of 0.02 unit of enzyme and incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The samples were applied to thin layer plates for analysis upon completion of the incubations. Nucleotide analyses were carried out by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates developed with 1.5 M LiCl. After application of the samples, the plates were washed in methanol prior to development. Previous studies have shown that RNA ligase and chimera forming activities cosediment on glycerol gradients (16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, it was important to further characterize the ligase and investigate its possible involvement in the generation of the chimeric molecule. To determine whether an adenylylated ligase intermediate could be detected, mitochondrial extracts were separated on glycerol gradients and proteins were adenylylated by incubation of the fractions with [α-32P]ATP. Adenylylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1C). Two labeled proteins of approximately 57 and 50 kDa were visualized. Endoprotease mapping and ATP affinity experiments indicated that the two proteins have different amino acid sequences and binding affinities for ATP (data not shown). The stability of the label to heating in the presence of SDS, during sample preparation for SDS-PAGE, suggests a covalent linkage. The labeled molecules are proteinase K-sensitive and do not become labeled following incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). The distribution of these adenylylated proteins in the glycerol gradients coincides with RNA ligase and chimera activities (Fig. 1, A-C). These results show that the adenylylated proteins are components of mitochondrial RNPs, possibly representing ligase intermediates. The stability of the labeled proteins to heating in SDS suggested a covalent linkage of the AMP to the protein as predicted for ligase intermediates (Fig. 1C). Aliquots of the isolated adenylylated proteins were subjected to various treatments to determine the nature of the E-AMP linkage (Table 1). The AMP-protein linkage was stable to boiling at neutral or alkaline pH, while boiling in 0.15 N HCl rendered the labeled material acid soluble. The protein-nucleotide linkage was hydrolyzed by hydroxylamine but was stable in sodium acetate at the same temperature and pH. The linkage was also hydrolyzed by pyrophosphate (releasing ATP, as visualized by TLC; data not shown). These results suggest that the AMP is linked to the protein via a phosphoamide bond as characterized for other ligases(20Uhlenbeck O.C. Gumport R.I. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes, Vol. 15.

Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To confirm the identification of the adenylylated proteins as RNA ligases, we examined the release of label upon ligation. Adenylylated proteins from the 19 S fraction (complex I) were incubated with either 5′-32P-labeled ligatable RNA substrate or the same [5′-32P]RNA substrate that was periodate-treated to remove the 3′-hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2A). Ligation of the RNA substrate results in linear and circular molecules (Fig. 2A), identified by nearest neighbor and gel mobility shift experiments (data not shown). However, no ligation products are seen with the periodate-treated RNA (Fig. 2A). To determine whether ligation resulted in deadenylylation of the 50- and 57-kDa proteins, samples were incubated without RNA, with unlabeled ligatable RNA, or with unlabeled nonligatable RNA (Fig. 2, B and C). Aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by thin layer chromatography to visualize the nucleotides (Fig. 2B) and by SDS-PAGE to visualize the adenylylated proteins (Fig. 2C). The release of AMP from both proteins coincided with their incubation in the presence of ligatable versus nonligatable RNA substrate. Based on quantitation by phosphorimagery, there was a 5-fold difference in the AMP release between the ligatable and nonligatable reactions. Consistent with these results we found that the level of deadenylylation of both proteins is significantly greater in the reaction with ligatable RNA. We attribute this difference to an increase in turnover of the ligase in the presence of the ligatable substrate. There is no deadenylylation of either the 50- or 57-kDa protein or release of AMP following their incubation with DNA (data not shown), indicating that both proteins are RNA ligases. The mechanism of RNA ligation outlined above predicts transfer of AMP from the ligase to the 5′-P of the RNA to form an adenylylated RNA intermediate. The final step of ligation results in the release of this AMP. Removal of the 3′-OH of the substrate RNA, by periodate oxidation, should block the final step of ligation and result in the accumulation of the adenylylated RNA intermediate. To address this question, complex I from the glycerol gradient was incubated with [α-32P]ATP and either ligatable or nonligatable unlabeled RNA substrate. Under these conditions only the nonligatable substrate RNA is labeled (Fig. 3A). A similar product was obtained with the same RNA incubated with T4 RNA ligase and [α-32P]ATP (data not shown). The labeled RNAs were gel purified and analyzed by P1 digestion for the presence of the AppN linkage (Fig. 3B). Nuclease P1 digestion of RNA adenylylated by T4 RNA ligase yielded a product that does not comigrate with pA or pG and represents the P1 resistant 5′-5′-phosphoanhydride-linked AppG dinucleotide(30Schwartz R.C. Greer C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8374-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P1 digestion of the chemically synthesized adenylylated RNA also resulted in the AppG dinucleotide (data not shown). The presence of a 5′-5′-phosphoanhydride linkage was confirmed by sequential digestion of the labeled RNA with P1 followed by snake venom phosphodiesterase (Fig. 3B) or tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (data not shown), yielding pA. RNA labeled by the trypanosome mitochondrial complex I showed an identical activated intermediate. Both P1 and snake venom phosphodiesterase digestion products of complex I-labeled RNA are identical to those from T4-labeled RNA (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the RNA ligase activity in complex I forms activated RNA intermediates identical to those previously characterized for other RNA ligases(31Kaufmann G. Littauer U.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3741-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Ohtsuka E. Nishikawa S. Sugiura M. Ikehara M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The release of AMP upon ligation is indicative of the adenylylated proteins representing ligase intermediates (Fig. 2). If RNA editing proceeds according to a cleavage-ligation mechanism, we would expect a similar release of AMP during chimera formation. Thus, we investigated whether AMP is released from the ligase upon the in vitro formation of the chimeric molecule. The RNA ligases in complex I were preadenylylated with [α-32P]ATP, free nucleotides were removed by dialysis and the labeled proteins were then utilized in a chimera assay containing unlabeled cytochrome b pre-edited mRNA and [α-32P]UTP uniformly labeled gRNA. Aliquots of the reaction were spotted on a PEI plate to visualize the AMP release by TLC and RNAs electrophoresed to visualize the generation of the chimeric molecule (Fig. 4). During the production of the chimeric molecule (Fig. 4A) AMP is released (Fig. 4B). This release corresponds to a loss of AMP from both ligases, as indicated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, because of other low level ligation events that occur during the in vitro reaction, such as gRNA self ligation (∼60 nucleotides), we cannot conclude that this AMP release is due solely to chimera formation. The predicted involvement of an RNA ligase in the mechanism of chimera formation requires an adenylylated ligase intermediate. Formation of this intermediate requires the hydrolysis of ATP at the α-β bond. To investigate the involvement of this reaction intermediate in chimera formation, we examined the nucleotide requirements of RNA ligase and chimera activities. We found that both activities share a requirement for ATP which could not be substituted with CTP, GTP, UTP, or dideoxy-ATP (data not shown). To determine the requirement for ATP hydrolysis, either at the α-β or β-γ position, each of these activities were assayed in the presence of the α,β-methylene (AMP-CPP) and β-γ-imino (AMP-PNP) analogs of ATP (Fig. 5). AMP-CPP, which is nonhydrolyzable at the α-β bond was not utilized in either assay. AMP-PNP, which is hydrolyzable at the α-β but not the β-γ bond, supported both ligase and chimera formation. AMP-CPP was not utilized but was able to compete with ATP in both the RNA ligase and chimera assays. Thus, the nonutilization of this analog is due to the importance of α-β bond hydrolysis and not the inability of the enzyme to bind the analog. These results indicate that both RNA ligase and chimera activities require the hydrolysis of ATP at the α-β bond but not the β-γ bond. The differential ability of the AMP-CPP analog to compete with ATP in the RNA ligase versus chimera assay indicates additional ATP requirements, other than the adenylylation of the ligase, in the mechanism of chimera formation. The formation of the adenylylated ligase intermediates resulted in the release of pyrophosphate. The finding that chimera formation also specifically requires the α-β bond hydrolysis of ATP provides a strong argument for the involvement of a similar reaction intermediate. Further evidence was provided by the inhibition of chimera formation with pyrophosphate (Fig. 6) which deadenylylates the ligase (Table 1). Pyrophosphate inhibits both RNA ligase and chimera activities in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 6). On the other hand, inorganic phosphate at the highest concentration tested has no effect on either assay (Fig. 6). The inhibition by pyrophosphate can be partially reversed with the addition of pyrophosphatase (Fig. 6). The ability of pyrophosphatase to reverse the level of inhibition indicates that this inhibition is in fact due to the pyrophosphate, most likely by deadenylylating the ligase-AMP. The ability of pyrophosphate to deadenylylate the ligase and inhibit the formation of the chimeric molecule is indicative of ligase involvement in chimera formation. We have previously shown that the gRNA/mRNA chimeric molecules produced in vitro are analogous to those observed in steady-state kinetoplastid mitochondrial RNA(12Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The chimeras formed in vitro consist of the poly(U) tail of the gRNA linked to the mRNA specifically at editing sites and are dependent upon the correct anchor sequence(11Blum B. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11944-11948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Koslowsky D.J. Göringer H.U. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Nature. 1992; 356: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is believed that the chimeric molecule represents an intermediate in the editing process. Thus, determination of the mechanism of its formation would provide an indication of the mechanism of kinetoplastid RNA editing. Previous work by Pollard et al.(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) characterized mitochondrial RNPs that contained potential editing activities including RNA ligase and chimera forming activities. The cosedimentation of RNA ligase and chimera activities suggested that ligase was involved in the production of chimeric molecules. This paper reports on the direct involvement of this RNA ligase activity in the mechanism of chimera formation. We find two distinct proteins which become adenylylated with ATP, cosediment with the ligase activity in glycerol gradients, and have been identified as ligase intermediates by the release of AMP concomitant with ligation. Deadenylylation of these intermediates results in the inhibition of chimera formation. In addition, AMP release from the ligase is concomitant with production of the chimeric molecule. These results argue for a cleavage ligation-type mechanism of chimera formation in vitro and suggests a similar mechanism for RNA editing in kinetoplastids. The identification of the adenylylated proteins as RNA ligase intermediates is consistent with the mechanism of other ligases. Thus, it is not surprising that the RNA ligase activity present in the chimera-forming complexes specifically requires the α-β bond hydrolysis of ATP. The requirement for α-β bond hydrolysis of ATP in chimera formation could be explained by the involvement of the RNA ligase intermediate. The finding that pyrophosphate, which deadenylylates the intermediate, inhibits chimera formation suggests its direct involvement in the chimera-forming mechanism. Release of AMP from the ligases upon chimera formation is also consistent with this argument. In the initial characterization of the editing complexes the editing site-specific endonuclease did not appear to comigrate with either complex(16Pollard V.W. Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This enzymatic activity, which cleaves pre-edited mRNA at sites where editing occurs, would be an essential component of the editing complex for editing to occur by a cleavage ligation-type mechanism. Preliminary evidence indicates that our previous inability to detect the endonuclease within the complexes was due to the masking of endonuclease activity by RNA ligase. 2B. Adler, R. Sabatini, and S. Lottajduk, unpublished data. Work is currently being done to investigate the involvement of the endonuclease in chimera formation. The involvement of RNA ligase in the production of the chimeric molecule is consistent with the type of mechanism proposed in Fig. 7. The first step in chimera formation would involve cleavage of the pre-edited mRNA at the editing site by the editing site-specific endonuclease. The adenylylated RNA ligase would then transfer the AMP to the 5′-phosphate of the 3′-cleavage fragment, forming a 5′,5′-phosphoanhydride bond. This activated phosphate is then attacked by the 3′-hydroxyl of the uridine at the end of the gRNA forming the chimeric molecule. It is conceivable that a second round of cleavage and ligation similar to that outlined above would produce an edited product. The proposed cleavage-ligation mechanism outlined above is similar to the two stage mechanism of tRNA splicing in yeast(33Peebles C.L. Ogden R.C. Knapp G. Abelson J. Cell. 1979; 18: 27-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In yeast, the mechanism involves polynucleotide kinase and cyclic phosphodiesterase activities as well as the endonuclease and ligase(19Greer C.L. Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 537-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the first stage the endonuclease cleaves the RNA generating the 5′-half, terminating with a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, the 3′-half, terminating with a 5′-hydroxyl, and the intervening sequence. In the second stage the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate is opened by a cyclic phosphodiesterase and the 5′-hydroxyl is the substrate for a kinase activity. The resulting species are then finally substrates for the ligase forming a 2′-phosphomonoester 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage where the phosphate in the newly formed bond comes from the γ position of the nucleotide cofactor. The lack of requirement for β-γ bond hydrolysis of ATP (Fig. 5), the inability to incorporate label from [γ-32P]ATP into the chimera product, as well as the lack of detectable polynucleotide kinase activity in mitochondrial extract, 3R. Sabatini and S. L. Hajduk, unpublished results. describe an overall reaction scheme similar to tRNA splicing but with several distinct differences. The ability to digest the ligation products to mononucleotides with P1 nuclease3 is consistent with a typical 3′-5′-phosphodiester linkage produced by the trypanosomal RNA ligase where the 2′-position is not blocked by a phosphoryl group. These results, along with the ability to pCp label the 5′-fragment with T4 RNA ligase,3 suggest the endonuclease cleaves RNAs leaving 3′-hydroxyls and 5′-phosphates. The 3′-hydroxyl on the gRNA has previously been shown to be required for chimera formation(12Harris M.E. Hajduk S.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Koslowsky D.J. Göringer H.U. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Nature. 1992; 356: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This may reflect the substrate requirement of the ligase for RNAs with 3′-hydroxyls and 5′-phosphates. Thus, the endonuclease may directly provide the substrates for the ligase in chimera formation as opposed to the mechanism of yeast tRNA splicing. The involvement of RNA ligase in the in vitro reaction provides the first direct evidence for a cleavage-ligation mechanism of chimera formation. Further purification of the components of these complexes will allow the determination of other proteins involved in the in vitro reaction. The ability to resolve the chimeric molecule to the edited product would characterize them as true editing intermediates and verify the cleavage-ligation model as the mechanism of kinetoplastid RNA editing. We thank Dr. Brian Adler and Dr. Victoria Pollard for many helpful discussions, and the rest of the Hajduk laboratory for criticisms of the manuscript."

We recently found that 30% of breast tumors produce PSA and that PSA is a favorable prognostic marker in female breast cancer. We measured immunoreactive PSA in cytosolic extracts of normal breast tissue from eight women receiving no medication and one woman who was receiving the progestin-containing oral contraceptive Brevicon. None of the eight cytosolic extracts of normal breast tissue contained appreciable amounts of immunoreactive PSA. However, left and right breast tissues from the woman receiving Brevicon contained high levels of PSA. This immunoreactive species was shown to have a molecular weight identical to that of seminal PSA. Furthermore, reverse transcription of RNA and polymerase chain reaction amplification produced a 571-base pair cDNA that hybridized to a labeled cDNA PSA probe. Upon sequencing, the cDNA polymerase chain reaction product was found to have 100% homology with cDNA from prostatic tissue. PSA production by breast carcinoma cell lines was achieved after in vitro stimulation with norethindrone and ethinylestradiol. Our data suggest that PSA can no longer be regarded as a specific prostatic protein because it is produced by breast tumors with good prognosis and by normal breast tissue after steroid hormone stimulation.

No genes have as yet been found which are specifically regulated by oral contraceptives in the female breast. We have recently found that about 30% of female breast tumors overexpress prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 1The abbreviations used are: PSAprostate-specific antigenHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)ACTα1-antichymotrypsin.

PSA overexpression in breast cancer is associated with the presence of steroid hormone receptors(4Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Sutherland D.J.A. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 27: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The mechanism of such overexpression in breast cancer is currently obscure. It has been hypothesized that either ovarian or adrenal steroids or tumor-derived molecules derepress the PSA gene through the steroid hormone receptors or that the PSA gene is constitutively overexpressed because of poststeroid hormone-receptor complex defects, loss of physiological repressors, or because of defects in the hormone response elements. We have observed a significant advantage in both overall and disease-free survival of breast cancer patients who are PSA-positive. 2H. Yu, M. Giai, E. P. Diamandis, D. J. A. Sutherland, M. A. Levesque, R. Roagna, R. Ponzone, P. Sismondi, and D. Katsaros, submitted for publication. As PSA was found to be associated with more benign breast tumors, we speculated that it could also be expressed by normal breasts either under physiological circumstances or after steroid hormone stimulation. In this paper we demonstrate that the breasts of one woman who was receiving a progestin-based oral contraceptive contained high levels of PSA. This protein was absent from the breasts of eight other women who were not receiving any medication. These data strongly suggest that PSA is not a prostate-specific protein and that it can be produced by the female breast either in cases of malignancy or after stimulation by steroidal compounds.

We have studied nine women who underwent breast reduction surgery for cosmetic reasons. Normal breast tissue was immediately frozen on dry ice after resection and was stored at −70°C until extraction. Eight of the nine women were not receiving any medication. One woman was receiving Brevicon, a highly prescribed oral contraceptive containing 1 mg of norethindrone (a progestin) and 0.035 mg of ethinylestradiol/tablet. Breast tissue was obtained from both the left and right breasts for each patient. Breast tissue cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously(1Diamandis E.P. Yu H. Sutherland D.J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PSA in the cytosolic breast extracts was measured with a highly sensitive and specific immunofluorometric technique described in detail elsewhere(6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PSA was also measured in the cytosolic breast extracts with commercially available kits: the Hybritech Tandem-E PSA kit (Hybritech Inc., San Diego) and the IMx automated PSA method (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago). PSA in the tissue was expressed as ng/mg of total protein. HPLC was performed as described previously(6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All necessary reagents and equipment for Western blot analysis were purchased from Novex (San Diego). The manufacturer's protocols were followed throughout. Samples for Western blot analysis were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 8-16% gradient polyacrylamide minigels, and proteins were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were blocked for 1 h and processed further as recommended by the manufacturer of the ECL-Western blot detection kit (Amersham Corp.). Briefly, the membrane was probed with a polyclonal anti-PSA antibody (from Medix Biotech, Foster City, CA, 1 mg/ml, diluted 2,000-fold in the blocking buffer), washed, and reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The enzyme activity on the membrane was revealed by chemiluminescence, captured on x-ray film. Biotinylated molecular weight markers were visualized by reacting with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate added simultaneously with the goat anti-rabbit antibody. The T-47D and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines and the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). These cell lines were cultured as described previously(7Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Zarghami N. Grass L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Stimulation experiments with steroids, obtained from Sigma, were performed as described previously (7Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Zarghami N. Grass L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PSA was measured in the supernatants of the tissue cultures with the immunofluorometric procedure(6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Total RNA extraction was performed using the RNazol B method (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was used for the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, RNA, oligo(dT)12-18 primers (100 ng), and random hexamer primers (100 ng) were first denatured for 5 min at 70°C, chilled on ice for 1 min, and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 1 × first stand buffer, 250 μM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Jefferson Cancer Institute Nucleic Acid Facility (Philadelphia) and used without further purification. The PSA oligonucleotide sequences used as primers were: PR5, 5′-AGCCCCAAGCTTACCACCT-3′; PR6, 5′-CAGACTGCCCTGCCACGA-3′; PR2 and PR3 sequences have been published previously(8Moreno J.G. Croce C.M. Fischer R. Monne M. Vihko S. Mulholland S.G. Gomella L.G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6110-6112PubMed Google Scholar). Previously published actin PCR primer sequences were used to rule out degraded RNA(9Ben-Ezra J. Johnson D.A. Rossi J. Cook N. Wu A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Amplification yielded a 571-base pair (bp) PSA cDNA fragment with PR5 (from exon 1) and PR2 (from exon 4) oligonucleotide primers and a 154-bp cDNA fragment with actin oligonucleotide primers. One microliter of cDNA was added to 39 μl of PCR mix containing 1 × PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), a 18 pM concentration of each primer, 250 μM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR was performed with primers PR5 and PR2 for 30 cycles according to the following program: 94°C for 1 min (2 min for the first cycle), 56°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min (5 min for the last extension). Actin fragments were amplified from 1 μl of the cDNA preparation under the same conditions used for PSA PCR. Twenty microliters of each PCR reaction was electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. After electrophoresis the PSA cDNA PCR products were transferred onto Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham) and hybridized with a PSA cDNA probe (kindly provided by Dr. Jose Moreno). Southern blotting, probe radiolabeling, hybridization, and autoradiography were performed by standard techniques(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A second PCR amplification was performed on the remaining PCR reaction to provide sufficient material for subsequent analysis. Finally, the fragments were purified by ion exchange columns (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. An automated 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and dye terminator kits from the same manufacturer were used for direct sequencing of the PSA cDNA fragments by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using fluorescent labels. The coding and noncoding strands of each fragment were sequenced with primers generating overlapping sequence data. Sequences were reassembled and analyzed using the SAP program(11Dear S. Staden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3907-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We have prepared cytosolic extracts from 18 normal breast tissues removed from nine women (left and right breasts) during cosmetic breast reduction surgery. PSA immunoreactivity was measured in these extracts using a highly specific and sensitive immunofluorometric technique (6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and by two widely used commercial PSA assays. Breast extracts from eight of the nine women were found to contain <0.03 ng of PSA/mg of total protein and were considered negative for PSA. Two breast extracts from the same woman (left and right breasts) had a relatively high concentrations of PSA (0.11 and 1.53 ng/mg). None of the eight PSA-negative women was receiving oral contraceptives or other medications. The woman with PSA-positive breasts was receiving only one medication, Brevicon. The PSA-positive and -negative results in the breast extracts by the immunofluorometric procedure were verified by using two widely used commercial PSA methods: the IMx from Abbott Laboratories and the Tandem-E kit from Hybritech Inc. Additionally, the highly positive breast extract was serially diluted in female serum from 2- to 32-fold and analyzed by immunofluorometry and the IMx assay. Excellent agreement between results was obtained. The serum from the patient on oral contraceptives and sera from another 10 women on oral contraceptives were analyzed for PSA and found to contain <0.02 μg/l PSA. The highly positive breast extract was subjected to HPLC (Fig. 1), and fractions were analyzed by two immunofluorometric procedures that measure either total PSA (free PSA plus PSA bound to α1-antichymotrypsin) or specifically the PSA-α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) complex(6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More than 80% of the total PSA in normal breast was in the free, 33-kDa form; a small proportion was present as ACT•PSA complex (100 kDa). Another minor species, containing PSA and ACT, was also detected (660 kDa), but its identity is unknown. The presence of PSA in the highly positive breast extract was further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). The 33-kDa form of PSA, shown here to be present in normal breasts stimulated by oral contraceptives, is similar to the form of PSA found in breast tumors(1Diamandis E.P. Yu H. Sutherland D.J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In male serum, the majority of PSA is present as ACT•PSA complex with a molecular mass of 100 kDa (data not shown)(6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Western blot analysis. Samples were electrophoresed on 8-16% gradient polyacrylamide minigels under reducing conditions, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PSA antibody.

No PSA was detected in the tissue culture supernatants in the absence of steroid hormones after 11 days of confluent cultures. Ethinylestradiol stimulated low levels of PSA production at concentrations ≥ 10-8M. Norethindrone was effective in mediating intense PSA gene expression at concentrations as low as 10-10M. Other progestins were also effective in mediating PSA gene expression (data not shown). The identity of PSA in the tissue culture supernatants was characterized further by HPLC and Western blot analysis (data not shown). Two RNA samples isolated from normal human breast tissue obtained at reduction mammoplasty were analyzed for PSA gene expression by PCR. Southern blot hybridization of the PCR products with a PSA cDNA probe detected a PSA band of the expected size (571 bp) in the sample obtained from the woman who was receiving oral contraceptives. The other sample, obtained from a woman not receiving any medication, was PSA-negative (Fig. 4). To determine whether the PSA mRNA detected in breast tissue is identical to the mRNA present in prostate tissue, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the PSA cDNA fragment isolated from breast tissue and compared it with the published PSA cDNA sequence. Partial results are shown in Fig. 5. DNA sequence analysis of the breast tissue PSA cDNA fragment showed 100% identity with the PSA cDNA sequence data from normal prostate tissue recently obtained by Monne and Croce 3M. Monne and C. M. Croce, manuscript in preparation. (GenBank accession number U17040). No mutations were identified in the 571-bp fragment that was sequenced.Figure 5:Representative chromatogram of a 60-nucleotide region of the PSA cDNA sequence from normal breast tissue. Total RNA was isolated from a breast tissue specimen obtained at reduction mammoplasty from a woman receiving Brevicon. RNA was reversed transcribed to cDNA, amplified by PCR, purified, and directly sequenced. We obtained a 100% identity between the PSA cDNA sequence from breast tissue (bottom) and the PSA cDNA published sequence (top).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PSA is a serine protease found at very high concentrations in sperm. The molecular mass of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated PSA is 28.430 and 26.079 kDa, respectively(12Belanger, A., Van Halbeek, H., Graves, H. C. B., Granbois, K., Stamey, T. A., Huang, L., Poppe, I., Labrie, F., (1994) 76th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Anaheim, CA, June 15-18, Abstr. 493.Google Scholar). However, with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PSA runs as a 32-33-kDa protein. It has been suggested that PSA is involved in semen liquefaction postejaculation. PSA is considered a highly specific biochemical marker of the prostate gland and is currently used for prostate cancer diagnosis, population screening, and postsurgical monitoring of patients with prostate cancer(2Oesterling J.E. J. Urol. 1991; 145: 907-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar, 3Armbruster D.A. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that PSA is produced by 30% of breast tumors and provided evidence that this marker may be a new favorable prognostic indicator of the disease(1Diamandis E.P. Yu H. Sutherland D.J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Patients whose tumors produce PSA live longer and relapse less frequently in comparison with patients with PSA-negative tumors.2 In this paper we have examined if PSA could also be produced by normal breasts either under physiological conditions or under conditions of stimulation by exogenously administered steroid hormones. Eight patients who received no medication had breast PSA levels below 0.03 ng/mg protein and were considered negative for PSA. One patient who was receiving a progestin-containing oral contraceptive was found to have breast PSA levels of 0.11 and 1.53 ng/mgf total protein (left and right breast, respectively). This immunoreactive PSA molecule was measurable by the immunofluorometric assay (6Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) as well as by commercial PSA assays that are used widely for prostate cancer diagnosis. We have verified, using HPLC (Fig. 1), that the immunoreactive PSA species in breast is present in two molecular forms: as a 33-kDa protein, corresponding to the seminal form of prostatic PSA; and as a 100-kDa protein, corresponding to PSA complexed with α1-antichymotrypsin. The latter form, which is predominantly found in the serum of prostate cancer patients, was present in the breast extract at relatively low levels (<10% of total PSA); the major form was comprised of the 33-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). We have further characterized PSA in the positive breast extract using Western blot analysis. This data have shown that the PSA-positive breast extract, but not a PSA-negative breast extract, contained an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of 33 kDa (Fig. 2). PSA was not elevated in the serum of patients receiving oral contraceptives. The additional band on Western blots, at 28 kDa, present in PSA-positive and PSA-negative breast extracts and in amniotic fluid, may represent a PSA isoform or a PSA fragment. We have further molecularly characterized the presence of PSA in the normal breast at the mRNA level. For this analysis, we extracted total RNA from the PSA-positive and a PSA-negative breast tissue and amplified it, after reverse transcription, with specific primers derived from the known PSA gene sequence. We found that amplification occurred only with RNA from the PSA-positive breast tissue. The PCR product was hybridized with a specific cDNA probe for PSA and revealed the expected 571-bp fragment (Fig. 4). Furthermore, sequencing of the PCR product derived from breast tissue has shown that the sequence was identical to the sequence of the cDNA for PSA derived from prostatic tissue. No mutations were identified (Fig. 5). The data presented support the notion that the PSA gene is expressed in normal breast tissue under conditions of stimulation by steroid hormones. To reproduce the phenomenon in vitro we cultured T-47D and MCF-7 cells, two breast cancer cell lines that are both positive for steroid hormone receptors. Tissue culture supernatants from the nonstimulated cell lines contained no detectable PSA. However, upon stimulation with norethindrone or ethinylestradiol, the two components of the contraceptive used by the patient whose breast was positive for PSA, the cell lines produced PSA. Notably, norethindrone was active at concentrations as low as 10-10M (Fig. 3). The physiological relevance of our finding is currently unknown. However, it has recently been suggested (13Kanety H.

Corral D.A. Kawinski E. Constantine R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our previous data on PSA gene expression in breast cancer that has good prognosis (1Diamandis E.P. Yu H. Sutherland D.J.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 32: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the demonstration here that the PSA gene is regulated by oral contraceptives in normal breast suggest that this enzyme, until recently thought to be associated only with male prostatic tissue, may have important, previously unrecognized extraprostatic functions related to breast and other tissue growth and possibly breast cancer. This suggestion is further supported by our finding of the PSA presence in amniotic fluid during gestational weeks 13-21 (16Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and in the milk of lactating women(5Yu H. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The role of PSA in embryonal life and its involvement in growth factor regulation are currently under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1515692272,"As the first step in an investigation of roles played by fatty acylation of G protein α chains in membrane targeting and signal transmission, we inserted monoclonal antibody epitopes, hemagglutinin (HA) or Glu-Glu (EE), at two internal sites in three α subunits. At site I, only HA-tagged αqand αzfunctioned normally. αs, αq, and αzsubunits tagged at site II with the EE epitope showed normal expression, membrane localization, and signaling activity. Using epitope-tagged αz, we investigated effects of mutations in sites for fatty acylation. Mutational substitution of Ala for Gly2(G2A) prevented incorporation of myristate and decreased but did not abolish incorporation of palmitate. Substitution of Ala for Cys3(C3A) prevented incorporation of palmitate but had no effect on incorporation of myristate. Substitution of Ala for both Gly2and Cys3(G2AC3A) prevented incorporation of both myristate and palmitate. All three mutations substantially disrupted association of αzwith the particulate fraction. Gz-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, triggered by activation of the D2-dopamine receptor, was, respectively, abolished (G2AC3A), impaired (G2A), and enhanced (C3A). Constitutive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by αzwas unchanged (G2AC3A), strongly diminished (G2A), or strongly enhanced (C3A). A nonacylated, mutationally activated αzmutant inhibited adenylyl cyclase, although less potently than normally acylated, mutationally activated αz. From these findings we conclude: (a) fatty acylations of αzincrease its association with membranes; (b) myristoylation is not required for palmitoylation of αzor for its productive interactions with adenylyl cyclase; (c) palmitoylation is not required for, but may instead inhibit, signaling by αz.

Hetereotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins transduce signals from cell surface receptors to a variety of effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, and phospholipase C. Covalent attachment of myristate and/or palmitate to G protein α subunits greatly facilitates and is in some cases essential for their association with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and for normal signaling function. These characteristics make G protein α subunits attractive models for investigating roles played by distinct fatty acylations in membrane association and protein function. Myristoylation of α subunits involves covalent addition of myristate to a Gly2residue via an amide linkage, and takes place during or immediately after translation. This modification is usually irreversible, but not always (1Manenti S. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8309-8313Google Scholar) and therefore an unlikely target for regulation. Myristoylation is confined to members of the αifamily, where it serves dual roles promoting membrane attachment and increasing affinity of protein-protein interactions. Mutations that abolish myristoylation substantially impair attachment of αi, αo, and αzto membranes (2Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Google Scholar, 3Jones T.L. Simonds W.F. Merendino J.J. Brann M.R. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Google Scholar, 4Hallak H. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4571-4576Google Scholar). Myristoylation promotes membrane attachment of αiand αo, at least in part, by increasing their affinity for membrane bound βγ subunits (5Linder M.E. Pang I.-H. Duronio R.J. Gordon J.I.

Productive interaction of αiwith adenylyl cyclase requires myristoylation (7Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Google Scholar). Excepting αt, all α subunits thus far examined are palmitoylated (8Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Google Scholar, 9Parenti M. Vigano M.A. Newman C.M.H. Milligan G. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 349-353Google Scholar, 10Veit M. Nurnberg B. Spicher K. Harteneck C. Ponimaskin E. Schultz G. Schidt M.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 160-164Google Scholar). In contrast to myristoylation, palmitoylation is a dynamic, reversible modification involving post-translational attachment of palmitate to a Cys residue by a thioester linkage. For αsand αq, which are modified solely by palmitate, this modification plays a critical role: mutations that prevent palmitoylation markedly impair membrane association (8Linder M.E. Middleton P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Google Scholar) of αsand αq. Moreover, palmitoylation is regulated (13Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Google Scholar, 14Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2800-2804Google Scholar, 15Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Google Scholar). Following activation of αsin intact cells, palmitate is removed, and depalmitoylated αsis found in the soluble compartment, suggesting that activation-dependent depalmitoylation may serve to decrease the amount of αsavailable for subsequent interactions with receptors and effectors (15Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Google Scholar). The function and regulation of palmitate in α subunits that are modified by both palmitate and myristate awaits elucidation. Here we report experiments designed to examine the effects of palmitoylation and myristoylation on membrane attachment and signaling function of αz. A member of the αifamily, αzis expressed primarily in brain, adrenal gland, and platelets (16Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Google Scholar). Like αi, αzcan mediate hormonal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (17Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Google Scholar) and is both palmitoylated and myristoylated (2Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike αi, αzis not uncoupled from receptor activation by the action of pertussis toxin (PTX),1 1The abbreviations used are: PTXpertussis toxinHAhemagglutininEEGlu-Gluβ2-ARβ2-adrenergic receptorLHRluteinizing hormone receptorD2RD2-dopamine receptorα2-ARα2-adrenergic receptorPI-PLCphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase CMEMminimal essential mediummAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. because it lacks the Cys residue modified by PTX. Consequently, signals mediated by transfected αzcan be assayed specifically and conveniently in cells treated with PTX.

Because the molecular genetic approach to this problem requires easy detection and specific quantitative immunoprecipitation of mutant α subunits, we began by extending the epitope tagging strategy, first employed with αs(18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Google Scholar). Here we report results of a search for a common site in G protein α subunits suitable for epitope tagging. Success of this search, with respect to αsand αq, as well as αz, will facilitate investigation of other G protein α subunits by strategies that utilize mutation, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. CHO K1 and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. cDNA constructs obtained as described in Ref. 12. Receptor agonists were from Research Biochemicals Inc. (quinpirole, UK-14304 as part of National Institute of Mental Health Chemical Synthesis Program Contract 278-90-0007[BS]), the National Pituitary Agency (human chorionic gonadotrophin), or Sigma (isoproterenol). Antisera were the generous gifts of S. Mumby and A. Gilman (Gβ) and Paul Sternweiss (αq). [2-3H]Inositol and [2-3H]adenine were obtained from Amersham Corp. [9,10-3H]Palmitic acid and [9,10-3H]myristic acid were from DuPont NEN. Single stranded DNA corresponding to the antisense strand was prepared from pcDNA1 containing α subunit constructs. Hemagglutinin (HA) or Glu-Glu (EE) epitope sequences were introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis protocol of Kunkel et al. (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). Sense strand oligonucleotides comprising the coding sequence for either epitope flanked on both sides by 24 bases of coding sequence of the appropriate α subunit were used as primers. Coding sequences were 5′- gacgtccccgactacgcg for the 6-amino acid HA epitope DVPDYA or 5′- tacgacgtccccgactacgcgtca for the 8-amino acid HA epitope YDVPDYAS. Coding sequences for the EE epitope were 5′- gagtacatgccgatggag for the sequence EYMPME, 5′- gagtacatgccgatcgag for the sequence EYMPTE, or 5′- gcggagtacatgccgatctgag for the sequence AEYMPTE used in αzEE-N. The G2A, C3A, and G2AC3A mutations were constructed in a similar fashion using the antisense strand of pCDNA1 containing αzEE-II. Mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. For transient expression in S49 cyc− cells, αsconstructs were subcloned into the expression vector pSR296α (20Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Google Scholar) by blunt-ended ligation at the unique PstI site. HEK293 cells were propagated in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids were transfected using Transfectam lipofectant (Promega). A DNA-lipofectant mixture (ratio, 1 μg of DNA to 2 μl of Transfectam) was added to a 60-mm dish of subconfluent cells bathed in 0.5 ml of serum-free MEM. After 2 h incubation, the medium was replaced with 4 ml of MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum. For assaying signaling activity of αqor αsconstructs, 1 μg of α2R plasmid was cotransfected with 3 μg of αqor αsplasmid. CHO K1 cells were propagated in MEMα containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Initially, CHO K1 cells were transfected exactly as described for HEK293 cells except that MEMα was used and the ratio of Transfectam to DNA was 4 μl/1 μg. In later experiments plasmids were transfected using the adenovirus-mediated transfection protocol (21Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-359Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were placed into 2.5 ml of bicarbonate-free, serum-free DME H16 medium supplemented with 20 m M HEPES, nonessential amino acids, and 80 μg/ml DEAE. A 1:4 to 1:8 dilution of adenovirus stock was added to the tube and mixed. The DNA-adenovirus solution was added to a 60-mm dish of subconfluent cells. Following a 2-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were shocked for 2 min with 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline and returned to bicarbonate-free DME H16 supplemented with 20 m M HEPES, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For assaying signaling activity of αzconstructs, 1 μg of LHR plasmid and 2 μg of D2R plasmid were cotransfected with 0-4 μg of αzplasmid. S49 cyc− cells were propagated in DME H21 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. For transfection, cells in logarithmic growth were pelleted, washed once, and resuspended in serum-free DME H21 at a concentration of 2 × 107cells/ml. 225 μl of cells and 25 μl of 10 m M Tris, 0.1 m M EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA were mixed in an electroporation chamber. Electroporation was done in a Cell-Porator (BRL) at settings of 330 microfarads and 225 V. Cells were immediately transferred to 60-mm dishes containing 4 ml of DME H21 with 10% horse serum. HEK293 or CHO K1 cells, 24 h after transfection, were reseeded into 6 wells of a 24-well plate and [3H]adenine (2 μCi/ml for HEK293, 6 μCi/ml for CHO K1) was added. For assays involving αzconstructs, pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) was also included. 24 h later, wells were washed once with 0.5 ml of serum-free, bicarbonate-free DME H16 medium containing 20 m M HEPES (assay medium), and then incubated with 0.5 ml of assay medium containing 1 m M isobutylmethylxanthine with or without the appropriate receptor agonists. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 m M each cAMP and ATP. [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP were separated on Dowex and alumina columns as described (22Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar). S49 cyc− cells, 24 h after transfection, were labeled with 6 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 24 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2.8 ml of assay medium. 450-μl aliquots were added to 6 wells of a 24-well plate. 50 μl of assay medium containing 10 m M isobutylmethylxanthine with or without 10 times concentration (10−5M) of isoproterenol was added. During the 30-min incubation at 37°C, the S49 cyc− cells adhered to the wells. Reactions were terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid as described above. The remainder of the assay was identical to that described for HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells, 24 h after transfection, were reseeded into 6 wells of a 24-well plate and [3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml) was added. 24 h later, wells were washed once with 0.5 ml of assay medium and then incubated with 0.5 ml of assay medium containing 10 m M LiCl with or without the receptor agonist, UK14304. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, the cells were lysed in 0.75 ml of 20 m M formic acid. [3H]Inositol phosphate and [3H]inositol were separated on Dowex columns as described (22Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar). 100-mm plates of CHO K1 cells, 24 h after transfection, were reseeded into two 60-mm plates. 24 h later, the cells were washed twice with serum-free MEMα and then incubated for 2 h with 1 ml of serum-free MEMα containing 0.75 mCi of either [3H]myristic acid or [3H]palmitic acid. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 60 min with 330 μl of 40 m M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m M EGTA, 2 m M MgCl2, 1% sodium cholate, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes on ice and spun in a microcentrifuge at 4°C at 3500 rpm for 3 min. Soluble material was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube on ice. Triton X-100 and SDS were added to final concentrations of 1 and 0.5%, respectively, in a total volume of 400 μl. 30 μl of EE mAb coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (15 μl of packed beads) was added to each tube and the tubes tumbled for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were pelleted by microcentrifugation and quickly washed with 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% sodium cholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% SDS. Beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 m M dithiothreitol and heated to 65°C for 3 min. 30-μl aliquots were resolved on two separate 14% SDS-PA gels (18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Google Scholar). Gels were fixed by three 15-min washes in 50% MeOH, 10% acetic acid. After soaking for 15 min in 1 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, one gel was transferred to a fresh solution of 1 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, and the other to a fresh solution of 1 M hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, for 12 h. Gels were then washed twice in 50% MeOH, 10% acetic acid and processed for fluorography with Amplify (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An additional 30-μl aliquot was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with biotinylated-EE mAb by Western blotting. 100-mm plates of CHO K1 cells, 48 h after transfection, were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 300 μl of 40 m M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 m M EGTA, 2 m M MgCl2, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin was added to each plate on ice. Cells were scraped off the plates with a rubber policemen and transferred to Eppendorf tubes on ice. Cells were disrupted by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by microcentrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were separated into soluble and particulate fractions by centrifugation for 30 min at 150,000 × g. Particulate fractions were resuspended into equivalent volumes of lysis buffer. Samples were analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. EE mAb was obtained from Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Richmond, CA), 12CA5 mAb from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Berkeley, CA). The septapeptide EEYMPME corresponding to the sequence of the EE epitope was synthesized at the Biomolecular Resource Facility at University of California at San Francisco. EE mAb was coupled to protein G-Sepharose as described (23Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Google Scholar). EE mAb was biotinylated using the Fluoreporter Biotin-XX labeling kit from Molecular Probes Inc. as described in the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blotting the following dilutions of primary antibodies were used: EE mAb, ∼3 μg/ml; biotinylated-EE mAb, ∼1 μg/ml; 12CA5 mAb, ∼1 μg/ml; anti-Gβ antiserum B600, 1/5,000 dilution; anti-αqantiserum WO82, 1/250 dilution; anti-αsantiserum 199.233, 1.2 μg/ml. Secondary antibodies with conjugated horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1/10,000 dilution. Incubations with primary antibodies were from 1 h to overnight, secondary antibodies for 30 min. ECL (Amersham) was used to visualize immunoreactive bands. One of our major goals was to identify a common site in G protein α subunits for introduction of well characterized monoclonal antibody epitopes, in order to improve immunodetection and immunoprecipitation. We scanned sequences of α subunits for regions of similar sequence, suitable for introduction of epitopes and predictably accessible to antibodies; we then introduced defined epitopes into these regions and assessed the effects of epitope tags on α subunit function. We used the HA (24Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Google Scholar) and EE (25Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Google Scholar) epitopes (Fig. 1); these comprise small contiguous stretches of amino acids, are well characterized and have been used for epitope tagging of a variety of proteins (26Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Google Scholar, 27Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Google Scholar). We introduced epitopes into representatives (αs, αq, and αz) of three α subunit families. Signaling activities of α subunit constructs were measured following transient transfection in cell types with a null background, that is, cells in which signaling activity of the corresponding endogenous α subunit could be blocked or was absent. For αsconstructs, S49 cyc− cells provide a genetically null background and αssignaling activity can be assayed by measuring cAMP production following stimulation of the endogenous β2-adrenoreceptor (β2-AR). HEK293 cells provide null backgrounds for assaying coupling of transiently expressed αsor αqto the cotransfected α2-adrenoreceptor (α2-AR), because the corresponding endogenous α subunits do not mediate responses to the α2-AR in these cells (22Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar, 28Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Google Scholar). αz, like αi, mediates receptor inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Because αzis resistant to PTX, treatment with PTX creates a null background for αz, by uncoupling endogenous Gifrom activation by receptors (17Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Google Scholar). Activities of αzmutants were therefore assayed by measuring D2-dopamine receptor (D2R) mediated inhibition of the cAMP accumulation generated by stimulation of the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in CHO K1 cells cotransfected with αz, LHR, and D2R. Previous work from this laboratory showed that insertion of the HA epitope into a site encoded by an alternative exon (exon 3) of the αsgene did not disrupt coupling to the β2-AR or to adenylyl cyclase (18Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Google Scholar). Epitope tags at the corresponding positions of αqand αz, however, produced non-functional proteins. In addition, appending epitopes at the carboxyl termini of αqand αzimpaired function (data not shown). Scanning α subunit sequences revealed two regions similar in amino acid composition to both epitopes. The first (site I) is located approximately 125 residues from the amino terminus. Site I sequences are well conserved among members of each α subunit family, although overall similarity among α subunits at this site is not high (Fig. 1 A). This site appeared suitable for both epitopes. The second region (site II) is located seven residues upstream of the arginine residue in αsthat is ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin (Fig. 1 B). Site II sequences are highly conserved among all α subunits and closely match the EE epitope sequence. In the crystal structure of αt1(29Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Google Scholar), site I and site II are located in the α helical domain, in loops between helices B and C and E and F, respectively. We introduced both epitopes into site I in αqand measured the ability of epitope-tagged αqto couple the α2-AR to stimulation of PI-PLCβ in HEK293 cells. While the magnitude of stimulation of PI-PLCβ varied from transfection to transfection, both αqHA-I and αqEE-I stimulated PI-PLCβ to the same extent as did untagged αq(Fig. 2 A). Agonist dose-response curves for αqHA-I were similar to that for untagged αq(Fig. 3 A). Reproducibly, the dose-response curve for αqEE-I was shifted to the left (Fig. 3 B). Both epitope-tagged proteins were detectable by Western blotting (data not shown).Figure 3:Agonist dose-response curves for epitope-tagged α subunits. Panels A-C, HEK 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of α2-AR DNA and 3 μg of pcDNA1 containing the indicated αqconstructs. Production of inositol phosphates in response to varying concentrations of the α2R agonist, UK 14304, was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panels D and E, CHO K1 cells were transfected using lipofectant with 1 μg of LHR, 2 μg of D2R, and 1 μg of pcDNA1 containing the indicated αzconstructs. Production of cAMP in response to 100 ng/ml human chorionic gonadotropin and various concentrations of the D2R agonist, quinpirole, was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quinpirole inhibition of cAMP production for cells transfected with pcDNA1 vector was less than 10% of the human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated cAMP signal (data not shown). Panel F, S49 cyc− cells were transfected with 10 μg of pSR296α containing the indicated αsconstructs. Production of cAMP in response to various concentrations of the β2-AR agonist, isoproterenol, was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For all panels, each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements. For each panel, at least two additional experiments yielded similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) αzHA-I mediated D2R inhibition of adenylyl cyclase but was not detectable by Western blotting using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). αzHA-I probably lacked sufficient determinants for recognition by the 12CA5 antibody, because a second HA construct (denoted αzHA8-I), comprising an additional two amino acids of the original HA epitope, was recognized by the 12CA5 antibody on Western blots (data not shown). αzHA8-I mediated D2R inhibition of adenylyl cyclase to the same extent as did untagged αz(Fig. 2 B) and agonist dose-response curves were similar to those for untagged αz(Fig. 3 D). In contrast to αzHA8-I, αzEE-I was expressed but coupled weakly to the D2R (data not shown). At higher levels of expression, αzEE-I constitutively inhibited adenylyl cyclase (as does untagged αz), suggesting that creation of the EE epitope at site I may perturb αzactivation, perhaps by impairing interactions with βγ and/or receptors. Introducing the HA epitope into site I of αscompletely disrupted its signaling activity in either S49 cyc− cells or in HEK293 cells, even though its expression in HEK293 cells was readily detected on Western blots. Furthermore, cholera toxin failed to activate adenylyl cyclase in S49 cyc− cells transfected with αsHA-I (data not shown). In contrast to epitopes at site I, the EE epitope at site II consistently left signaling activity intact. In response to receptor stimulation, αqEE-II, αzEE-II, and αsEE-II regulated activities of their respective effectors to the same extent as did their untagged counterparts (Fig. 2, A-C). Agonist dose-response curves for EE-tagged constructs were also similar to those of their untagged counterparts (Fig. 3, C, E, and F). All three EE-tagged constructs were easily detected by Western blotting (Figs. 4 and 5). Site II appears to be a potential site for tagging all α subunits with the EE epitope, probably because highly conserved sequences at this site closely resemble the sequence of the EE epitope. We fractionated cells transiently expressing α subunits into crude particulate and soluble fractions and measured relative amounts of α subunit by immunoblotting. Transiently transfected αsEE-II, αqEE-II, and αqHA-I fractionate like their transiently expressed untagged counterparts and express to the same degree (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Transiently expressed αsEE-II and untagged αsare found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction, as is the endogenous αs. A substantial fraction of transiently expressed αqEE-II and untagged αqis soluble, while endogenous αqis primarily particulate. We suspect that overexpression per se alters the distribution of αq, because transient transfection of larger amounts of αqcDNA further increases the fraction of soluble protein (data not shown). The predominantly particulate localization of αzEE-II (Fig. 7) is similar to that reported by others for untagged αz(4Hallak H. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4571-4576Google Scholar). Thus these epitope tags do not appear to alter expression or subcellular distribution of these three α subunits.Figure 7:Subcellular distribution of αz palmitoylation and myristoylation mutants. CHO K1 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA1 containing the indicated αzconstructs. Crude particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were prepared following hypotonic lysis 48 h later as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal volumes of both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the EE mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous work demonstrated that HA-tagged αsand αqwere efficiently immunoprecipitated by the HA monoclonal antibody (12Wedegaertner"

Expression of the human GH receptor in the mouse promyeloid, interleukin-3-dependent cell line, FDC-P1, shows that this receptor can signal ligand-dependent proliferation in these cells as well as induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and the activation of transcription factors. We now examine the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor for these three events by expression of a receptor without tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. Six of the seven intracellular tyrosine residues were removed by a carboxyl-terminal truncation, and the remaining tyrosine was changed to phenylalanine to yield the GH receptor D351Stop/Y314F. When expressed in FDC-P1 cells, this receptor retained its ability to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, to induce the activation of transcription factors, and to signal ligand-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor is not essential for the signaling of these three events at least in this system. This finding contrasts with that for the interferon-γ receptor system where data indicate that the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the interferon-γ receptor leads to an association with the STAT protein, p91, that is the mechanism by which ligand couples the receptor to the signal transduction system.

Eden S. Jansson J.-O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human GH receptor contains an extracellular hormone binding domain of 246 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain of 24 amino acids, and a 350-amino acid cytoplasmic domain(2Leung D.W.

Recently, a direct signaling pathway utilizing tyrosine kinases of the Jak family and STAT proteins has been delineated for the IFN-α and IFN-γ receptors(20Watling D. Guschin D. Müller M. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Rogers N.C. Schindler C. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 21Müller M. Briscoe J.

These experiments and data from the GH system support the hypothesis that Jak2 associates with the GH receptor following ligand binding and receptor dimerization(14Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). This leads to activation of the Jak2 kinase which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 itself, of the GH receptor, and of STAT proteins. The activated STAT proteins, possibly in a complex with other transcription factors, then migrate to the nucleus and bind DNA elements responsible for the modulation of gene transcription(10Finbloom D.S. Petricoin E.F. Hackett R.H. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K.-I. Fibach E. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Silva C.M. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell.

For the IFN-γ receptor, mutagenesis and phosphorylated peptide data show that Tyr440 of the intracellular domain of the α chain is essential for signaling(23Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These data also show that the STAT protein, p91, specifically interacts with the phosphorylated receptor, indicating that this inducible association is the mechanism by which the ligand couples the receptor to the signal transduction system(24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Expression of the human GH receptor in the promyeloid cell line, FDC-P1, or in the pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, which both normally require IL-3 for maintenance and growth, leads to lines that proliferate in response to GH(25Wang Y.-D. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 26Ishizaka I.E. Fukunaga R. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have used this system to demonstrate that GH receptor truncations containing as few as 54 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain will signal a proliferative response upon ligand binding(27Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proliferative response is preceded in these systems by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and the activation of transcription factors(25Wang Y.-D. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Mutation of amino acids in the remaining 54-residue signaling region shows that there is a correlation of Jak2 phosphorylation, transcription factor activation, and cell proliferation, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that the Jak-STAT signaling pathway is required for the signaling of proliferation in this system(25Wang Y.-D. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In the current work we examine the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor for the signaling of proliferation and for the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway. We find that the human GH receptor without tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain is capable of signaling the proliferation of FDC-P1 cells and that Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and transcription factor activation appear unaffected. DNA sequences encoding the full-length and D351Stop human GH receptor in pRKN2 expression vector were constructed previously(27Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y314F mutation shown in Fig. 1 was made by in vitro mutagenesis as described(27Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double mutant D351Stop/Y314F was constructed by swapping the EcoRI fragment from Tyr314 into D351Stop to give the plasmid pRKN2.hghr51.1. FDC-P1 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Shigekazu Nagata. Untransfected cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented media (10% fetal calf serum, 10 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM glutamine) with addition of 10 units/ml IL-3.

In order to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the GH receptor is essential for the signaling of a ligand-dependent growth response, we utilized plasmids encoding the three forms of the receptor shown in Fig. 1. Previous work has shown that the D351Stop truncated receptor (which lacks 77% of the cytoplasmic domain and six of the seven tyrosine residues) gives a growth response similar to that found for the full-length receptor when expressed in FDC-P1 or Ba/F3 cells(25Wang Y.-D. Wood W.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 27Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one remaining tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain, Tyr314, was changed to phenylalanine in the D351Stop truncated GH receptor to eliminate all the tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain. Characterization of the GH binding properties of the receptors when stably expressed in FDC-P1 cells gives affinities of Kd = 0.61, 0.21, and 1.8 nM and receptor numbers of 5600, 500, and 3500 sites/cells for the full-length, D351Stop, and D351Stop/Y314F expressing cell lines, respectively (data not shown)(27Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor in the expressing cell lines was assessed by immunoprecipitation of the receptor followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblot (Fig. 2). For the full-length receptor, a broad, GH-dependent band of the expected size (∼130 kDa) (2Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was found (FFR); this band was absent with untransfected cells (FDC-P1). These findings indicate that the GH receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in this system. No phosphorylated receptor band was found for the D351Stop/Y314F receptor, as expected (F51.5). No phosphorylated receptor band was found as well for the D351Stop receptor (F351), suggesting the possibility that much of the tyrosine phosphorylation found for the full-length receptor is in the distal six tyrosine residues. FDC-P1 cells expressing the three forms of the GH receptor were assayed for GH-dependent proliferation in the presence of saturating concentrations of ligand (Fig. 3). No response was found without GH or IL-3. All three receptor expressing lines, including the line expressing the GH receptor without tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain (F51.5), show a proliferation response that equals that for IL-3. A full proliferative response was also found for FDC-P1 cells expressing the Y314F mutation in the full-length receptor (data not shown). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the human GH receptor is not required to signal a growth response in this system. To test whether some of the intracellular signaling events coupled to receptor activation are affected by the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor, we examined Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4) and transcription factor activation (Fig. 5) in response to GH binding. The GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2, and the band shifts induced with the DNA elements SIE or GRR, are unaffected in the D351Stop/Y314F mutant (F51.5). Thus, these two intracellular signals also do not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor.Figure 5Transcription factor complex formation in GH receptor expressing FDC-P1 cell lines. The binding of whole cell extracts to labeled DNA elements was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Binding was performed with extracts from lines treated without(-) or with (+) 10 nM human GH (GH) or unlabeled oligonucleotide (Cold Oligo).

Carter-Su C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, Jak2 has been identified as the tyrosine kinase likely to be responsible for these phosphorylation events(14Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Jak2 associates with the receptor following ligand binding and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation(14Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The activation of Jak2 and the related kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, have been implicated in the intracellular signaling pathways for many if not all of the receptors of the GH/cytokine receptor family(9Ihle J.N.

Direct evidence that the Jak family kinases are an essential component of the signaling pathway has been provided for the IFN-α and IFN-γ receptors where cell lines lacking these kinases or STAT proteins fail to respond to ligand stimulation(20Watling D.

We find that the full-length GH receptor when expressed in FDC-P1 cells is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to GH stimulation, as has been found for other systems(16Carter-Su C.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether this tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step in the signaling of proliferation and in the activation of the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, we have expressed a truncated form of the human GH receptor that lacks tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. This receptor is able to signal a hormone-dependent biological response (e.g. proliferation), as well as stimulate the phosphorylation of Jak2 and the activation of STAT protein(s). Thus, at least in FDC-P1 cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of the GH receptor is not an essential step in these signaling events. Work is in progress to identify which STAT protein or proteins are activated by growth hormone in FDC-P1 cells. Published data from other systems indicate that p91 and STAT3 may be the specific STAT proteins activated by the GH receptor(11Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Cochran B.H. Argetsinger L.S. Larner A.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24391-24395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently described experiments show that Tyr440 of the α chain of the IFN-γ receptor is required for signal transduction in a mouse fibroblast cell line, SCC16-5(23Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of the STAT protein, p91 (as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with homogenates of the human cell line, Colo-205), can be specifically inhibited by a 9-amino acid phosphorylated peptide having the sequence surrounding Tyr440; the unphosphorylated peptide fails to block p91 activation(24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although no direct binding of p91 to the phosphorylated IFN-γ receptor has been reported, the docking of p91 to Tyr440 of the receptor has been proposed as a key step in its activation that is followed by its tyrosine phosphorylation, dissociation, and translocation to the nucleus(24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Recent, phosphorylated peptide inhibition experiments with the IL-4 receptor and the newly identified IL-4 STAT protein support a similar model for IL-4 STAT binding to two phosphotyrosine-containing sequences of the IL-4 receptor cytoplasmic domain(33Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants of the IL-4 receptor lacking tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain are able to signal proliferation in Ba/F3 cells, although STAT activation was not determined(34Seldin D.C. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although additional studies will be required to resolve these apparently divergent actions, perhaps there are phosphotyrosine-containing STAT binding sites on proteins other than the receptors (for example on ancillary molecules, on the Jak proteins themselves, or on receptors for other ligands) that can be used as alternative sites for STAT docking and activation. Such a hypothesis would predict that deletion of any one site would have little or no effect, whereas competition for all the sites would inhibit STAT activation and signaling."

Incubating HIRc cells in 27 mMD-glucose for 4 days impaired the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of pp185 and receptor β-subunits. Both protein kinase C activities and phorbol dibutyrate binding to intact cells were unchanged; however, cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity increased within 1 h prior to the impairment of insulin receptor kinase in HG cells (Maegawa, H., Tachikawa-Ide, R., Ugi, S., Iwanishi, M., Egawa, K., Kikkawa, R., Shigeta, Y., and Kashiwagi, A.(1993) Biochem.

Increased PTPase activity was consistent with a 2-fold increase in the amount of PTP1B, and anti-PTP1B antibody inhibited this increment of cytosolic PTPase activity in HG cells. Co-incubating cells with pioglitazone prevented these abnormalities in cytosolic PTPase, the PTP1B content and the impaired phosphorylation of pp185 and receptor β subunits in HG cells. Finally, HG cells had impaired insulin-stimulated α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake, which was ameliorated by exposure to thiazolidine derivatives. In conclusion, exposing cells to high glucose levels desensitizes insulin receptor function, and thiazolidine derivatives can reverse the process via the normalization of cytosolic PTPase, but not of protein kinase C.

https://openalex.org/W2016602122,"Gene transcription can be induced by cAMP and Ca2+through distinct protein kinases phosphorylating the transcription factor CREB, which binds to cAMP response elements (CREs) in various genes. Induction of gene transcription by Ca2+has been shown recently to depend on the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin in pancreatic islet cells. This study investigates the role of calcineurin in CRE-directed gene transcription after stimulation by cAMP. Reporter fusion genes under the transcriptional control of CREs were transiently transfected into the cell line HIT. Pharmacological evidence suggests that cAMP stimulates CRE-mediated transcription through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited CRE-mediated transcription stimulated by cAMP. At the same concentrations they also inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity. Reversal of calcineurin inhibition by rapamycin or overexpression of calcineurin led to disinhibition of CRE-mediated gene transcription. Immunoblots with a phosphoCREB-specific antibody showed that cyclosporin A and FK506 do not interfere with CREB phosphorylation at serine 119 stimulated with cAMP or membrane depolarization. These results indicate that in HIT cells stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription depends not only on the activity of protein kinases phosphorylating CREB but also on the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin that is necessary for the transcriptional competence of phosphorylated CREB.

The β-galactosidase activity was measured using a commercial kit for chemoluminescent detection (Serva, Germany). The calcineurin phosphatase activity in the cultured cells was measured as described (27Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HIT cell lysates (in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, rinsed in TBST (10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 m M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated in 10% nonfat dry milk dissolved in TBST for 1 h, and then incubated with either anti-CREB antiserum (29Waeber G.

Antibody-antigen complexes were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.). Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (31Joost H.G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1979; 11: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). FK506 and rapamycin were dissolved in ethanol. KN-62 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. A stock solution of cyclosporin A (10 mg/ml) was prepared in ethanol with 20% Tween 80 and further diluted in medium. Controls received the solvent only. The CRE of the rat glucagon gene has the typical consensus sequence TGACGTCA and confers responsiveness to cAMP (21Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Ca2+influx following membrane depolarization induced by high KCl concentration in the pancreatic islet cell line HIT (12Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reporter gene under control of five copies of the rat glucagon CRE in front of the truncated viral thymidine kinase promoter (from −81 to +52) was transiently transfected into HIT cells. The glucagon CRE did not increase basal activity (data not shown). However, transcription was stimulated 7.3-fold by 1.5 m M 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 1). Lowering the extracellular Ca2+concentration by addition of EGTA had no effect on basal gene transcription, but inhibited 8-Br-cAMP-induced transcription by about 80% and abolished the stimulation by high KCl (Fig. 1). The effect of EGTA seems to be specific since a dye exclusion test showed no change in cell viability after EGTA treatment compared to controls. Furthermore, the effect of EGTA was reversible, since EGTA treatment followed by washing of the cells and re-addition of Ca2+had no significant effect on the subsequent stimulation by forskolin (10 μM) of insulin secretion (120.5 ± 17.0 ng ml−1h−1versus 159.5 ± 26.0 ng ml−1h−1in controls) or CRE-mediated transcription (6.1 ± 0.7-fold versus 5.8 ± 0.6-fold in controls). Therefore, these data suggest that cAMP-induced gene transcription depends on extracellular Ca2+. Verapamil (10 μM), a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+channels, inhibited CRE-mediated transcription by 27% after stimulation by 8-Br-cAMP (p < 0.05, t test), whereas depolarization-induced transcription was completely blocked (data not shown), indicating that the stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription by cAMP depends in part on Ca2+influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+channels. KN-62 is a selective inhibitor of CaM kinases that spares other protein kinases, e.g. protein kinase A, and calmodulin-dependent enzymes (32Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KN-62 (1 μM) had no effect on 8-Br-cAMP stimulation of CRE-mediated transcription, whereas it completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of membrane depolarization (not shown). Therefore, all these data suggest that a Ca2+-dependent enzyme other than CaM kinase is involved in cAMP-induced transcription through the CRE. Cyclosporin A and FK506 are inhibitors of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (33Liu J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 on gene transcription stimulated by cAMP through the CRE. Both drugs inhibited cAMP-induced transcription (Fig. 2); in parallel experiments they also inhibited Ca2+-induced transcription (Fig. 2) as reported previously (17Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Lux G. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23111-23115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect was concentration-dependent. The IC50 for cyclosporin A was about 60 n M or 15 n M after 8-Br-cAMP or KCl stimulation, respectively, for FK506 about 1 n M after both stimuli. The maximal inhibition by cyclosporin A or FK506 was about 60-70% after stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP and about 80% after stimulation with KCl. The effective concentrations are consistent with the reported affinities of both drugs to their immunophilin receptors and are similar to those concentrations effective in T cells (25Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 34O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 35Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Fischer P.A. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1418-1424PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A also reduced transcription stimulated by forskolin through the well characterized CREs of the rat somatostatin or the human choriogonadotropin α genes (Fig. 3 A). The somatostatin, choriogonadotropin α, and glucagon gene CREs contain the CRE octamer consensus sequence but differ in the bases flanking the CRE octamer. These data thus indicate that susceptibility to cyclosporin A and FK506 is conferred by the CRE octamer and does not depend on the sequence context. Although a number of transcription factors can bind to the CRE consensus sequence, only CREB and the highly homologous factors ATF-1 and CREMτ are known to mediate cAMP responsiveness (5Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). The notion that cyclosporin A and FK506 interfere with the action of CREB or a homologous factor is supported by the observation that overexpression of a dominant repressor of CREB, KCREB (26Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the cyclosporin A-sensitive transcription stimulated by forskolin through the somatostatin CRE (Fig. 3 B). The stimulation by cAMP of transcription mediated by a GAL4-CREB fusion protein, which contains the CREB transactivation domain (12Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was inhibited by cyclosporin A (Fig. 3 B), indicating that CREB is responsive to cyclosporin A. Ca2+and cAMP stimulate CRE-mediated transcription synergistically (12Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While CRE-mediated transcription was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP 8.3-fold and by KCl 3.7-fold, the combination of both induced a 38.8-fold increase in gene transcription (Fig. 4). This synergism was almost completely inhibited by cyclosporin A (Fig. 4). Thus, the synergism, like the effect of the individual stimuli, is sensitive to inhibition by cyclosporin A. To test whether cyclosporin A and FK506 are effective inhibitors of calcineurin phosphatase activity in HIT cells, calcineurin activity was measured. Untreated cells had a calcineurin activity of 127.3 ± 8.4 pmol of phosphate released min−1mg−1(n = 7). Cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity in HIT cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The IC50 values for calcineurin inhibition were about 3 and 40 n M for FK506 and cyclosporin A, respectively. Thus, at concentrations that inhibited CRE-directed transcription, cyclosporin A and FK506 also inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity in HIT cells. To test the relationship between the inhibition of calcineurin activity and CRE-directed transcription stimulated by cAMP, rapamycin and calcineurin expression vectors were used. Rapamycin is an analogue of FK506. Rapamycin binds to the cytosolic FK506 receptor, the FK506-binding protein FKBP-12, but in contrast to the FK506/FKBP-12 complex, the rapamycin/FKBP-12 complex does not inhibit calcineurin, resulting in a competitive antagonism by rapamycin of FK506 action with respect to calcineurin inhibition (33Liu J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rapamycin does not, however, bind to cyclophilins, the intracellular receptors of cyclosporin A (33Liu J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rapamycin alone had no effect on calcineurin activity in HIT cells (data not shown). Inhibition by cyclosporin A (60 n M) of calcineurin activity was not reduced by rapamycin (1.1 μM); it was even somewhat enhanced (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, inhibition of calcineurin activity by FK506 (5 n M) was completely reversed by rapamycin (Fig. 6 A). This indicates that in HIT cells as well, inhibition by FK506 of calcineurin depends on a FKBP that binds FK506 and rapamycin. Rapamycin had no effect on gene transcription stimulated by cAMP through the CRE (data not shown) and did not prevent its inhibition by cyclosporin A (Fig. 6 B); it was even somewhat enhanced (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, the inhibition by FK506 was disinhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 6 B). Thus, disinhibition of calcineurin activity was accompanied by disinhibition of CRE-mediated transcription. If inhibition of calcineurin activity is indeed the mechanism by which cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit CRE-directed transcription after stimulation by cAMP, then overexpression of calcineurin should render HIT cells more resistant to the action of these compounds. Fig. 7 shows the effect of overexpression of the subunits A and B of murine calcineurin (24Kincaid R.L. Giri P.R. Higuchi S. Tamura J. Dixon S.C. Marietta C.A. Amorese D.A. Martin B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) on gene transcription stimulated by cAMP through the CRE. Cotransfection of the expression vectors for calcineurin had no effect on basal transcription (not shown) and increased 8-Br-cAMP-induced gene transcription only slightly (Fig. 7). However, after overexpression of calcineurin FK506 (1.6 n M) or cyclosporin A (60 n M) no longer inhibited the 8-Br-cAMP-induced increase in gene transcription (Fig. 7). These results suggest that cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit cAMP-induced transcription through inhibition of calcineurin, implying that gene transcription stimulated by cAMP through the CRE depends on calcineurin phosphatase activity in HIT cells. The cAMP and Ca2+signaling pathways converge on serine 119 of CREB-327 (corresponding to serine 133 in CREB-341), which is phosphorylated in response to both signals initiating an increased transcriptional activity. Since cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit CRE-directed transcription stimulated by Ca2+(17Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Lux G. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23111-23115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cAMP (this study), it was tested whether cyclosporin A and FK506 change the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119. The phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119 was investigated by immunoblots of HIT cell lysates using an antibody that recognizes CREB phosphorylated at serine 119 but fails to recognize CREB that is not phosphorylated at serine 119 (30Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). After treatment of HIT cells with forskolin or KCl, a band of 43 kDa comigrating with CREB as stained by another anti-CREB antiserum and a band of 38 kDa were increased in intensity (Fig. 8). The 38-kDa protein could correspond to ATF-1 (36Liu F. Thompson M.A. Wagner S. Greenberg M.E. Green M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6714-6720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is highly homologous to CREB and seems to cross-react with the anti-phosphoCREB antiserum (30Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of HIT cells with cyclosporin A and FK506 did not change the intensities of the bands corresponding to phosphoCREB or phospho-p38 after stimulation by cAMP as well as Ca2+(Fig. 8). Therefore, inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A and FK506 interferes with CRE-mediated transcription without reducing cAMP- or Ca2+-induced CREB phosphorylation at serine 119. To determine if the requirement for calcineurin occurs in cell types other than HIT cells, JEG-3 and GH3cells were tested; these have been used for analysis of cAMP-dependent activation of CREB (3Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 5Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 37Drust D.S. Troccoli N.M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In JEG-3 cells, FK506 severely inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity whereas CRE-directed transcription induced by cAMP was not changed by FK506 (Fig. 9). EGTA (3 m M), added 1 h before cAMP stimulation, did also not change cAMP-induced transcription (not shown). In GH3cells, FK506 inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity and severely blunted CRE-mediated transcription induced by cAMP (Fig. 9). EGTA treatment (3 m M) reduced transcription by about 80% (not shown). Consistent with other experiments in which additional cell lines were tested, 2M. Krüger, M. Schwaninger, and W. Knepel, unpublished results. these data indicate that, under the experimental conditions used, transcription stimulated by cAMP through CREs depends on calcineurin phosphatase activity in some but not all cell types. This study shows that cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit cAMP-induced transcription mediated by the CRE in a pancreatic islet cell line. At the same concentrations, these structurally unrelated agents also inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity. Furthermore, when inhibition of calcineurin by FK506 or cyclosporin A was reduced by rapamycin or overexpression of calcineurin, CRE-dependent transcription was disinhibited. These data strongly suggest that cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit CRE-directed transcription after stimulation by cAMP through inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity. This implies that after stimulation by cAMP, CRE-directed transcription depends not only on protein kinase A but also on calcineurin phosphatase activity. Together with previous evidence that also after membrane depolarization and Ca2+influx transcription mediated through the CRE depends on calcineurin (17Schwaninger M. Blume R. Oetjen E. Lux G. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23111-23115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this suggests a central role for calcineurin phosphatase activity in CRE-mediated transcription in pancreatic islet cells. The cAMP- and Ca2+-induced signaling pathways converge on the transcription factor CREB, phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119 by cAMP- or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases being the initial event of CREB activation (9Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Activation of CREB is thought to involve an increase in transcriptional activity (5Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly DNA binding (2Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 38Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schütz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which phosphorylation at serine 119 stimulates CREB transcriptional activity remains elusive, this modification may stimulate interaction with one or more of the general transcription factors or, alternatively, allow recruitment of a co-activator (39Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 40Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16999-17009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, it has not been possible to determine whether the single phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119 is sufficient for CREB activation. Based on the finding that recombinant CREB phosphorylated in vitro on serine 119 was transcriptionally active upon its microinjection into fibroblast nuclei, it was suggested that phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119 is sufficient to stimulate CRE-dependent transcription in intact cells (42Alberts A.S. Arias J. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7623-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, cAMP- and Ca2+-induced CREB phosphorylation at serine 119 was unimpaired in the presence of cyclosporin A and FK506, while CRE-dependent transcription was largely reduced. This provides direct evidence for the notion that under these conditions the phosphorylation of CREB at serine 119 is not sufficient for activity. Furthermore, since cyclosporin A and FK506 seem to act through inhibition of a phosphatase (calcineurin), these results suggest the existence of an additional phosphorylation event that directly or indirectly interferes with the transcriptional competence of serine 119-phosphorylated CREB; this inhibitory phosphorylation can be removed by calcineurin phosphatase activity. The nature of the kinase involved is unclear. Its activity may be constitutive or regulated by stimuli including cAMP and Ca2+. Its substrate could be any protein that directly or indirectly can inhibit transactivation by CREB phosphorylated on serine 119. Serine 119 in CREB is flanked by multiple consensus sites for potential phosphorylation by protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (5Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar) within a region of CREB that is required for interaction with CBP (39Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), a potential CREB co-activator that together with a dTAFII 110-like protein (40Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) may be required for the interaction of serine 119-phosphorylated CREB with the TFIID complex. Although the functional significance of these phosphorylation sites has not yet been demonstrated, mutation of serine 128 of CREB to alanine (CREB-327 corresponding to serine 142 in CREB-341) in overexpressed GAL4-CREB fusion proteins enhanced transcriptional activation in response to CaM kinase II1–290 (43Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of CREB at serine 128 may inhibit its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, activation by protein kinase C through phorbol esters in hepatoma cells reduced the occupancy of the CRE in the tyrosine aminotransferase gene in vivo (44Reik A. Stewart A.F. Schütz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 490-497PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of p34 kinase, which also can phosphorylate CREB in vitro, repressed transactivation by CREB in JEG choriocarcinoma cells (45de Groot R.P. Derua R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1495-1501PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the calcineurin-sensitive phosphorylation event that, as suggested by the present study, interferes with the transcriptional competence of serine 119-phosphorylated CREB may add to the understanding of the transactivating mechanism of CREB. The implied inhibitory phosphorylation offers another mechanism in addition to serine 119 phosphorylation through which CREB/CRE-dependent transcription could be regulated according to functional, developmental, and cell-specific cues. Consistent with this view, induction of CRE-directed transcription by cAMP was found by this study and additional experiments2to depend on calcineurin phosphatase activity in some but not all cell types, under the experimental conditions used. Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme (33Liu J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with a central role for calcineurin, the Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA reduced the stimulation by cAMP of CRE-dependent transcription in HIT cells. EGTA treatment prevents influx of extracellular Ca2+and also lowers basal cytosolic free Ca2+concentration in these cells (46Rajan A.S. Hill R.S. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The effect of verapamil suggests that part of the Ca2+needed for cAMP-induced transcription enters the cell through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+channels. This may be accounted for by the stimulation by cAMP of Ca2+influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+channels (46Rajan A.S. Hill R.S. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar). As the inhibition by EGTA or cyclosporin A and FK506 exceeds that by verapamil, Ca2+from other sources may participate (48Satin L.S. Cook D.L. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 49Sussman K.E. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 571-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Heguy A. Melli M. Telford J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19103-19108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A and FK506 are of great clinical importance as powerful immunosuppressive drugs. Through inhibition of calcineurin, these drugs interfere with the nuclear translocation of a subunit of the T-cell-specific transcription factor NF-AT, which enhances the transcription of genes essential for T-cell-activation, such as the interleukin-2 gene (25Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, 34O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). This may explain part of cyclosporin A/FK506-mediated immunosuppression (33Liu J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 182-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The functional disruption of CREB/CRE-directed transcription at concentrations that block T-cell activation represents a novel mechanism of cyclosporin A/FK506 action, which may underlie some of their pharmacological effects, both desired and undesired.

https://openalex.org/W2069860443,"Zinc finger proteins of the Cys2His2 type represent a large class of proteins that have been assumed to function by means of specific interactions with DNA. Experiments motivated by structural characteristics of zinc finger protein-DNA complexes revealed that certain zinc finger proteins bound DNA-RNA hybrids with affinities comparable to or greater than those for DNA duplexes. The interactions between the zinc finger proteins and the DNA-RNA hybrids were dependent on which strand was RNA and were sequence-specific. Thus, interactions with DNA-RNA hybrids should be considered with regard to the biological roles of zinc finger proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1973478880,"This study examines the regulatory effects of two cytokines, stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-3, and a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, on lipid mediator generation in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC). Treatment of BMMC with SCF induced a modest, dose-dependent increase in three eicosanoids, thromboxane B2, prostaglandin D2, and leukotriene B4. These increases were accompanied by a marked elevation in cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). Dexamethasone blocked the induction of cPLA2 levels and the elevation in leukotriene B4 induced by SCF. By contrast, the combination of SCF and dexamethasone dramatically increased (5-8-fold) the capacity by BMMC to produce prostanoid products. This increase in prostanoid products was mirrored by an increase in prostaglandin G/H synthase I (PGHS-I) levels. Dexamethasone, alone, had no effect on PGHS-I, cPLA2, or prostanoid levels. Moreover, neither SCF or dexamethasone, alone or in combination, influenced prostaglandin G/H synthase II (PGHS-II) levels. In contrast to SCF, interleukin-3 alone or in combination with dexamethasone had no effect on prostanoid synthesis or PGHS-I or II levels. To better understand the SCF and dexamethasone effect, PGHS-I and PGHS-II mRNA expression were examined by Northern analysis. PGHS-I mRNA was markedly induced (maximal levels at 5 h) by the combination of SCF and dexamethasone. PGHS-II mRNA was undetectable in either control or SCF/dexamethasone-treated BMMC. Neither SCF or dexamethasone, alone, altered mRNA for either PGHS isotype. Taken together, these studies reveal that PGHS-I may be critical to prostanoid formation in mast cells exposed to cytokines and glucocorticoids. Moreover, they suggest that synergistic induction of PGHS-I could represent a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids.

https://openalex.org/W2053475175,"Cytokine activation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) gene expression by endothelial cells is an important feature in a variety of vascular inflammatory responses. Cytokines transcriptionally activate the VCAM-1 promoter in endothelial cells at least in part through two closely linked NF-κB enhancer motifs, κL-κR (positions −77 and −63). However, cytokine activation of the dimeric NF-κB transcriptional factor (p50+p65 subunits) occurs in almost all cell types, whereas VCAM-1 gene expression exhibits a cell type-specific pattern of expression. Tumor necrosis factor-α markedly transactivated a transiently transfected minimal κL-κR motif-driven VCAM-1 promoter, p85VCAMCAT, in passaged human vascular endothelial cells but not in the human epithelial cell line, HeLa suggesting that cell type-specific factors may function through the κL-κR motif. Both cell types exhibited similar inductions of NF-κB DNA binding activity and transcriptional activity. However, co-transfection of HeLa cells with p65 and p50 expression vectors demonstrated that the minimal VCAM-1 promoter was effectively transactivated by p65 alone but that additional co-expression of p50 blocked this activity. Furthermore, cytokine activation of the minimal VCAM-1 promoter in HeLa cells was recovered by inhibition of p50 expression using antisense oligonucleotide. These studies suggest that the NF-κB(p50+p65 heterodimer) does not support transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter with the p50 subunit potentially playing a significant inhibitory role in suppressing cytokine activation of VCAM-1.

Endothelial expression of VCAM-1 is observed in early atherosclerotic lesions of the vessel wall, as well as other inflammatory processes, suggesting the importance of VCAM-1 in these disease states (3Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Science. 1991; 251: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating VCAM-1 gene expression are not well understood. The human VCAM-1 promoter contains two closely linked κB-like elements, κL -κR, separated by five nucleotides, at positions −77 and −63 relative to the transcription start site, respectively (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). κR but not κL completely conforms to the κB consensus sequence for the binding of the inducible, transcriptional regulatory factor NF-κB (5Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, both of these sequences are necessary for the induction of VCAM-1 promoter by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in endothelial cells (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neish A. Williams A. Palmer H. Whitley M. Collins T. J. Exp.

NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of transcriptional regulatory proteins and consists of two distinct polypeptides of 50 and 65 kDa, termed p50 and p65. In most unstimulated cell types, NF-κB is complexed with an inhibitory protein, IκB, in a non-DNA-binding form that is localized to the cytosol (8Baeuerle P.A. Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 2: 789-798Crossref Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with cytokines (9Osborn L. Kunkle S. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) results in the release of NF-κB from IκB and its translocation into the nucleus where it transcriptionally regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes through specific κB enhancer motifs (5Baeuerle P.A.

An important feature of the Rel family is its ability to form a wide range of homodimers (e.g. p65 and p50) as well as heterodimers not only within the Rel family, but also with other classes of transcriptional factors (12Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 13Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell.

Recently, it has been shown that the p65 subunit of NF-κB can form homodimers that can also function as transactivators (15Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Liou H.C. Tempst P. Baltimore D.

Thus, cell type-specific differences in the activation of this family of NF-κB-like DNA-binding proteins may play an important role in regulating VCAM-1 gene expression through its κL-κR motif.Two observations suggest that transcriptional regulatory factors other than the NF-κB heterodimer itself may mediate transactivation through the VCAM-1 κL-κR elements. First, the κL-κR elements bind at least two different NF-κB-like binding proteins (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, TNF-α transactivates the VCAM-1 promoter through the κL-κR elements in a cell type-specific manner. Non-endothelial cell lines such as Jurkat and HeLa activate NF-κB when stimulated with cytokine TNF-α as well as other activators (5Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 10Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). However, although active in TNF-α-stimulated human vascular endothelial (HUVE) cells, constructs of the VCAM-1 promoter containing κL-κR are not transactivated in the TNF-α-stimulated T-cell line Jurkat (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that instead of NF-κB, other homo- or heterodimers of members of NF-κB/Rel family may be involved in activating the VCAM-1 promoter in TNF-α-stimulated HUVE cells.To explore the relative roles of NF-κB and NF-κB-like factors in regulating VCAM-1 gene transcription through the κL-κR motif, we have characterized the ability of these factors to mediate transcription of the VCAM-1 promoter through cytokine activation of endogenous NF-κB as well as to reconstituted homo- and heterodimers of p50 and p65 using expression vectors in HeLa cells. Our studies suggest that while Rel family members, such as the p65 homodimer, are potent transactivators, the NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) does not effectively transactivate the VCAM-1 promoter through the κL-κR motif. DNA binding studies suggest that TNF-α induces NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) and p65 homodimer or homodimer-like protein both in HUVE and HeLa cells. However, functional p65 homodimer was mainly present in HUVE cells. Thus, VCAM-1 transactivation through κL-κR may be a function of differential activation of NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) relative to other members of the Rel family, such as p65 homodimers.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureHeLa cells (CCL2) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). HUVE cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 16 units/ml heparin (ESI Pharmaceuticals, Cherry Hill, NJ), 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Collaborative Research Incorporated, Bedford, MA), and 25 m M HEPES buffer. The medium for both cells contains 2 m ML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HUVE cells were grown on tissue culture plates coated with 0.1% gelatin and were used within the first 6 passages. Human recombinant TNF-α was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of reagent grade.CAT AssayOne day prior to transfection, HeLa and HUVE cells were split at the ratio that would give 60-70% confluence. The transfection was done by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. For HeLa cells, 5-10 μg of reporter plasmids were used. For HUVE cells, 30 μg of reporter plasmids were transfected as described previously (24Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The promoterless plasmid, poLUC (25Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar), was used for adjusting the amount of transfected DNA. The cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of rapid freeze-thaw in 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.0. Protein content was determined using the Bradford (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar) technique. The same amounts of proteins were assayed for CAT activity according to standard protocols (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The CAT activity was expressed as percent of chloramphenicol converted to acetyl chloramphenicol. Acetylated and unacetylated forms of chloramphenicol were separated on thin layer chromatography and their amounts were determined after scraping by counting the radioactivity of the respective bands in scintillation vials. Each assay was performed in duplicate or triplicate and the results reported are the average of at least two separate experiments.Expression Vectors and CAT Reporter GenesThe eukaryotic expression vectors CMV-p50, CMV-p65, CMV-p50/65, and CMV-rel/p65 contain the respective cDNAs cloned between a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, β-globin intron and simian virus 40 poly(A) signal (17Ruben S. Narayanan R. Klement J. Chen C.-H. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMV-p50/65 encodes a chimeric protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of p50 (amino acids 1-370) and the transactivation domain of p65 (amino acids 309-550) (28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid, p(HIVκB)4CAT, contains four tandem copies of the κB DNA sequences cloned upstream of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat and fused to the coding region of the bacterial CAT gene (28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the κB motif of p(HIVκB)4CAT is 5′-GGGGACTTTCC-3′, and is identical to the κB sequence found in the mouse immunoglobulin gene promoter (IgκB). These vectors were generous gifts of Dr. C. Rosen (Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD). The reporter gene, p85VCAMCAT, contains coordinates −85 to +12 of the human VCAM-1 promoter (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The κL-κR driven heterologous promoter pTA(−77/−63)CAT has been described previously (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reporter genes were generous gifts of Dr. D. Dean (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).Nuclear Extracts PreparationConfluent HUVE and HeLa cells were exposed to TNF-α (100 units/ml) for 1-3 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (29Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1476-1489Crossref Scopus (9141) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing with phosphate buffered saline, cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet suspended in 500 μl of buffer A (10 m M HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 10 m M KCl, and 1.0 m M dithiothreitol). After recentrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 80 μl buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 by gentle pipetting up and down. After incubating for 10 min at 4°C, the homogenate was centrifuged and the nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer A and resuspended in 70 μl of buffer C (20 m M HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 0.2 m M EDTA, 1 m M dithiothreitol). This suspension was incubated for 30 min at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −70°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford (26Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213254) Google Scholar) method. To minimize proteolysis, all buffers contained 1.0 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and antipain (10 μg/ml).Gel Shift AssaysThe oligonucleotide containing κL-κR of the VCAM-1 promoter (VCAM-1 wild type oligo) was synthesized. Its sequence is as follows: 5′CTGCCCTGGGTTTCCCCTTGAAGGGATT-TCCCTCCGCCTCTGCAACAAGCTCGAGATCCTATG-3′. The sequences of κL and κR are underlined with a single line. The double underlined sequences represent an unrelated tail sequence added to serve as a template for synthesis of the double-stranded DNA. To prepare double-stranded DNA, first an oligonucleotide 5′-CATAGGATCTCGAGC-3′ (complementary to the 3′-unrelated tail, double underlined sequence) was annealed to VCAM-1 wild type oligo. The second strand was extended with DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) in a reaction mixture containing 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP and 0.5 m M of cold dATP, dGTP, and dTTP. The reaction was followed by the addition of 0.5 m M cold dCTP to insure completion of the second strand. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by column chromatography over a Sephadex G-50 column. The DNA binding reaction was performed at 30°C for 15 min in a volume of 20 μl, which contained 225 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.0 × 105cpm of 32P-labeled probe, 0.1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 15 μl of binding buffer (12 m M HEPES pH 7.9, 4 m M Tris, 60 m M KCl, 1 m M EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1 m M dithiothreitol, and 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After the binding reaction, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1 × Tris-glycine buffer using 4% native polyacrylamide gels.Antibody p50 was a generous gift of Dr. C. Rosen (Human Genome Sciences Inc., Rockville, MD) and was characterized to completely shift both the p50 homodimer and the NF-κB(p50+p65 heterodimer) in gel shift assays (data not shown). Antibodies against p65, c-Rel (raised against a peptide in the carboxyl terminus region), and RelB were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Bacterially expressed proteins, p50 and truncated p65 (containing amino acids 1-309), were prepared and purified as described previously (17Ruben S. Narayanan R. Klement J. Chen C.-H. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the low amounts of available purified proteins, the concentration of the purified proteins was roughly estimated from the concentration of proteins before dialysis, the final step of purification. The homo- and heterodimers of p50 and truncated p65 were prepared by incubating them alone or in combination with each other for one hour at 37°C as described earlier (20Fujita T. Nolan G. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) except that DNA binding buffer was used for dimerization. These dimers were used for DNA binding studies. The purified proteins were generous gifts of Dr. C. Rosen (Human Genome Sciences Inc., Rockville, MD).The sequences of phosphorothioate antisense p50, p65 (30Narayanan R. Higgins K.A. Perez J.R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the epithelial cell line, HeLa, that does not express VCAM-1 at either the mRNA or protein levels (data not shown). This lack of VCAM-1 expression in HeLa cells occurs despite its well described NF-κB activation in response to several cytokines and to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (32van Huijsduijnen R.H.

Gazzolo L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HeLa and HUVE cells were transfected with p85VCAMCAT, a deletion construct of the human VCAM-1 promoter (coordinates −85 to +12) that contains the κL-κR elements and has been previously characterized as the minimal TNF-α-inducible VCAM-1 promoter (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess for functional NF-κB, both cell types were also transfected in parallel with p(HIVκB)4CAT, an NF-κB-responsive promoter construct containing a tetramer of canonical κB elements, p(HIVκB)4CAT, well characterized to be activated by NF-κB(p50+p65 heterodimers) (28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As expected, TNF-α markedly induced p(HIVκB)4CAT in both HUVE (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2) and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2), demonstrating functional activation of NF-κB. TNF-α also markedly induced p85VCAMCAT activity in HUVE cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, TNF-α caused little or no activation of p85VCAMCAT (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4) in HeLa cells. Similar results were obtained when the TNF-α concentration was increased up to 1000 units/ml (data not shown). Similar to studies in Jurkat T cells (4Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that activated NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells is not sufficient to effectively transactivate the minimal inducible VCAM-1 promoter, containing the κL-κR elements.Co-expression of the p65 Subunit of NF-κB Potently Transactivates the VCAM-1 Promoter in HeLa CellsAs an endogenous activation of NF-κB in HeLa cells appeared not to be effective, we undertook to determine which members of the NF-κB/Rel family could transactivate the VCAM-1 promoter through the κL-κR elements. In functional reconstitution experiments Rel-like subunits were co-transfected into HeLa cells with p85VCAMCAT or p(HIVκB)4CAT (a p65 homodimer and NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) driven reporter gene) as a control. These included expression vectors for the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB as well as for the chimeric protein, p50/65, that contains the DNA binding domain of p50 and transactivation domain of p65 and is a functional mimic of NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) (28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, co-expression of the p65 subunit markedly transactivated p85VCAMCAT (7Shu H.B. Agranoff A.B. Nabel E.G. Leung K. Duckett C.S. Neish A.S. Collins T. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6283-6289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, co-expression of the chimeric protein (p50/65) failed to significantly induce p85VCAMCAT. Similarly, p50 did not induce p85VCAMCAT. However, both p65 and the chimeric protein p50/65 potently induced p(HIVκB)4CAT (Fig. 2 A) (28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p50 did not induce p(HIVκB)4CAT. These data suggest that expression of p65 either as a homodimer or in combination with a component distinct from p50 already present in HeLa cells is sufficient to transactivate the minimal inducible VCAM-1 promoter containing the κL-κR elements.FIG. 2The p65 subunit of NF-κB is a potent activator of the VCAM-1 promoter. HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of p85VCAMCAT (Panel B) or p(HIVκB)4CAT (Panel A) along with 5 μg of the expression vectors encoding p65 and p50, and the chimeric protein p50/65 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The CAT activity was determined using equal amount of protein. The CAT activity of p85VCAMCAT (Panel B) and p(HIVκB)4CAT (Panel A) under different conditions is expressed as percentage of acetylated chloramphenicol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reconstitution of a Functional NF-κB (p50+p65 Heterodimer) in Vivo Enhances p(HIVκB)4CAT but Blocks p85VCAMCATTo further elucidate the relative roles of p65 and the NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) on transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter, functional NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer) was reconstituted in HeLa cells by co-transfection of the expression vectors encoding p50 and p65. Recent studies have shown that the NF-κB(p50+p65 heterodimer) can be efficiently formed when expression vectors of both p50 and p65 are co-transfected in different cell lines. This has been shown by gel mobility shift assays and by increases in the transcriptional activation of p(HIVκB)4CAT reporter genes (16Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A.

Studies in vitro have also suggested that the p50+p65 heterodimer is preferentially formed when purified proteins of p50 and p65 are incubated together (20Fujita T. Nolan G. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).We first determined the concentration of p65 that was required for the maximal activation of p85VCAMCAT. p85VCAMCAT was transfected into HeLa cells along with different concentrations (0.1-10 μg) of the p65 expression vector. Increasing amounts of p65 activated p85VCAMCAT in a dose-dependent manner (7Shu H.B. Agranoff A.B. Nabel E.G. Leung K. Duckett C.S. Neish A.S. Collins T. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6283-6289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The amount of p65 required for the maximal CAT activity was approximately 5 μg. Further increase in the amount of expression vector did not significantly increase or decrease CAT activity. Based on these studies, the concentration of p65 expression vector used for the activation of p85VCAMCAT was 5 μg or lower. To generate NF-κB (p50+p65 heterodimer), HeLa cells were transfected with a constant amount of p65 and increasing amounts of p50 expression vectors. The effect of the co-expressed p50+p65 heterodimers on promoter function was assessed in p85VCAMCAT. The functional formation of the p50+p65 heterodimer and its ability to drive a"

Incubation with bradykinin induced a rapid transient translocation of PKC α and a more sustained translocation of PKC ∊ to the particulate fraction; translocation of PKC ζ was unaffected. Bradykinin-induced translocation and activation of PKC α, but not translocation of PKC ∊, was blocked in SF 3271 cells which had been incubated with 1-O-hexadecylglycerol (1-O-HDG; 20 μg/ml) for 24 h and then incubated in the absence of 1-O-HDG and serum for a further 24 h. Supplementation with 1-O-HDG increased the mass of ether-linked phospholipid. Bradykinin initiated a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in both control and 1-O-HDG supplemented cells, indicating that the initial receptor linked events were not affected by 1-O-HDG supplementation. Bradykinin also caused a rapid activation of phospholipase D (PLD), measured by phosphatidylbutanol accumulation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) determined by myelin basic protein phosphorylation of Mono Q fractions. Both events were blocked by preincubation of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h to deplete PKC protein. 1-O-HDG supplementation prevented the bradykinin-induced activation of PLD, but had no effect on the stimulation of MAPK activity. These results establish that modulation of the ether lipid composition of membranes can alter PKC isozyme translocation and indicate that a PKC isozyme other than PKC α, most likely PKC ∊, is involved in MAPK activation.

The α2M-proteinase complex (activated α2M; α2M*) is removed rapidly by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the liver. Here we demonstrate by Western blotting that α2M is also present in the yolk of chicken oocytes. Plasma levels of α2M are increased by estrogen, and yolk α2M is partially proteolyzed, consistent with the action of cathepsin D on endocytosed α2M. Two known estrogen-induced ligands of the oocyte-specific 95-kDa very low density lipoprotein/vitellogenin receptor (OVR) are also fragmented by yolk cathepsin D (Retzek, H., Steyrer, E., Sanders, E. J., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W. J.(1992) DNA Cell Biol. 11, 661-672). Since these findings suggested a common uptake mechanism for lipoproteins and α2M by oocytes, we investigated whether OVR, a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, functions in the metabolism of α2M. Ligand blotting of oocyte membrane extracts with chicken α2M* revealed that it binds to OVR. Surprisingly, the oocyte receptor also recognizes native α2M, in sharp contrast to the hepatic receptor, which only binds α2M*. Receptor interaction of both forms requires Ca2+; however, competition experiments suggest that α2M and α2M* interact with slightly different, or overlapping, sites on the receptor. Colocalization of α2M and OVR in coated vesicles isolated from growing oocytes, and internalization and degradation of methylamine-activated α2M by COS-7 cells transfected with OVR, strongly suggest that α2M is transported into growing oocytes via OVR.

These major precursors of yolk mass are synthesized in the liver and taken up by the oocytes from the circulation via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). The LRP/α2MR rapidly removes from the circulation complexes between proteinases and α2M by specifically binding to a receptor recognition site on α2M. This recognition site on α2M is exposed by a conformational change, commonly referred to as activation of α2M (for review see (34Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The conformational change is the result of a cleavage in the bait region of α2M by a protease that might become cross-linked to α2M via an internal thiolester of α2M. Here we report that OVR, believed to be the product of an ancestral gene involved in female reproduction, binds not only activated α2M, but also its native form. Analysis of coated vesicles derived from small vitellogenic oocytes and yolk from differently staged follicles suggests that α2M is a cytoplasmic constituent of chicken oocytes, which likely endocytose it via OVR.

After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to 16% PEG; the efficacy of precipitation was assessed by SDS-PAGE of supernatants after 12% and 16% PEG precipitations (see “Results”).

Zn2+-charged iminodiacetic Sepharose (25-ml bed volume) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The Zn2+-Sepharose was washed thoroughly with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.4, and packed into a column. Adsorbed α2M was eluted with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and gel filtrated on Sephacryl S-300. The pure α2M was concentrated to 5-10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and stored at −20°C or used immediately. α2M-trypsin complexes were prepared by incubating α2M with a 15-fold molar excess of trypsin for 1 min followed by the addition of the same amount of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Methylamine-activated α2M (α2MMA) was prepared by treating native α2M with 0.2 M methylamine for 2 h at 20°C. Native α2M was radiolabeled using the lactoperoxidase method (36Thorell J.I. Johansson B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 251: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) to specific activities of 20-50 kcpm/ng. Labeled α2M-trypsin complexes were produced by reacting labeled native α2M with trypsin as described above. Oocyte membranes were prepared from previtellogenic follicles (4-6-mm diameter) and extracted with 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (6George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VTG and VLDL were prepared from laying hens or estrogen-treated roosters as described(6George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Stifani S. George R. Schneider W.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed on 5% gels (100 min at 125 V) using the Tris borate system described by van Leuven et al.(38van Leuven F. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berge H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 4.5-18% gradient slab gels at 180 V for 60 min using the minigel system from Bio-Rad. Samples containing 10 mM dithiothreitol were heated for 3 min at 95°C. Nonreducing samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis without prior heating. Samples containing proteolytic activity were added to excess preheated sample buffer and heated further at 95°C for 3 min. The molecular masses of proteins were estimated with the broad range molecular mass standard (6-200 kDa) from Bio-Rad. Gels were stained with 3% Coomassie Blue (G-250) in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid and destained in 10% acetic acid. Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp.) was performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M glycine buffer, pH 8.4, for 90 min at 200 mA. After transfer, proteins were visualized by staining the membrane with Ponceau S (2 g/liter and 30 g/liter trichloroacetic acid) and rinsing with H2O. Nitrocellulose membranes used for Western blot analysis were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound polyclonal antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Renaissance system, DuPont NEN). Membranes were exposed on Reflection film (DuPont NEN) for the times indicated. Ligand blotting with 1125I-α2M was performed as described for 1125I-VLDL(6George R. Barber D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that ligand-blotting buffer contained 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which was added immediately before use. Purified chicken α2M was isolated by electroelution from a 4.5-18% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and used for producing polyclonal antibodies in rabbits as described(5Barber D.L. Sanders E.J. Aebersold R. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18761-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography, and microimmunoaffinity purification of the IgG was performed as follows. α2M was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose. The protein was visualized with Ponceau S and the area of the membrane containing α2M excised. The strip was blocked for 2 h in 2.5 ml of buffer A (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.6) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Then, 0.1 ml protein A-purified IgG (200 μg/ml) was added, and the incubation was carried on for another 2 h. The strip was washed extensively with buffer A without bovine serum albumin, and the bound IgG was eluted with 0.5 ml 0.1 M citric acid, pH 2.5, and neutralized immediately with 0.1 ml of 1 M Tris. Elution was repeated twice, and the fractions were combined and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody against OVR was prepared as described(7Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of serum α2M were determined by Western blotting. Serum samples (0.1 or 0.05 μl/lane) were run on two 4-18% SDS-PAGE gradient gels under reducing conditions. One gel was then blotted electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose, and a Western blot using immunopurified anti-α2M antibody was performed as described above. The intensity of the bands was measured with a densitometer using the Image-Quant software package from Molecular Dynamics. The other gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the serum albumin band of corresponding samples was quantitated by densitometry and used to normalize the relative intensities obtained for α2M. Small yellow follicles (vitellogenic) were collected and the yolk obtained by extrusion. The yolk was diluted with 4 volumes of 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 2 h at 400,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was redissolved in MES buffer (0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM NaN3, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μM leupeptin) to give a final concentration of approximately 10 μg/μl. Alternatively, 400 μl of yolk diluted 1:1 with MES buffer was loaded on top of a gradient of 5-40% sucrose in 0.1 M MES and centrifuged for 20 h in a SW-40 rotor at 40,000 rpm. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected starting from the top of the tube, and aliquots thereof were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Chicken liver cathepsin D was obtained as described(40Retzek H. Steyrer E. Sanders E.J. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Purified α2M (30 μg) was incubated with 3 units of cathepsin D in 100 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, at 37°C for 20 h. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 1 μg of pepstatin A. As a control, 1 μg of pepstatin A was added to 30 μg of α2M before the addition of cathepsin D. Coated vesicles were prepared from the yolk of white (previtellogenic) and small yellow (vitellogenic) follicles using a 1H2O/2H2O, 8% sucrose gradient(41Nandi P.K. Irace G. Jaarsveld P.P.V. Lippodt R.E. Edelhoch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5881-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After homogenization in MES buffer the homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended again in MES buffer and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants from both centrifugations were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was suspended in MES buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in MES buffer, and the centrifugation was repeated. The supernatants from the two centrifugations were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of MES buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min; the pellet was again resuspended in 3 ml of MES buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The combined supernatants (6 ml) were loaded on the top of 6 ml of 8% sucrose in 2H2O and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet, resuspended in 300 μl of MES buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin, was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and stored at 4°C. The protein concentration of the resulting coated vesicle preparation was 1.5 mg/ml. Monolayers of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pCDMCVR-1 (coding for full-length OVR), and control cells transfected with pCDM8 (vector without insert) (7Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were incubated for 5 h in standard medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and the concentrations of radioiodinated ligand indicated in the figure legends. Assays of proteolytic degradation of 1125I-labeled ligands in monolayers of cultured cells were determined according to the standard protocol for LDL(42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Specific OVR-mediated degradation of α2M was calculated as the difference between the values obtained with OVR-expressing and mock transfected cells. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Lowry et al.(43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of samples containing lipoproteins or detergent was determined using a modified Lowry procedure(44Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11442-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To initiate studies on the binding of α2M to oocyte membrane proteins and uptake into growing oocytes, we first purified it from laying hen plasma by modifications of the procedure described for human α2M(35Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Wierzbicki D.M. Jones C.M. Lonblad P.B. Kristensen T. Mortensen S.B. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 421: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Feldman and Pizzo (45Feldman S.R. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) described an initial precipitation at 7% (w/v) PEG for the purification of chicken α2M, resulting in a significant reduction in yield. In our hands, initial precipitation at 4% (w/v) PEG led to a complete removal of fibrin and fibrinogen without significant loss of α2M. The second PEG precipitation was carried out at 16% (w/v) PEG, which increased the yield of chicken serum α2M by about 50% compared with that obtained with 12% (w/v) PEG routinely used for the precipitation of human α2M. After further chromatography on Zn2+-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-300, we obtained virtually pure α2M, as assessed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). It migrated as a single band with an apparent Mr of 360,000 under nonreducing conditions, and with an apparent Mr of 180,000 under reducing conditions, corresponding to the homodimer and monomer of native α2M, respectively. When compared with human α2M using nondenaturing electrophoresis (where native α2M, consisting of two noncovalently associated homodimers, migrated with a Mr of 720,000), a significant difference between human and chicken α2M became evident. Whereas native human α2M (Fig. 1B, lane a) became transformed to the so-called fast form by small amines such as methylamine (lane b), native chicken α2M (lane d) did not undergo any conformational change detectable by electrophoresis (lane e). However, treatment with an excess of trypsin increased the mobility of chicken α2M (lane f) to the same extent as that observed in human α2M (lane c). Pure chicken α2M was obtained by preparative SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and the eluted protein was used to produce specific antibodies. The anti-α2M IgG was immunopurified and shown to react equally well with reduced and nonreduced samples of chicken α2M in Western blots (data not shown). This IgG was used to determine relative concentrations of α2M in different chicken sera as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 2A shows a representative Western blot of sera derived from different animals. The relative intensities of the bands were measured and normalized using the intensity of the albumin band in Coomassie Blue-stained gels as described under “Experimental Procedures” and displayed graphically in Fig. 2B. Relative α2M levels in laying hens (30 weeks old) were three times higher than in immature hens (2 weeks old). Immature roosters (2 weeks old) had the same plasma concentration as immature hens, with slightly higher levels in mature roosters (30 weeks old). Upon estrogen administration to roosters, plasma levels rose about two to three times to levels similar to those in laying hens. To study the interaction of α2M with OVR, we prepared oocyte membranes and performed ligand blotting experiments with purified α2M from chicken (Fig. 3A) and human serum (Fig. 3B). Radioiodinated trypsin-treated chicken α2M* prominently labeled a 95-kDa band in oocyte membrane extracts (Fig. 3A, lane 1), corresponding to the VLDL/VTG receptor, as shown in lane 5 with an antibody prepared against a peptide derived from the cloned sequence of the receptor(7Bujo H. Hermann M. Kaderli M.O. Jacobsen L. Sugawara S. Nimpf J. Yamamoto T. Schneider W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5165-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The binding of α2M* was Ca2+-sensitive, since the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 20 mM) completely abolished it (lane 2). Surprisingly, native α2M, which is known not to bind to hepatic α2M receptors (for review see (33Moestrup S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) and thus was intended to serve as control, also bound to the same receptor, although with lower affinity (lane 3); this binding too, was EDTA-sensitive (lane 4). To determine if the binding of native α2M to OVR was specific for the chicken ligand, we performed ligand blots with purified human α2M and chicken oocyte membrane extracts. In this set of experiments (Fig. 3B), we used a sandwich ligand blot technique in which bound ligands are visualized with specific antibodies against human α2M. This procedure eliminated the possibility that α2M became activated by the iodination process. As with the chicken protein, not only trypsin-treated human α2M (lane 1), but also the native form (lane 3) bound to the receptor in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (lanes 2 and 4). Importantly, when the procedure was performed without the addition of activated or native α2M, the antibody used for the second step did not cross-react with any protein in the oocyte membrane extract (lane 5). In Fig. 3B, lane 6, OVR is visualized with the specific antireceptor antibody. The use of human α2M also gave us the opportunity to check electrophoretically for any “fast” form present in the preparation used in the ligand blotting experiments. Even upon extreme overloading of the gel we could not detect any fast form in freshly prepared human α2M (cf. Fig. 1); thus, native α2M from both chicken and human serum bound to the chicken OVR. When we tried to visualize the binding of chicken α2M to the receptor by the same procedure (i.e. without the labeling of chicken α2M), the anti-chicken α2M antib"

In general, antibodies will not be raised against self-antigens nor against highly conserved domains. In the present study we describe the production and characterization of murine monoclonal “auto-antibodies” against murine tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) raised in “knock-out” mice, homozygously deficient of the functional gene. 203 stable hybridomas were obtained producing murine monoclonal antibodies against murine t-PA. Analysis of the species reactivity revealed that 182 cross-reacted with one or more (t-)PAs originating from other species including rat t-PA, human t-PA, and vampire bat-PA. 121 reacted with epitopes conserved among murine, rat, and human t-PA. In addition, 31 of the monoclonal antibodies were directed against domains present in all four species. Epitope mapping indicated a high frequency of specificity toward diverse epitopes that are highly conserved across species. Comparative analysis of their influence on the enzymatic activity of t-PA and their species cross-reactivity clearly demonstrated that the domains required for the biological activity of plasminogen activators are more conserved (p < 0.02) than non-functional domains.The availability of such unique antibodies against a wide variety of conserved epitopes may facilitate studies on the structural homologies between (t-)PAs isolated from various species. The present approach should also apply to various other classes of proteins, allowing the generation of monoclonal antibodies, against conserved epitopes, which could not be raised in wild-type animals because of their “self-antigen” nature.

The present approach should also apply to various other classes of proteins, allowing the generation of monoclonal antibodies, against conserved epitopes, which could not be raised in wild-type animals because of their “self-antigen” nature. Since the development of the hybridoma technology by Kohler and Milstein (1Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12505) Google Scholar), the production of murine monoclonal antibodies against foreign antigens has become a routine technique. However, it is generally accepted that the greater the phylogenetic distance between antigen and recipient, the more pronounced the immune response, e.g. highly conserved mammalian proteins usually evoke a weak immune response (2Goding J.W. Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, London1983: 5-55Google Scholar). In this same view, generation of murine monoclonal antibodies against murine proteins (i.e. self-antigens) is not to be expected due to an absence, by active elimination or functional inactivation, of lymphocytes bearing receptors for self-antigens (3Burnet F.M. The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville, TN1959Crossref Google Scholar, 4Nossal G.J. Science. 1989; 245: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For similar reasons, the immunological system will also be unable to recognize an epitope present in a protein obtained from another species, but showing a high degree of homology with an epitope in the corresponding protein of the immunized species. As a consequence all available monoclonal antibodies of murine origin, raised against a particular non-murine protein, will not cross-react (or only to a low extent) with the corresponding murine protein. From a practical viewpoint, this eliminates the possibility of detection or quantitation of murine proteins with highly specific murine monoclonal antibodies. More importantly, none of the currently available murine monoclonal antibodies should react with domains or epitopes that are conserved between various species. We therefore hypothesized that immunization of transgenic mice, in which the expression of specific proteins is abolished by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (5Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), could result in the generation of murine antibodies against the “knocked-out” protein and against epitopes conserved across species. In the present study we describe the generation and characterization of a wide variety of murine monoclonal antibodies raised against murine tissue-type plasminogen activator (mt-PA)( 1The abbreviations used are:mt-PAmurine t-PAt-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatoru-PAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorht-PAhuman t-PArt-PArat t-PAbat-PAvampire bat plasminogen activatormu-PAmurine u-PAhu-PAhuman u-PAt-PA‐/‐t-PA-deficientu-PA‐/‐u-PA-deficientELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are:mt-PAmurine t-PAt-PAtissue-type plasminogen activatoru-PAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorht-PAhuman t-PArt-PArat t-PAbat-PAvampire bat plasminogen activatormu-PAmurine u-PAhu-PAhuman u-PAt-PA‐/‐t-PA-deficientu-PA‐/‐u-PA-deficientELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in transgenic mice in which the gene encoding tissue-type plasminogen activator had been inactivated (6Carmeliet P.

Monoclonal antibodies were produced essentially as described by Galfré and Milstein (7Galfré G. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 1PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous t-PA-deficient (t-PA‐/‐) mice (6Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) were immunized by subcutaneous injection of 10 μg murine t-PA in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed 2 weeks later by intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of mt-PA in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antisera were collected 1 week later and were analyzed in a micro-ELISA using microtiter plates coated with mt-PA (1 μg/ml) and detection of bound immunoglobulins with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The specific antibody concentration in these antisera (see “Results”) was retrospectively calculated by ELISA on microtiter plates coated with the respective antigen using purified monoclonal antibodies for calibration. An identical procedure was used for the evaluation of the immune response in wild-type mice. After an interval of at least 4 weeks, the mice were boosted intraperitoneally with 10 μg of mt-PA in saline on days 4 and 2 before the cell fusion. Spleen cells were isolated and fused with either P3x63.Ag.8-6.5.3 or Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells. After selection in hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine medium, the supernatants were screened for specific antibody production with a one-site non-competitive micro-ELISA using microtiter plates coated with mt-PA and detection of bound immunoglobulins as described above. Positive clones were used for the production of ascites in pristane-primed mice. The IgG fraction of the monoclonal antibodies was purified from ascites by affinity-chromatography on protein A-Sepharose. A similar procedure was followed for the generation of monoclonal antibodies against murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (mu-PA) in homozygous u-PA-deficient (u-PA‐/‐) mice. Cross-reactivity of the obtained anti-mt-PA monoclonal antibodies with (t-)PA from other species (rat, human, or vampire bat) or with murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator, was evaluated by comparative analysis of the reactivity of hybridoma supernatant or purified antibody in a micro-ELISA system using microtiter plates coated with 1 μg/ml of the respective antigen and detection of bound immunoglobulins as described above. Parallel control reactions were carried out using microtiter plates coated with bovine serum albumin to exclude false positive reactions. Domain localization of the epitope recognized by antibodies cross-reacting with human t-PA (ht-PA) was evaluated by comparative analysis of their reactivity in various micro-ELISAs using microtiter plates coated with either one of the domain deletion and/or insertion variants of human t-PA (see below). Determination of overlapping epitopes was carried out through competition of purified antibodies for binding to mt-PA using the Biacore(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, mt-PA (10 μg/ml, in 10 m M acetate, pH 5.0, 30 μl) was coupled to the sensor chip, followed by incubation with one antibody and evaluation of its binding. Subsequently, the binding of a second antibody was evaluated. Lack of binding of the second antibody indicates that both antibodies are directed against the same epitope, or that a significant portion of the epitopes overlap. All pairs of antibodies evaluated were analyzed in both sequences. After each cycle the sensor chip was regenerated using 10 m M HCl. Positive and negative control samples were included at the beginning and at the end of each set of experiments. mt-PA (4 ng/ml) was preincubated (1 h at room temperature) with conditioned medium diluted 1:5 or with a 20-fold molar excess of purified monoclonal antibody. Subsequently residual t-PA activity was measured by a plasminogen-coupled chromogenic substrate assay as described (8Verheijen J.H. Mullaart E. Chang G.T.G. Kluft C. Wijngaards G. Thromb.

A hybrid molecule (K1K2Pu−PA) consisting of kringle 1 and kringle 2 of human t-PA and the protease part of human u-PA was produced and characterized as described (14Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Van Nuffelen A. Demarsin E. Collen D. Thromb. Haemost. 1990; 64: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human t-PA was a kind gift from Genentech Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The statistical significance of differences was assessed using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test for unpaired values and Fisher's exact test for proportions. p values > 0.05 were considered to be not significant. Administration of mt-PA evoked a strong immune response in t-PA‐/‐ mice, resulting in a specific antibody concentration in serum of 675 μg/ml (median; range 100-3,000, n = 4) against mt-PA and of 100 μg/ml (median; range 25-500, n = 4) against human t-PA (ht-PA). Administration of murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (mu-PA) to urokinase-type plasminogen activator-deficient (u-PA‐/‐) mice induced a specific antibody concentration of 350 μg/ml serum (median; range 33-2,000, n = 4) against mu-PA. However, no significant cross-reactivity was observed with human u-PA (hu-PA). These findings suggest that there are common (conserved) epitopes on mt-PA and ht-PA but not on mu-PA and hu-PA; they are consistent with our previous experience that polyclonal antisera raised in rabbits against ht-PA cross-react with mt-PA, whereas antisera raised against hu-PA do not cross-react with mu-PA.( 2P. J. Declerck, M. Verstreken, P. Carmeliet, D. Collen, unpublished observations. 2Administration of mt-PA or mu-PA to wild-type mice resulted in a specific antibody concentration in serum of 15 μg/ml (median; range 9-130, n = 4) against mt-PA and 4 μg/ml (median; range 3-30, n = 4) against mu-PA, respectively (p = 0.029 and p = 0.014 versus gene-inactivated mice, respectively). Two fusions of myeloma cells with spleen cells isolated from immunized t-PA‐/‐ mice yielded 203 hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against mt-PA, whereas one fusion with spleen cells of an immunized u-PA‐/‐ mouse yielded 38 hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against mu-PA. Of the antibodies against mt-PA, 78% cross-reacted with ht-PA, whereas none of the anti-mu-PA antibodies cross-reacted with hu-PA, confirming the differential cross-species reactivity of polyclonal antisera raised with the respective proteins. The cross-reactivity of the anti-mt-PA monoclonal antibodies was further studied using rat t-PA (rt-PA) and vampire bat-PA (bat-PA). Table I illustrates that 10% of the monoclonal antibodies reacted exclusively with mt-PA, 10% cross-reacted with rt-PA, 3% with ht-PA, and 0.5% with bat-PA. However, 61% cross-reacted with three of the four PAs tested, while 15% reacted with all four PAs. None of the monoclonal antibodies raised with mt-PA cross-reacted with mu-PA.Table I:Cross-reactivity of anti-murine t-PA monoclonal antibodies with t-PA obtained from various speciesThe data represent the number of monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with t-PA from the respective species.

The data represent the number of monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with t-PA from the respective species. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of monoclonal antibodies that inhibit plasminogen activation by mt-PA. All antibodies cross-reacting with ht-PA (i.e. n = 158) could be further evaluated with respect to their domain reactivity using a set of deletion/insertion mutants of ht-PA. These experiments revealed that the majority of these antibodies were directed against an epitope in kringle 1 (n = 48), kringle 2 (n = 33), or the protease domain (n = 52) (Table II). 16 monoclonal antibodies required the simultaneous presence of at least two domains (K1-K2, K1-P, or FEK1). Only two antibodies were directed against an epitope in the finger-like domain, while none recognized the growth factor-like domain. Further analysis revealed that the epitopes recognized by the subgroup of 31 monoclonal antibodies reacting with all four PAs were exclusively localized in the finger-like, kringle 1, or the protease domain but not in the kringle 2 domain (Table II).Table II:Domain localization of the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with human t-PAThe data represent the number of monoclonal antibodies reactive with the indicated species and with the indicated domains of human t-PA. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of antibodies that inhibit plasminogen activation. Based on the homology between distinct portions of the amino acid sequence of t-PA with corresponding domains of other proteins, five subdomains (“modules”) are distinguished: a fingerlike domain (F), an epidermal growth-factor domain (E), two kringle domains (K1and K2), and a protease domain (P). Presentation of one domain indicates that the epitope is localized entirely in the respective domain. Presentation of two or three domains indicates that the epitope is composed of parts of two or three domains. Undefined indicates that the domain reactivity could not be deduced unambiguously. mu, murine; hu, human; ra, rat; ba, vampire bat.

Evaluation of the interference of the monoclonal antibodies with the plasminogen activation potential of mt-PA revealed that 111 out of 203 exhibited inhibitory properties toward mt-PA activity (Table I). Of the 21 monoclonal antibodies reacting exclusively with mt-PA, only 6 (29%) were inhibitory, whereas out of the 182 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with one or more other (t-)PAs, 105 (58%) were inhibitory. Table II shows a subanalysis in which the inhibitory properties of the 158 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with ht-PA were compared to their domain reactivity in ht-PA. From these data it appeared that the majority (26 out of 33, 81%) of the kringle-2-reacting antibodies had an inhibitory effect while only 35% (17 out of 48) of the kringle-1-reacting antibodies interfered with the activity. 32 out of 52 (62%) monoclonal antibodies reacting with the protease domain exhibited inhibitory properties (Table II). Interestingly, the kringle-1-reacting antibodies that cross-reacted with the four (t-)PAs were all inhibitory. 26 purified monoclonal antibodies were further subjected to a detailed epitope mapping analysis based on their mutual competition for binding to mt-PA. These data revealed the presence of at least six distinct clusters. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the various epitopes and the association with their domain and/or species reactivity. At least three distinct epitopes were localized in the kringle 1 domain, two in the protease domain and one in the kringle 2 domain. At least three non-overlapping epitopes, two located in the kringle 1 domain and one located in the protease domain, were conserved in all four species and are involved in the t-PA activity. In general, antibodies are prepared either from antisera collected from immunized animals or by hybridoma technology using spleen cells from immunized mice and formation of stable hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Recently strategies have been developed for expression of antibody fragments in Escherichia coli and for the generation of combinatorial libraries in bacteriophages, using phagemid vectors allowing the formation of “phage-displayed” antibodies (15Hawkins R.E. Winter G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Winter G. Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 349: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The efficiency (i.e. number of antibodies as well as their affinity) of the latter procedures is also dependent on the immunization of the animal prior to construction of the library (15Hawkins R.E. Winter G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, different approaches have been described to mimic, in vitro, the naturally occurring process of affinity maturation (17Hawkins R.E. Russell S.J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 18Marks J.D. Griffiths A.D. Malmqvist M. Clackson T.P. Bye J.M. Winter G. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, because of the clonal selection, resulting in an elimination of functional lymphocytes bearing receptors for self-antigens (3Burnet F.M. The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. Vanderbilt University Press, Nashville, TN1959Crossref Google Scholar, 4Nossal G.J. Science. 1989; 245: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the currently available methods do not allow consistent generation of antibodies against self-antigens. In addition, all induced and/or selected antibodies will be directed against epitopes that are not conserved between the two respective species. We hypothesized that the use of t-PA-deficient mice for the production of monoclonal antibodies against mt-PA should not only yield, with a high efficiency, an immune response toward mt-PA, but should also result in the generation of a panel of monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with t-PA from other species. Immunization with mt-PA and mu-PA indeed caused a significantly higher immune response in gene-inactivated than in wild-type mice. Out of two fusions using spleen cells isolated from the immunized t-PA‐/‐ mice, 203 stable hybridomas were obtained producing murine monoclonal antibodies against mt-PA, out of which 182 exhibited a cross-reactivity with at least one of the three other PAs tested. Up to 60% cross-reacted with murine, human, and rat t-PA. Of the currently available data regarding monoclonal antibodies raised against ht-PA in wild-type mice, only a few reports mentioned the occurrence of a cross-reactivity with either rt-PA (19Bulens F. Thompson A.E. Stassen J.M. Moreau H. Declerck P. Nelles L. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 243-249Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or mt-PA (20Cajot J.F. Bachmann E. Cousin E. Kruithof E.K.O. Schleuning W.D. Hauert J. Bachmann F. Thromb. Res. 1987; 46: 141-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the current approach and its correlation with the extend of homology is further illustrated in Table III. Indeed, the higher the percentage of homology, the higher the number of cross-reacting antibodies.Table III:Comparison of interspecies homology and yield of cross-reacting antibodies obtained either from wild-type mice or from t-PA‐/‐ mice More interestingly, 15% (31 out of 203) of the monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with mt-PA, rt-PA, ht-PA, and bat-PA. Localization of the domain reactivity of these antibodies revealed that none were directed against the kringle 2 domain. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis, based on its primary structure, that the kringle of bat-PA is more similar to kringle 1 (77% amino acid identity) than to kringle 2 (56% amino acid identity) of human t-PA (21Gardell S.J. Duong L.T. Diehl R.E. York J.D. Hare T.R. Registrer R.B. Jacobs J.W. Dixon R.A.F. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17947-17952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the observation that none of the currently described anti-mt-PA antibodies cross-reacted with mu-PA, one may not conclude that mt-PA and mu-PA would not have any common epitopes since the t-PA‐/‐ mice used had normal u-PA levels (6Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Consequently, producton of antibodies against epitopes conserved between mt-PA and mu-PA would require the use of “double knocked-out” mice. Because such mice are however severely handicapped (6Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), this was not attempted. Monoclonal antibodies can be directed against epitopes involved in the biological or enzymatic activity of proteins, and it is not unlikely that homologous proteins with similar activities have these particular epitopes in common or at least share a significant degree of similarity. In the present study, out of the 203 monoclonal antibodies, 111 inhibited plasminogen activation by mt-PA. However, of the 21 antibodies reacting exclusively with mt-PA, only 6 (29%) exhibited neutralizing properties, whereas out of the 182 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting with at least one other PA, 105 (58%) were inhibitory. The difference between these ratios is significantly different (p < 0.02), suggesting that epitopes required for the biological activity of plasminogen activators are more conserved across species than other regions of the molecule. Three different epitopes (Fig. 1), conserved among all four species, were found to be involved in the plasminogen activation potential of t-PA. Evaluation of their presence in plasminogen activators other than those used in the present study may reveal how far this conservation extends over various other species. In the current study, the inhibiting properties were evaluated using a plasminogen-coupled chromogenic substrate assay, in the presence of fibrin. Using this method, antibodies interfering with the catalytic activity as well as antibodies interfering with plasminogen or fibrin binding are detected. In addition, evaluation of the inhibitory properties of 23 purified antibodies, using a direct assay for t-PA activity, revealed that one cluster of monoclonal antibodies directed against the protease domain (Fig. 1, MA-H2B1, MA-H5F10, MA-H27B6, MA-H31A1, and MA-H32B8), and recognizing an epitope that is conserved among murine, rat, and human t-PA, also interfered with the catalytic activity of murine as well as human t-PA (data not shown). The observation that the 38 anti-mu-PA antibodies raised in u-PA‐/‐ mice did not cross-react with hu-PA, even though in line with our previous observations that polyclonal antisera raised in rabbits against hu-PA do not cross-react with mu-PA, should be interpreted with some caution. (a) Only a limited number of monoclonal antibodies could be studied that (b) were obtained out of only one fusion, and (c) no u-PAs from other species were included. In conclusion, a large panel of murine monoclonal antibodies directed against mt-PA was obtained using t-PA-deficient mice as immunizing target. These antibodies cover a wide range of epitopes localized in different domains of the molecule and conserved among the various species studied. By extrapolation, it is assumed that immunization of any type of gene-inactivated mice with the respective knocked-out proteins could provide a general means to obtain unique monoclonal antibodies against structurally and functionally conserved domains within other protein families."

https://openalex.org/W1988466873,"Abstract We previously reported that when 32Pi-loaded rat parotid slices are incubated with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the level of a soluble 32P-labeled 17-kDa protein (pp17) decreases rapidly (Kanamori, T., and Hayakawa, T.(1982) Biochem. Int. 4, 517-523). Here we show that pp17 consists of two distinct phosphoproteins (pp17a and pp17b), identify their unphosphorylated forms (p17a and p17b, respectively), and provide evidence for their β-adrenergic stimulation-induced dephosphorylation. Since p17a and p17b were predominant forms even in nonstimulated cells, peptides were generated from them with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or cyanogen bromide; subsequent sequencing of these peptides and homology search allowed identification of p17a and p17b as destrin- and cofilin-like proteins, respectively. Interestingly, they were also dephosphorylated in response to cholinergic stimulation. Because destrin and cofilin are actin-depolymerizing proteins whose activities are possibly regulated by their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, the two parotid proteins reported here might be involved in cortical F-actin disruption observed in parallel with exocytotic amylase secretion."

Incubation of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with the 11-amino acid [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibited bombesin-stimulated cell proliferation and phospholipase Cβ activation even at high bombesin concentrations. The peptide did not inhibit the activation of phospholipase Cβ by a GTPase-deficient form of the Gq-like protein, G16, indicating that the peptide does not inhibit phospholipase Cβ and is acting at a point upstream of the activated form of the G protein α subunit. The peptide inhibited MAP kinase activation at low bombesin concentrations, but unlike phospholipase Cβ, this inhibition could be overcome with 30 n M bombesin. In control Swiss 3T3 cells, bombesin did not measurably activate Ras or Raf-1 above basal levels. Following incubation of the cells with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide, 50 n M bombesin activated Raf-1 4-6-fold over basal levels. Platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated activities of PLC, Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase were unaltered after incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide, as was platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated growth of the Swiss 3T3 cells. Thus, the peptide behaves as an antagonist that differentially inhibited phospholipase Cβ and MAP kinase signal transduction pathways.

Evidence for this in part involves a study using a monoclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of GRP, which has been shown to inhibit the in vitro growth of SCLC cell lines and tumor xenografts in nude mice (9Cuttitta F. Carney D.N. Mulshine J. Moody T.W. Fedorko J. Fischler A. Minna J.D. Nature. 1985; 316: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 11-amino acid synthetic peptide, [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P, has been shown to act as a potent inhibitor of Swiss 3T3 and SCLC cell growth in vitro. Using Swiss 3T3 cells, the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide was demonstrated to diminish 125I-GRP binding to its receptor and inhibit GRP-stimulated calcium mobilization and DNA synthesis (10Woll P.J.

We investigated the effect of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide on the activation of the MAP kinase pathway under conditions in which it inhibits bombesin-stimulated PLCβ activation and growth arrests Swiss 3T3 cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibits activation of the MAP kinase pathway at low concentrations of bombesin and that this can be overcome in a bombesin concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, PLCβ activation is inhibited even at high bombesin concentrations. The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide was purchased from Bachem. myo-[2-3H]Inositol and phosphorus-32 radionuclide were obtained from DuPont NEN. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Pertussis toxin was obtained from List Biological Laboratories. The human bombesin/GRP receptor cDNA was from J. Battey, National Institutes of Health. Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 5% newborn and 5% bovine calf serum, in humidified 7.5% CO2, 92.5% air at 37°C. All experiments were performed with cells between passages 1 and 10 from the original stocks. The cells were quiesced by replacing the growth medium with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20-24 h. When the cells were assayed for kinase activity, this medium was replaced with DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 15 m M Hepes (pH 7.4) for 5-10 min prior to agonist addition. The isolation of stable clones of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing the α16Q212Lpolypeptide has been described previously (11Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes and labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (DMEM/F-12/bovine serum albumin). The cells were then rinsed three times with DMEM, F-12, bovine serum albumin, 15 m M Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubated for 5 min with this medium supplemented with LiCl (20 m M). Agonists were added for an additional 20-min incubation at room temperature. The reactions were terminated with an equal volume of ice-cold methanol/HCl (100:1, v/v) and the cells scraped into an extraction mixture containing H2O:methanol/HCl:chloroform (1:1:2, v/v). After vigorous mixing and centrifugation, the aqueous phase was passed over an AG 1-X8 (200-400 mesh) formate anion-exchange column (Bio-Rad). The total [3H]inositol phosphates were eluted as described previously (14Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

The activation of these proteins was assayed as described previously with slight modifications (11Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

In the experiments represented by Fig. 3 C, the MAP kinase activities were batch eluted from a DEAE-Sephacel column using a high salt concentration (0.5 M, NaCl). The eluate was then assayed in quadruplicate as described previously (15Gardner A.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PhosphorImager analysis was used for a quantitative measure of the products of Raf-1 and Ras activation. Autoradiographs from single, representative experiments are shown, with data from several experiments presented as arbitrary phosphorimaging units. Selective Inhibition of Cell Growth by the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]Substance P Peptide-Fig. 1 shows that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibited bombesin-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide had little or no effect on PDGF-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cell proliferation. The results are similar to previously described cytostatic actions of this peptide with fibroblasts and small cell lung carcinoma lines (10Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The molecular action of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11] substance P peptide is poorly understood, except that it inhibits the ability of bombesin and other neuropeptides to stimulate calcium mobilization (10Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]Substance P Peptide Selectively Modulates Signal Transduction Pathways-We determined that incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibited calcium mobilization in response to bombesin stimulation but had little or no effect on the ability of PDGF to mobilize calcium (not shown). This finding indicated that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide did not influence calcium stores or the ability of phospholipase Cγ catalyzed release of inositol trisphosphate to mobilize intracellular calcium. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibited the ability of 50 n M bombesin, a maximally effective concentration of bombesin in the absence of the inhibitory peptide, to stimulate inositol phosphate generation. The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide had no effect on PDGF-stimulated inositol phosphate generation.FIG. 2Stimulation of PtdIns-PLC activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Total inositol phosphate formation was measured in wild type or α16Q212Lexpressing Swiss 3T3 cells (denoted as G16QL). Serum-starved, myo-[3H]inositol-labeled cells were challenged with 50 n M bombesin or 10 ng/ml PDGF for 20 min and assayed for PLC activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were preincubated with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide (50 μM) for 5 min prior to agonist stimulation and the peptide was present for the duration of the stimulation. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of between three and four independent experiments. In a single experiment each condition was measured in quadruplicate. Other clones of α16Q212Lexpressing Swiss 3T3 cells gave similar results to the clone represented in these experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The bombesin receptor has a predicted seven-transmembrane structure and couples minimally to Gq,11members of the heterotrimeric G protein family (16Strathmann M.

Swiss 3T3 cells stably expressing a mutant GTPase-inhibited Gα16subunit, a member of the Gqsubfamily of G protein α subunits (19Amatruda T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), have a constitutively activated phospholipase Cβ (11Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide had no effect on the ability of the GTPase-inhibited Gα16to activate phospholipase Cβ but inhibited bombesin stimulation of phospholipase Cβ activity (Fig. 2). Thus, the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibited receptor but not Gα16activation of phospholipase Cβ. The site of action of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is therefore upstream of G protein α subunit interaction with phospholipase Cβ. Bombesin and PDGF both activate MAP kinase activity in Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig. 3). The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide has no effect on PDGF stimulation of MAP kinase activity (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with a concentration of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide (50 μM) that totally inhibited PLCβ activation by 50 n M bombesin did not inhibit bombesin receptor stimulation of MAP kinase activity at this concentration of bombesin (Fig. 3, A and C). In fact, in many experiments the inhibitory peptide enhanced MAP kinase activity stimulated by 50 n M bombesin (Fig. 3 A). The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide had little or no effect on basal MAP kinase activity in the absence of bombesin. In Fig. 3 C we demonstrate that, in the presence of 50 μM [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide, bombesin activated MAP kinase in a concentration-dependent manner, although with a lowered affinity (Kdshift from 1.5 ± 0.5 n M to 20 ± 5 n M), consistent with the inhibitory peptide acting as a competitive antagonist. However, 50 n M bombesin could overcome the inhibition of MAP kinase, but not PLCβ activation, by the inhibitory peptide. These findings demonstrated that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide influenced bombesin binding to its receptor, while differentially affecting PLCβ and MAP kinase regulation. Expression of the bombesin/GRP receptor in HEK-293 cells by transfection indicated that the cloned bombesin receptor mediates both phospholipase Cβ and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4). Thus, the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide differentially inhibits two signal transduction pathways regulated by the bombesin receptor. The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide must not simply competitively inhibit bombesin activation of its receptor but must have allosteric effects on the receptor. Regulation of the MAP Kinase Pathway in the Presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]Substance P Peptide-MAP kinase is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is activated by phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine (20Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by a specific tyrosine/threonine-directed kinase, MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) (21Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). MEK is in turn phosphorylated and activated by the protein kinase Raf-1 (22Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Raf-1 interacts with Ras−GTP, and its activity is regulated in a Ras-dependent manner by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (23Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 24Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates that incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide alters the regulation of Raf-1 activation in response to bombesin but not PDGF. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with PDGF or phorbol ester, but not bombesin, leads to a significant activation of Raf-1 (Fig. 5A). PhosphorImager quantitation of MEK phosphorylation in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates from bombesin-stimulated cells of 15 different experiments was not statistically significant relative to basal Raf-1 activity (Fig. 5 B). In striking contrast, incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide resulted in a significant activation of Raf-1 activity in response to 50 n M bombesin relative to basal or peptide in the absence of bombesin. The peptide had little effect itself, on either MAP kinase or Raf-1 activity. The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide had no significant effect on PDGF receptor signaling or phorbol ester stimulation of Raf-1 activity (Fig. 5, A and B).FIG. 5A, Raf-1 activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with agonists in the absence or presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide (50 μM, 5-min preincubation) and assayed for Raf-1 activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were stimulated with bombesin (50 n M, 2 min), TPA (200 n M, 5 min), or PDGF (10 ng/ml, 5 min). Purified recombinant wild type MEK was autophosphorylated and used as a standard (as indicated). An autoradiograph from a single experiment, representative of at least five experiments, is shown. B, PhosphorImager analysis of phosphorylated MEK-1 in Swiss 3T3 cells. Quantification of the [32P]MEK protein is represented as -fold activation over basal in arbitrary units. The number of individual experiments quantified varied between 5 and 15, depending upon the condition. Bombesin in the absence or presence of peptide are conditions representative of 15 individual experiments and the increased activity observed in the presence of the peptide was significant (p < 0.01 by Student's t test). C, PhosphorImager analysis of phosphorylated MEK-1 in control and pertussis toxin-treated Swiss 3T3 cells. Serum-starved cells were stimulated and assayed as described in A. When toxin-treated, cells were incubated for 18 h with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) prior to agonist stimulation. Quantification of the [32P]MEK protein is represented as -fold activation over basal in arbitrary units. The number of individual experiments quantified varied between 3 and 5, depending upon the condition. The increased activity in the presence of the peptide was significant in both the control (p < 0.01 by Student's t test) and the pertussis toxin-treated cells (p < 0.05 by Student's t test). The apparent decrease in PDGF-stimulated Raf-1 activity upon pertussis toxin pretreatment of the Swiss 3T3 cells was not significant (p < 0.10 by Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increased Raf-1 activation in response to bombesin in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide was not due to the receptor coupling to Gior Goproteins. Pertussis toxin treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells, to uncouple Giand Goproteins from receptors, had no significant effect on the ability of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide to enhance Raf-1 activation in response to bombesin (Fig. 5 C). Even though the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide enhanced bombesin-stimulated Raf-1 activity, it had little or no effect on Ras−GTP loading (Fig. 6). The Ras−GTP loading assay (25Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) is non-catalytic and thus rather insensitive. Nonetheless, PDGF stimulation resulted in a 4.5-5-fold increase in Ras−GTP loading, whereas the response to bombesin was not significantly different from basal levels in the presence or absence of peptide (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the increased Raf-1 activity in response to bombesin in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is independent of a significant change in Ras−GTP loading. The [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibits bombesin but not PDGF-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cell growth and induces apoptosis of small cell lung carcinoma cells whose growth is dependent on neuropeptide autocrine or paracrine loops (26Reeve J.G. Bleehen N.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide inhibits phospholipase Cβ and MAP kinase activation in response to bombesin, but that only the MAP kinase inhibition was overcome by high bombesin concentrations. The action of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is selective for bombesin receptor/G protein and not PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase regulated signal transduction pathways. The results clearly demonstrate that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide differentially inhibits bombesin activation of receptor-mediated responses. The enhanced Raf-1 activity in response to bombesin stimulation in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide may be explained in part by the inhibition of phospholipase Cβ activity. Stimulation of protein kinase C activity resulting from phospholipase Cβ activation in Swiss 3T3 cells leads to enhanced cAMP synthesis and protein kinase A activation (11Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase A in response to elevated cAMP levels has been shown to uncouple Raf-1 activation from Ras−GTP loading (28Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 29Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

In fact, protein kinase A activation in Swiss 3T3 cells inhibits the enhanced activation of Raf-1 in response to bombesin in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide (data not shown). Thus, bombesin activation of Raf-1 is more pronounced in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide. The robust Ras−GTP loading in response to PDGF is apparently sufficient to significantly overcome any protein kinase A-mediated uncoupling of Raf-1 activation that would occur in response to phospholipase Cγ activation. Saltiel and colleagues (7Pang L. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that bombesin-stimulated, but not epidermal growth factor-stimulated, MAP kinase activation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts is inhibited by over 90% following TPA-mediated down-regulation of PKC. We have confirmed this observation with prolonged exposure to TPA, causing a 80-100% reduction in the bombesin-stimulated MAP kinase activity observed in both the absence and presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide (data not shown). Prolonged exposure to TPA does not impair the ability of the bombesin receptor to activate PLCβ. PDGF-stimulated MAP kinase activity is also inhibited 50-60% after prolonged TPA treatment (data not shown). These observations could be interpreted to suggest that the activation of MAP kinase by bombesin, in the absence and presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide, requires activation of a TPA-sensitive PKC isoform. This raises the possibility that in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide an isoform of PKC is activated by a sn-1,2-diradylglycerol species independent from PLCβ activation. Bombesin regulation of a PLD-like activity, although currently poorly understood, is possible (5Cook S.J. Briscoe C.P. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consequence of PLD and PLCβ stimulation of PKC isoforms must then have different regulatory functions. However, interpretation of the TPA down-regulation experiments should be qualified with the fact that TPA also activates the MAP kinase pathway. MAP kinase has been proposed to regulate activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway by feedback inhibition (see Ref. 35Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The potentially multiple effects observed with TPA make interpretation of the down-regulation experiments difficult and may explain in part the partial inhibition we observe for PDGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation. The question arises how the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide selectively inhibits bombesin-stimulated phospholipase Cβ but not MAP kinase activation at high bombesin concentrations (50 n M). Mukai et al. (36Mukai H. Munekata E. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16237-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a novel truncated substance P-related peptide, p-Glu-Gln- D-Trp-Phe- D-Trp- D-Trp-Met-NH2, which inhibited m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (m2 receptor) activation of Giand Goin reconstituted phospholipid vesicles. The inhibitory peptide interfered neither with ligand binding to the m2 receptor nor with binding of guanine nucleotides to Gαiand Gαo. Their findings indicated that the inhibitory peptide bound to the G proteins and inhibited m2 receptor coupling to Giand Go. The sequence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is D-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro- D-Phe-Gln- D-Trp-Phe- D-Trp-Leu-Leu-NH2(10Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The two inhibitory peptides have the conserved 4-amino acid sequence Gln- D-Trp-Phe- D-Trp, although the flanking amino acids also appear critical for their pharmacological action (10Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Mukai H. Munekata E. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16237-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3968-3973PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide uncoupling Gq,11from the bombesin receptor. The site of action of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is presently unclear. It clearly reduces the affinity of the receptor for bombesin but selectively alters regulation of two effector pathways at high bombesin concentrations. This suggests that the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide most likely acts allosterically at a site distinct from the bombesin receptor ligand binding domain. This interpretation is consistent with the ability of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide to have inhibitory effects on a number of neuropeptide receptors (10Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1859-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 37Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3968-3973PubMed Google Scholar). The putative allosteric regulatory site could be either on the extracellular or cytoplasmic domain of the neuropeptide receptor. Studies to define the site of action of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide are currently ongoing. The bombesin receptor is, however, still functional and capable of signaling in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide as demonstrated by the stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway at 50 n M bombesin. βγ subunits of G proteins appear to play an important role in activation of the MAP kinase pathway (38Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 39Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear if bombesin-stimulated MAP kinase activity in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide allows βγ subunits to be released from Gq,11or if an additional G protein remains coupled to the bombesin receptor that is capable of regulating the MAP kinase pathway. If another G protein is coupled to the bombesin receptor it is not Gior Go, because the bombesin response in the presence of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide is not pertussis toxin-sensitive. Woll and Rozengurt (37Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3968-3973PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the hexapeptide Arg- D-Trp-MePhe- D-Trp-Leu-Met-NH2had broad neuropeptide antagonist activity in Swiss 3T3 cells. This hexapeptide also inhibits the growth of small cell lung carcinoma cells in vitro (37Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3968-3973PubMed Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 cells this hexapeptide was a potent vasopressin antagonist and weak bombesin and bradykinin antagonist relative to the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide. The hexapeptide antagonist was, however, equipotent to the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide in arresting small cell lung carcinoma cell growth. From these observations the authors concluded that the actions of these peptides cannot simply be related to interruption or antagonism of bombesin-driven autocrine loops in small cell lung carcinoma (36Mukai H. Munekata E. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16237-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that the antagonist peptide can selectively inhibit the activation of one signal transduction effector but not another at high bombesin concentrations. We propose that it is the disruption of the coordinated regulation of multiple signaling pathways that contributes to the growth inhibitory properties of the [D-Arg1, D-Phe5, D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P peptide. If this hypothesis is correct, it suggests that compounds that differentially regulate the different arms of signal transduction pathways regulated by G protein-coupled receptors will be potential anti-tumorigenic agents for small cell lung carcinoma and other carcinomas that proliferate in response to neuropeptide autocrine or paracrine loops."
https://openalex.org/W2017800300,"We have cloned a protein tyrosine kinase, MATK, which is expressed abundantly in megakaryocytes and the brain. We investigated whether MATK participates in the c-Kit ligand/stem cell factor (KL/SCF) signaling pathway in the megakaryocytic cell line CMK. After KL/SCF stimulation, five major proteins of molecular masses of 145, 113, 92, 76, and 63 kDa were rapidly and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner, peaking within 5 min, and returning to basal levels within 60 min. To study the role of MATK in the KL/SCF signaling pathway, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing SH2 and SH3 domains of MATK were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. MATK-SH2, but not MATK-SH3, precipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Kit (molecular mass of 145 kDa) in KL/SCF-stimulated CMK cells. Other GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of p85 of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C gamma-1, and ras-GAP also precipitated c-Kit. The tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Kit was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-MATK and anti-p85 antibodies in KL/SCF-stimulated CMK cells, but not in granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or interleukin-6-stimulated cells, suggesting receptor specificity. These results indicate that MATK associates with the c-Kit receptor following specific stimulation by KL/SCF via its SH2 domain and likely participates in transduction of growth signals induced by this cytokine in megakaryocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2058270533,"Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), which irreversibly entraps proteinases through a drastic conformational change, has also been reported to bind various cytokines. The meaning of cytokine binding to native and/or transformed α2M molecules is, however, not understood. In an attempt to elucidate this question, we have studied the interaction of radioiodinated recombinant human interleukin-2 (125I-rhIL-2) with native and chymotrypsin (α2M-C)- or methylamine-transformed (α2M-MA) α2M. Our results show that native and α2M-MA are able to bind 125I-rhIL-2, with binding occurring only with the latter in a covalent manner, whereas the labeled cytokine is proteolyzed when incubated with α2M-entrapped chymotrypsin. The degradation of uncomplexed 125I-rhIL-2 has also been observed in the presence of trypsin, whereas 125I-rhIL-2 bound to α2M-MA is protected. Moreover, the proliferative activity of this cytokine on responsive cells is still maintained either with native α2M- or α2M-MA-complexed rhIL-2 in comparison with that observed with the cytokine alone. Our results, which lead us to consider α2M molecules as IL-2-binding proteins, emphasize the possible role of these molecules as immune response regulators. Human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), which irreversibly entraps proteinases through a drastic conformational change, has also been reported to bind various cytokines. The meaning of cytokine binding to native and/or transformed α2M molecules is, however, not understood. In an attempt to elucidate this question, we have studied the interaction of radioiodinated recombinant human interleukin-2 (125I-rhIL-2) with native and chymotrypsin (α2M-C)- or methylamine-transformed (α2M-MA) α2M. Our results show that native and α2M-MA are able to bind 125I-rhIL-2, with binding occurring only with the latter in a covalent manner, whereas the labeled cytokine is proteolyzed when incubated with α2M-entrapped chymotrypsin. The degradation of uncomplexed 125I-rhIL-2 has also been observed in the presence of trypsin, whereas 125I-rhIL-2 bound to α2M-MA is protected.

Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to vertebrates (2Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The main biological function now attributed to α2M within a unique trapping mechanism (3Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) is its nonspecific endoproteinase inhibitory activity. A proteolytic attack of each subunit of the tetrameric α2M molecule, leading to the breaking of internal thiol ester bonds, induces a remarkable structural modification of this molecule. Proteinases, whose activity is then confined to small substrates only (4Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Research Monographs in Cell and Tissue Physiology-Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Vol. 2. North-Holland Publishing Co., New York1977: 663-696Google Scholar), are irreversibly entrapped. A similar conformational change in α2M is also obtained after nucleophile hydrolysis of these thiol ester bonds by primary amines, e.g. methylamine, in the absence of proteolytic cleavage. In nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), native and proteinase- or methylamine-transformed α2M molecules, which exhibit an obvious difference in mobility, are usually designated as slow (S) and fast (F) forms, respectively (5Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The two existing F-forms cannot be distinguished by PAGE but are easily differentiated by electron microscopy (EM) (6Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. Van Leuven F. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1992; 5: 231-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).As soon as it was identified as a foremost plasma-binding protein for several growth factors and interleukins (reviewed in Refs. 7LaMarre J.

Res. 1989; 22: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), interesting hypotheses were proposed regarding the role of α2M in the regulation of cytokine functions: α2M may act by scavenging them through its specific receptor or by carrying and protecting them from proteinase-induced degradation. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a 15 kDa glycoprotein, secreted by antigen-activated T lymphocytes (13Smith K.A. Science. 1988; 240: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), which regulates the growth and differentiation of cells belonging to the hematopoietic and lymphoid lineages. As recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) is now frequently used as an immunotherapeutic agent in several trials against cancer (14Rosenberg S.A. Lotze M.T. Muul L.M. Chang A.E. Avis F.P. Leitman S. Linehan W.M. Robertson C.N. Lee R.E. Rubin J.T. Seipp C.A. Simpson C.G. White D.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), we felt that an important point worth investigating was its possible interaction with α2M. Recently, James and co-workers (15James K. Milne I. Cunningham A. Elliott S.-F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that α2M-MA could interfere with the detection of IL-2 using certain commercial cytokine assays, suggested a possible interaction between this cytokine and α2M-MA. The present paper reports the first demonstration by PAGE analysis of biochemical interactions between 125I-rhIL-2 and different forms of α2M.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents125I-rhIL-2 (39-52 μCi/μg) was provided by Amersham (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Unlabeled rhIL-2 (ProleukinR, Eurocetus, Rueil-Malmaison, France) was a generous gift from Dr. Bernard Escudier (Unité d'Immunothérapie, from the Institut Gustave-Roussy). Porcine chymotrypsin and trypsin were purchased from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany), and methylamine was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). HEPES buffer was 20 m M HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 m M NaCl.Purification of Human Plasma α2MHuman native α2M was prepared from fresh plasma (Centre National de la Transfusion Sanguine, Les Ulis, France) by zinc affinity chromatography (16Kurechi T. Kress L.F. Laskowski M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin (α2M-C)- and methylamine-transformed (α2M-MA) α2M molecules were obtained, as described previously (17Pochon F. Barray M. Delain E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purity and homogeneity of α2M solutions were systematically controlled by EM observation (6Delain E. Pochon F. Barray M. Van Leuven F. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1992; 5: 231-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Characterization of α2M-125I−rhIL-2 Complexes by Native PAGESamples were run on 4% native PAGE in 0.1 M Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0, for 2-3 h at 250 V. For SDS-PAGE analysis, samples were treated with 3% SDS in the absence or not of 60 m M DTT and incubated for 1 h at 37°C prior to electrophoretic migration. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue in methanol:acetic acid (40:10), dried, and autoradiographed.Studies on the Binding of 125I-rhIL-2 to Native and Transformed α2MTwo and four pmol of S- and F-forms, respectively, were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 0.04 pmol of 125I-rhIL-2 in a total volume of 10 μl of HEPES buffer and then subjected to gel electrophoresis.Effect of Trypsin Treatment on the Binding of 125I-rhIL-2 to α2M-MAα2M-MA (400 n M) was first incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 125I-rhIL-2 (4 n M). The mixture was subsequently treated or not with various amounts of trypsin for 1 h at 37°C in HEPES buffer (15 μl final volume) and run onto nondenaturing PAGE, as described previously. Control of proteinase digestion was performed in the same conditions with 125I-rhIL-2 alone.Biological Activity of the α2M−rhIL-2 ComplexesIL-2 activity of the complexes was determined with a standard T-cell proliferation assay by measuring the uptake of tritiated thymidine in the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 (18Gillis S. Fern M.M. Ou W. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 2027-2032PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Didier Fradelizi (INSERM U283, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France). Cells were seeded at 4 × 103cells/well in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum, 2 m ML-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5 × 10−4Mβ-mercaptoethanol in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter trays. Incubations of rhIL-2 were first performed at 37°C for 3 h in 100 μl either with culture medium or with native and chymotrypsin- or methylamine-transformed α2M. Mixtures were then added to each well in triplicate. After 24 h of culture at 37°C in 5% CO2, the incubation was prolonged for 18 h in the presence of 100 μCi (10 μl) of [6-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) (Amersham). Cells were collected on filters with a cell harvester and the radioactivity was measured in a Beckmann liquid scintillation counter.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur study provides compelling evidence of an interaction between purified human α2M and 125I-rhIL-2. Indeed, we have observed that 125I-rhIL-2 binds to native α2M (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) and to α2M-MA (lanes 5 and 6), whereas 125I-rhIL-2 is degraded in the presence of purified (with no free chymotrypsin) α2M-C, as demonstrated by the absence of radioactivity either in the wells (nonmigrating 125I-rhIL-2) or associated with the α2M-C band (lanes 3 and 4). The remaining proteinase activity of chymotrypsin was due to the entrapment of the proteinase within the α2M molecule via a mechanism which does not involve its active site (3Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). As a consequence, α2M-complexed proteinases would still be able to degrade or activate some substrates by proteolysis as already demonstrated for the conversion of proinsulin into insulin (19Largman C. Johnson J.H. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Nature. 1977; 269: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our findings are therefore at variance with those of Heumann and Vischer (20Heumann D. Vischer T.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) who observed undegraded 125I-rhIL-2 in the presence of α2M-chymotrypsin for a broad spectrum of α2M-proteinases in which α2M-entrapped trypsin was only efficient when proteolyzing 125I-rhIL-2. Our results, however, indicate that α2M could indeed be an rhIL-2-binding protein and extend the previous observations which described its relationship with various cytokines (7LaMarre J. Wollenberg G.K. Gonias S.L. Hayes M.A. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar).The following results are noteworthy for they avoid ambiguous interpretations. Using outdated α2M-MA (stored for months at 4°C), we observed another slower migrating band which could be confused with a native S-form α2M in nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 2 A). Using EM to control this old α2M-MA preparation we detected associated molecules of this F-form of α2M (Fig. 2 B), which could account for this slower migration. This additional band containing dimeric forms of α2M-MA was unable to bind 125I-rhIL-2, whereas single molecules did. In the same setting, using outdated α2M-C, proteolytic degradation of 125I-rhIL-2 was not observed. Seemingly, the entrapped-chymotrypsin molecules had lost their activity with time. 125I-rhIL-2, which was only detectable in the wells, could not, however, be bound by α2M-C (data not shown). The above observations underscore the need to both clearly characterize the conformational state of the α2M molecules with which cytokines react and to verify the purity and homogeneity of the different α2M preparations. EM, associated with PAGE analysis, should therefore be considered as a valid tool for such quality control.FIG. 2Slow bands are not always the S-form α2M. Outdated α2M-MA and 125I-rhIL-2 were incubated in duplicate. A, PAGE analysis (lanes 1 and 2) shows two bands, a faster band corresponding to α2M-MA (F-form) which binds 125I-rhIL-2 and a slower one which does not (lanes 3 and 4). B, the EM picture demonstrates that this old α2M-MA preparation contains polymers of α2M-MA (arrows). Scale = 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of the binding of 125I-rhIL-2 with SDS-PAGE showed that radioactivity was still present in the α2M-MA band of the sample which had not been treated with DTT (Fig. 3, lane 3), but was absent from the reduced sample (Fig. 3, lane 4). We conclude that the cytokine is covalently bound only to α2M-MA through a disulfide bond. It has been established (21Robb R.J. Kutny R.M. Panico M. Morris H.R. Chowdhry V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Liang S.M. Allet B. Rose K. Hirschi M. Liang C.M. Thatcher D.R. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that, among the three cysteine (Cys) residues present in the mature form of human IL-2, two are involved in an intramolecular disulfide bond (at positions 58 and 105) and are essential for biological activity (23Wang A. Lu S.D. Mark D.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), whereas the Cys residue at position 125, which contains a free sulfhydryl group, is not important (23Wang A. Lu S.D. Mark D.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 24Liang S.M. Thatcher D.R. Liang C.M. Allet B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 334-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native α2M is transformed by methylamine through a slow process which generates four SH groups. The Cys-125 residue probably reacts with one of these groups to form a covalent bond, without compromising the biological activity of IL-2.FIG. 3Covalent binding. For SDS-PAGE analysis, samples were treated with 3% SDS in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) or not (lanes 2 and 4) of 60 m M DTT. Lanes 3 and 4 are autoradiograms. In the presence of SDS, α2M-MA molecules migrate as half-molecules (360 kDa), and under reducing conditions, we observe the complete conversion to the subunits (180 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether α2M-MA is able to protect rhIL-2 from proteolysis, both were first allowed to form complexes and then incubated with various amounts of trypsin. Fig. 4 shows that 125I-rhIL-2 resisted trypsin activity when complexed to α2M-MA (lanes 4-6), whereas free 125I-rhIL-2 was completely degraded in the wells (lanes 4-6) and when incubated alone with the proteinase (lane 2). We postulate that some trypsin-sensitive sites on the IL-2 molecule become inaccessible when it is bound to α2M-MA. Similar results, already demonstrated for the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-6 (25Matsuda T. Hirano T. Nagasawa S. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 148-152PubMed Google Scholar) and nerve growth factor (12Koo P.H. Stach R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggest that cytokines could be protected by α2M from the onslaught of proteinases.FIG. 4Effect of trypsin treatment on cytokine binding. Complex form between α2M-MA and 125I-rhIL-2, observed on autoradiograms before trypsin treatment (lane 3), is maintained after treatment with 1.25, 2.50, or 5.00 pmol of trypsin (lanes 4-6). The profiles of 125I-rhIL-2 alone or treated with 2.50 pmol of trypsin are shown as controls in lanes 1 and 2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using increasing amounts of unlabeled rhIL-2, we inhibited 125I-rhIL-2 binding to α2M-MA in a dose-dependent competitive manner (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, the data presented in Fig. 6 demonstrate a poor α2M-MA binding ratio, for only half of these molecules were able to bind one rhIL-2 molecule. We wondered whether the rhIL-2 complexed to α2M molecules was still biologically active or not. Results, which are depicted in Fig. 7, show first that whatever the α2M form used and without an additional amount of cytokine, CTLL-2 proliferation was not induced (Fig. 7 A, Exp. 1). When incubated with rhIL-2 (Exp. 2), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” native α2M or α2M-MA stimulated cell proliferation to the same extent as rhIL-2 alone, whereas a loss of rhIL-2 biological activity was observed in the presence of α2M-C. This last result further corroborated our preliminary biochemical data which evidenced cytokine degradation by α2M-entrapped chymotrypsin. In order to exclude any biological effect of nonmigrating (uncomplexed) rhIL-2, described in our PAGE experiments, native α2M or α2M-MA was incubated overnight at room temperature together with a large rhIL-2 molar excess and rhIL-2-complexed α2M molecules were then isolated by gel filtration. We demonstrate that the proliferative activity of either the native α2M- or the α2M-MA-complexed rhIL-2 is maintained on CTLL-2 (B), in a similar manner to that obtained with the cytokine alone, and we conclude that α2M is potentially able to bind a biologically active rhIL-2.FIG. 5Binding competition. Incubation of α2M-MA (1.33 μM) and 125I-rhIL-2 (13.3 n M) was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” at a constant 125I-rhIL-2:α2M-MA (1:100) molar ratio in the presence of 100-, 200-, 300-, 400-, 1000-, and 1600-fold molar excess of unlabeled rhIL-2 (lanes 2-7). Control experiments with 125I-rhIL-2 alone and without unlabeled rhIL-2 are shown in lane C and lane 1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIG. 6Distribution of 125I-rhIL-2 during α2M-MA binding. A mixture of cold rhIL-2 (6.66 μM) and 125I-rhIL-2 (4.69 × 10−5μM) as a tracer was incubated with α2M-MA (1.66 μM) at 37°C for 3 h in HEPES buffer (total count: 58,560 cpm) prior to loading on an AcA-54 gel filtration column (1 × 15 cm) (Sofracor, Paris, France). 125I-rhIL-2 (open square) co-eluted with a single peak of α2M (closed square) which was controlled by EM.

This phenomenon is partly explained by a similarity between the pH of the electrophoretic buffer and the isoelectric point of IL-2 which, as a consequence, fails to enter the gel. Unexpected radioactive bands were also observed on the autoradiograms as intermediate or faster than α2M-MA migrating bands. We felt that these bands merely reflected a particular type of behavior of 125I-rhIL-2 in our experimental conditions. We therefore performed similar binding experiments either at pH 6.5 or at pH 9.0 (Fig. 8). We show first that the labeled cytokine still remained in the wells at both pH values, but with a reduced radioactive signal at pH 9.0 which is interpreted as a loss of labeled cytokine from the gel. At pH 6.5 (Fig. 8 A), autoradiography demonstrated lesser radioactive intensity for the native (lane 2) than for the methylamine-transformed (lane 3) α2M bands. We previously observed that native α2M does not bind the cytokine in a covalent manner. We suggest that 125I-rhIL-2 could be released from α2M molecules in an acidic environment, as already described for other cytokines (26Bonner J.C. Goodell A.L. Lasky J.A. Hoffman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12837-12844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Webb D.J. Crookston K.P. Hall S.W. Gonias S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, at this pH value, other faster bands appeared on autoradiography (not detectable in Coomassie staining) in the presence of native α2M. These bands could be related to the dissociation of α2M molecules into subunits, as already demonstrated by Pochon et al. (28Pochon F. Barray M. Delain E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In our experiment at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), we have also observed an extra radioactive faster band, not detectable in Coomassie staining, which is also capable of binding the cytokine. At the present time we have no other explanation than the possibility of native α2M molecules dissociation. At pH 9.0 (Fig. 8B), migrating bands, slower than the native corresponding band, appeared on autoradiography (lanes 2 and 3) and were comparable with the control where a similar band was detected (lane 1). However, cytokine binding to α2M-MA was seemingly unmodified either at pH 6.5 or at pH 9.0. It should be noted that this commercial 125I-rhIL-2 is in a nonglycosylated form and thus could be aggregated and form unspecific radioactive bands, as described above. These observations, which are relevant to rhIL-2 binding to α2M, suggest that environmental variations could physiologically influence the binding or the release capacity of α2M, thus providing further evidence that α2M plays a regulatory role in the immune system.FIG. 8Unspecific radioactive bands. α2M forms (400 n M) were incubated with 125I-rhIL-2 (4 n M). Native PAGE were processed as already described either at pH 6.5 (A) or at pH 9.0 (B).

The internalization of α2M is mediated through high affinity receptors present on the surface of a variety of cells, including macrophages (30Imber M.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only α2M F-forms can bind to these receptors and be cleared from the circulation (31Feldman S.R. Rosenberg M.R. Ney K.A. Michalopoulos G.M. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or delivered to macrophages, resulting in enhanced α2M-bound antigen presentation and antibody production, as related by Pizzo and co-workers (32Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 48-58PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chu C.T. Oury T.D. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1538-1545PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer treatments using rhIL-2, which now tends to be administered in lower doses, either injected alone or combined with immunocompetent cells for adoptive immunotherapy (34Fisher R.I. Coltman C.A.

Med. 1988; 108: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), is still hampered by considerable cytokine degradation and cytokine-induced toxicity. Interactions between IL-2 and α2M have already been reported in a biological system. Although it has been shown by Hubbard et al. (35Hubbard W.H. Hess A.D. Hsia S. Amos D.B. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 292-297PubMed Google Scholar) that T-cell proliferation is inhibited when α2M-bound trypsin is added to human mixed lymphocyte cultures, suggesting a decrease in IL-2 biological activity, two other papers (36Borth W. Teodorescu M. Immunology. 1986; 57: 367-371PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mannhalter J.W. Borth W. Eibl M.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2792-2799PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the loss of IL-2 activity is due to α2M-bound trypsin residual activity and not the result of a trypsin-induced conformational change in α2M. Our study, which at the present time throws further light on the role of human plasma α2M in the regulatory functions of cytokines, could be of significant clinical interest in cancer immunotherapy, particularly as rhIL-2 is currently employed in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma (34Fisher R.I.

J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) is its nonspecific endoproteinase inhibitory activity. A proteolytic attack of each subunit of the tetrameric α2M molecule, leading to the breaking of internal thiol ester bonds, induces a remarkable structural modification of this molecule. Proteinases, whose activity is then confined to small substrates only (4Starkey P.M. Barrett A.J. Barrett A.J. Research Monographs in Cell and Tissue Physiology-Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. Vol. 2. North-Holland Publishing Co., New York1977: 663-696Google Scholar), are irreversibly entrapped. A similar conformational change in α2M is also obtained after nucleophile hydrolysis of these thiol ester bonds by primary amines, e.g. methylamine, in the absence of proteolytic cleavage. In nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), native and proteinase- or methylamine-transformed α2M molecules, which exhibit an obvious difference in mobility, are usually designated as slow (S) and fast (F) forms,"

The size of the pol ∊ transcript for the catalytic subunit (>200 kDa) was investigated in both normal human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. A 7.7-kilobase transcript was detected which was 5-16-fold more prevalent in proliferating than in quiescent HeLa cells. No significant difference in the level of pol ∊ transcript in HeLa cells or fibroblasts was seen after ultraviolet irradiation. Mouse polyclonal antiserum was produced to a 144-amino acid fragment of pol ∊ fused to staphylococcal protein A. This non-neutralizing polyclonal antiserum specifically recognized the catalytic subunit of pol ∊ by immunoblotting, but not that of pol α, β, or δ. In addition, mouse polyclonal antiserum raised against column-purified pol ∊ was able to recognize and to neutralize pol ∊, and a mouse monoclonal antibody was raised which was able to recognize specifically the catalytic subunit of pol ∊."
https://openalex.org/W1532508445,"The molecular basis by which transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 protects certain tumor cells from tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytotoxicity was investigated. When pretreated with TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, murine L929S fibroblasts developed resistance to TNF cytotoxicity. Time course experiments revealed that TGF-β1 initially induced both cellular protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and simultaneous secretion of a novel extracellular matrix TNF-resistance triggering (TRT) protein(s), which closely preceded the acquisition of TNF-resistance. TGF-β2 and -β3 also increased tyrosine phosphorylation. However, both molecules failed to stimulate TRT secretion. The increased levels of phosphorylation, particularly to 9 specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive cellular proteins, appeared to alter the TNF killing pathway. TGF-β1-induced TRT secretion required participation of unknown serum factors. TRT adhered strongly to polystyrene plates and resisted treatment with heat (60°C, 30 min), collagenase, α2-macroglobulin, heparin, antibodies against TGF-βs, and limited trypsin digestion. Notably, TRT promoted TNF-resistance via activation of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase functions in L929S. Thus, the molecular pathway involves TGF-β1-mediated initiation of a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular protein substrates (which alters TNF cytotoxic pathway), and a simultaneous secretion of TRT, which in turn signals the cells to maintain the levels of phosphorylation, thereby sustaining the TNF-resistance.

Furthermore, TGF-β inhibits the development of lymphokine-activated killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, an action which is reversed by TNF-α(5Espevik T. Figari I.S. Ranges G.E. Palladino Jr., M.A. J.

However, in other reports, TGF-β and TNF-α were found to act synergistically to induce monocytic differentiation of human leukemic cell lines(7Kamijo R. Takeda K. Nagumo M. Konno K.C. J.

The molecular mechanism by which TGF-β protects some cancer cells from TNF cytotoxicity is unknown. One possibility is that TGF-β produces metabolic changes in cancer cells, such that part of the TNF cytotoxic pathways is either blocked or eliminated(9Larrick J.W. Wright S.C. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). One report demonstrated that TGF-β-mediated growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle correlates with increased cellular resistance to TNF in a murine fibrosarcoma cell line, L929(2Belizario J.E. Dinarello C.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2379-2385PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was determined that this acquired TNF-resistance of L929 cells is associated with TGF-β-induced de novo protein synthesis (4Kamijo R. Takeda K. Nagumo M. Konno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 158: 155-162Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the TGF-β-induced protein products which are responsible for blocking TNF function have not been identified and their mode of action is unknown. To understand how the type I TGF-β (TGF-β1) induces TNF-resistance in the murine L929 fibrosarcoma cell line (L929S), we have determined in this study that TGF-β1 induction of resistance to TNF involves both an early protein-tyrosine phosphorylation event and a simultaneous secretion of a novel extracellular matrix TNF-resistance triggering (TRT) protein(s). The raised tyrosine phosphorylation appeared to alter the TNF killing pathway, and TRT further activated cellular protein kinases, thus maintaining the levels of phosphorylation and prolonging the status of TNF-resistance in TGF-β1-treated L929S cells. Both murine TNF-sensitive L929S and TNF-resistant L929R cells were kindly provided by Dr. D. Beezhold of the Guthrie Research Institute. L929R cells resist the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α and TNF-β (10-500 units/ml) even in the presence of actinomycin D (Act D; 1 μg/ml). These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JR Scientific, Woodland, CA), in a 5% CO2/atmosphere, 37°C incubator. Where indicated, a serum-free medium, HyQ-CCM2 (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), was used to culture fibroblasts in some experiments. TNF cytotoxicity assays were performed using L929S fibroblasts as killing targets, as described previously(10Chang N.-S. Intrieri C. Mattison J. Armand G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-μl aliquots of L929S cells (2 × 105/ml) were dispensed onto 96-well microtiter plates and cultured 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C. The cell monolayers were then pretreated with human TGF-β1 (0.25-2 ng/ml; Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA) for 10 min to 14 h (or prolonging up to 48 h) at 37°C prior to washing with RPMI 1640 and challenge with recombinant TNF-α (2.5-10 units/ml; Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA) in the presence of Act D (1 μg/ml; Sigma). Similarly, L929S monolayers were treated with recombinant human TGF-β2 and -β3 (0.25-2 ng/ml; Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). Following 24 h in culture, measurement of TNF-mediated cellular cytotoxicity using crystal violet stain (OD at 590 nm) was performed as described(10Chang N.-S. Intrieri C. Mattison J. Armand G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The percentages of cytotoxicity were calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity = [(OD from control cells - OD from TNF-treated cells)/OD from control cells] × 100. Furthermore, the percentages of TNF-resistance induced by TGF-β were also calculated as: % induced TNF-resistance = [1 - (% TNF killing of TGF-β treated cells/% TNF killing of control cells)] × 100. The modulation of TGF-β1 induction of TNF-resistance by protein kinase inhibitors was examined. These inhibitors included genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone)(11Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S.

L929S monolayers (2 × 105/ml) in 96-well microtiter plates were treated with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of protein kinase inhibitors (1-30 μM) for 1-6 h at 37°C prior to exposing to TNF-α/Act D for 24 h. Where indicated, L929S cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 for 1 h, followed by coincubation with protein kinase inhibitors for 1-6 h. Similar experiments were performed by treating L929S cells with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) and/or brefeldin A (18Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Alternatively, the cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 for 4 h followed by a 2-h exposure to brefeldin A. In control experiments, the TNF-resistant L929R cells were treated similarly. To examine TGF-β-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular protein substrates, L929S and L929R cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with or without TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3 (2 ng/ml) for 0.5-8 h at 37°C in the presence of 500 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). After incubation, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of a 10 × lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), 5 mM benzamidine (Sigma), 10 mM EDTA (Sigma), 0.1% SDS (Bio-Rad), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), 1 μM okadaic acid (Sigma), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). The cell lysates were adjusted to 10 ml by adding 9 ml of PBS and precleared with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°C. Subsequently, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were captured using both monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (2 μg; Life Technologies, Inc./BRL) and protein A-agarose beads (10 μl) during a 4-h period of end-over-end rotating at 4°C. The protein A-bead-bound phosphorylated proteins were then processed for reducing SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and densitometry as described previously (21Chang N.-S. Leu R.W. Rummage J.A. Anderson J.K. Mole J.E. Blood. 1992; 79: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the TGF-β1-induced extracellular TRT proteins that blocked TNF cytotoxic function, culture supernatants from TGF-β1-treated and control adherent L929S monolayers were harvested after 16 h in culture. Additionally, culture supernatants were harvested from nonadherent L929S cells (3 × 105/ml) growing under rolling conditions in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for 16 h. Ninety six-well microtiter plates were precoated with 100-μl aliquots of the serially diluted culture supernatants for 3 h at 37°C, followed by washing each well 6 times with PBS. In controls, microtiter plates were coated with serially diluted serum, fibronectin, or its RDG-containing fragment of 120 kDa (22Beezhold D.H. Personius C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 51: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (1-10 μg/well; kind gifts of Dr. D. Beezhold, Guthrie Research Institute). Untreated control L929S cells (2.5 × 105/ml) were then seeded onto the wells for 12-16 h prior to determining their susceptibility to the cytotoxic action of TNF-α/Act D. Where indicated, the culture supernatants were treated with heat (60°C, 30 min), alkaline (0.5 M NaOH, 7 h), or acid (0.5 M HCl, 7 h) prior to coating, or treated with trypsin (250 μg/ml), α2-macroglobulin (5 μg/well or 10 μg/ml; Sigma), heparin (300 μg/ml; Sigma), neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 IgG (1 μg/well or 2 μg/ml; Collaborative Research), anti-TGF-βs (β1, β2, and β3) IgG (0.5 μg/well or 1 μg/ml; Genzyme), or collagenase (50 units/ml; Sigma) for various durations during coating onto microtiter plates. These treatments were intended to inhibit TRT and to block any residual TGF-βs from exogenous or cellular sources. α2-Macroglobulin is also known to complex with the latent form of TGF-β1(23O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Wakefield L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14090-14099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other experiments, L929S monolayers were pretreated with or without TGF-β1 (0.25-2.0 ng/ml) for 10-16 h and the cells were removed from each individual well by treating with 100 μl of trypsin/EDTA or 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature. After thoroughly washing the wells 6 times with PBS, untreated control L929S cells were then seeded onto these wells for 12-16 h, followed by examining their susceptibility to the cytotoxic effect of TNF-α/Act D. Similar experiments were performed using TGF-β2 and -β3. These experiments were to examine whether TGF-β1 induced the expression of extracellular proteins that bound TNF-α. Binding of TNF-α to 0.5% formaldehyde-fixed L929S cells pretreated with or without TGF-β1, or to the plastic adherent extracellular matrix proteins from TGF-β1-treated or control cells was performed by standard ELISA procedures (10Chang N.-S. Intrieri C. Mattison J. Armand G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using the Pierce ELISA kit (Pierce). The plastic adherent matrix proteins were prepared by removing L929S monolayers from each individual well with trypsin/EDTA or Nonidet P-40 as described above. TGF-β1-treated L929S cells acquired TNF-resistance in a time- and dose-related manner (Fig. 1A). For instance, L929S developed significant levels of TNF-resistance (>10%) after treatment with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 40 min and gained approximately 50% resistance in 3 h. L929S cells stably maintained the acquired TNF-resistance upon prolonging the treatment up to 48 h. In contrast, both TGF-β2 and -β3 rapidly increased TNF-resistance in L929S cells reaching approximately 40% of resistance in 40 min (Fig. 1, B and C). The intrinsic TNF-resistance of L929R cells was not altered by treatment with TGF-β1. L929S cells also developed increasing resistance to TNF-β when pretreated with TGF-β1 for 1-20 h at 37°C (data not shown). In agreement with other reports(1Sugarman B.J. Lewis G.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Shepard H.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 47: 780-786Google Scholar, 4Kamijo R. Takeda K. Nagumo M. Konno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 158: 155-162Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), TGF-β1 did not significantly enhance proliferation of L929S cells (approximately 10% increase) during 24-48 h treatment. Similar results were observed for TGF-β2 and -β3 regarding the cell proliferation. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that TGF-β1 increased the levels of cellular tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in L929S cells during the initial 0.5-1 h treatment, followed by decreases with time (Fig. 2A). In contrast, protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in L929R cells was reduced after treating the cells with TGF-β1 for 0.5-2 h at 37°C (Fig. 2A). Similarly, by treating L929S cells with TGF-β2 or -β3 for 30 min, an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation by approximately 30-50% was also observed. Both TGF-β2 and -β3 decreased the phosphorylation in L929R cells by approximately 15-25% in 0.5-1 h. As determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, both lavendustin A and tyrphostin (10 μM) blocked the TGF-β1-increased phosphorylation by 60 and 56%, respectively (Fig. 2B). In addition, both inhibitors concurrently restricted phosphorylation of 9 specific protein species, which were p36, p38, p44, p63, p105, p119, p138, p174, and p260 (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of L929S with both TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as tyrphostin, lavendustin A, BABA, and genistein at 10 μM for 6 h, resulted in reduced TNF-resistance in these cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained by increasing the concentrations of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors up to a non-cytotoxic concentration of 30 μM, or by treating L929S cells with both TGF-β1 and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors for 1-5 h (data not shown). However, when L929S cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 for 1 h followed by coincubation with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors for 6 h, the acquired TNF-resistance was not abolished (Fig. 3B). In contrast, staurosporine (10 μM), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, failed to block the acquired TNF-resistance (Fig. 3A). Similarly, no significant effect in blocking TGF-β1 function was observed when staurosporine was tested at lower concentrations (1 nM to 1 μM) (data not shown). At concentrations greater than 10 μM, staurosporine was cytotoxic to both L929S and L929R cells. Under similar experimental conditions, TGF-β2 or -β3-mediated TNF-resistance was blocked (approximately 50%) by tyrphostin and lavendustin A (10 μM), but not by staurosporine. The intrinsic TNF-resistance of L929R cells was not altered by TGF-β1 and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (data not shown). In the following studies, evidence is presented that TGF-β1 induced secretion of TRT protein(s) to the extracellular matrix. As an inhibitor of protein secretion(18Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), brefeldin A inhibited the acquisition of TNF-resistance. By treating L929S cells with both TGF-β1 and brefeldin A for 6 h prior to challenge with TNF-α/Act D resulted in inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated protection of TNF cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). However, when L929S cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 4 h before exposure to brefeldin A for 2 h, the cells developed TNF-resistance (Fig. 4). TRT adhered to polystyrene-based plastic surface and triggered cellular resistance to TNF. For example, 96-well microtiter plates were precoated with secreted proteins from the culture supernatants of control or TGF-β1-treated L929S for 3 h at 37°C, followed by washing the wells thoroughly with PBS and seeding untreated control L929S cells for 14-20 h. These control cells became TNF-resistant when seeded onto the wells precoated with proteins secreted from TGF-β1-treated cells growing under rolling conditions, but not with proteins secreted by untreated control cells (Fig. 5). Similarly, by growing L929S cells in roller culture using both serum-free RPMI 1640 and HyQ-CCM2 media, the TGF-β1-treated and control cells failed to secrete TRT (Fig. 5). In additional controls, adherent L929S monolayers, whether or not pretreated with TGF-β1, produced no TRT proteins against TNF to the culture supernatants (data not shown). Both serially diluted serum proteins and native or degraded fibronectin (1-10 μg/well) when coated onto microtiter plates failed to protect L929S from TNF killing (data not shown). More than 95% of TGF-β1-treated L929S monolayers once detached from microtiter plates readily became TNF-sensitive. Cell removal from microtiter plates was achieved by using trypsin/EDTA, trypsin, or chilling the cells at 4°C for 30 min and repeat pipetting. However, by seeding untreated control L929S onto the wells where the TGF-β1-treated cells had once occupied, these control cells became TNF-resistant (Fig. 6). In this procedure, TGF-β1-treated or control L929S monolayers were removed from each individual well by treating with either 0.05% Nonidet P-40 or trypsin/EDTA, followed by thoroughly washing the wells with PBS six times to remove cellular debris and seeding control L929S overnight (14-20 h). The time required for the control L929S cells to develop significant levels of TNF-resistance (>10%) was at least 8 h post-seeding. When 0.01% SDS was included in Nonidet P-40 to remove TGF-β1-treated cells from the culture plates, the protective effects were decreased, indicating that the adhered TRT protein(s) was partially removed from the plates (Fig. 6). High salt conditions (at 5 M NaCl) failed to remove TRT from the microtiter plates. These results, again, provide direct evidence that TRT adhered to the plastic surface. A time course experiment showed that TRT was rapidly produced after treating L929S cells with TGF-β1 for approximately 20-30 min (Fig. 7A). In contrast, both TGF-β2 and -β3 failed to induce TRT secretion (Fig. 7, B and C). A prolonged treatment of L929S cells with TGF-β2 and -β3 for 4-16 h also failed to observe the TRT activity (less than 10%).Figure 7Time course induction of TRT by TGF-β1, but not by TGF-β2 and -β3. L929S cells in 96-well microtiter plates were pretreated with TGF-β1 (A), -β2 (B), or -β3 (C) for 10 min to 2 h, followed by removing the cells using trypsin/EDTA, washing the plates thoroughly with PBS, and seeding untreated control L929S cells overnight for TNF cytotoxicity assays (in 8 duplicates).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All the indicated protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors failed to block the induction of TRT expression by TGF-β1. When L929S monolayers were coincubated with both TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (10-30 μM) for 1-6 h, no significant decreases in TRT activity caused by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors were found (p > 0.05; Student's t test). When L929R cells were treated with or without TGF-β1 in roller culture, no TRT activity was found in the culture supernatants (data not shown). Similarly, by seeding control L929S cells onto the wells where TGF-β1-treated L929R cells had once resided, the L929S cells did not acquire TNF-resistance. To determine whether blocking of TNF function by TRT was due to binding interactions, I have examined the binding of TNF-α to extracellular matrix proteins by ELISA. Compared to controls, there were no significant increases (p > 0.05; Student's t test) in the binding of TNF-α to the plastic adherent extracellular matrix proteins from TGF-β1-treated L929S cells, or to the formaldehyde-fixed L929S cells pretreated with TGF-β1. TRT was shown to be relatively stable. As summarized in the Table 1, TRT resisted treatments with heat, mild trypsinization, collagenase, heparin, and α2-macroglobulin. However, using a prolonged treatment for 7 h with trypsin or with 0.5 N alkaline or acid, the TRT activity was totally destroyed.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Next, I examined whether residual TGF-β1 or cellularly secreted TGF-βs adhered to plastic wells that caused L929S resistance to TNF. L929S cells in roller culture were treated with or without TGF-β1 for 24 h, followed by harvesting the culture supernatants and precoating onto microtiter plates for 3 h. The adhered TRT and other proteins were then treated with neutralizing antibodies against TGF-β1. These antibodies failed to abolish the TRT activity (Fig. 8A). Similarly, the TRT activity was not blocked by another antibody, anti-TGF-βs (β1, β2, and β3) IgG. TRT proteins in the extracellular matrix were prepared by removing control or TGF-β1-treated L929 monolayers with trypsin/EDTA (Fig. 8B). These antibodies also failed to inhibit TRT activity obtained from roller culture (data not shown). Evidence was obtained that TRT triggered L929S resistant to TNF by increasing protein phosphorylation in these cells. For example, control L929S cells become TNF-resistant when seeded onto the TRT-containing wells of microtiter plates (Fig. 9A). Inhibitors of protein kinases, such as lavendustin A, BABA, and H7, blocked this induction of TNF-resistance (Fig. 9A). In controls (without TGF-β1 treatment), no TRT activity was found and the kinase inhibitors alone also failed to induce the production of TRT (Fig. 9A). Moreover, by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, L929S cells, when seeded onto TRT-containing Petri dishes for 3 h, had a 44.7% increase in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation which was significantly inhibited by lavendustin A (Fig. 9B). The increase in phosphorylation could go up to 100% after 16 h culturing of L929S cells on the TRT-containing matrix. In this study we have examined the mechanisms by which TGF-β1 induces TNF-resistance in L929S cells. Our results demonstrate that both an early TGF-β1-mediated activation of tyrosine kinases and a simultaneous secretion of extracellular matrix TRT protein(s) contribute to the development of TNF-resistance. Both events occur before the development of TNF-resistance. The increased phosphorylation levels appear to alter the TNF killing pathway. TRT is a putative adhesion molecule and shown to provide an additional stimulus allowing the cells to sustain the increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and the status of TNF-resistance. Protein kinase C was not involved in TGF-β1-induction of TNF-resistance, as evidenced by the failure of staurosporine in restricting the induced resistance in L929S cells. In addition to TGF-β1, it is determined that both TGF-β2 and -β3 stimulate TNF-resistance in L929S cells. Time course studies revealed that TGF-β2 and -β3 could rapidly induce TNF-resistance faster than that of TGF-β1. However, TGF-β1 exerts a greater extent of protection against TNF-α than TGF-β2 and -β3 (60-70 versus 40-50%). Most interestingly, L929S cells secreted little or no TRT by stimulating with either TGF-β2 or -β3. These observations suggest that the reduced efficiency for TGF-β2 and -β3 to protect L929S cells against TNF-mediated cytotoxicity is probably due to their inability to stimulate TRT secretion. Accordingly, the degree of TNF-resistance is contributed, in part, by both the increased tyrosine phosphorylation and the stimulatory effect of TRT. Unlike TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and -β3 fail to induce TRT secretion, suggesting an undefined difference in the signal transduction pathways among these molecules. TGF-β signals through a heteromeric complex between the type I and type II receptors(24Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzen P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are known to possess intrinsic serine/threonine kinase functions(25Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 26Ebner R. Chen R.-H. Shum L. Lawler S. Zioncheck T.F. Lee A. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Although both the type I and type II receptors have a higher binding affinity for TGF-β1 and -β3 than for TGF-β2(27Massague J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), such differences in the binding probably could not account for the failure of TGF-β2 and -β3 to induce TRT secretion. The type I receptors have been shown to specify growth inhibitory and transcriptional responses to TGF-β and activin in Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells(28Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, TGF-β1 activates two different signal transduction pathways in epithelial cells(29Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mediates different signals for growth inhibition and extracellular matrix protein in prostatic carcinoma cells(30Franzen P. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the generation of diverse signal pathways may be related with the kinetic formation of heteromeric receptor complex (24Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzen P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of cellular protein-tyrosine kinases in L929S cells probably occurs downstream from the activation of TGF-β receptor kinases. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that tyrosine kinase inhibitors restricted TGF-β-mediated induction of TNF-resistance in L929S cells. However, which specific protein-tyrosine kinase activates immediately subsequent to the receptor kinases remains to be established. Both lavendustin A and tyrphostin were shown to suppress phosphorylation of 9 identical protein species and block the induced TNF-resistance, indicating that phosphorylation of these proteins is critical in altering the TNF killing pathway. These observations appear to correspond to the finding that both the intrinsic kinase function and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor correlates with an alteration of TNF cytotoxic signal transduction and control of TNF responsiveness in ME-180 squamous carcinoma cells(31Donato N.J. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419PubMed Google Scholar). However, the above postulation may not necessarily be true for other types of cells. For instance, TGF-β1 could not alter the intrinsic TNF-resistance in L929R cells, and, most interestingly, there was a reduced tyrosine kinase activity in TNF-resistant L929R cells upon treatment with TGF-βs. Perhaps, TGF-βs up-regulated tyrosine phosphatase activity in L929R. Another possibility is that there is a functional defect in the tyrosine kinase activation cascade in L929R cells, and this defect may be directly or indirectly associated with the intrinsic TNF-resistance in this cell mutant. Both the TGF-β1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and the secretion of TRT are independent events, simply because protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors failed to block the secretion of TRT. Time course studies revealed that the occurrence of both events preceded the acquisition of TNF-resistance. The expression of TRT requires a unknown serum factor(s) along with TGF-β1 in the stimulation of L929S cells. In contrast, under serum-free conditions L929S monolayers still acquire TNF-resistance upon treatment with TGF-β1. Thus, in addition to TRT, TGF-β1 must have induced novel intracellular proteins which also interrupt the TNF killing pathway under either serum-free or the present conditions. Indeed, by expression cloning I have isolated a novel cDNA, designated TR1, whose expression is rapidly induced by stimulating L929S cells with TGF-β1 for less than 1 h, and transfection of L929S cells with TR1 cDNA renders the cells TNF-resistant. 2N-S. Chang, manuscript in preparation. Unlike the rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by TGF-β1, TRT slowly increased the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (40% increases in 3 h) and its induction of TNF-resistance in L929S cells requires at least 8 h. Thus, the function of TRT is mainly to provide an additional signal to sustain the high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and the extent of TNF-resistance. Since the TRT-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a relatively long-term process, it indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation is most likely a secondary or a later event following TRT-mediated signal transduction. The ability of H-7 to block the TRT-mediated TNF-resistance, suggests that TRT may signal through receptors with serine/threonine kinase activity(32Ohtsuki M. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 261-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the underlying pathway is that TGF-β1 initiates both a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in cellular protein substrates (which is essential to alter TNF cytotoxic pathway) and a simultaneous production of extracellular matrix TRT, which in turn signals the cells to continue to raise the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation necessary for sustaining the TNF-resistance. Although the characteristics of TRT requires further investigation, TRT is a protein and relatively stable as its resistance to treatments with heat, collagenase, limited trypsinization, heparin, and α2-macroglobulin have shown. Preliminary characterization of TRT by preparative isoelectric focusing revealed that TRT complexes with high-molecular weight extracellular matrix proteins. Precipitation by ammonium sulfate and functional analysis showed that TRT appears to be a 46-kDa protein, which possesses a unique N-terminal amino acid sequence, not related to the latent form of TGF-βs, as determined by gas-phase microsequencing.2 TGF-β1-mediated protection from TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells is not related to changes in the receptor numbers or binding affinity(1Sugarman B.J. Lewis G.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Shepard H.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 47: 780-786Google Scholar, 4Kamijo R. Takeda K. Nagumo M. Konno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 158: 155-162Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our experimental results from cellular ELISA have further verified these observations. Similarly, in myeloid cell lines, it is determined that there is no correlation between TNF receptor number or receptor affinity and the cellular sensitivity to TNF(33Munker R. DiPersio J. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1987; 70: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, no apparent novel extracellular matrix proteins induced by TGF-β1 were found to bind TNF-α as determined by functional testings and ELISA-based binding studies. These results have been further confirmed by separating and enriching extracellular protein species using preparative isoelectric focusing, followed by testing their TNF blocking activities and TNF-binding interactions using Western blotting analyses (data not shown). In summary, it is demonstrated in this study that TGF-β1-induced TNF-resistance in L929S cells is associated with a rapid activation of protein tyrosine kinases as well as secretion of an extracellular TRT protein(s). The increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels in specific protein substrates appear to contribute to the blockade of the TNF killing pathway. TRT, in turn, signals for a continued high level of tyrosine phosphorylation, thus prolonging the status of TNF-resistance. Further structural and molecular characterizations of TRT protein(s) will increase our understanding of TNF-resistance in tumor cells. I thank Dr. D. Beezhold for providing the L929 cell lines, Drs.

The final cell pellet was dissolved in 6.5 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, sonicated, and refolded by rapid dilution (100-fold) into 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.3 M urea, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM glutathione, and 0.1 mM oxidized glutathione at 4°C. Refolded HAR-TX β2 protein was diluted 2-fold with 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and applied to a cationexchange resin (POROS 50 HS; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated in the same buffer. HAR-TX β2 protein was eluted at 400-450 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and fractions were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Final purification of pooled fractions was performed by chromatography using Source 15S cation-exchange media (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0). HAR-TX β2 fusion protein was eluted with a gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CEM cells expressing various HER receptors (1 × 106 cells) were stimulated with indicated amounts of HAR-TX β2 for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM sodium ortho-vanadate) at 4°C. Insoluble material was pelleted for 30 s at 10,000 × g, and samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, ICN, Irvine, CA; and PY20, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) followed by 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG, F(ab′)2 fragment (DuPont NEN). For cytotoxicity assays, tumor cells (105 cells/ml) in growth medium were added to 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates (0.1 ml/well) and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Cells were incubated with HAR-TX β2 for 48 h at 37°C and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by addition of 200 μl/well of 1.5 μM calcein AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). The plates were incubated for 40 min at room temperature, and the fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence concentration analyzer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Mundelein, IL) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm. Calcein AM is membrane-permeable and virtually nonfluorescent. When it is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases, an intensely fluorescent product, calcein, is formed. The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as described previously(15Siegall C.B. Chace D. Mixan B. Garrigues U. Wan H. Paul L. Wolff E. Hellström I. Hellström K.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2377-2384PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive cytotoxicity assays were done by co-incubation of heregulin β2-Ig (0.002-5.0 μg/ml) with HAR-TX β2 (50 ng/ml) on LNCaP and MDA-MB-453 cells. Chimeric L6 (huIgG1) (16Fell H.P.

HER4, expressed in baculovirus, was used as the immunogen for subcutaneous injection into 4-6-week-old female BALB/c mice. Immunization was performed 4 times (approximately 1 month apart) with 20 μg of HER4 given each time. Spleen cells from immunized mice were removed 4 days after the final immunization and fused with the mouse myeloma line P2x63-Ag8.653 as described(15Siegall C.B. Chace D. Mixan B. Garrigues U. Wan H. Paul L. Wolff E. Hellström I. Hellström K.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2377-2384PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants of interest were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening on plates coated with HER4-transfected CHO cells (1Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) compared with parental CHO cells and human fibroblasts. Secondary screening was done by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on plates coated with baculovirus/HER4 membranes. Positive hybridomas were rescreened by two additional rounds of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using CHO/HER4 cells, and false positives were removed by testing on HER4-negative cells. Remaining hybridomas were cloned in soft agar and tested for reactivity with MDA-MB-453 human breast carcinoma cells (HER4-positive) and CEM cells co-transfected with HER4 and HER2. Hybridoma 6-4-11 (IgG1) was cloned in soft agar and found to produce monoclonal antibody reactive to both native and denatured HER4. A second antibody (7-142, IgG2a) was also selected and found to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of HER4. Both 6-4-11 and 7-142 were reactive with HER4 protein in Western blot analysis (data not shown). Cells were stained for cell surface expression of HER2, HER3, and HER4 protein. HER2 staining was done using mouse anti-HER2 mAb 24.7 (17Stancovski I. Hurwitz E. Leitner D. Ullrich A. Yarden Y. Sela M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8691-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) as described (18Bacus S.S. Gudkov A.V. Zelnick C.R. Chin D. Stern R. Stancovski I. Peles E. Ben-Baruch N. Farbstein H. Lupu R. Wen D. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5251-5261PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories) was used for detection. HER3 staining was done using mouse anti-HER3 mAb RTJ2 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) at 2.5 μg/ml concentration. Detection was performed using biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). HER4 staining was performed with mouse anti-HER4 mAb 6-4-11 at 15 μg/ml concentration and detected as described for HER3. The staining procedure was as follows. Cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 60 min at room temperature, washed with H2O, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6), and blocked with 10% goat serum (for HER2) or rabbit serum (for HER3 and HER4) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline for 15 min. Next, primary, secondary, and tertiary reagents were incubated for 30, 20, and 15 min, respectively, at room temperature and with Tris-buffered saline washing between steps. Final detection was achieved using Cellular Analysis Systems red chromagen (Becton Dickinson, Elmhurst, IL) for 4 (HER2), 8-10 (HER3), and 10-12 min (HER4) at room temperature. Counterstaining was performed with Cellular Analysis Systems DNA stain protocol (Becton Dickinson). Image analysis was performed as described previously(18Bacus S.S. Gudkov A.V. Zelnick C.R. Chin D.

Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In the quantitation of HER2, both solid state imaging channels of the Cellular Analysis Systems 200 image analyzer (Becton Dickinson), a microscope-based two-color system, were used. The two imaging channels were specifically matched to the two components of the stains used. One channel was used for quantitating the total DNA of the cells in the field following Feulgen staining as described (21Bacus S.S. Kiguchi K. Chin D. King C.R. Huberman E. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the other for quantitating the level of HER2, HER3, and HER4 proteins following immunostaining. When the total DNA amount/cell was known, the average total HER2, HER3, and HER4/cell was computed. Sparsely growing AU565 cells were used for calibrating the HER2 protein. Their level of staining was defined as 100% of HER2 protein content (1.0 relative amounts = 10,000 sum of optical density); all other measurements of HER2, HER3, and HER4 protein were related to this value. HAR-TX β2 (100 μg) was labeled with IODO-GEN (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and was purified through PD10 (Pharmacia) chromatography. The specific activity of the 125I-HAR-TX β2 was determined to be 6.6 μCi/μg. Adherent tumor cells were gently removed from flasks by incubation for 10 min at 37°C with 2 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Receptor binding reactions were performed at 4°C for 16 h with agitation using 1.67 × 105 cells/100-μl reaction volumes in the presence or absence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled HAR-TX β2. Cell-bound 125I-HAR-TX β2 was separated from unbound by centrifugation through a 50:50 mixture of dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate at 4°C, and the radioactivity present in both supernatant and cell pellet was determined using a γ-counter. The HAR-TX β2 expression plasmid, encoding the hydrophilic leader sequence from AR, heregulin β2, and PE40, under the control of the IPTG-inducible T7 promoter, was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 1A. The AR leader sequence was added to the N terminus of heregulin to facilitate purification as was previously demonstrated with ligand alone (1Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). HAR-TX β2 fusion protein contained in E. coli inclusion bodies was denatured and refolded as described under “Experimental Procedures” and applied to cation-exchange chroma-tography on a POROS HS column. The major protein band migrating at 51 kDa corresponded to HAR-TX β2 (Fig. 2, lane 2). The column flow-through from POROS HS contained only small amounts of HAR-TX β2 (Fig. 2, lane 3). POROS HS chromatography resulted in >50% purity of HAR-TX β2 (Fig. 2, lane 4). Further purification, to >95% purity, was achieved by chromatography using Source 15S cation-exchange resin (Fig. 2, lane 5). The monomeric nature of purified HAR-TX β2 was determined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, lane 6), which showed the same migration pattern as under reducing conditions (Fig. 2, lane 5). We next tested whether HAR-TX β2 induced receptor phosphorylation of HER4 as previously demonstrated for heregulin(2Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CEM cells expressing different HER family members were analyzed by phosphotyrosine immunoblots following exposure to HAR-TX β2. HAR-TX β2 (10 nM) induced tyrosine phosphorylation in CEM cells expressing HER4 either alone or together with HER2 but not in cells expressing only HER2 or HER1 (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that HER4 and not HER2 or HER1 is sufficient for tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor in response to HAR-TX β2. The fact that HAR-TX β2 does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation in CEM cells transfected with HER1 shows that the hydrophilic leader sequence from amphiregulin does not affect the specificity of the heregulin moiety in its selective interaction between receptor family members. HAR-TX β2-mediated phosphorylation of receptors in CEM cells co-expressing HER2 and HER4 was found to be both dose-dependent and saturable (Fig. 3, B and C). The cell-killing activity of HAR-TX β2 was determined against a variety of human cancer cell lines. AU565 and SKBR3 breast carcinomas and LNCaP prostate carcinoma were sensitive to HAR-TX β2 with EC50 values of 25, 20, and 4.5 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 4A), while SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells were insensitive to HAR-TX β2 (EC50 >2000 ng/ml). Addition of heregulin β2-Ig to LNCaP cells reduced the cytotoxic activity of HAR-TX β2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4B). In contrast, cL6, a chimeric mouse-human antibody with a nonrelated specificity but matching human Fc domains(16Fell H.P. Gayle M.A. Yelton D. Lipsich L. Schieven G.L. Marken J.S. Aruffo A. Hellström K.E. Hellström I. Bajorath J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15552-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) , did not inhibit the HAR-TX β2 cytotoxic activity. Thus, the cytotoxic effect of HAR-TX β2 was due to specific heregulin-mediated binding. Similar findings were observed using MDA-MB-453 cells (data not shown). The levels of cell surface expression of HER2, HER3, and HER4 were quantitated on tumor cell lines by image analysis (18Bacus S.S. Gudkov A.V. Zelnick C.R. Chin D. Stern R. Stancovski I. Peles E. Ben-Baruch N. Farbstein H. Lupu R. Wen D. Sela M. Yarden Y. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5251-5261PubMed Google Scholar) using mAbs specific for these receptors (Table 1). The data indicate that HER4 expression is required for heregulindirected cytotoxic activity. All seven of the tumor cell lines that expressed detectable levels of HER4 were found to be sensitive to HAR-TX β2-mediated killing with EC50 values ranging from 1 to 125 ng/ml. MCF-7 cells displayed the lowest detectable levels of HER4 and were found to be the least sensitive (EC50 = 125 ng/ml) of the cells that did respond. Four cell lines were found to be devoid of any detectable levels of HER4 on their surface, and each of these was completely resistant to the toxic effects of HAR-TX β2. Three of these lines, L2987, SKOV3, and H3396, display both HER2 and HER3 in the absence of HER4. Thus, the expression of HER3, even in the presence of HER2, was not sufficient to render tumor cells sensitive to HAR-TX β2. The relative binding affinity of HAR-TX β2 for three tumor cell lines was determined. Iodinated HAR-TX β2 specifically bound to MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells, both expressing cell surface HER2, HER3, and HER4. High and low affinity sites were present as determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding results for MCF-7 (KD1 = 125 pM, KD2 = 2.1 nM) and for MDA-MB-453 (KD1 = 88 pM, KD2 = 1.25 nM) (Fig. 5). H3396 cells, co-expressing cell surface HER2 and HER3 and insensitive to HAR-TX β2, also displayed high and low affinity sites (KD1 = 300 pM, KD2 = 3.3 nM). Thus, cells expressing HER2 and HER3, in the presence or absence of HER4, form both high and low affinity heregulin binding sites. This demonstrates that while HAR-TX β2 binding to tumor cells is essential for cytotoxicity, by itself it is not sufficient. Heregulin directly binds to both HER3 and HER2/HER3 in a heterodimer configuration(2Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HAR-TX β2 binds to H3396 cells that co-express HER2 and HER3. Despite binding, cells expressing HER2 and HER3 (L2987, H3396, and SKOV3) were insensitive to HAR-TX β2. Direct interaction via signaling of H3396 and L2987 cells with the fusion protein was determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblots following exposure to HAR-TX β2. HAR-TX β2 was found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation in both tumor cell types (Fig. 6) similarly to that previously seen in COS-7 cells transfected with HER2 and HER3(3Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SKOV3 cells were found to be constitutively phosphorylated in the presence or absence of heregulin (data not shown), and no further activation was observed. However, previous studies reported that heregulin does not bind to these cells(20Peles E. Bacus S.S. Koski R.A. Lu H.S. Wen D. Ogden S.G. Levy R.B. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 205-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Thus, despite direct binding (H3396) and phosphotyrosine signaling via HAR-TX β2 (H3396 and L2987), these cells are insensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the fusion protein. We have constructed and characterized a ligand-toxin fusion protein, HAR-TX β2, that kills a variety of carcinoma cells that express HER4. HAR-TX β2 was produced in E. coli by expressing a gene fusion encoding a chimeric form of heregulin β2 and a binding mutant form of PE. The fusion protein was isolated as insoluble material, denatured, refolded, and purified by cation-exchange chromatography. HAR-TX β2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation in CEM cells expressing either HER4 alone or co-expressing HER4 and HER2 but not in cells expressing either HER1 or HER2 alone (Fig. 3). These data confirm earlier findings that heregulin can induce tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing cell surface HER4 in the presence or absence of HER2 but not in cells expressing HER2 alone(1Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine activity of HAR-TX β2 was dose-dependent and saturable (Fig. 3, B and C) and reached 50% maximal phosphorylation at approximately 10 nM. This amount is comparable with that used in other reports describing the phosphotyrosine activity of heregulin(2Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A.

Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). HAR-TX β2 was effective at killing breast and prostate cancer cells (Fig. 4A). HAR-TX α, containing heregulin α, was also produced. It was found to bind >10-fold less well to MDA-MB-453 cells, and it was >10-fold less cytotoxic to tumor cells including MDA-MB-453, BT474, and SKBR3 cells (data not shown). Because of these results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the in vitro activities of HAR-TX β2. Measurements of HER2, HER3, and HER4 by image analysis have allowed us to gain a more accurate understanding of the expression levels of these receptors on the cell surface of tumor cell lines and to correlate their expression with sensitivity to the heregulin-based toxin fusion protein. The tumor cell lines that were sensitive to HAR-TX β2, including MDA-MB-453, LNCaP, and T47D, co-expressed HER2, HER3, and HER4 (Table 1). L2987, SKOV3, and H3396 cells, which co-express HER2 and HER3 but do not express HER4, were insensitive to the cell-killing activities of HAR-TX β2. Therefore, the expression of HER2 and HER3 is not sufficient for HAR-TX β2-mediated killing. It has been shown that heregulin can bind to either HER3 or HER4 in transfected cell lines (1Plowman G.D.

Radiolabeled HAR-TX β2 bound directly to MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, and H3396 breast carcinoma cells, demonstrating the presence of both high and low affinity sites with Kd values ranging from 88 pM to 3.3 nM (Fig. 5). The high affinity binding site identified on MCF-7 cells (125 pM) was similar to that previously reported for heregulin (105 pM)(5Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Adabi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In addition we also report the presence of a low affinity site on MCF-7 cells (2.1 nM). HAR-TX β2 can also induce tyrosine phosphorylation in H3396 cells and L2987 cells (Fig. 6), which co-express HER3 and HER2. Thus, in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells, which express HER2, HER3, and HER4, direct binding and cell killing are found following incubation with HAR-TX β2. In contrast, H3396 and L2987 cells, which co-express HER2 and HER3, are insensitive to HAR-TX β2 despite direct binding (H3396) and signaling (H3396 and L2987) via the fusion protein. The expression of HER4 correlates with sensitivity to HAR-TX β2. This may be due in part to the higher affinity of heregulin for HER4, thereby maximizing uptake of the toxin. Alternatively, HER4 may also be associated with distinct signals directing internalization and/or subcellular trafficking, such that PE40 reaches its target in the cytosol. In addition to the expression of HER4, this process may require HER2, HER3, and/or some other cellular components or HER family members whose identity is still unknown. Regardless, our results demonstrate that heregulin-based fusion proteins can be used to kill tumor cells that express HER4 and suggest that such proteins may prove useful for the in vivo targeting of HER4-positive tumors.

EGF, in contrast to NGF and FGF, cannot maintain the sustained phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase and MAP kinases, which may account for the difference in phenotypic response. The pretreatment of PC12 cells with staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, causes a substantial increase in both receptor and MAP kinase phosphorylation that results in a differentiative response (neurite proliferation). However, neurites begin to disappear after 3 days, despite the continual presence of EGF, and are largely gone after 5 days, which is not the case with NGF and FGF. Thus, the effect of staurosporine is not permanent. Northern and Western blots indicate that the staurosporine response mainly results from a substantial up-regulation in EGF receptor synthesis, thus providing a much stronger cell surface signal and supporting the view that quantitative rather than qualitative differences distinguish the EGF versus NGF/FGF signaling pathways in these cells.

These observations have raised the question of whether the two responses are induced by fundamentally unique mechanisms or whether quantitative differences, i.e. the level or duration of an essential activated component(s), are responsible(8Chao M.V.

Although the detailed mechanisms for the induction of differentiation in PC12 cells by either NGF or FGF has not yet been determined, recent findings have underscored the importance of a pathway controlled by p21ras that leads to the activation of a kinase cascade involving Raf, MAPK kinase, and MAPK(9Miyasaka T.

Booker G.W. Waterfield M.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) via a Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange protein (SOS or C3G). Of particular importance apparently is the sustained activation of MAPK kinase and MAPK and the transfer of the latter to the nucleus (17Traverse S. Gomez N. Patterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). EGF, which can also activate MAPK kinase and MAPK, cannot maintain the necessary level of phosphorylation nor induce nuclear translocation, and it has been suggested that this may result from the rapid internalization of occupied EGFR because of the phosphorylation of Ser-1046/Ser-1047 (by an as yet unidentified kinase)(19Theroux S.J. Stanley K. Campbell D.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1849-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This would suggest that EGF, which prematurely attenuates its own signal, induces the necessary responses to produce differentiation, but because of the rapid loss of cell surface receptors following ligand binding and the concomitant loss in the transmembrane signal, it cannot do so. In this report, we show that staurosporine, a broad inhibitor of protein kinases, can convert EGF to a differentiative factor for PC12 cells by causing a marked up-regulation of EGFR synthesis as well as by directly affecting receptor phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, thus establishing that the endogenous rat EGFR has the requisite specificity to stimulate both mitotic and differentiative responses in PC12 cells. Mouse EGF was prepared by the method of Savage and Cohen (20Savage Jr., C.R. Cohen S. J. Biol.

Gill (University of California, San Diego). Anti-phosphotyrosine antiserum was obtained from Zymed Labs. Anti-ERK-1 antiserum and Protein-A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. 125I-Labeled protein A was purchased from ICN. Staurosporine was from Calbiochem. Molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad and Life Technologies, Inc. Immobilon P membranes were from Millipore. PC12 cells were obtained from E. Shooter (Stanford University) and maintained in culture in 150-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 1% Pen-strep solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. PC12 cells were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates in complete medium at a density of 0.2 × 105 cells/well. After 12-16 h, the medium was changed, and the cells were cultured in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) and/or various concentrations of staurosporine. The medium was replaced every other day. Cells were examined for the presence of neurites at various times. Responsive cells were defined as those bearing neurites at least 1 cell diameter in length. For whole cell lysates, cells were plated in complete medium on either 100- or 150-mm2 collagen-coated culture dishes and grown to 60-70% confluency. The medium was replaced 16 h before the experiments, and 10 nM staurosporine was added at the same time or for different lengths of time as specified. At the end of this period, cells were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for the specified time, then rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice(23Raffioni S. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9121-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford colorimetric assay from Bio-Rad. For immunoprecipitations, lysates (2 mg) were incubated with monoclonal anti-rat EGFR antibody for 2 h at 4°C, and immunoprecipitates were collected using protein A/G-agarose for an additional 2 h. After being washed, the complexes were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes by electroblotting at 63 V overnight. The membranes were probed with antibodies as specified and then incubated with 125I-labeled protein A. A ∼750-base pair DNA fragment was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA from PC12 cells and oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acids 33-272 of the extracellular domain of rat EGFR(24Petch L.A.

The amplified fragment was subcloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) using the restriction sites BamHI and SphI. The linearized plasmid was used as a template to generate an antisense RNA and was used for hybridization with blots at 65°C in a hybridization solution containing 5 × SSPE, 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After 20 h, blots were washed at 67°C in 0.2 × SSPE containing 0.5% SDS. Subsequently, blots were stripped and reprobed at 42°C with a 0.74-kilobase BamHI DNA fragment of CHOb (25Harpold M.M. Evans R.M. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1979; 17: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) used to normalize RNA loading differences. Staurosporine was initially described as a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (26Morioka H. Ishihara M. Shibai H. Suzuki T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 1959-1963Google Scholar, 27Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to be a highly specific inhibitor of the NGF receptor (as well as other neurotrophin receptors) tyrosine kinase (28Berg M.M.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar) but not other receptor tyrosine kinases, including those for FGF, which can also induce the differentiative response in PC12 cells(31Hashimoto S. Hagino A. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Staurosporine has also been shown to have some neurite proliferative effects in PC12 cells at high concentrations(32Hashimoto S. Hagino A. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Tischler A.S. Ruzicka L.A. Perlman R.L. J.

As shown in Fig. 1, at a concentration of 5 × 10−8M, it does show some differentiative activity in this system. However, the presence of EGF, which alone has no neurite proliferative capabilities, greatly enhances this response. Interestingly, the increase in the EGF response is most pronounced during the first 3 days of treatment and begins to decline thereafter (Fig. 2). The response to staurosporine alone is relatively constant over this time period, suggesting that the principal effect is an augmentation of the EGF signal rather than that induced by staurosporine. The magnitude of the response (particularly during days 1-3) is comparable with that induced by NGF and FGF. However, these factors do not show a diminution of response at later time points(6Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3639-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unless the factor is removed.Figure 2The induction of neurite outgrowth by the combined action of EGF and staurosporine in PC12 cells. Cells were cultured in complete medium in the presence of medium alone (CON) or with EGF (10 ng/ml) (EGF), 10 nM staurosporine (ST), or EGF (10 ng/ml) plus 10 nM staurosporine (EGF + ST).

Bar, 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In view of previous reports suggesting that EGF induced a rapid decrease in its own cell surface receptors(19Theroux S.J. Stanley K. Campbell D.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1849-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we examined the levels of EGFR phosphorylation as a function of time in cells stimulated with EGF in the presence and absence of staurosporine. As shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. 4, A and C, cells pretreated with staurosporine for 16 h clearly show more extensive phosphorylation of the EGFR (when exposed to EGF), as detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and 125I-protein A, than cells treated with EGF alone. The identification of the 170-kDa band as EGFR was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the blots with anti-EGFR antibody (Fig. 4, B and D). The blots in Fig. 3 also revealed an increased level of phosphorylated proteins in the molecular weight range expected for the two isoforms of MAPK (pp42 and pp44), which is known to correspond to an increased activity of these enzymes(11Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D.

This was confirmed by stripping the blot and reprobing with antibodies specific for these entities. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3, the levels of phosphorylated MAPK1 and −2 (indicated by the shift in mobility in the lanes corresponding to 2 and 10 min (left side) and 2, 10, 30, and 60 min (right side)) are indeed prolonged in the cells pretreated with staurosporine and induced by EGF (both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms are clearly visible in the later time points of the staurosporine plus EGF samples). This latter profile is virtually identical to that seen for NGF and basic FGF in PC12 cells, under conditions that produce full neurite outgrowth(37Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It is important to point out that, at the concentration used, staurosporine by itself had no effect on the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells and on the activity of MAPK1 and MAPK2, as shown in Fig. 3B.Figure 4Time course of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (A, C, and E) and level of EGF receptor (B, D, and F) in PC12 cells in the absence and presence of staurosporine. After preincubation without (A, B) or with (C, D) 10 nM staurosporine for 16 h, PC12 were left untreated (lanes 0) or treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for 2, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min at 37°C as indicated. A and C, 100 μg of protein from each whole cell lysate was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the antiphosphotyrosine antiserum. B and D, the anti-phosphotyrosine blots were stripped and reprobed with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody C13. E and F, after preincubation without or with staurosporine for 16 h, PC12 cells were left untreated or treated with EGF for 30 min, as indicated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-rat EGFR antibody. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (E) and, after stripping, reprobed with a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody generated against a peptide corresponding to the submembrane domain of the human EGFR (F). The phosphorylation of p170, corresponding to the EGFR, is indicated by arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the increased phosphorylation of the 170-kDa species corresponds to the EGFR, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, after immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody Western blotting, cells treated with EGF (pretreated with staurosporine) for 30 min show a more heavily phosphorylated EGFR than cells treated with EGF alone. After stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-EGFR antibody, it is evident that more EGFR can be immunoprecipitated in the cells treated with either both agents or staurosporine alone (Fig. 4F). Despite the higher level of EGFR present in PC12 cells following their pretreatment with staurosporine for 16 h, no tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor was observed until EGF was added to the culture medium. It appears that the up-regulation of the level of EGFR in cells pretreated with staurosporine is evident, even if in a more qualitative manner, in the anti-EGFR Western blot of total cell extracts of PC12 cells when comparing the first three left lanes of Fig. 4D (cells treated with staurosporine for 16 h) to the corresponding lanes of Fig. 4B (untreated cells). As the up-regulation of EGFR by the prolonged treatment with staurosporine cannot rule out a possible direct effect of staurosporine on the phosphorylation of EGFR, experiments were performed to address this issue. Upon simultaneous addition of EGF and staurosporine, a modestly increased phosphorylation of EGFR and MAPKs was observed when compared with the addition of EGF alone up to 30 min (Fig. 5). This transient stimulatory effect of staurosporine on EGF-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation is likely due to a direct inhibition of phosphorylation of EGFR at Ser-1046/Ser-1047 (19Theroux S.J. Stanley K. Campbell D.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1849-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or on other phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events that regulate EGFR activity. Thus, they may make some contribution to the induced EGF responsiveness. The clear demonstration that PC12 cells treated with staurosporine show a sustained response to EGF, including a prolonged level of phosphorylated receptor at the plasma membrane, suggests an altered rate of synthesis or degradation (down-regulation). To test whether staurosporine effected the expression of EGFR, PC12 cells were treated for 2, 4, 8, and 16 h with 10 nM drug and 20 μg of total RNA isolated from each. Following separation on 1% agarose, blots were probed at 65°C with a riboprobe corresponding to the extracellular domain of PC12 EGFR. As shown in Fig. 6, staurosporine is a potent inducer of EGFR gene expression in these cells. The effect appears to peak at 8 h but remains high at 16 h. Translation of this increased level of mRNA would presumably increase the number of plasma membrane EGFR, similar to cells transfected with an exogenous EGFR gene (18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and account for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation signals induced by the added EGF (Figure 3, Figure 4). It is unclear whether the mechanism by which staurosporine effects the level of EGFR gene transcription is related to kinase inhibition or to some other as yet undefined activity. However, similar observations have been made with human tumor necrosis factor receptors on myeloid and epithelial cells (38Zhang L. Higuchi M. Totpal K. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10270-10279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the phenomenon may be a more general one. These findings clearly establish that the endogenous EGFR of PC12 cells is capable of inducing neurite outgrowth, effectively eliminating the possibility that it fails to do so in wild type PC12 cells because of some abnormality in function. These results further suggest that any substantial increase in plasma membrane levels of EGFR will allow for EGF-induced differentiation in these cells, in this case provided by staurosporine-induced increases in expression or inhibition of down-regulation. In contrast to the situation expected for stably transfected cells(18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the sustained expression of EGFR is eventually overcome, i.e. the up-regulation by staurosporine is not permanent, and neurite outgrowth begins to wane by day 5. This provides further proof that the effect observed is related to the number of EGFR and not to any changes in the specificity of its receptor kinase. It also suggests that the magnitude of the signal induced and the length of time that threshold levels of phosphorylation can be maintained are directly related to the number of cell surface receptors. There is greater than an order of magnitude more EGFR than TrkA or FGF receptor on native PC12 cells 2R. A. Bradshaw and K. Seedorf, unpublished observations. (although the relative amounts of each receptor type can vary, particularly in different PC12 cell subspecies), which might suggest that the EGFR tyrosine kinase has a lower specificity for substrates of the Ras pathway. Its response is essentially identical to that of the NGF receptor (TrkA) in the first 3 min(17Traverse S. Gomez N. Patterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), which may represent the maximal magnitude of this response, and more EGFR may be required to achieve this. However, in view of the rapid decay of the signal, it is equally likely that there is no significant difference in substrate selectivity or affinity of the EGFR for activating Ras, thus suggesting that inherently EGF is potentially as good a neurotrophic factor as NGF and FGF. It is interesting in this regard that it has been reported to affect selected neurons in the central nervous system(39Fallon J.H. Seroogy K.B. Loughlin S.E. Morrison R.S. Bradshaw R.A. Knauer D.J. Cunningham D.D. Science. 1984; 224: 1107-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 40Morrison R.S. Kornblum H.I. Leslie F.M. Bradshaw R.A. Science. 1987; 238: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), although it is not reported to act on neuronal targets in the peripheral nervous system. The importance of the duration of the MAPK signal in PC12 cells may be related to both locational and temporal aspects of the response. Clearly, the prolonged response induced by NGF and basic FGF causes not only the activation of MAPK but also its translocation to the nucleus (17Traverse S. Gomez N. Patterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). This may be fundamental to the initiation of the neurotrophic response. It is instructional to recall that the initial response of PC12 cells to all of these factors is a mitotic one(41Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 745-755Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), i.e. there is apparently a protein(s) that must be induced before the neurotrophic response can be manifested. This clearly requires new protein synthesis, suggesting that the signal induced by a potential neurotrophic factor must sustain the MAPK signal long enough to produce an initial round of transcription (expression of the set of immediate early response genes and their products(42Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar)). Cells that have been primed, i.e. exposed previously to NGF(5Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-415Crossref Google Scholar), or variants that can respond essentially immediately to growth factor (43Sano M. Katoh-Semba R. Kitajima S. Sato C. Brain Res. 1990; 510: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 44Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) do not have this temporal restriction, presumably because they have previously synthesized the required regulatory protein(s). Although this putative entity has yet to be described, its behavior is consistent with that expected for a mitotic suppressor(45Stanbridge E.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 615-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It might also be noted that the transcriptional regulation controlled by MAPK is sufficiently extensive that it leads to a clearly defined phenotype following 2-6 h of stimulation by NGF or FGF that is apparently the signature of the differentiated cell and is lacking following EGF treatment(35Hondermarck H.

https://openalex.org/W2078751804,"E-selectin is a member of the selectin family of proteins that recognize carbohydrate ligands in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In order to better understand the role of Ca2+ in E-selectin-ligand interactions, we examined the E-selectin structure by limited proteolysis. Apo-Lec-EGF-CR6, a Ca2+-free form of soluble E-selectin containing the entire extracellular domain, was sensitive to limited proteolysis by Glu-C endoproteinase. Amino-terminal sequencing analysis of the proteolytic fragments revealed that the major cleavage site is at Glu98 which is in the loop (residues 94-103) adjacent to the Ca2+ binding region of the lectin domain. Upon Ca2+ binding, Lec-EGF-CR6 was protected from proteolysis. This Ca2+-dependent protection was further augmented upon sialyl Lewis × (sLex) ligand binding. These results implied that Ca2+ binding to E-selectin induces a conformational change and perhaps facilitates ligand binding. The sLex-bound complex in turn stabilizes Ca2+ binding. Lec-EGF-CR6 contains only one high-affinity Ca2+ site (Kd = ≈3.5 μM) as determined by equilibrium dialysis. In addition, we found that Ba2+ was a potent antagonist in blocking Lec-EGF-CR6-mediated HL-60 cell adhesion. By competitive equilibrium dialysis and proteolysis analysis, we demonstrated that Ba2+ bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 5-fold tighter than Ca2+ and abolished ligand binding activity. Sr2+ also bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 tighter than Ca2+. However, Sr2+-regenerated Lec-EGF-CR6 showed 50% ligand binding activity. Mg2+ bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 with much weaker affinity than Ca2+ and did not show any activity. Thus, E-selectin function can be modulated by different metal ions. E-selectin is a member of the selectin family of proteins that recognize carbohydrate ligands in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In order to better understand the role of Ca2+ in E-selectin-ligand interactions, we examined the E-selectin structure by limited proteolysis. Apo-Lec-EGF-CR6, a Ca2+-free form of soluble E-selectin containing the entire extracellular domain, was sensitive to limited proteolysis by Glu-C endoproteinase. Amino-terminal sequencing analysis of the proteolytic fragments revealed that the major cleavage site is at Glu98 which is in the loop (residues 94-103) adjacent to the Ca2+ binding region of the lectin domain. Upon Ca2+ binding, Lec-EGF-CR6 was protected from proteolysis. This Ca2+-dependent protection was further augmented upon sialyl Lewis × (sLex) ligand binding. These results implied that Ca2+ binding to E-selectin induces a conformational change and perhaps facilitates ligand binding. The sLex-bound complex in turn stabilizes Ca2+ binding. Lec-EGF-CR6 contains only one high-affinity Ca2+ site (Kd = ≈3.5 μM) as determined by equilibrium dialysis. In addition, we found that Ba2+ was a potent antagonist in blocking Lec-EGF-CR6-mediated HL-60 cell adhesion. By competitive equilibrium dialysis and proteolysis analysis, we demonstrated that Ba2+ bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 5-fold tighter than Ca2+ and abolished ligand binding activity. Sr2+ also bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 tighter than Ca2+. However, Sr2+-regenerated Lec-EGF-CR6 showed 50% ligand binding activity. Mg2+ bound to apo-Lec-EGF-CR6 with much weaker affinity than Ca2+ and did not show any activity. Thus, E-selectin function can be modulated by different metal ions."

Immunoblotting studies on proteolytic fragments of Gtα were consistent with an amino-terminal epitope. To define the antibody recognition site, recombinant Gtα was synthesized in Escherichia coli cotransfected with or without yeast N-myristoyltransferase. Amino-terminal fatty acylation of Gtα, verified by use of radiolabeled fatty acid, was required for immunoreactivity. LAS-2 did not react with a chimeric protein consisting of residues 1-9 of Gtα and the remainder Goα, regardless of its myristoylation. Immunoreactivity was observed when amino acids 1-17 of Gtα were present in a Goα chimera and the protein was amino-terminally myristoylated; there was no reactivity without myristoylation. It appears that the LAS-2 epitope requires both Gtα-specific sequence in amino acids 10-17 and a fatty acyl group in proximity to these residues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the myristoyl group is essential for protein structure; conceivably it “folds back” on and stabilizes the amino-terminal structure of Gtα, as opposed to protruding from an amino-terminal α-helix and serving as an amino-terminal membrane anchor.

The amino-terminal domain of Gα is important for interaction with Gβ. Removal of 21 amino acids from the amino terminus of the α subunit of transducin (Gtα), using Staphylococcal V8 protease, inhibited βγ-dependent reactions including GTP hydrolysis, GTP/GDP exchange, and binding of Gtα to rhodopsin(2Navon S.E.

Based on these data, it has been postulated that the myristoyl moiety may be involved in stabilizing the structure of the amino terminus. We describe here an anti-Gtα monoclonal antibody, LAS-2, whose epitope involves the Gtβγ-binding domain of Gtα and requires amino-terminal fatty acylation as well as specific Gtα amino-terminal sequence.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were done in a NOVEX Minicell apparatus or Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Transducin was purified from bovine rod outer segments(18Kühn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Blue-Sepharose chromatography was used to separate the Gtα and Gtβγ subunits.(19Shinozawa T. Uchida S. Martin E. Cafiso D.

Intact proteins or proteolytic fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE(25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar); transfer to nitrocellulose was performed in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine buffer with 20% methanol (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blots were processed as described(27Halpern J.L. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Kanaho Y. Bekesi E. Kung H. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 515-519PubMed Google Scholar). Gtα (1 μg) and Gtβγ (1 μg) were incubated in the presence of LAS-1, LAS-2, or control mouse IgG at 4°C for 1 h before pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, which was carried out at 30°C for 30 min in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 μM [32P]NAD (2 μCi/assay), 1 mM ATP with 2 μg of activated pertussis toxin in total volume of 100 μl. Pertussis toxin was activated for 10 min with dithiothreitol immediately before use(6Watkins P.A. Burns D.L. Kanaho Y. Liu T.-Y. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13478-13482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid and subjected to electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography with Kodak XAR film and an intensifying screen at −70°C for 30 min. Bovine retinal Gtα1 cDNA was used as template for PCR amplification of the rGtα coding region. The sense primer was 5′-ACGACGACGCATATGGGGGCTGGGGCCAGCGCTGAGGAGA-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GCGCCACGGTGATCATCAGAAGAGCCCGCAGTCTTT-3′. Goα cDNA from bovine brain was used as template for PCR preparation of coding regions for rGoα the Gtα17-Goα chimera, which contains Gtα1 sequence in amino acids 1-17 and the remainder Goα, an initial PCR was carried out using 5′-ACGACGACGCATATGGGGGCTGGGGCCAGCGCTGAGGAGAAGCACTCAAGGGAGCTGGAGAAAAACCTCAAAGAG-3′ as the sense primer and the Goα antisense primer used in other reactions. The product of this PCR was used as template for a second round of PCR amplification using the same 5′ primer as in the Gtα amplification and the 3′ primer used for Goα amplifications. PCR products were purified with a PCR purification spin kit (Qiagen), digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and BclI, and gel-purified. The NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end and BclI site at the 3′ end allowed directional cloning. The gel-purified, restriction-digested PCR products were inserted into a modified pGEM vector, pT7/Nde, under control of a T7 promoter(28Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competent DH5α Escherichia coli were transfected and screened on LB/ampicillin plates. The presence of insert in the positive clones was verified by PCR. An appropriate colony was selected and used for plasmid isolation and transfection into BL21(DE3) E. coli (Novagen) or competent BL21(DE3) E. coli that had previously been tranfected with the pACYC177/ET3d/yNMT vector(29Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7064-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the yeast N-myristoyltransferase coding region under control of a T7 promoter and a kanamycin resistance gene for coselection. Small scale preparations were done by diluting fresh overnight cultures 1:10 and growing at 37°C in the presence of appropriate antibiotics for 1 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 0.2 mM) and [3H]myristic acid (final concentration of 5 μM with a specific activity of 50 Ci/mmol) were added. Growth was continued an additional 3 h before cells were pelleted and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Presence of incorporated fatty acid was verified by exposure of the gel to Kodak XAR film at −70°C after treatment with Pro-Mote (Integrated Separation Systems). Hybridomas LAS-1 and LAS-2 and were grown in serum-free medium (Ultradoma supplemented with glutamine) or RPMI 1640 with glutamine and 5 or 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker). Go polyclonal antibodies (pcGo) were prepared as previously reported(30Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Kanaho Y. Halpern J.L. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4728-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Murine monoclonal antibodies against purified bovine Gtα were screened for functional effects on Gtα and Gtβγ interaction. One clone, LAS-2, inhibited Gtβγ-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gtα in a concentration-dependent manner; control immunoglobulin of the same isotype (IgG2) and LAS-1 did not inhibit the reaction (Fig. 1). To define the LAS-1 and −2 epitopes better, Gtα was cleaved with endoprotease Arg-C(23Shenkein I. Levy M. Franklin E.C. Frangione B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), hydroxylamine at alkaline pH (24Borstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), or trypsin(22Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. Science. 1984; 226: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); the fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted with antibodies LAS-2 and AS/7. Endoprotease Arg-C digestion generated LAS-2-reactive fragments of 34, 23, and 15 kDa, all of which were refractory to microsequencing, consistent with the presence of a blocked amino terminus (Fig. 2A). Hydroxylamine at alkaline pH cleaves primarily at Asn-Gly bonds(24Borstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); cleavage of Gtα (Asn291-Gly292) produced 32-kDa amino-terminal and 7-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragments. Both LAS-1 and −2 reacted with the 32-kDa piece, whereas AS/7 did not, confirming that the LAS-reactive fragment lacked the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2B, data not shown). Tryptic digestion of Gtα initially removes a 2-kDa amino-terminal fragment(22Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. Science. 1984; 226: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); this modification abolished immunoreactivity with LAS-2. The presence of the remaining 37-kDa fragment was verified by reactivity with the carboxyl-directed polyclonal antibody AS/7 (Fig. 2C). These findings all suggested that the LAS-2 epitope was located within the 18 amino-terminal amino acids removed by trypsin, in agreement with the functional data obtained with Gtβγ(2Navon S.E. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15746-15751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Phillips W.J. Wong S.G. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Adamik R. Hewlett E.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7378-7381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further mapping was done using recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. Gtα1 cDNA inserted into a pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia) yielded high levels of rGtα in a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase(31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Despite reacting with AS/7, this fusion protein failed to react with LAS-2 both before and after cleavage of the thrombin-sensitive link between glutathione S-transferase and Gtα (data not shown). An amino-terminally myristoylated rGtα was synthesized in E. coli by coexpressing Gtα and yeast N-myristoyltransferase(32Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of rGtα was verified by detection of 3H-labeled Gtα after addition of [3H]myristic acid during protein synthesis. This myristoylated rGtα reacted with LAS-1 and −2 on immunoblots. rGtα synthesized without N-myristoyltransferase was not labeled with [3H]myristate and did not react with LAS-2, although it did react with AS/7 and another transducin monoclonal antibody, 6E4 (27Halpern J.L. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Kanaho Y. Bekesi E. Kung H. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 515-519PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Fidelity of expression and lack of proteolytic modification of the unmyristoylated rGtα was verified by Edman degradation though five cycles, yielding the expected Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Ser sequence (Harvard MicroChem). The LAS-2 antibody was very specific for Gtα. It reacted with only a single band from a bovine retinal homogenate (Fig. 4A) and did not react with Goα, Giα, or Gsα on immunoblots (Fig. 4B). A recombinant Goα, expressed in E. coli, did not react with LAS-2 either in a nonmyristoylated state or when coexpressed with N-myristoyltransferase and myristoylated (Fig. 4C, lanes1 and 2). A chimeric protein, Gtα9-Goα, consisting of Gtα1 sequence in amino acids 1-9, and the remainder Goα sequence was constructed by replacing Cys3, Thr4, and Leu5 of Goα with Ala3, Gly4, Ala5. This protein was myristoylated when coexpressed with N-myristoyltransferase but did not react with LAS-2 either with or without myristoylation (Fig. 4C, lanes3 and 4). A chimeric protein in which the first 21 amino acids of Goα were replaced with the first 17 amino acids of Gtα (Gtα17-Goα) did react with LAS-2, but only when myristoylated; the nonmyristoylated Gtα17-Goα did not react (Fig. 4, lanes5 and 6). The LAS-1 antibody shown in Fig. 1 reacted in a manner identical to LAS-2 on all immunoblots including those performed with proteolytic digests of Gτα, native Gα proteins, and recombinant proteins. It did not, however, interfere functionally with Gτα-Gtβγ interaction as judged by inhibition of βγ-dependent ADP-ribosylation. Why two antibodies with seemingly identical mapping properties differ functionally is unclear, but it may have to do with differing affinities for Gτα. It appears that monoclonal antibody LAS-2, a Gτα-specific monoclonal antibody, which interferes with Gτα-Gtβγ interaction, has an epitope that includes specific Gτα amino acid sequence within positions 10-17 and requires a fatty acyl group in proximity to these residues. Just as the first 9 amino acids are not specific for Gtβγ binding(17Kokame K. Yoshitaka F. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), they do not encompass the LAS-2 epitope, which lies further downstream. The amino terminus of bovine Gτα is modified in a heterogeneous manner by lauroyl (C:12), myristoyl (C:14), (cis-Δ-5)-tetradecaenoyl (C:14:1), or (cis,cis-Δ5,Δ8)-tetradecadienoyl (C:14:2) fatty acids(17Kokame K. Yoshitaka F. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 33Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) reported that the length of the amino-terminal fatty acid was important for the ability of nonapeptides to inhibit the interaction of Gτα and Gtβγ, although no requirement for specific amino acid sequence was observed. Upon exchange of GDP for GTP, Gτα disassociates from Gtβγ, and a conformational difference in crystal structures of these two nucleotide-bound states has been documented (34Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 35Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The proteins crystallized, however, lacked the amino-terminal 25 amino acids and thus lacked the Gtβγ-binding domain and the LAS epitope studied here. It has been postulated that myristate may act to stabilize an amino-terminal amphipathic helix and participate in protein function(38Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J.

The fatty acyl group in the N-myristoylated Gα proteins may play a similar role, depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound. Our findings suggest that within the Gτα amino-terminal domain the fatty acid may “fold back” on and stabilize peptide structure, consistent with the hypothesis that the fatty acid does more than merely project from the protein into the lipid bilayer to serve as an amino-terminal membrane anchor."
