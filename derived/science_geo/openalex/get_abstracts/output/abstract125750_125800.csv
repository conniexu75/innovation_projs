https://openalex.org/W2098203835,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, pRB, is inactivated by phosphorylation. While existing evidence is strong that such phosphorylation is mediated by one or more cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) active during G1/S, it remains unclear which of the various CDKs is responsible. We show here that three candidate pRB-inactivating kinases, CDK4-cyclin D1, CDK2-cyclin E, and CDK2-cyclin A, phosphorylate pRB differentially, each on a subset of authentic pRB phosphorylation sites. Notably, two neighboring pRB phosphate acceptors, threonine 821 and threonine 826, which have previously been implicated in the regulation of LXCXE protein binding, are phosphorylated by different CDKs. We demonstrate that phosphorylation by either CDK2-cyclin A, which phosphorylates T821, or CDK4-cyclin D1, which phosphorylates threonine 826, can disable pRB for subsequent binding of an LXCXE protein. However, only one of these two kinases, CDK2-cyclin A, can dissociate a pre-existing LXCXE protein-pRB complex. We provide evidence that prior binding of an LXCXE protein blocks access to certain residues specifically targeted by CDK4-cyclin D1, explaining the inability of this kinase to resolve such complexes. While these results are not direct proof of the relevance of differential pRB phosphorylation in cells, our findings support a model whereby full phosphorylation of pRB may require the action of more than one kinase and explains how such differential phosphorylation by different CDKs might translate into a differential regulation of downstream effector pathways.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, pRB, which plays a central role in control of the cell cycle. pRB seems to act as a check during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, ensuring that cells do not enter S phase until such a time as is appropriate. In some differentiating cells this function is extended, with pRB mediating their permanent exit from the cell cycle (see review in Ref. 1Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These functions of pRB seem to rely on its ability to bind to, and alter the activity of, transcription factors including E2F-1, PU.1, ATF-2, UBF, Elf-1, MyoD, and BRG-1 (reviewed in Ref. 2Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). pRB appears to inhibit transcription from genes necessary for cell cycle progression by binding to certain of these transcription factors (the best studied of which is E2F-1) while promoting transcription from differentiation-specific genes through binding others (e.g. MyoD). Hyperphosphorylation of pRB is thought to inactivate its functioning by disabling its transcription factor-binding abilities, thus allowing progression of cells through the division cycle (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4303) Google Scholar). The likely mediators of this phosphorylation are members of the family of proline-directed, serine/threonine, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase.; they phosphorylate authentic sites on pRB and are themselves thought to play a key role in cell cycle control (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Lin B.T. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W.H. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of pRB is accompanied by release of pRB from nuclear tethering and a change in pRB's mobility in SDS-containing gels (6Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-10513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 7Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1995; 5: 79-95PubMed Google Scholar, 8DeCaprio J.A.

Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). These changes are first seen during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle, implicating cyclin-dependent kinases active at around this time to be responsible. These include CDK2-cyclin E, CDK2-cyclin A, and the CDK4/CDK6-cyclin D subfamily of CDKs (reviewed in Ref. 11Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of any single one of these CDKs in pRB hyperphosphorylation remains controversial. Expression of either D type cyclins, cyclin A, or cyclin E can induce retarded migration in SDS gels, released from nuclear tethering and inactivation of pRB's growth suppressing function in SAOS2 osteosarcoma cells (12Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 13Ewen M.E. Ludlow J.W. Marsilio E. DeCaprio J.A. Millikan R.C. Cheng S.H. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, while ectopic expression of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E shortens the G1 phase in NIH 3T3 cells, only cyclin D1 expression concomitantly leads to premature pRB hyperphosphorylation (14Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Other evidence suggests that successive phosphorylation by cyclin D1- and cyclin E-directed kinases may be necessary to achieve hyperphosphorylation of pRB (15Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Regulation of pRB by phosphorylation might indeed by quite complex. There are 16 consensus CDK phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs) on pRB and phosphopeptide analysis suggests that many, if not all, of them serve as bona fide phosphate acceptors in cells (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of differentially phosphorylated forms of pRB appear to exist in cells (as judged by differential mobility in SDS gels and phosphopeptide patterns) and the state of phosphorylation appears to alter even after pRB's initial hyperphosphorylation in late G1 (16DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Lynch D. Furukawa Y. Griffin J. Piwnica W.H. Huang C.M. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Evidence is emerging that phosphorylation at particular residues of pRB may affect the binding of pRB to only particular subsets of its interacting partners (17Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This suggests that different arrays of pRB phosphorylation may result in differential regulation of downstream effector pathways. We have recently shown evidence that one of pRB's phosphorylated residues, serine 608, is a target for some, but not all, CDKs (18Zarkowska T., U, S. Harlow E. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that different CDKs may phosphorylate pRB differentially. Here, we have extended this observation and provide evidence that the same CDKs also target other pRB residues differentially. We also demonstrate how such differential phosphorylation may affect the ability of these CDKs to dissociate pre-existing pRB-protein complexes. Vectors for the production of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pRB fusion proteins were constructed by insertion of the entire pRB coding sequence (or fragments thereof) into the BamHI site of pGEX 2T (Pharmacia). The threonine at position 826 was converted into alanine using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Baculovirus encoding human CDK4 was a gift of C. Sherr (HHMI, St Jude's Hospital, Memphis, TE). Cloned versions of human CDK2 and cyclin A (obtained from E. Harlow, MGH Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA), human cyclin D1 (obtained from A. Arnold, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and human cyclin E (obtained from S. Reed, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) were inserted into the baculovirus shuttle vectors pVL1392/3 to produce recombinant baculovirus. Baculoviruses were generated using the baculovirus GoldTM kit (PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A vector allowing expression of 9E10 (myc)-tagged cyclin E in COS cells was constructed by engineering (by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis) a NotI site in front of the natural cyclin E stop codon into which a cloned version of the 9E10 epitope (coding for amino acids EQLISEEDL-STOP) was subsequently inserted. Cyclin E modified in this way was cloned into the COS cell expression vector RcCMV (Invitrogen). Anti-pRB antisera were raised in rabbits using human GST-pRB fusion proteins as immunogens. Monoclonal antibodies specific for underphosphorylated pRB (14441A) and SV40 large T antigen (14111A) were purchased from PharMingen. Monoclonal α-human cyclin A antibody (BF683) was a gift of E. Harlow. The tag- specific 9E10 antibody was purified from tissue culture supernatant of 9E10 Hybridoma cells (a gift of G. Evan, ICRF, London) using DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Human HaCat cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were labeled with orthophosphate and pRB immunoprecipitated as described previously (10Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with DNA using DEAE-dextran as described by others (27Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner W.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Insect Sf9 cells and baculoviruses were cultured and used based on the detailed, published procedures of others (25King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus System, A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar). Enzyme preparation was essentially as described by others (26Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of >10 plaque forming units per cell with baculoviruses encoding either cyclin or CDK subunits for control lysates, or both viruses concomitantly to generate active enzymes. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection and lysed at 4 °C in 250 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, containing protease inhibitors leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin, the phosphatase inhibitor β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm protein kinase A inhibitor). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Kinases from mammalian tissue culture cells were purified by immunoprecipitation as described in Ref. 20Tsai L.-H. Harlow E. Meyerson M. Nature. 1991; 353: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed and purified from cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) P-Lys transformed with plasmids as described recently (18Zarkowska T., U, S. Harlow E. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were either stored in kinase buffer (see above) and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (for phosphorylation by insect cell-produced kinases) or eluted (for binding assays and phosphorylation by CDKs immunopurified from mammalian cells). Elution was performed with elution buffer (100 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), and protease inhibitors). Eluted proteins were stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. GST fusion proteins (300 ng), bound to glutathione-Sepharose, were incubated with 0.5–2 μl of insect cell expressed enzymes (or equivalent amounts of control lysate) in kinase buffer (see above) containing 25 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 25 °C. Following phosphorylation, the pRB-containing beads were washed once with TNET (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The level of phosphorylation achieved by individual kinase preparation was characteristically 20–50-fold above the levels achieved using control lysates. Phosphorylation by immunopurified cyclin-associated kinases was essentially performed identically, except that eluted GST fusion proteins were used as substrates to aid access to protein G-Sepharose bound kinase. For phosphorylation of pRB in the presence of E1A, full-length GST-pRB (GST-pRB(1–928)) was mixed with a molar excess of purified E1A and, following incubation on ice for 10 min, phosphorylated using CDK4-cyclin D1 as described above. E1A was expressed as a full-length product in bacteria and purified as described by others (28Krippl B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Ferguson B. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 420-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps were performed essentially as described recently (10Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Typically, an amount equivalent to 300–1000 cpm of the digested proteins was resolved for each map. Numbers were assigned to individual peptides by comparison with standard maps run in parallel and/or further maps where material from two sources was comigrated. pRB labeled in vivo was immunoprecipitated from HaCat cells as described previously (10Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Individual tryptic phosphopeptides were scratched from thin layer chromatography plates using the autoradiograph as a template. Peptides were eluted from the cellulose matrix by resuspension in 0.5 ml of pH 1.9 buffer (88% formic acid/acetic acid/water, 25:78:897 (by volume) containing, for a carrier, 0.1 μg/ml unlabeled phosphoserine and phosphothreonine). Elutions were performed at room temperature for 30 min after which time the cellulose was pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 5 min). The supernatant, containing the eluted peptide, was removed and the cellulose pellet subjected to one further round of elution. The eluates were combined, lyophilized, hydrolyzed in 6n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h under nitrogen, lyophilized again, resuspended in pH 1.9 buffer (as above), loaded onto cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Kodak), and subjected to electrophoresis. Electrophoretic separation was performed toward the anode at 800 V for a duration of 40 min after which time the plates were dried and stained with ninhydrin to visualize the position of unlabeled carrier phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Radiolabeled amino acids were visualized by exposing the plates to autoradiographic film. COS cell lysate, equivalent to 2 × 106 cells, was mixed with 50 ng of full-length GST-pRB (GST-pRB(1–928)) and pRB-containing complexes were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads. COS cell lysates were prepared in ELB (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, containing the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride, β-glycerophosphate, and sodium vanadate) and stored at −70 °C. Beads containing the pRB complexes were washed twice in 0.5 × ELB and analyzed for the presence of pRB and T(Ag) by Western blotting or, alternatively, used as a substrate for subsequent CDK phosphorylation. In the latter case the Sepharose beads were washed a further two times in kinase buffer and treated with insect cell-expressed CDKs (for phosphorylation) or buffer alone (for a control). The conditions for phosphorylation were as described for protein labeling except that radioactive ATP was omitted and the amount of unlabeled ATP was increased to 50 μm. To ensure complete phosphorylation, the incubation period was increased to 45 min and fresh kinase and ATP were added every 15 min. Prior to the reaction, the different kinase-containing extracts were diluted with kinase buffer to contain equal concentrations of kinase activity. To remove any proteins that may have been released as a consequence of the kinase treatment the Sepharose beads were washed twice in 0.5 × ELB and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for pRB or T(Ag). To test for the impact of pRB phosphorylation on complex assembly, pRB was phosphorylated prior to addition of COS cell extract. The conditions for phosphorylation were identical to those for phosphorylation of pRB complexes. We have previously demonstrated that one of pRB's consensus CDK phosphorylation sites, serine 608, is part of the epitope recognized by antibodies that specifically detect the underphosphorylated, G1 form of pRB and that this site is phosphorylated by CDK4-cyclin D1 and CDK2-cyclin A but not by CDK2-cyclin E. To establish whether differences in phosphorylation by these three CDKs occur on other Ser/Thr-Pro motifs, we performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of pRB following its phosphorylation by these kinases in vitro. As a substrate, we used purified full-length pRB produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-pRB(1–928)) in E. coli. The kinases were derived from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the various cyclin and CDK subunits. The resulting phosphopeptide maps demonstrate that serine 608 is not the only phosphorylation acceptor differentially targeted by these different CDKs (Fig. 1 A). Phosphorylation by any one of the three CDKs generates authentic phosphopeptides, demonstrated by comigration with peptides derived from cellular pRB labeled in vivo with radioactive phosphate (data not shown). Yet the array of peptides phosphorylated by these three kinases is remarkably different. Cellular pRB (labeled by exposing growing HaCat cell to [32P]orthophosphate) gives a characteristic pattern of phosphopeptide spots, each of which has been previously named to aid comparison between maps (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In general, the most hydrophobic phosphopeptides migrate furthest in the chromatography dimension, such as the upper diamond of spots seen in in vivo maps (embracing spots 1, 2, and 3) (see Fig. 1 A, top left panel). Smaller phosphopeptides generally migrate furthest in the electrophoresis direction, such as those making up an “ear” shaped configuration on the right of the map (spots A and 6–10). To the left of the ear migrates spot 14. Although the maps generated by phosphorylation with each CDK contain many of these same phosphopeptides, none of the CDKs alone can reproduce the full pattern of spots seen for maps of cellular pRB. Most of the authentic pRB phosphopeptide spots are generated when pRB is phosphorylated by CDK4-cyclin D1 (Fig. 1 A, top right panel), including spot 14, most of the upper diamond (spots 1, 2, and 3) and nearly all the ear (spots A, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Only spot 10 (the lowest of the ear phosphopeptides) is absent from this map. In addition, one aberrant phosphopeptide is generated, spot Z (see below). Interestingly, of the three kinases tested, CDK4-cyclin D1 is the only one that is able to generate all three of the hyperphosphorylation-specific spots (3, 9, and 14) which are under-represented in maps of active, nuclear tethered pRB (10Mittnacht S. Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pRB by CDK2-cyclin A or CDK2-cyclin E results in phosphopeptide maps very different from the one generated by CDK4-cyclin D1 (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). Both of these maps consist of far fewer phosphopeptide spots (immediately apparent is that neither map contains spot 14 nor spots 1, 2, and 3 from the upper diamond). Phosphorylation of pRB by both of these kinases gives rise to three phosphopeptides also seen to be produced upon CDK4-cyclin D1 phosphorylation (spots 7, 9, and Z). Additionally, both give rise to spot 10 (the one major phosphopeptide of cellular pRB that is absent when recombinant pRB is phosphorylated by CDK4-cyclin D1) and spot F (an authentic, in vivo tryptic phosphopeptide of pRB, migrating below spot 2 and to the left of spot 6, which is represented only at low levels in maps of cellular pRB labeled in growing cells (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)). While the maps of pRB phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2-cyclin E are very similar they are not, however, identical. One phosphopeptide, spot 6, is produced upon phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin E kinase but not upon phosphorylation by CDK2-cyclin A. It is perhaps surprising that CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2-cyclin E phosphorylate so few residues on pRB, since both cyclin A and cyclin E trigger kinase activity that results in full hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of pRB upon transfection into SAOS2 cells (12Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). However, both these cyclins have been reported to associate with, and activate, CDK subunits other than CDK2 (19Miyajima M. Nornes H.O. Neuman T. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Tsai L.-H. Harlow E. Meyerson M. Nature. 1991; 353: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that, by combining with additional CDK subunits in cells, these cyclins might direct modification of additional residues of pRB, resulting in a more complete phosphorylation. We therefore sought to assess whether the kinase activity associated with these cyclins isolated from cells would result in a tryptic phosphopeptide pattern equivalent or different to that generated by our recombinant enzymes. We immunopurified cyclin A, for which a highly specific monoclonal antibody is available, from growing HaCat keratinocytes. For a cyclin E source, we transfected COS cells with a vector encoding 9E10 epitope-tagged cyclin E and purified kinase activity with tag-specific antibody. The map of recombinant pRB phosphorylated by α-cyclin A associated kinases is identical to that using insect cell-expressed CDK2-cyclin A (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Similarly, maps using either 9E10 (anti-tag) associated kinases or CDK2-cyclin E expressed in insect cells are also identical (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Thus the distinct patterns of phosphates installed on pRB by recombinant CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2-cyclin E genuinely reflect the kinase activities associated with the respective cyclins in cells. The phosphopeptide maps of GST-pRB phosphorylated by CDK4-cyclin D1, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK2-cyclin E kinases clearly imply that each of these CDKs phosphorylates a distinct subset of residues on pRB. We therefore set out to unravel which residues of pRB are phosphorylated by these different kinases. This task was greatly aided by the results of previous work from Lees and co-workers (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). They provided evidence for the identity of many of the tryptic phosphopeptide spots generated from cellular pRB by demonstrating their co-migration with synthetic pRB peptides phosphorylated by mitotic CDK (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have used two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of phosphorylated GST-pRB fragments in combination with phosphoamino acid analysis to confirm many of their predictions and to map previously unassigned spots. Using these two, complementary methods, we first established the identities of pRB residues phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A. We subjected each tryptic phosphopeptide of full-length pRB phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A to phosphoamino acid analysis to identify the nature of the phosphorylated residue(s) (Fig. 2 A). We also used two-dimensional maps of pRB fragments to determine the region of pRB from which each phosphopeptide arises (Fig.2 B). The phosphopeptide giving rise to spot 10 has previously been shown to co-migrate with phospho-SPK, suggesting that it arises from phosphorylation of serine 612, the only serine within pRB's primary amino acid sequence positioned to give such a peptide upon tryptic cleavage (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the identity of spot 10 by demonstrating that it contains only phosphoserine (Fig. 2 A) and that it arises from CDK2-cyclin A phosphorylation of a pRB fragment spanning amino acids 379–792 (the pocket region) (Fig. 2 B, bottom left panel). Similarly, we have confirmed that spot F represents phosphorylation at threonine 821 of pRB, since it contains only phosphothreonine (Fig. 2 A) and, while not arising from the pocket region alone, is generated upon phosphorylation of a fragment that also contains the COOH terminus of pRB (amino acids 300–928; top right panel). Spot 7, which has not been previously mapped, is also generated only from this larger region (see below). The origins of certain pRB tryptic phosphopeptide spots are ambiguous since identical tryptic peptides can be derived from different regions of pRB (4Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For example, phosphopeptides generated from three distinct regions of pRB can give rise to spot 9. This spot has previously been shown to co-migrate with phospho-TPR, the phosphopeptide generated upon tryptic cleavage around Thr5, Thr252, or Thr356 of pRB. Thus, although spot 9 is seen in maps of pRB phosphorylated by each of the three CDKs investigated here, we cannot automatically infer that they phosphorylate the same residue. We have confirmed that spot 9, generated upon phosphorylation of full-length pRB by each of these CDKs, contains only phosphothreonine (Figs.2 A and 3 A, and data not shown) and have used maps of smaller regions of pRB to determine, in some instances, which of the three sites are phosphorylated. CDK2-cyclin A does not appear to phosphorylate Thr356 of pRB, since spot 9 is not represented in maps of GST-pRB(300–928) phosphorylated by this kinase (Fig. 2 B, top right panel). Spot 9 is, however, present in maps of GST-pRB(1–32) phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin A (bottom right panel). On this short NH2-terminal fragment of pRB, the presence of spot 9 can only indicate phosphorylation at Thr5. The aberrant spot Z also arises from this short, NH2-terminal fragment (GST-pRB(1–32)). Phosphoamino acid analysis of spot Z reveals that, like spot 9, it too contains only phosphothreonine and thus presumably also results from phosphorylation at Thr5. We infer that spot Z does not arise from the GST portion of this fusion protein since: 1) the only proline-directed site on GST is a Ser/Pro"

The detection of a coprecipitated protein of 92 kDa was confirmed by reactivity with an antibody against β-catenin (Fig. 1 A). Since E-cadherin forms complexes with α-, β-, and γ-catenins (26Kintner C.

While there was no detectable α-catenin in the precipitates, the results indicate that DF3 forms complexes with γ-catenin (Fig. 1, B and C). In the reciprocal experiments, anti-catenin immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DF3. The findings confirm binding of DF3 to β- and γ-catenins (Fig. 1 D). As previously shown (26Kintner C.

Incubation of the filters with a GST fusion protein that contains the DF3 cytoplasmic domain (GST-DF3/CD) demonstrated binding to β-catenin (Fig.2 A). By contrast, there was no detectable binding to GST (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained for γ-catenin (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Direct binding of DF3 to β-catenin (β-cat) and γ-catenin.

Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). A similar site is present at amino acids 1239–1243 in DF3 (Fig.3 A). To assess whether β-catenin binds to the SXXXXXSSL site in DF3, we subjected cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with mAb DF3 in the presence of the synthetic peptide GGSSLSY. The results demonstrate that the peptide inhibits binding of β-catenin and DF3 (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, there was no detectable effect on this interaction when using an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 3 B). The GGSSLSY peptide also blocked interaction of DF3 and γ-catenin (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggested that β- and γ-catenin bind to DF3 at similar sites.Figure 3DF3 binds to catenins at an SXXXXXSSL site. A, SXXXXXSSL sites in E-cadherin, APC, and DF3.

There was no detectable β-catenin in the mAb DF3 immunoprecipitates prepared from the suspension cells. By contrast, binding of DF3 to β-catenin was detectable at 1 and 3 h of adherence (Fig.4 A). Cell adhesion was also associated with formation of a complex with DF3 and γ-catenin (Fig. 4 B), but not α-catenin (data not shown). A similar analysis of E-cadherin immunoprecipitates demonstrated little if any difference in binding to β- or γ-catenin in suspension as compared with adherent cells (Fig.4 C).Figure 4Cell adhesion induces binding of DF3 with β-catenin (β-cat) and γ-catenin.

The cell adhesion E-cadherin protein and the APC tumor suppressor gene product compete for binding to the arm repeats of β-catenin (16Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) that are also found in Armadillo, γ-catenin, and certain other junctional proteins (29Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that DF3 also binds directly to β-catenin and that the SXXXXXSSL motif in DF3 is responsible for this interaction. Similar results were obtained with the highly related γ-catenin. Whereas the cytoplasmic domain of DF3/MUC1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine (8Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zrihan-Licht S. Baruch A. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it is not known if tyrosine sites influence binding of catenins to the serine-rich motif. The formation of a complex between DF3 and β-catenin (or γ-catenin) may differ from those found in other β-catenin complexes. The interaction of E-cadherin or APC complexes to the cytoskeleton is mediated by binding of β-catenin to α-catenin (16Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). By contrast, there was little if any α-catenin in the complex of DF3 and β-catenin. Moreover, while E-cadherin forms a stable complex with β-catenin in suspension and adherent cells, the interaction of DF3 with β-catenin is detectable following cell adhesion. Similar findings were obtained for the interaction of DF3 and γ-catenin. These findings support a role for DF3 in the adhesion of cells and provide support for a novel interaction of DF3 with catenins.

These findings suggested that β- and γ-catenin bind to DF3 at similar sites.Figure 3DF3 binds to catenins at an SXXXXXSSL site. A, SXXXXXSSL sites in E-cadherin, APC, and DF3. B, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb DF3 in the presence of no added peptide, a control peptide (50 μm; EAPPPKIPDKQ), or a 50 μm GGSSLSY peptide. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-β-catenin (β-cat) or anti-γ-catenin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The functional role of the association between DF3 and β-catenin was studied in cells grown in suspension and then grown as a monolayer. There was no detectable β-catenin in the mAb DF3 immunoprecipitates prepared from the suspension cells. By contrast, binding of DF3 to β-catenin was detectable at 1 and 3 h of adherence (Fig.4 A). Cell adhesion was also associated with formation of a complex with DF3 and γ-catenin (Fig. 4 B), but not α-catenin (data not shown). A similar analysis of E-cadherin immunoprecipitates demonstrated little if any difference in binding to β- or γ-catenin in suspension as compared with adherent cells (Fig.4 C).Figure 4Cell adhesion induces binding of DF3 with β-catenin (β-cat) and γ-catenin. Cells were trypsinized and grown in suspension by gentle agitation for 6 h. Suspension cells were allowed to adhere to culture dishes for 1 and 3 h. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with mAb DF3 (A and B) or anti-E-cadherin (anti-E-cad, C). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for reactivity with anti-β-catenin, anti-γ-catenin, or mAb DF3. Lysates were directly analyzed by immunoblotting as controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)β-Catenin is involved in the formation of adherens junctions of epithelial cells. The cell adhesion E-cadherin protein and the APC tumor suppressor gene product compete for binding to the arm repeats of β-catenin (16Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) that are also found in Armadillo, γ-catenin, and certain other junctional proteins (29Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that DF3 also binds directly to β-catenin and that the SXXXXXSSL motif in DF3 is responsible for this interaction. Similar results were obtained with the highly related γ-catenin. Whereas the cytoplasmic domain of DF3/MUC1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine (8Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zrihan-Licht S. Baruch A. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), it is not known if tyrosine sites influence binding of catenins to the serine-rich motif. The formation of a complex between DF3 and β-catenin (or γ-catenin) may differ from those found in other β-catenin complexes. The interaction of E-cadherin or APC complexes to the cytoskeleton is mediated by binding of β-catenin to α-catenin (16Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). By contrast, there was little if any α-catenin in the complex of DF3 and β-catenin. Moreover, while E-cadherin forms a stable complex with β-catenin in suspension and adherent cells, the interaction of DF3 with β-catenin is detectable following cell adhesion. Similar findings were obtained for the interaction of DF3 and γ-catenin. These findings support a role for DF3 in the adhesion of cells and provide support for a novel interaction of DF3 with catenins. To identify proteins that associate with DF3, we analyzed mAb DF3 immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The detection of a coprecipitated protein of 92 kDa was confirmed by reactivity with an antibody against β-catenin (Fig. 1 A). Since E-cadherin forms complexes with α-, β-, and γ-catenins (26Kintner C. Cell. 1992; 69: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we analyzed anti-DF3 immunoprecipitates for an association with α- and γ-catenins. While there was no detectable α-catenin in the precipitates, the results indicate that DF3 forms complexes with γ-catenin (Fig. 1, B and C). In the reciprocal experiments, anti-catenin immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DF3. The findings confirm binding of DF3 to β- and γ-catenins (Fig. 1 D). As previously shown (26Kintner C. Cell. 1992; 69: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), E-cadherin formed complexes with all three of the catenins (Fig.1 D). To determine if binding to DF3 is direct, we subjected anti-β- catenin immunoprecipitates to SDS-PAGE and then transferred the separated proteins to filters. Incubation of the filters with a GST fusion protein that contains the DF3 cytoplasmic domain (GST-DF3/CD) demonstrated binding to β-catenin (Fig.2 A). By contrast, there was no detectable binding to GST (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained for γ-catenin (Fig. 2 B). Previous studies have demonstrated that β-catenin binds to SXXXXXSSL sites in E-cadherin (amino acids 840–848) and APC (seven motifs) (23Su L.K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 24Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Mastarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P.

Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). β-Catenin also associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor, which contains a SRTPLLSSLS (amino acids 1030–1039) site (28Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). A similar site is present at amino acids 1239–1243 in DF3 (Fig.3 A). To assess whether β-catenin binds to the SXXXXXSSL site in DF3, we subjected cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with mAb DF3 in the presence of the synthetic peptide GGSSLSY. The results demonstrate that the peptide inhibits binding of β-catenin and DF3 (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, there was no detectable effect on this interaction when using an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 3 B). The GGSSLSY peptide also blocked interaction of DF3 and γ-catenin (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggested that β- and γ-catenin bind to DF3 at similar sites.

Sequence analysis revealed that this 1,778-base pair cDNA contained an open reading frame and encoded a new 502 amino acid protein designated CYP2J3. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, CYP2J3 was approximately 70% homologous to both human CYP2J2 and rabbit CYP2J1. Recombinant CYP2J3 protein was co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Microsomal fractions of CYP2J3/NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase-transfected cells metabolized arachidonic acid to 14,15-, 11,12-, and 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as the principal reaction products (catalytic turnover, 0.2 nmol of product/nmol of cytochrome P450/min at 37 °C). Immunoblotting of microsomal fractions prepared from rat tissues using a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant CYP2J2 that cross-reacted with CYP2J3 but not with other known rat P450s demonstrated abundant expression of CYP2J3 protein in heart and liver. Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded rat heart tissue sections using the anti-CYP2J2 IgG and avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection localized expression of CYP2J3 primarily to atrial and ventricular myocytes. In an isolated-perfused rat heart model, 20 min of global ischemia followed by 40 min of reflow resulted in recovery of only 44 ± 6% of base-line contractile function. The addition of 5 μm 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid to the perfusate prior to global ischemia resulted in a significant 1.6-fold improvement in recovery of cardiac contractility (69 ± 5% of base line,p = 0.01 versus vehicle alone). Importantly, neither 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid nor 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid significantly improved functional recovery following global ischemia, demonstrating the specificity of the biological effect for the 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid regioisomer. Based on these data, we conclude that (a) CYP2J3 is one of the predominant enzymes responsible for the oxidation of endogenous arachidonic acid pools in rat heart myocytes and (b) 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid may play an important functional role in the response of the heart to ischemia.

Importantly, the chirality of CYP2J2 products matched that of the EET enantiomers present in vivo in human heart, suggesting that CYP2J2 was one of the predominant enzymes responsible for the epoxidation of endogenous cardiac arachidonic acid pools (8Wu S.

Despite these investigations, the regulation and functional significance of this hemoprotein and the epoxygenase metabolites that it produces in the heart remain unknown. Studies on the importance and functional role of the human cardiac P450 epoxygenase(s) in human heart physiology and pathophysiology have not been possible because of the limited availability of fresh, histologically normal and abnormal human heart tissues. The presence of an animal model would greatly facilitate these investigations but would first require a detailed knowledge of the molecular and catalytic properties of the enzyme(s) involved and access to biospecific probes to study the regulation of the relevant enzyme(s) at the gene and/or protein level. In this report, we describe the cloning and cDNA-directed expression of a rat P450 that is highly expressed in cardiac myocytes and metabolizes arachidonic acid to EETs and 19-OH-AA. We also utilize an isolated-perfused rat heart model to demonstrate that one of these eicosanoid products (11,12-EET) improves functional recovery following prolonged global cardiac ischemia. [α-32P]dATP and [1-14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from DuPont NEN. Restriction enzymes and Escherichia coli polymerase I were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).

As a result, we screened an oligo(dT)-primed Uni-Zap cDNA library, synthesized from rat liver poly(A)+ mRNA using a Lambda Zap-cDNA synthesis kit obtained from Stratagene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the 1.9-kb CYP2J2 cDNA probe.

Two of these clones (clones SW5-12 and SW5-21) were completely sequenced utilizing a total of 14 oligonucleotide primers (20–25 nucleotides each) that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. Clones SW5-12 and SW5-21 were approximately 98% identical and differed only in that clone SW5-12 lacked 38 nucleotides at position 1193 and clone SW5-21 contained an additional 11 nucleotides in the 5′-end untranslated region and an additional 62 nucleotides at position 1332 (Fig. 1). Clone SW5-21 (designated CYP2J3P1) 3The new sequences that are reported in this paper were submitted to the Committee on Standardized Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature and have been designated CYP2J3P1 (clone SW5-21), CYP2J3P2 (clone SW5-12), and CYP2J3 (clone SW9-1). These sequences have also been submitted to GenBankTM and assigned the accession numbers U39943, U40000, and U40004. was 1,909 nucleotides long, contained an open reading frame that encoded a 456-amino acid protein that did not contain the putative heme binding peptide, and was deemed too short to code for a functional P450 protein (Fig. 1). Clone SW5-12 (designated CYP2J3P2) was 1,807 nucleotides long, contained an open reading frame that encoded a 399-amino acid protein that also failed to contain the heme binding peptide, and so was also deemed too short to code for a functional P450 protein (Fig. 1). Both of these clones were thought to represent CYP2J subfamily pseudogenes. Oligonucleotide primers based on the 5′- and 3′-end sequences of CYP2J3P1 and CYP2J3P2 (forward primer, 5′-ATATCAGCCATGCTTGTCACAGCGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCATTCTCCATGGTCCCGTAATC-3′) were then used to PCR-amplify reverse transcribed rat liver and heart total RNA. Reverse transcription was performed with 5 μg of total RNA in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μmoligo(dT)16 primer, 1 mm each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP, 0.01 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The PCR amplifications were performed on 10% of the reverse transcription reaction in the presence of 50 μm forward and reverse primers, 2.5 mm dNTPs, and 5 units of AmpliTaq ® DNA polymerase. Following an initial incubation for 3 min at 94 °C, samples were subjected to 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 4 min at 68 °C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and a single 1.8-kb band was recovered from the gel using a Qiaex gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The cDNAs were ligated into the pCR™II vector (In Vitrogen), replicated in DH5α-competent E. coli, and sequenced. One of the clones (clone SW9-1, designated CYP2J3) was completely sequenced using a total of 14 nucleotide primers (20–25 nucleotides each) that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and purified using G-25 Sephadex columns (Pharmacia). Total RNA (20 μg) prepared from rat heart, lung, kidney, liver, stomach, and small intestine was denatured and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.2 m formaldehyde. After capillary pressure transfer to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (DuPont NEN), the blots were hybridized with either the 1.9-kb CYP2J2 cDNA insert or with the 1.8-kb SW9-1 cDNA insert. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 50% formamide containing 1 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, and 0.1 mg heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.). Co-expression of the protein encoded by the cloned 1.8-kb SW9-1 cDNA insert (CYP2J3) and CYPOR in Sf9 insect cells was accomplished using the pAcUW51-CYPOR shuttle vector (kindly provided by Dr. Cosette Serabjit-Singh, Glaxo Research Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) (25Lee C. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the BaculoGold Baculovirus Expression System (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, the CYP2J3 cDNA was released from the pCR™II cloning vector by digestion with SpeI andXbaI and then ligated with the pAcUW51-CYPOR vector that was linearized by digestion with NheI. In the resulting expression vector (pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2J3), the expression of CYPOR was controlled by the p10 promoter, while the expression of CYP2J3 was independently controlled by the polyhedrin promoter. Cultured Sf9 insect cells were co-transfected with the pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2J3 expression vector and linear wild-type BaculoGold viral DNA in a CaCl2 solution. Recombinant viruses were purified, and the presence of a CYP2J3 cDNA insert was corroborated by PCR analysis. Cultured Sf9 cells grown in spinner flasks at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml were then infected with high titer CYP2J3/CYPOR recombinant baculovirus stock in the presence of 500 μm δ-aminolevulinic acid. Cells co-expressing recombinant CYP2J3 and CYPOR were harvested 72 h after infection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and either lysed in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) sodium cholate, 0.1 μm EDTA, and 0.1 μm dithiothreitol (8Wu S.

P450 content was determined spectrally according to the method of Omura and Sato (26Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual-wavelength/double-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). The recombinant CYP2J3 was partially purified by passage of the crude cell lysate over an ω-aminooctyl-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μm EDTA, 0.1 μmdithiothreitol, and 0.4% (w/v) sodium cholate (buffer A). The column was washed with four column volumes of buffer A, and the bound CYP2J3 was eluted with buffer A containing 0.4% (v/v) Emulgen 911 (Kao Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Reaction mixtures containing 0.05m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 0.01m MgCl2, 8 mm sodium isocitrate, 0.5 IU/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, 2.0–4.0 mg of CYP2J3/CYPOR-transfected Sf9 cell microsomal protein/ml, and [1-14C]arachidonic acid (25–55 μCi/μmol; 50–75 μm final concentration) were constantly stirred at 37 °C. After temperature equilibration, NADPH (1 mmfinal concentration) was added to initiate the reaction. At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction products were extracted into ethyl ether, dried under a nitrogen stream, analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, and quantified by on-line liquid scintillation using a Radiomatic Flo-One β-detector (Radiomatic Instruments, Tampa, FL) as described (27Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

For chiral analysis, the EETs were collected from the HPLC eluent, derivatized to corresponding EET-PFB or EET-methyl esters, purified by normal phase HPLC, resolved into the corresponding antipodes by chiral phase HPLC, and quantified by liquid scintillation as described previously (30Capdevila J.H.

For some experiments, rats were pretreated with either phenobarbital (80 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 3 days followed by the addition of 0.05% phenobarbital sodium salt to drinking water for 10 days), β-naphthoflavone (40 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 4 days), clofibrate (250 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 4 days), or acetone (1% in drinking water for 7 days). Polyclonal anti-human CYP2J2 IgG was raised in New Zealand White rabbits against the purified, recombinant CYP2J2 protein and affinity-purified as described previously (8Wu S. Moomaw C.R. Tomer K.B. Falck J.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3460-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Antibodies to rat CYP1A1, CYP2B1, CYP2E1, and CYP4A1 were purchased from GENTEST (GENTEST Corporation, Woburn, MA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microsomal fractions prepared from human lymphoblast cells transfected with the cDNAs to rat CYP2A1 and CYP2E1 were also purchased from GENTEST. Purified preparations of rat CYP1A1, CYP2B1/CYP2B2, and CYP2C13 were a gift from Dr. Joyce Goldstein (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). Partially purified, recombinant rat CYP2C11 and CYP2C23 were generously provided by Dr. Jorge Capdevila (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). For immunoblotting, microsomal fractions or partially purified, recombinant P450s were electrophoresed in SDS-10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (80 × 80 × 1 mm), and the resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted using rabbit anti-human CYP2J2 IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the ECL Western blotting Detection System (Amersham) as described (8Wu S.

Protein determinations were performed according to the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, rat heart tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely, and embedded in paraffin. Localization of CYP2J3 protein expression was investigated using the anti-CYP2J2 IgG (1:200 dilution) on serial sections (5–6 μm) of rat atrium and ventricle. Slides were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated through a graded series of ethanol to 1 × automation buffer (1 × AB) (Biomeda, Burlingame, CA) washes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. After rinsing in 1 × AB, slides were microwave-treated, cooled, and blocked with normal goat serum, and the primary antibody was applied for 30 min. Preimmune rabbit IgG was used as the negative control in place of the primary antibody. The bound primary antibody was visualized by avidin-biotin-peroxidase detection using the Vectastain Rabbit Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the color-developing reagent. Slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to xylene washes, and coverslipped with PermountTM (Fisher). Methods used to quantify endogenous EETs present in rat heart were similar to those used to quantify EETs in rat liver (5Karara A. Dishman E. Blair I. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19822-19827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human heart (8Wu S. Moomaw C.R. Tomer K.B. Falck J.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, heart tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing triphenylphosphine (5–10 mg). The homogenate was extracted twice, under acidic conditions, with two volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and once more with an equal volume of chloroform, and the combined organic phases were evaporated in tubes containing mixtures of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-[1-14C]EET internal standards (55–57 μCi/μmol, 30 ng each). Saponification to recover phospholipid-bound EETs was followed by silica column purification. The eluent, containing a mixture of radiolabeled internal standards and total endogenous EETs was resolved into individual regioisomers by HPLC as described ("

O., Näslund, J., Lindqvist, F., Johansson, J., Karlström, A. R., Thyberg, J., Terenius, L., and Nordstedt, C. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 8545–8548). Here, it is shown that KLVFF binds stereospecifically to the homologous sequence in Aβ (i.e. Aβ16–20). Molecular modeling suggests that association of the two homologous sequences leads to the formation of an atypical anti-parallel β-sheet structure stabilized primarily by interaction between the Lys, Leu, and COOH-terminal Phe. By screening combinatorial pentapeptide libraries exclusively composed of d-amino acids, several ligands with a general motif containing phenylalanine in the second position and leucine in the third position were identified. Ligands composed ofd-amino acids were not only capable of binding Aβ but also prevented formation of amyloid-like fibrils. These ligands are protease-resistant and may thus be useful as experimental agents against amyloid fibril formation in vivo.

Synthetic Aβ1–40 was obtained from Dr. David B. Teplow, Biopolymer Laboratory at Harvard University. All other soluble peptides were obtained from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL. Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were from Sigma. The peptide KKLVFFA (this peptide will be referred to hereafter as LBMP1620) and Aβ1–40 were iodinated using the Bolton-Hunter technique. Following the reaction, the iodinated peptide was purified on a Vydac C-4 reverse phase liquid chromatography column (0.21 × 15 cm) using a solvent system containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (buffer A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B). The technique used is essentially identical to the SPOT technique described by Frank (28Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Cellulose membranes (Whatman 1Chr) were derivatized withN,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide-activated Fmoc β-alanine. A spacer, consisting of 2 molecules of β-alanine, was coupled to derivatized filters. The indicated peptides were then synthesized using Fmoc-protected and pentafluorophenyl- orN,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide-activated amino acids dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone. Coupling efficiency was monitored by bromphenol blue staining. Following the blocking of filters with 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), they were incubated in the presence of 2–20 μm125I-labeled Aβ1–40 or 125I-labeled LBMP1620 at 20 °C for 12 h in TBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, the filters were washed repeatedly in the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and dried. Radioactivity bound to the filters was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using densitometry. The docking of a KLVFF (Aβ16–20) pentamer to an Aβ13–23 segment was studied using the Insight/Discover 2.9.7 program suite (Biosym/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA). The two polypeptides were simulated in a periodic box (47 × 20 × 24 Å) with 607 explicit water molecules and an 8-Å cut-off. Default values were used for all other conventions. The Aβ13–23 segment was initialized in a β sheet conformation. The ligands were dissolved in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and diluted with TBS to a final concentration of 100 μm. Aβ was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol before the addition of the freshly prepared ligand solution to a final Aβ concentration of 100 μm. The final concentration of hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol was 2%. In another experiment the samples were dissolved directly in TBS. The samples were thereafter incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, the peptides were examined by electron microscopy, and inhibition of fibril formation was estimated semiquantitatively. The peptides were dissolved in TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Polymers were sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water by a short sonication. Aliquots (8 μl) of the resuspended material were placed on grids covered by a carbon-stabilized Formvar film. After 30 s, excess fluid was withdrawn, and the grids were negatively stained with 3% uranyl acetate in water. Finally, the specimens were examined and photographed in a Jeol electron microscope 100CX at 60 kV. The previously used peptide sequence Ac-QKLVFF-NH2 has a limited solubility in aqueous buffers. We therefore synthesized a peptide sequence with improved water solubility, LBMP1620. The 31 possible decamers corresponding to Aβ1–10, Aβ2–11, Aβ3–12, … , Aβ31–40 were synthesized on a cellulose membrane with their COOH terminus covalently bound to the membrane as described (28Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated overnight at 20 °C in the presence of 2 μm125I-LBMP1620. Following repeated washing in TBS, binding of 125I-LBMP1620 to the immobilized peptides was determined by autoradiography and subsequent densitometry. The radioligand bound to peptides Aβ11–20, Aβ12–21, Aβ13–22, Aβ14–23, Aβ15–24, and Aβ16–25. This binding pattern is similar to the one found when immobilized peptides were incubated with 125I-Aβ1–40 (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The decamer Aβ13–22 (i.e. HHQKLVFFAE) was selected for further studies. The minimal sequence required for125I-LBMP1620 binding was determined by systematic truncation at the NH2- and COOH terminus, respectively (Fig. 1). The results revealed that the LBMP1620-binding site had certain distinct features. (i) Only pentapeptides or larger peptides displayed significant binding, and (ii) binding peptides contained the sequence KLVFF or LVFFA (i.e.Aβ16–20 or Aβ17–21). It is concluded that the Aβ-ligand LBMP1620 binds to the Aβ-peptide by interacting with a domain with a homologous primary sequence. A peptide entirely composed of amino acids in dconfiguration with the sequence klvff (lowercase marks amino acids ind configuration) was synthesized using the SPOT technique and assayed for 125I-LBMP1620 binding. This peptide failed to bind 125I-LBMP1620 (data not shown) indicating that the KLVFF-KLVFF interaction is stereospecific. KLVFF was synthesized on cellulose membranes. They were then incubated overnight at 20 °C with incubation buffer alone, 20 μm Aβ1–40, or LBMP1620. Following washing, the immobilized peptide was incubated with 20 μm125I-Aβ1–40 for 5 h. After the removal of non-bound radiolabeled peptide by repeated washing, binding of125I-Aβ1–40 was determined by autoradiography and densitometry. Preincubation of KLVFF with Aβ1–40 did not affect125I-Aβ1–40 binding, whereas preincubation with LBMP1620 reduced 125I-Aβ1–40 binding by 49%. This confirms that short KLVFF-containing peptides bind to Aβ16–20 and thereby block further Aβ1–40binding. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a short peptide or a functionally similar molecule capable of binding to Aβ16–20 may inhibit Aβ polymer growth. Incubation of KLVFF in aqueous buffers leads to aggregation and precipitation (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), which complicates studies of the structural basis for binding using solution phase techniques (e.g. NMR). The small sizes of the present peptides made them particularly suitable for computer simulations using molecular modeling. Repeated runs of molecular dynamics were followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization. Peptides with the sequences HHQKLVFFAED (Aβ13–23) and KLVFF (Aβ16–20) were docked (Fig. 2). Two common docking motifs were observed roughly corresponding to parallel and anti-parallel β-sheet conformations, respectively. The parallel conformation was considerably higher in energy, and hence the anti-parallel conformation was chosen for further studies. In dynamic simulations of up to several picoseconds in duration, a typical docking pattern involved the approach of the portion of the KLVFF pentamer comprised of the alkane-like basic side chain of the Lys and the Leu of the ligand to the Phe (Aβ20) of Aβ13–23. The COOH-terminal Phe of the pentamer typically projected outward. This motif would suggest a prominent role for Lys, Leu, and the COOH-terminal Phe residues in Aβ aggregation as observed in earlier experiments (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Over the course of the run, the Aβ segment developed an elbow, with the docked pentamer in the interior. Presumably, during longer simulations this conformational shift could significantly enhance the binding of KLVFF pentamers to Aβ. LBMP1620 contains several proteolytic cleavage sites and is highly sensitive to proteolysis (26Nordstedt C. Näslund J. Tjernberg L.O. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30773-30776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore decided to design a ligand with the same binding properties as LBMP1620 but that would be resistant to proteolysis. Since proteolytic enzymes are not capable of hydrolyzing peptide bonds between amino acids ind configuration, ligands entirely composed ofd-amino acids should be able to withstand enzymatic proteolysis. Here it was shown that the shortest peptide binding efficiently to LBMP1620 was a pentamer (see Fig. 1). Therefore, pentapeptides exclusively composed of d-amino acids were synthesized. A combinatorial pentapeptide library, theoretically containing all 2,476,099 permutations of the 19 d-amino acids (cysteine was excluded to avoid unwanted disulfide bonds), was synthesized as described (29Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and subsequently was assayed for125I-LBMP1620 binding. By this design, an individual peptide spot on the membrane contained 130,321 different peptide sequences. As seen in Fig. 3, all amino acid residues mediating 125I-LBMP1620 binding had either basic side chains (h, k, r), aromatic side chains (f, y, w) or non-polar side chains (i, l, m). No amino acid residues with acidic side chains promoted binding, strongly suggesting that electrostatic interactions (i.e. with Lys in LBMP1620) were not critical for binding. Assaying an identical library for125I-Aβ1–40 binding yielded similar results (data not shown). The three amino acids in each position in the pentapeptide library that most prominently promoted 125I-LBMP1620 binding were selected for additional studies (Table I). The 243 possible pentapeptide combinations of these d-amino acids were synthesized individually and assayed for 125I-LBMP1620 binding. The 39 peptides binding most efficiently to125I-LBMP1620 are listed in Fig. 4. As seen in the figure, f in the second and l in the third position were critical for binding. The f in position 2 could be replaced with y, and l in position 3 could be replaced with m, but not concurrently. In position 1, l and y showed higher binding than w, whereas l was favored in position 4. The fifth residue could be either one of the three amino acids tested. It is unlikely that binding observed in these experiments was the result of nonspecific protein adhesion since the reaction mixture contained relatively large quantities of bovine serum albumin.Table IThe three amino acid residues that, in the indicated position, most efficiently promoted pentapeptide binding to125I-Aβ1–40Positiond-Amino acidO-1y l wO-2y f wO-3l m rO-4l m rO-5l m r Open table in a new tab From the 39 125I-LBMP1620 binding peptides showed in Fig. 4, yfllr and lflrr were selected for further studies. The reason for selecting these peptides was that they contain one or two d-arginine residues, thus making them more hydrophilic and water-soluble than other binding peptides. We also selected a non-binding peptide with the sequence yyrrl as control. The peptides were incubated with synthetic Aβ1–40 at equimolar concentrations (100 μm) as described (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). When Aβ1–40 was incubated alone, a dense network of amyloid fibrils with a diameter of about 6–8 nm and undefined lengths was formed (Fig.5 A). The addition of the non-binding control peptide yyrrl had no effect on the polymerization of Aβ1–40 (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, lflrr markedly reduced the amount of polymers produced and instead of elongated fibrils short rodlike structures were formed (Fig.5 C). The putative toxicity of these structures has not been studied. However, it has been shown that it is the fibrillar form, not the amorphous form, of aggregated Aβ that mediates neurotoxicity (21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). A less distinct effect was obtained with yfllr under these conditions, and a mixture of elongated fibrils and diffuse aggregates appeared (Fig. 5 D). When the d-pentapeptides were incubated alone no detectable polymers or aggregates were formed (not shown), in partial contrast to the previously studied KLVFF-containing peptide ligand made up of l-amino acids (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, a lower concentration of Aβ1–40 (5 μm) was incubated with a 10-fold excess of the d-pentapeptides (50 μm). In this case, Aβ1–40 alone gave rise to fibrils with a similar width but shorter length than described above. Both lflrr and yflrr almost completely blocked the formation of fibrils, whereas yyrrl again had no effect (not shown). No differences between samples predissolved in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol and samples dissolved directly in TBS were detected. The present method is designed to assay the inhibition of amyloid fibril formation, and hence we cannot exclude the possibility that small, potentially toxic, aggregates are being formed in the presence of ligands. However, preliminary results from fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies indicate that LBMP1620 dissolves preformed soluble Aβ aggregates completely. 2L. O. Tjernberg, A. Pramanik, J. Thyberg, R. Rigler, L. Terenius, and C. Nordstedt, manuscript in preparation. Our previous data indicated that the KLVFF (Aβ16–20) sequence was critical for Aβ fibril formation. However, it was not clear whether fibril formation involved interaction between homologous sequences or not. Here, we have used LBMP1620 as the labeled probe for screening defined sequences in Aβ1–40, ranging from tripeptides to decapeptides, and thereby identified the sequence that KLVFF-containing ligands bind to within the Aβ1–40 molecule. The identified binding site docking to KLVFF was then subjected to molecular modeling. Our next aim was to use the acquired data to search for a protease-stable inhibitor of Aβ fibril formation. Random combinatorial pentapeptide libraries made up from d-amino acids, and consequently protease-stable, were probed with labeled LBMP1620. The three d-amino acids most efficiently promoting binding in each position were selected, and out of these all 243 possible pentapeptides were synthesized and assayed for LBMP1620 binding. Two of the binding peptides and one non-binding peptide were synthesized on a larger scale, and their capacity of inhibiting Aβ fibril formation in solution was tested. The first experiments conclusively showed that the KLVFF-containing ligand binds to the homologous sequence in Aβ (Fig. 1). The data obtained in binding studies were used in computer simulations of docking between KLVFF and Aβ13–23. An anti-parallel arrangement was shown in the minimum energy conformation. Residues Lys and Leu in KLVFF interact with the Phe (Aβ20) in the homologous sequence in Aβ13–23, thereby stabilizing the formation of a β-sheet structure (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with previous experimental data showing that the substitution of Lys, Leu, and the COOH-terminal Phe in KLVFF with Ala leads to loss of binding capacity (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Since the first experiment revealed that LBMP1620 binding requires a sequence of at least five amino acids, we chose to use a combinatorial library consisting of pentamers of d-amino acids. By using a short peptide capable of binding to a region critical for polymerization of Aβ (i.e. LBMP1620), the risk of identifying d-pentapeptides binding to non-relevant regions of Aβ1–40 (i.e. NH2- and COOH-terminal to Aβ16–20) was minimized. Of the 243 pentapeptides synthesized from the most efficiently binding amino acids (Table I), 39 were found to bind 125I-LBMP1620. The composition of these binding peptides indicates that hydrophobic interactions are necessary for binding (Fig. 4). Although r can be found in position 4 or 5, l is more frequent in these positions. Positions 2 and 3 were most critical for binding, being l and f, respectively, in most of the binding peptides. In position 1, l and f were preferred over w. Some of the binding peptides showed similarities with a reversed KLVFF, e.g. yfllr (Fig. 4), indicating the formation of a parallel β-sheet (KLVFF forming an anti-parallel β-sheet according to molecular modeling). However, the positions critical for binding to LBMP1620, 2 (f) and 3 (l), would then correspond to non-critical residues in KLVFF. Molecular modeling of thed-amino acid ligands docking to KLVFF might reveal the nature of this interaction. An interesting question is how Aβ-ligands, such as those described here, affect the physiological and pathological properties of aggregated and non-aggregated Aβ-peptide. It is well known that aggregated full-length and truncated variants of the Aβ-peptide are toxic to several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types (30Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Moreover, substances capable of inhibiting the polymerization have been shown to prevent Aβ-associated toxicity (21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 22Tomiyama T. Asano S. Suwa Y. Morita T. Kataoka K. Mori H. Endo N. Biochem. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29525-29528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which points to the fact that the higher order structure is important for the toxicity of these peptides. An Aβ-ligand has to meet several important criteria to be a useful inhibitor of fibril formation in vivo. These include acceptable bioavailability, pharmacokinetics allowing passage of the blood-brain barrier, access to the desired site of action, and low toxicity. The present d-ligands are resistant to proteolysis and should therefore have acceptable bioavailability. Those that were studied functionally were chosen because of their relatively high hydrophilicity. Ligands to be used in vivo should probably be more hydrophobic because this increases the probability that they will pass the blood-brain barrier (31Benet L.Z. Kroetz D.L. Sheiner L.B. Hardman J.G. Limbird E.L. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 3-27Google Scholar). Several of the 39d-ligands presented in Fig. 4 have a high content of hydrophobic residues and hence should have properties allowing them to pass the blood-brain barrier. At present, there is no information regarding the toxicity of these compounds. On balance, several of thed-ligands are potentially useful for testing the hypothesis that Aβ-amyloidogenesis in vivo may be inhibited by ligands binding to the KLVFF motif. A fragment of the Aβ-peptide corresponding to amino acids 25–35 undergoes polymerization and has neurotoxic properties (30Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 32Pike C.J. Walencewicz-Wasserman A.J. Kosmoski J. Cribbs D.H. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In these and our previous studies (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), we have not been able to identify ligands capable of binding efficiently to this region of the peptide. There are several possibilities for this failure. (i) A ligand efficiently binding to this region has to be larger than the penta- to decapeptides tested here and previously (19Tjernberg L.O. Näslund J. Lindqvist F. Johansson J. Karlström A.R. Thyberg J. Terenius L. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar); (ii) the covalent linkage of ligands to a matrix via their COOH termini may prevent the adoption of the conformation necessary for interaction with (i.e.binding to) amino acids 25–35; and (iii) the polymerization of the hydrophobic 25–35 segment is not directly related to the polymerization of full-length Aβ-peptide. The overall conclusion from these studies is that not only the KLVFF peptide (Aβ16–20) but also structurally different peptides consisting of non-natural amino acids have the capability of binding Aβ and preventing its assembly into amyloid fibrils. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that pharmacologically useful organic non-peptide molecules with similar functional properties as the present ligands can be synthesized."

NCC27 is a novel chloride ion channel protein that was found to localize principally to the cell nucleus.

NCC27 therefore represents the first human member of a new class of organellar chloride ion channel proteins. Whereas ion channels have been found on the membranes of various intracellular organelles, it has only been recently that patch clamping studies have suggested their existence at the nuclear membrane. The nuclear pore complexes have been considered the site of communication and exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm (1Goldberg M.W. Allen T.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Miller M. Park M.K. Hanover J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 909-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Studies of traffic across the nuclear envelope have in general conformed to the paradigm that ions and small metabolites with diameters of less than 3–4 nm passively diffuse across the nuclear envelope (3Stochaj U. Silver P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concept of nuclear membrane ion channels seems at variance with the generally accepted views of the nuclear envelope, with their function at this location seeming redundant. However, this does not appear to be the case. The first demonstration of ionic conductances in the nuclear membrane were in mouse zygote pronuclei (4Mazzanti M. DeFelice L.J. Cohen J. Malter H. Nature. 1990; 343: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Further evidence then followed with the demonstration of ion-selective channels in avian erythrocytes (5Matzke A.J.M. Weiger T.M. Matzke M.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in mouse oocyte germinal vesicles, in nuclei from two-cell embryos and liver (6Mazzanti M. DeFelice L.J. Smith E.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in the nuclei of cardiac myocytes (7Bustamante J.O. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and in rat hepatocyte nuclei (8Tabares L. Mazzanti M. Clapham D.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 123: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mak and Foskett (9Mak D-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

Similarly, Pasyk and Foskett (10Pasyk E.A. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

More recently, following fractionation and reconstitution of inner and outer nuclear membrane fractions into lipid bilayers, Rousseau et al. (11Rousseau E. Michaud C. Lefebvre D. Proteau S. Decrouy A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 703-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have shown the presence of two types of chloride channels. The use of calcium ion imaging techniques has also demonstrated variations in calcium ion concentrations between the nucleus and cytoplasm, again suggesting a selective uptake or retention of these ions by the nucleus (12Przywara D.A. Bhave S.V. Bhave A. Wakade T.D. Wakade A.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Birch B.D. Eng D.L. Kocsis J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). With growing electrophysiological data for the existence of nuclear ion channels, it is clear that the cloning and isolation of these proteins will greatly assist in determining their structure and function. This paper describes the molecular cloning and characterization of what we believe to be the first chloride ion channel protein of the nuclear membrane and only the second cloned ion channel found at this location. As part of a project investigating gene expression in “activated” monocytoid cells, a subtracted cDNA library designed to enrich for activation-associated genes was prepared using U937 cells. U937 cells were used to generate the cDNA library, since they are a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line with monoblastic characteristics that can undergo in vitro differentiation into a cell with monocyte-like characteristics (14Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Exposure of U937 cells to various factors including all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) or interferon-γ, can induce this change.These differentiated cells can be activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), much like normal monocytes. Screening of the subtracted cDNA library for genes associated with activation resulted in the isolation of clone 4, which was found to code for a novel 241-amino acid protein, designated nuclear chloride channel-27 (NCC27). It is homologous to a cDNA clone, BOVCCP64A (GenBankTM accession number L16547), which codes for a bovine chloride channel protein, p64, believed to localize to internal organelles (15Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCC27 is a novel chloride channel protein that localizes principally to the nucleus of all cells studied. Patch clamp studies of CHO-K1 cells transfected with NCC27 revealed an increased level of chloride ion channel activity at their nuclear membrane. NCC27 was found to be widely expressed in various cells and cell lines, and its gene expression was regulated by activation stimuli. A subtraction library was constructed using U937-derived mRNA. The driver cDNA library (U937-RA) was synthesized from U937 differentiated with 1 μm RA for 3 days, and the tester cDNA library (U937-RP) was synthesized from U937 cells treated for 3 days with 1 μm RA, followed by 160 nm PMA activation for 3 h. The cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the λZAP II vector (Stratagene) using the ZAP-cDNA Gigapak II Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene). Each library was then converted to pBluescript SK− plasmid (Stratagene) using the autoexcision feature of λZAP II. Single-stranded DNA from the two libraries was used to prepare the subtraction library using the Subtractor kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clone 4 was fully sequenced bidirectionally by the dideoxy method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence similarity searches of GenBankTM, EMBL, and SwissProt data bases were performed with the FASTA (17Pearson W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar) and BLITZ (18Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Google Scholar) programs. Predictions of the protein's secondary structure were performed using the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) (window size was 10 residues). The following cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD). Cell culture materials were obtained from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Australia), unless otherwise indicated. U937, RAW 264.7, K562, U266B1, and HUT 78 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media, supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. HL-60, KG-1, Raji, and Daudi cells were maintained in the same media except with a final concentration of 20% FCS, while THP-1 cells had (2 × 10−5m) 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck) added. CCD-34LU cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Australia) containing 5% FCS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were a gift from Mr. T. Magoulis (CFI, Australia). Monocytes and lymphocytes were obtained from buffy coat leukocyte concentrates from normal human donors by centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Australia). Monocytes were isolated by adherence and cultured in a modified serum-free medium according to the method of Bennett et al. (20Bennett S. Por S.B. Stanley E.R. Breit S.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 153: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Bennett S. Por S.B. Cooley M.A. Breit S.N. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2364-2371PubMed Google Scholar). Serum-free medium consisted of Iscove's modification of Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4 mml-glutamine, 2 mg/ml FCS, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma), soy bean lecithin (0.1 mg/ml) (ICN Biomedicals), insulin (5 mg/ml)(Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), and transferrin (5 mg/ml) (Boehringer Mannheim). Lymphocytes were isolated as the nonadherent cell population, removed from the adherent macrophages, and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 1% (v/v) FCS, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES. For recombinant interferon-γ stimulation, 1000 units/ml was added to the culture medium for a specified length of time. Recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) (50 units/ml) and IL-4 (100 units/ml) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. RA was used at a final concentration of 10−6m, PMA at 160 nm final concentration, and lipopolysaccharide at 10 μg/ml for a specified length of time. All were purchased from Sigma. All RNA samples were prepared by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated on a formaldehyde/agarose denaturing gel, in 1 × MOPS buffer and then transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham) and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. RNA ladder (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as a molecular size marker. Membranes were then probed with a cDNA insert from clone 4, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime Labeling kit (Amersham) or with a 28 S oligonucleotide (TCCGTCCGTCGTCCTCCTC) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization was overnight at 65 °C (37 °C for the 28 S oligo probe), with the final wash in 0.1% SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 5 min (1% SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 5 min for the 28 S oligo probe). Blots were exposed using XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with Cronex Lightening Plus intensifying screens (Dupont) at −70 °C. The recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein (GST-NCC27) was expressed and purified using pGEX-4T-1 vector system (AMRAD-Pharmacia, Australia) and the Escherichia coli strain HB101, following the manufacturer's protocol. The open reading frame of clone 4 was PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides incorporating restriction enzyme sites to allow for directional cloning: sense primer, TCCCCGACGGATCCATGGCT; antisense primer, CCCAGCGGCCGCTTATTTGA. The DNA was restriction enzyme-digested and then cloned in frame into theHindIII/NotI site of pGEX-4T-1. The isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced recombinant protein (rNCC27) was purified from the bacterial homogenate on glutathione S-Sepharose (AMRAD-Pharmacia). The fusion protein was at this stage either eluted from the column with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) or cleaved from GST while still bound to the column using biotin-labeled thrombin (Novagen), which was then removed by the streptavidin-agarose affinity matrix (Novagen). Purified recombinant fusion protein GST-NCC27 was used to immunize rabbits for the production of polyclonal antibodies (Institute of Medical & Veterinary Science, South Australia). Preimmune and test bleed sera, were screened by immunofluorescent staining of nontransfected and clone 4-transfected CHO-K1. Eukaryotic expression of NCC27 was performed by directionally cloning the coding region of the clone 4 construct described above into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) at the HindIII/NotI sites. A second construct (clone4FLAG) was also cloned into pRc/CMV vector, which incorporated the sequence for the 8-amino acid FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) at the carboxyl terminus of the recombinant protein NCC27. The insert-containing pRc/CMV constructs were then transfected into monolayers of CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells (80% confluent) were transfected for 24 h in 35-mm2 dishes using 9 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μg of DNA, as recommended by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants were selected with 1000 μg/ml G418 (Boehringer Mannheim). Subclones were isolated and then screened by immunofluorescent staining using anti-m2 (anti-FLAG) monoclonal antibody (IBI) and anti-NCC27 polyclonal antisera. Cells were seeded onto 8-well glass chamber slides (NUNC) one day prior to staining, washed twice with PBS, and either fixed and permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature in PBS containing 3.5% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for internal cell staining or fixed with 4% paraformaldehye for 30 min for surface staining. The cells were stained with primary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Antibodies used were anti-FLAG antibody (1:1000 dilution), control class-matched monoclonal antibody, anti-CD4 (OKT4 (550 mg/ml), a gift from Dr. Margaret Cooley (CFI, Australia) (1:50)), anti-NCC27 rabbit polyclonal antisera (1:1000), and control preimmune rabbit sera (1:1000). A further control of anti-NCC27 polyclonal antibody (1:2000), which had been preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μg of purified rNCC27 protein, was also included. Following the reaction with primary antibody, the cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with secondary sheep anti-mouse or sheep anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Silenus Laboratories, Australia) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were then mounted and viewed using UV fluorescence microscopy, with excitation at 488 nm and by confocal microscopy using a Sarastro 2000 CLSM (Molecular Dynamics), with a plan apochromat × 60/1.40 NA oil immersion lens and an argon-ion class II laser. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed by standard techniques (23Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1988, Wiley Interscience, New York.Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized on ice for 15 min, in 1 × lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 3.7% (w/v) EDTA) including leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min. 6 × SDS sample buffer (0.35 mTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10.28% (w/v) SDS, 36% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.012% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was then added to protein from 1 × 105 cells and loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Australia). This was followed by tank electrotransfer of the samples to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Western blots were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C (or overnight at 4 °C) with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS and then probed for 30 min at room temperature using either anti-NCC27 (1:2000) or anti-FLAG antibody (IBI) (1:1500). Control antibodies were anti-GST polyclonal (1:5000) (AMRAD-Pharmacia) and preimmune rabbit sera (1:2000). After washing, secondary biotin-labeled anti-mouse Ig or anti-rabbit Ig polyclonal antibodies were applied (1:2000) (Amersham) for 30 min at room temperature, after which time blots were again washed. This was followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (1:2000) (Amersham). After final washing, the staining was visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposure of the blots to XAR-5 x-ray film (Kodak). This was performed essentially as outlined by Ausubel et al. (23Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1988, Wiley Interscience, New York.Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–10 μg of each protein sample was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mg/ml CNBr (Pierce) in 70% formic acid. A second sample of each protein was dissolved in 100 μl of 70% formic acid without CNBr. Samples were incubated for 48 h at room temperature, after which time they were lyophilized. 1 × SDS sample buffer was then added, and Western blot analysis was undertaken as previously indicated. A modification of the method described by Ausubel et al. (23Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1988, Wiley Interscience, New York.Google Scholar) was used to isolate nuclei. Confluent CHO-K1 cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were then detached with 0.02% EDTA and washed with PBS once more. All solutions used from this point contained leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (all at 2 μg/ml), and Pefabloc (0.5 mm) (all from Boehringer Mannheim). The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of ice cold hypotonic buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH7.4) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 3 times its own volume of hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min to allow the cells to swell. The swollen cells were disrupted with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and a crude nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate for 2 min at 800 × g. The nuclei were purified using Optiprep iso-osmotic density medium (Nycomed, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization solution (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8), combined with 1 ml of solution C (50% (w/v) Optiprep, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.8). For centrifugation, 2 ml of the nuclear suspension were underlaid with 2 ml of 30% Optiprep, followed by 1 ml of 35% Optiprep. The sample was centrifuged for 40 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the nuclei were collected at the 25–30% interface. The nuclear suspension was diluted 4-fold in hypotonic buffer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min to remove the remaining Optiprep. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer and freeze-thawed three times, and the insoluble material was washed three times. The insoluble nuclear fraction was resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 1 unit of DNase I and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The insoluble nuclear fraction was solubilized in nonreducing SDS electrophoresis sample buffer and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal anti-NCC27 antibody as described above. Nuclei were isolated based on the method of Wotton et al. (24Wotton D. Flanagan B.F. Owen M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent CHO-K1 were detached with 0.02% EDTA and then washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and lysed on ice with 2.0% Nonidet P-40. Following lysis, the nuclei were centrifuged through a 30% sucrose cushion at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was then gently resuspended in intracellular solution (140 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH). Integrity of the nuclei was checked by staining with toluidine blue and trypan blue and viewed by phase contrast microscopy. The nuclei were then placed into 35-mm2 dishes for electrophysiological study. Single ion channel activity in isolated nuclei from CHO-K1 were recorded using a “nucleus-attached” configuration at room temperature (23 °C) (4Mazzanti M. DeFelice L.J. Cohen J. Malter H. Nature. 1990; 343: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,25Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). In other experiments, whole-cell and single-channel currents were recorded from the plasma membrane of intact CHO-K1 (26Martin D.K. Bootcov M.R. Campbell T.J. French P.W. Breit S.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 147: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes with a tip opening of between 0.9 and 1.5 μm (27Martin D.K. Cook D.I. Pflugers Arch. 1990; 417: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and impedence of 3–7 megaohms were fabricated from thin walled borosilicate glass (Vitrex Microhematocrit Tubes, Denmark). The reference electrode was connected to the superfusing bath with a KCl salt bridge for experiments in which the Cl− was either reduced in concentration or substituted by a different anion. The channel currents were amplified and filtered at 1 kHz (−3 db point) using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) and sampled on line by a microcomputer (IBM 486 compatible) using commercial software and associated A/D hardware (pClamp 6.0/Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments Inc. and Scientific Solutions Inc.). Single-channel open probability was determined from steady-state recordings of 2-min duration, with the nucleus clamped at the resting membrane potential, and quantified as follows, Po=1M∑m­1mM·PmEquation 1 where P o represents single-channel open probability, M is the apparent number of channels in the patch, m is each channel in the range 1 to M, andP m is the open probability associated with the mth channel in the patch. The apparent number of channels in each patch was determined as the number of discrete levels of current observed in the patch clamp recordings. The values for P m were obtained as the area under the curve for gaussian curves fitted to each of the channel peaks in amplitude histograms constructed for each patch (28Martin D.K. Nakaya Y. Wyse K.R. Campbell T.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All data are presented as the mean ± S.E., with the number of different cells used to obtain the recordings indicated in parentheses (see “Results”). The solution used for superfusion of the intact CHO-K1 contained 130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, 12.5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, bovine albumin (0.5 mg/ml, fraction V, Sigma), pH 7.4, with NaOH. The solution used for superfusion of the isolated nuclei contained 140 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH. The same solution was used to fill the recording pipette for both the “nucleus-attached” and whole-cell recordings. In separate experiments using the whole-cell configuration and clone 4-transfected CHO-K1 cells to detemine the permeability of the channels to different anions, the chloride in the superfusing solution was substituted for nitrate, isothiocyanate, iodide, acetate, bicarbonate, sulfate, or fluoride. The permeability ratio of the anion (X −) relative to Cl−(Px/PCl) was calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation from the resultant shift in reversal potential of the I/V curves. A 1223-base pair cDNA clone (clone 4), was isolated from the U937 subtracted cDNA library, and comparison of its DNA sequence to the GenBankTM and EMBL data bases revealed significant homology to a bovine chloride channel clone, BOVCCP64A (15Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of 1561 base pairs in size (full-length cDNA, 6160 nucleotides). The longest open reading frame of clone 4 extends from nucleotide 219 to 944 (Fig.1 A). The initiation codon is flanked by sequences that concur with the consensus sequence for the initiation of translation (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Northern blots of total RNA from various cells and cell lines were probed using the complete clone 4 insert. This resulted in the detection of two mRNA species of approximately 1.2 and 1.0 kb. In the monocytoid cell line U937, clone 4 mRNA is up-regulated by PMA after 24–48 h, with a disproportionate increase in expression of the 1.2-kb band compared with the 1.0-kb band. This response could be further enhanced by pre-exposure of the cells to RA (Fig. 2 A). This response appears to be PMA-specific, since lipopolysaccharide had no noticeable effect (data not shown). Similarly, pretreatment of human culture-derived macrophages with interferon-γ for 9 h followed by IL-2 for 3 h, up-regulates the 1.2-kb band with no detectable 1.0-kb band expression (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether the two mRNA transcripts represented two closely related genes or alternate products of the same gene, Northern blots of total RNA from U937 cells were probed separately with the three EcoRI restriction digest-generated fragments from clone 4 (Fig. 1 A). All three fragments were found to hybridize to both mRNA transcripts. The Northern blots were then probed with two shorter fragments generated by PCR, which represent the 5′- (primers T3.4 and T7.6) (Fig. 1 A) and 3′- (primers T3.5 and T7.7) (Fig. 1 A) untranslated sequences of clone 4. It was found that only the 3′ probe detected both mRNA species, while the 5′ probe only detected the 1.2-kb species. It was therefore inferred that the two mRNA transcripts varied in at least the first 120 base pairs of the longer species. This would suggest that the two transcripts are due either to alternate transcription start sites or alternate transcripts. Clone 4 mRNA was found to be expressed in all of the following cells and cell lines, including the monocytoid cell lines U937, HL-60, THP-1, and KG-1, the mouse monocyte cell line RAW264.7, peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes, the B cell lines Daudi, Raji, and U266B1, and the T cell line HUT 78 as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the fibroblast cell line CCD-34LU, and K562 cells (results not shown). The longest open reading frame of clone 4 codes for a polypeptide of 241 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 26,900 Da and pI of 4.85. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of NCC27 with the available protein data bases NBRF and SwissProt again confirmed its close homology to the bovine chloride channel protein p64, with scores of 57% identity and 72% similarity. The 241 amino acids of NCC27 align with p64 at positions 194–437, which represent the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein p64 (Fig.1 B). Extensive searches and multiple alignment comparisons of these two protein sequences to other ion channel proteins revealed no similarities. Hydrophobicity analysis (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) shows two strongly hydrophobic regions that are long enough to represent transmembrane domains, from amino acids 21–39 and 170–189 (Fig. 1 A). Comparison of the hydrophobicity plots for NCC27 with p64 reveals a similar pattern of hydrophobic domains, with the two longest regions found at the same relative position in both proteins (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, analysis of NCC27 for possible motifs revealed two putative nuclear localization sequences, KRR and KKYR, at positions 49–51 and 192–195, respectively (Fig. 1 A). There is one putativeN-glycosylation site at asparagine 42, one cAMP phosphorylation site at threonine residue 49, five possible casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, four putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at serines 27 and 163 and threonines 48 and 77, and five possible N-myristoylation sites. To localize NCC27, CHO-K1 cells transfected with clone 4, the clone4FLAG construct, or the vector alone were stained using anti-FLAG. The antibody showed bright staining of the clone4FLAG-transfected cells, while there was no visible staining in the other two transfectants (Fig. 3). The antibody staining was brightest throughout the nucleus, including the nuclear membrane, with a small amount of staining also apparent in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3).

https://openalex.org/W1963676888,"The heme oxygenase (HO) system degrades heme to biliverdin and CO and releases chelated iron. In the primary sequence of the constitutive form, HO-2, there are three potential heme binding sites: two heme regulatory motifs (HRMs) with the absolutely conserved Cys-Pro pair, and a conserved 24-residue heme catalytic pocket with a histidine residue, His151 in rat HO-2. The visible and pyridine hemochromogen spectra suggest that the Escherichia coli expressed purified HO-2 is a hemoprotein. The absorption spectrum, heme fluorescence quenching, and heme titration analysis of the wild-type protein versus those of purified double cysteine mutant (Cys264/Cys281 --> Ala/Ala) suggest a role of the HRMs in heme binding. While the His151 --> Ala mutation inactivates HO-2, Cys264 --> Ala and Cys281 --> Ala mutations individually or together (HO-2 mut) do not decrease HO activity. Also, Pro265 --> Ala or Pro282 --> Ala mutation does not alter HO-2 activity. Northern blot analysis of ptk cells indicates that HO-2 mRNA is not regulated by heme. The findings, together with other salient features of HO-2 and the ability of heme-protein complexes to generate oxygen radicals, are consistent with HO-2, like five other HRM-containing proteins, having a regulatory function in the cell."

These ES cells also failed to differentiate into mature erythroid cells in vitro (10Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 12Pevny L. Lin C-S. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Constantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that GATA-1 is required for the erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, previous attempts failed to produce germ line transmission of the GATA-1-null allele. Thus, the in vivo role of GATA-1 in erythropoiesis remains to be resolved. In this study, we enfeebled the GATA-1 gene through a disruption of its hematopoietic promoter in ES cells and generated germ line chimeras to directly address the in vivo effects of the targeted mutation. Our results demonstrate that GATA-1 is required for the terminal differentiation of primitive erythroid cells in vivo, and this work reveals for the first time the consequence of GATA-1 function in primitive erythroid progenitors during development. Genomic clones of the GATA-1 locus were isolated from a mouse 129 SVJ λFix II library (Stratagene). A 5.1-kilobase 5′-fragment and 2.7-kilobase 3′-fragment, which contains the erythroid-specific first exon (IE exon), were cloned into a vector containing a neomycin-resistance gene (neo) cassette to generate the targeting construct. The resultant construct was linearized withHindIII and electroporated into E14 cells as described (13Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Clones were selected in G418 (300 μg/ml), expanded, and analyzed by PCR. Homologous recombination was observed at a frequency of ∼1/10 G418-resistant clones. Chimeras were generated by injection of C57 BL/6 blastocysts as described previously. Pups and embryos were genotyped by PCR and/or Southern blotting analyses. We determined the sex of these embryos by using PCR amplification of Y chromosome-specificzfy-1 gene (14Koopman P. Gubbay J. Vivian N. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1991; 351: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). RNA from 9.5 days post coitus (dpc) embryos was isolated by single-step RNA extraction system (RNAzol, Tel-Test). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h, and 1 μl of this 20-μl reaction mixture was used in PCR reactions. Reaction products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Sequences of the primers used and the expected sizes of PCR products are as follows: for erythroid-specific GATA-1, 5′-TAAGGTGGCTGAATCCTCTGCATC and 3′-CCGTCTTCAAGGTGTCCAAGAACGT (expected product 483 bp); and for testis-specific GATA-1, 5′-CGTGAAGCGAGACCATCGTC and the 3′-primer used for the erythroid-specific primer set (expected product 529 bp). Primers for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were synthesized as described previously (expected product 162 bp; Ref. 15Boehm T. Spillantini M.-G. Sofroniew M.V. Surani M.A. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 695-703PubMed Google Scholar). Newborn mice were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Embryos were fixed after being dissected free of maternal tissues. β-Galactosidase (LacZ) activity was detected as described previously (16Byrne C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3176-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining, embryos were photographed before embedding in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical) and freezing. Cryosections were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-murine embryonic hemoglobin sera (17Miwa Y. Atumi T. Imai N. Ikawa Y. Development. 1991; 111: 543-549PubMed Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. Tadao Atsumi. Fetal liver cells were inoculated into a methyl cellulose culture in the presence of erythropoietin (2 units/ml) (18Okuyama R. Koguma M. Yanai N. Obinata M. Blood. 1995; 86: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 days, the number of colonies formed were counted, colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E). Cells were also assayed for the ability to form granulocyte colonies, colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) in a semi-solid culture supplemented with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-6. We prepared a positive/negative selection targeting vector to introduce a neo cassette into the intergenic region between an important regulatory region of the erythroid promoter and the mRNA cap site. GATA factor binding sites located approximately 620 bp 5′ to the IE exon (Fig.1 A) have been shown to positively regulate transcription from the IE promoter (19Tsai S.F. Strauss E. Orkin S.H. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The insertion of neo was designed to separate the GATA motifs from the IE exon in the hope that the mutation would negatively affect the activity of the IE promoter. In addition, the positive/negative selection targeting vector was designed to transcribe neo in the same orientation as the GATA-1 gene so that the strong promoter directing neo expression might further weaken the activity of the IE promoter through competition (20Kim C.G. Epner E. Forrester W.C. Groudine M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Choi O-R.B. Engel J.D. Cell. 1988; 55: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our expectation is that the activity of the IE promoter will be diminished by the combinatorial effects of these two mechanisms, resulting in a specific ‘knock-down’ (rather than a ‘knock-out‘) of the erythroid-specific expression of the GATA-1 gene, and possibly lead to a germ line-transmissible targeted mutation. This targeting construct was introduced by electroporation into ES cells, and 20 independent G418-resistant, PCR-positive clones were identified. Southern blot analysis using internal gene-specific and neo probes confirmed the homologous recombination events (Fig. 1,B and C). Three mutant ES cell lines were used for the generation of chimeric offspring. All the ES cell lines gave rise to chimeras. We crossed these chimeras with normal Balb/c mice and one line (No. 78) gave stable germ line transmission. All F1 generation mice from the chimera mouse were found to be of ES cell origin, and the number of litters and sex ratio were in normal range. F1 progeny were examined by Southern blot and PCR analyses to confirm the presence of the mutated GATA-1 allele. Since the GATA-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, all heterozygous F1 pups were female. These heterozygotes were found to display varying degrees of anemia. Fig.2 A shows GATA-1 heterozygous embryos; their appearance ranges from normal (left) to severely anemic (right). Concordantly, when we analyzed the livers of two heterozygous newborn littermates (panel B), we found that one liver contained a normal number of hematopoietic cells (left), whereas the other displayed a marked reduction in the number of hematopoietic cells (right). These observations indicated that disruption of the GATA-1 gene erythroid promoter seems to cause severe anemia in vivo and that the effect of the knock-down strategy was as anticipated. The heterogeneity of the phenotypes observed in the female heterozygotes may be the result of selective inactivation of the X chromosome (22Lyon M.F. Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). The heterozygous females were mated with wild-type males to observe the phenotypic effects on mutant males. Surprisingly, no mutant males were observed among the live offspring, and heterozygous female offspring displayed the same varying degrees of anemia that we observed among the F1s. To determine the nature and timing of the presumptive embryonic lethality of the targeted males, we collected and genotyped embryos ranging from 8.5 to 14.5 dpc. A total of 112 pups from 13 litters were analyzed. At 9.5 dpc, mutant male embryos were present in the expected ratio, but already visible defects could be discerned. The yolk sacs of mutant males were noticeably pale and almost no blood vessels were present (Fig.3 A, right). The mutant males (Fig.3 B, right) could be easily distinguished from wild-type (left) or heterozygous female embryos (data not shown) by their distinctive pallor and small size. Embryonic lethality was first detected at 11.5 dpc, and no live mutant male embryos were found by 12.5 dpc. The expression levels of erythroid-specific GATA-1 mRNA were analyzed by RT-PCR using RNA samples obtained from 9.5-dpc embryos. Densitometric analysis of the RT-PCR data revealed that the expression of GATA-1 from the IE promoter in the mutant male embryos was less than 5% of the level present in wild-type embryos (Fig.4 A), therefore we will refer to this targeted mutation as the GATA-1.05 mutant allele. These data show that the expression of the GATA-1 gene from the IE promoter is severely impaired, but not extinguished, by the promoter disruption. The phenotype and timing of death in the male mutant embryos led us to conclude that the cause of in utero lethality is due to impaired primitive erythropoiesis. We also analyzed the expression of GATA-1 from the testis-specific promoter (IT promoter) in these embryos. The expression of testis-type GATA-1 mRNA in the mutant embryos was almost identical as that seen in the wild-type embryos (Fig. 4 B), indicating that activity of the testis promoter was left intact in our knock-down mice. We examined the hematopoietic phenotype in the livers of mutant male embryos. Morphological examination revealed that size of the liver rudiments of mutant male embryos was markedly reduced and that the color was pale in comparison to the livers of wild-type embryos (data not shown). Microscopic analysis revealed that, whereas many erythroid cells should be present in the liver rudiment at 11.5 dpc, virtually none could be detected in the livers of mutant embryos (compare Fig. 5, panels A and B). This seems to reflect the absence of yolk sac hematopoiesis. GATA-1-positive cells were also absent in liver sections from 11.5-dpc GATA-1.05 mutant male (compare panels C andD). We also performed in vitro colony assays with these same fetal liver cells. In comparison with wild-type littermates, the GATA-1.05 male mutant livers did not generate any CFU-E at 10.5 dpc (data not shown), and only a small number of CFU-E were recovered at 11.5 dpc (Table I). In contrast, fetal liver cells from either wild-type or mutant embryos produced similar numbers of CFU-GM colonies (Table II). These data indicate that only a small number of erythroid progenitors exist in the liver of the mutant embryos, while the non-erythroid hematopoietic lineages are unaffected by the mutation. The number of CFU-E formed from fetal liver cells of female heterozygous mutants (GATA-1(+/1.05)) accordingly displayed wide variability, again consistent with the hypothesis that the X chromosome is selectively inactivated in hematopoietic progenitor cells.Table IResults of the fetal liver CFU-E assaysGenotypeWild type+/− female−/Y maleEmbryo number152,600 ± 1,350256,200 ± 1,810349,120 ± 6,35042,590 ± 1685110,370 ± 611633,410 ± 767718,500 ± 180888,760 ± 3,2769109,120 ± 1,2101034,020 ± 2,814111,360 ± 1641269,750 ± 3,7261359,044 ± 4,3031472,027 ± 5,8191511,175 ± 892The numbers shown represent the colony number per liver ± S.E. from 11.5 dpc embryos.

Assays were performed in triplicate. Colonies were counted 6 days after plating. To investigate how primitive hematopoiesis is affected by the lack of GATA-1, we took advantage of a GATA-1 promoter-LacZ transgene, which is transcriptionally active in primitive but not definitive erythroid cells, to specifically mark the primitive erythroid lineage (23Onodera, K., Takahashi, S., Nishimura, S., Ohta, J., Motohashi, H., Yomogida, K., Hayashi, N., Engel, J. D., and Yamamoto, M. (1997)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press.Google Scholar). Female mice heterozygous for the GATA-1.05 mutation were crossed with transgenic mice homozygous for the LacZ reporter transgene to generate LacZ-positive embryos harboring the GATA-1.05 mutation (compound mutation designated GATA-1.05::LacZ). In 8.0-dpc embryos examined by whole mount X-gal staining, no significant difference in either the abundance or distribution of stained erythroid cells was observed between GATA-1.05::LacZ mutant embryos and LacZ-only littermates (data not shown). By 9.5 dpc, however, the number of blue cells detected in the GATA-1.05::LacZ embryos was far greater than that seen in littermates carrying only the reporter transgene (compare panels A and B, Fig. 6). Detailed examination revealed that the absolute number of hematopoietic cells found in the yolk sac, aortic sac, and atrial chamber of the heart was similar in both wild-type and GATA-1.05 mutant embryos. The significant difference was that only a small percent of the hematopoietic cells in the atrial chamber were positive for staining in the LacZ control embryos (panel C), compared with the blue staining seen in virtually all of the hematopoietic cells in the GATA-1.05::LacZ male embryos (panel D). These blue GATA-1-positive cells express only a limited amount, if any, of embryonic hemoglobin as visualized by an embryonic hemoglobin anti-sera. It should be noted that, consistent with the whole mount analysis described above, virtually all hematopoietic cells in the yolk sac blood islands of 8.5-dpc LacZ transgenic mouse embryos were blue regardless of whether they carried the GATA-1.05 or wild-type allele (data not shown), confirming the specific expression of the reporter GATA-1/LacZ transgene in undifferentiated primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Therefore, in the GATA-1.05 mutant background, it seems that primitive hematopoietic progenitors develop to the GATA-1-positive stage but subsequently cannot differentiate into normal hemoglobinized cells. We show here that a modified gene targeting strategy can be successfully employed to dissect the complex roles played by GATA-1in vivo. This strategy consisted of two components. The first is promoter-specific impairment (knock-down) of transcription factor gene activity, and the second is the lineage- and stage-specific marking of the lineage of target cells that specifically require the function of the transcription factor. The combination of these two approaches enabled us to identify the precise stage of maturation arrest within the primitive erythroid lineage that resulted as a direct consequence of the lowered levels of GATA-1. The in vivoapproach described here may be applied to the analysis of any gene of interest with well characterized regulatory regions. We are able to detect the accumulation of primitive erythroid progenitors in the yolk sac of the GATA-1-mutant embryos, demonstrating that GATA-1 is necessary for the differentiation, but not the formation, of primitive erythroid progenitors. These results are especially intriguing and contrast with the conclusions of a previous report (24Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Using in vitro differentiation of GATA-1-null ES cells, Weiss et al. (11Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) failed to detect primitive erythroid precursors, leading them to conclude that GATA-1 is essential at the earliest stage of primitive erythropoiesis definable by then current methods. In contrast, we observed numerous primitive erythroid progenitors in the yolk sacs and atrial chambers of GATA-1.05 mutant embryos, and the erythroid enhancer of GATA-1 seems active in the progenitor cells. Two possibilities could account for this discrepancy. First, it is possible that a cell lacking GATA-1 may be able to survivein vivo but not under in vitro conditions (24Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the residual 5% activity displayed by GATA-1 in the 1.05 mutant allele might be sufficient for cell survival but not for promoting terminal differentiation. We favor the former hypothesis since the knock-down effect on erythropoiesis seems to be clonal, and not uniform, in the erythroid cells (some weakly hemoglobinized cells in the yolk sac of the mutant embryos are routinely detected). In this regard, it should be noted that Fujiwara et al. (25Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1996) 12355–12358Fujiwara, Y., Browne, C. R., Cunniff, K., Goff, S. C., and Orkin, S. H.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1996) 12355–12358.Google Scholar) recently reported the germ line transmission of a GATA-1-null allele. In that study, the second exon of the GATA-1 gene was disrupted in ES cells, as was the method employed in several previous trials (9Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agani V. Orkin S.H. Constantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 10Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat.

D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Constantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus the reasons for the failure to generate germ line chimeras using the original GATA-1-disrupted ES cells prepared for previous studies remains unclear. In agreement with the present analysis, male mice bearing the GATA-1-null allele (i.e. −/Y genotype) died by 11.5 dpc of embryogenesis. The coincidence of the null and knock-down mutant phenotypes suggests that the knock-down strategy resulted, as anticipated, in enfeebling the gene to such an extent that its final activity was very close to that of a null mutation, while analysis of the Sertoli GATA-1 transcript indicates that its synthesis, as also anticipated, is unaffected by the GATA-1.05 mutation. Fujiwaraet al. (25Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1996) 12355–12358Fujiwara, Y., Browne, C. R., Cunniff, K., Goff, S. C., and Orkin, S. H.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1996) 12355–12358.Google Scholar) also found accumulation of embryonic erythroid cells in GATA-1-null embryos and suggested that the inability to detect embryonic erythroid precursors in prior in vitro experiments reflected a limitation of cell culture assays. Finally, they suggested that the accumulated cells in the yolk sac of the null mutant mouse were arrested at the proerythroblast stage based on morphological examination. In contrast, the present study provides direct evidence for the accumulation of primitive erythroid progenitors in the yolk sac blood islands through an intercross experiment performed by breeding the GATA-1.05 mutant allele to a separate line of mice bearing a transgene that specifically marked the primitive erythroid lineage. As additional evidence, we were able to unequivocally identify the arrested cells as primitive erythroid progenitors using both anti-GATA-1 and anti-embryonic hemoglobin antibodies. In addition to the primitive erythroid lineage analysis, preliminary studies on the effect of GATA-1 mutation on fetal liver (definitive) erythropoiesis in vivo are presented here for the first time, and we also found this developmental process to be severely affected by the knock-down mutation. The mutant fetal livers were observed to contain only a small number of CFU-E. Since we detected comparable numbers of CFU-GM in either GATA-1(+) or GATA-1.05 mutant mice, the GATA-1 deficiency appears to specifically promote the growth, or prevent apoptosis, in definitive erythroid progenitors. However, we cannot completely rule out the indirect physiological influence (e.g. through hypoxia) that may result from the lack of primitive erythropoiesis. Gene rescue and/or selective inactivation experiments will be necessary to further refine the specific roles played by GATA-1 in definitive hematopoiesis in vivo. We thank Drs. R.

Using SREBP-2 as a prototype, we here identify the site of sterol-regulated cleavage as the Leu522-Ser523bond in the middle of the 31-residue hydrophilic loop that projects into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. This site was identified through use of a vector encoding an SREBP-2/Ras fusion protein with a triple epitope tag that allowed immunoprecipitation of the cleaved COOH-terminal fragment. The NH2 terminus of this fragment was pinpointed by radiochemical sequencing after replacement of selected codons with methionine codons and labeling the cells with [35S]methionine. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that only two amino acids are necessary for recognition by the sterol-regulated protease: 1) the leucine at the cleavage site (leucine 522), and 2) the arginine at the P4 position (arginine 519). These define a tetrapeptide sequence, RXXL, that is necessary for cleavage. Cleavage was not affected when the second transmembrane helix of SREBP-2 was replaced with the membrane-spanning region of the low density lipoprotein receptor, indicating that this sequence is not required for regulation. Glycosylation-site insertion experiments confirmed that leucine 522 is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that the sterol-regulated protease is a novel enzyme whose active site faces the lumen of the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, or another membrane organelle to which the SREBPs may be transported before cleavage.

Each SREBP is composed of three segments: 1) an NH2-terminal segment of ∼485 amino acids that is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family, 2) a membrane attachment segment of ∼75 amino acids composed of two membrane-spanning sequences separated by a short hydrophilic loop of 31 amino acids, and 3) a COOH-terminal segment of ∼585 amino acids that plays a regulatory role.

The NH2-terminal fragment leaves the membrane with a portion of the first transmembrane sequence still attached. It enters the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes encoding the LDL receptor (5Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The net result is to increase the cell's supply of cholesterol and fatty acids. The Site-1 protease is the target of feedback regulation by cholesterol and other sterols (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). When these sterols accumulate within cells, the rate of proteolysis at Site-1 declines markedly. Cleavage at Site-2 also declines because this cleavage requires prior cleavage at Site-1 (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As a result, the amounts of nuclear SREBPs decline, and transcription of the target genes falls. The net effect is to prevent overaccumulation of cholesterol and fatty acids when intracellular sterol levels are already high. Three isoforms of SREBP are known (5Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and 1c are derived from a single gene through use of alternate promoters that encode alternate first exons (5Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 13Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a is much more active than SREBP-1c in stimulating transcription of all known target genes (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The third protein, SREBP-2, is the product of a separate gene (6Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar,13Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1995; 25: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and it is also more active than SREBP-1c (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In view of the regulatory role of the Site-1 protease, further knowledge of its structure and mode of regulation is desirable. A first step would be the identification of the precise site at which the Site-1 protease cuts SREBPs. In previous studies we have shown that this cleavage is abolished when arginine 519 in the lumenal loop of SREBP-2 (or the corresponding arginine of SREBP-1a) is changed to alanine by in vitro mutagenesis (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The size of the cleavage product, as determined by SDS-PAGE, is consistent with cleavage at or near this arginine (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In the current studies we have used a combination of in vitro mutagenesis, epitope tagging, immunoprecipitation, and radiochemical sequencing to determine the precise location of Site-1 in SREBP-2. We found, surprisingly, that cleavage does not occur at arginine 519, but rather it occurs 3 residues further toward the COOH terminus, namely at leucine 522. Arginine 519 seems to be the NH2-terminal residue in a tetrapeptide sequence, RXXL, that serves as a recognition signal for the Site-1 protease. We obtained HSV-TagTM and T7-TagTM monoclonal antibodies from Novagen; v-H-Ras(Ab-1)-agarose linked monoclonal antibody was obtained from Oncogene. Protein G-SepharoseR 4 Fast Flow beads were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.,l-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN, and glycosidases were obtained from New England Biolabs. pTK-HSV-BP2-Ras-T7 encodes an epitope-tagged SREBP-2/Ras fusion protein (1391 amino acids) consisting of an initiator methionine, two tandem copies of the HSV epitope (QPELAPEDPED), six novel amino acids (IDGTVP) encoded by a sequence that consists of restriction sites for BspDI andKpnI, human SREBP-2 (amino acids 14–1141), two novel amino acids (HM) encoded by the sequence for restriction siteNdeI, human H-Ras (amino acids 2–189), and three tandem copies of the T7 epitope (HMASMTGGQQMGAAAMASMTGGQQMGGGPMASMTGGQQMGLINM). pTK-HSV-BP2-Ras-T7 was constructed from a previously described plasmid, pTK-HSV-BP2-T7 (16Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), by insertion of a cDNA segment encoding human H-Ras between the sequences for SREBP-2 and the first copy of the T7 epitope. The nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 2–189 of human H-Ras was obtained by polymerase chain reaction on pRcCMV-H-Ras (17James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a pair of primers containing an NdeI site at each 5′ end using Pfu DNA polymerase. The amplified product was digested with NdeI and cloned into the uniqueNdeI site between human SREBP-2 and the three tandem copies of the T7 epitope. Two independent clones were used in each of the transfections. pTK-HSV-BP2/LDLRTM encodes an epitope-tagged SREBP-2 fusion protein in which a 26-amino acid region that includes the second transmembrane domain of human SREBP-2 (amino acids 535–560) is replaced with the transmembrane domain of the human LDL receptor (amino acids 708–729) (18Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). To construct pTK-HSV-BP2/LDLRTM, we used oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to produce an intermediate plasmid in which amino acids 535–560 of human SREBP-2 were replaced by two novel amino acids (TG) corresponding to an AgeI restriction site. A pair of complementary oligonucleotides (top strand, 5′-CCGGTGCTCTGTCCATTGTCCTCCCCATCGTGCTCCTCGTCTTCCTTTGCCTGGGGGTCTTCCTTCTATGGT-3′; bottom strand, 5′-CCGGACCATACAAGGAAGACCCCCAGGCAAAGGAAGACGAGGAGCACGATGGGGAGGACAATGGACAGAGCA-3′) were annealed at 94–83 °C for 5 min and then at 83–23 °C for 60 min. These oligonucleotides correspond to amino acids 708–729 of the human LDL receptor flanked by the single-stranded sequence 5′-CCGG-3′. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the uniqueAgeI restriction site of the intermediate plasmid (described above). The resulting pTK-HSV-BP2/LDLRTM encodes an 1157-amino acid chimeric protein consisting of an initiator methionine, two tandem copies of the HSV epitope, six novel amino acids (IDGTVP), human SREBP-2 (amino acids 14–534), two novel amino acids (TG), human LDL receptor (amino acids 708–729), two novel amino acids (SG), and human SREBP-2 (amino acids 561–1141). Plasmid pTK-HSV-BP2(R519A)/LDLRTM is identical to pTK-HSV-BP2/LDLRTM except for the R519A point mutation in the lumenal loop of the SREBP-2 sequence. This plasmid was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. pTK-HSV-BP2-NGT and pTK-HSV-BP2-NSS/NGT encode epitope-tagged SREBP-2 fusion proteins in which serine 515 in the loop region of SREBP-2 is replaced by a novel amino acid sequence containing one or two N-linked glycosylation sites, either SNGT or NSSGSSGNGT, respectively. Both plasmids were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the Muta-gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Version-2 kit (Bio-Rad) (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the relevant region, and at least two independent clones of each mutant were independently transfected. Monolayers of human embryonic kidney 293 cells were set up on day 0 (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and cultured in 8–9% CO2 at 37 °C in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (4Hua X.

On day 2, cells were transfected with 4 μg of pTK empty vector (mock) or the indicated plasmid as described (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Three h after transfection, the cells were switched to medium B (medium A containing 10% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 50 μmcompactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate) in the absence or presence of sterols as indicated in the legends. After incubation for 20 h, the cells receivedN-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at top speed in a microfuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is designated nuclear extract. The supernatant from the original 1000 × g spin was centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor, and the pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1Wang X.

Monolayers of 293 cells were set up on day 0 (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and cultured as described above. On day 2, the cells were transfected with 7 μg of pTK empty vector (mock), pTK-HSV-BP2-NGT, and pTK-HSV-BP2-NSS/NGT, respectively. Three h after transfection, the cells were switched to medium B in the presence of sterols as described in Fig. 1. After incubation for 20 h, the cells were harvested, and the pooled cell suspension from four dishes was fractionated. The 105 × g membrane pellet was washed once with buffer A (4Hua X. Sakai J.

Aliquots of the 105 × g membrane fraction (0.16 mg in 40 μl of buffer A) were boiled for 5 min in the presence (peptide N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H reactions) or in the absence (neuraminidase reactions) of 0.5% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min, after which the indicated amount of glycosidase was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h as described in Fig. 10.Figure 10Insertion of N-linked glycosylation sites into the lumenal loop of SREBP-2.

Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991: 100Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured with a BCA kit (Pierce). After SDS-PAGE in 8% gels, proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). Immunoblot analysis was carried out with a horseradish peroxidase detection kit using the SuperSignalTM CL-HRP Substrate System according to the manufacturer's instructions except that the nitrocellulose sheets were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 5% (v/v) nonfat dry milk, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated newborn calf serum. The chimeric proteins were visualized with 0.5 μg/ml HSV-TagTM monoclonal antibody or with 10 μg/ml IgG-1C6, a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against amino acids 833–1141 of human SREBP-2 (4Hua X.

Gels were calibrated with prestained molecular weight markers. Filters were exposed at room temperature to Reflection™ NEF-496 film (DuPont NEN). Monolayers of 293 cells were set up on day 0 (7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) and cultured as described above. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of the wild-type or mutant version of pTK-HSV-BP2-Ras-T7, 1 μg of pCMV-SCAP(D443N) (16Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and 2 μg of pVAI as described above. pVAI encodes the adenovirus virus-associated I RNA gene, which enhances translation of transfected cDNAs (21Akusjärvi G. Svensson C. Nygard O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated for 20 h with 50 μm compactin and 50 μm sodium mevalonate, at which time the medium was changed to 1.3 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum, 50 μm compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal was added, and the cells were pulse-labeled with 700 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells from four dishes were harvested and pooled, and the membrane fraction was prepared as described above. The pooled membrane fraction from the four dishes was resuspended in 0.1 ml of SDS lysis buffer at room temperature. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The suspension was rotated for 30 min in 5 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 125 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) SDS, 1.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.25% (v/v) deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 25 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal, and 1 mmdithiothreitol), after which 20 μl of preimmune whole rabbit serum, 40 μg of irrelevant mouse monoclonal antibody IgG-2001 (22Tolleshaug H. Goldstein J.L. Schneider W.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and 0.2 ml of Protein G-Sepharose beads were added. After rotation for 16 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 7 min. The resulting supernatant was mixed with an additional 20 μl of preimmune whole rabbit serum, 40 μg of irrelevant monoclonal antibody IgG-2001, and 0.2 ml of Protein G-Sepharose beads, rotated for 2 h, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3–7 min. To the supernatant were added 1 μg of T7-Tag monoclonal antibody, 25 μg of v-H-Ras(Ab-1)-agarose linked monoclonal antibody, and 20 μg of anti-COOH-terminal SREBP-2 monoclonal antibody IgG-1C6. After rotation for 2.5 h, 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, followed by rotation for 2.5 h and centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 3–7 min. The beads were washed once by rotation with buffer D for 16 h, followed by four washes in buffer D for 1 h each. The washed beads were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 2× SDS loading buffer (20Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991: 100Google Scholar) containing 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1000 × g at room temperature for 3 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube (tube A), and the beads were re-eluted with 40 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer containing 25% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 1000 × g at room temperature for 3 min, the supernatant was transferred to tube A, and the entire volume was boiled again for 5 min before SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated samples (from 1.3 dishes of cells) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-PSQ; Millipore). After drying, the membranes were exposed to an imaging plate and scanned in a Fuji X Bas 1000 phosphorimager. The band containing the COOH-terminal product of the cleavage reaction (M r ∼83,000) was excised and subjected directly to multiple cycles of Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer. Fractions from each cycle (148 μl) were collected and counted in a scintillation counter. To identify the exact position of Site-1, we prepared a cDNA (pTK-HSV-BP2-Ras-T7) encoding a triply tagged version of SREBP-2, which we designate SREBP-2/Ras (Fig. 1). The NH2terminus contains two copies of an epitope tag from the HSV glycoprotein that we used previously (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). At the COOH terminus we inserted amino acids 2–189 of H-Ras followed by three copies of an 11-residue epitope derived from the gene 10 protein of bacteriophage T7 (23Tsai D.E. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8864-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The combination of epitopes at the COOH terminus allowed efficient precipitation of the COOH-terminal fragment with a mixture of antibodies directed against the Ras and T7 epitopes plus a monoclonal antibody directed against the COOH-terminal domain of SREBP-2 (see below). To demonstrate that SREBP-2/Ras is cleaved at Site-1 in a physiologic fashion, we transfected 293 cells with a vector encoding this construct and another encoding a mutated version in which arginine 519 was changed to alanine (Fig. 1). We used the relatively weak thymidine kinase promoter, which produces near physiological levels of this protein (2Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).

Isolated acrosomal matrices are composed of a limited number of major bands when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, among which is a M r 67,000 protein that we have termed AM67. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that AM67 is localized to the apical segment of the cauda epididymal sperm acrosome. Immunoelectron microscopy further refined the localization of AM67 to the M1 (dorsal bulge) domain within the acrosome. Using a polymerase chain reaction product based upon tryptic peptide sequences from AM67, a λgt11 guinea pig testis cDNA library was screened to yield two cDNA clones that encode the AM67 peptides. Northern analysis revealed that AM67 is transcribed as a 1.9-kilobase testis-specific mRNA. The complete AM67 sequence encodes a prepropolypeptide of 533 amino acids with a calculatedM r of 59,768. Following cleavage of a probable signal sequence, the polypeptide was predicted to have aM r of 56,851 and seven consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation. The deduced amino acid sequence of AM67 is most similar to those of the mouse sperm protein sp56 and the α-subunits of complement component 4-binding proteins from various mammalian species. Although mouse sp56 has been reported to be a cell-surface receptor for the murine zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3, standard immunoelectron microscopy using the anti-sp56 monoclonal antibody 7C5 detected sp56 within the mouse sperm acrosome, but failed to detect sp56 on the surface of acrosome-intact mouse sperm. Furthermore, acrosomal labeling was detected in mouse sperm prepared for immunofluorescence using paraformaldehyde fixation, but was not observed with live unfixed sperm. Thus, the finding that sp56 is present within the acrosome provides further support that sp56 and AM67 are orthologues and suggests that sp56 may function in acrosomal matrix-zona pellucida interactions during and immediately following the acrosome reaction in the mouse. The guinea pig sperm acrosomal matrix is the dense core of the acrosome and is likely to be important in acrosome biogenesis and fertilization. Isolated acrosomal matrices are composed of a limited number of major bands when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, among which is a M r 67,000 protein that we have termed AM67. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that AM67 is localized to the apical segment of the cauda epididymal sperm acrosome. Immunoelectron microscopy further refined the localization of AM67 to the M1 (dorsal bulge) domain within the acrosome. Using a polymerase chain reaction product based upon tryptic peptide sequences from AM67, a λgt11 guinea pig testis cDNA library was screened to yield two cDNA clones that encode the AM67 peptides.

Thus, the finding that sp56 is present within the acrosome provides further support that sp56 and AM67 are orthologues and suggests that sp56 may function in acrosomal matrix-zona pellucida interactions during and immediately following the acrosome reaction in the mouse. The sperm acrosome reaction has the characteristic hallmarks of regulated secretion: 1) secretory products are concentrated and condensed; 2) secretory granules are stored for long periods of time; and 3) secretion is coupled to an extracellular stimulus (in this case, the zona pellucida) (1Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 243-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Regulated secretion from sperm (i.e. the acrosome reaction) is obligatory for fertilization (2Kopf G.S. Gerton G.L. Wassarman P.M. Elements of Mammalian Fertilization.1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 153-203Google Scholar). It is presumed that the release of specific secretory components from the acrosome is involved in assisting the sperm in the penetration of the investments surrounding the egg. Furthermore, although sperm contain only one secretory vesicle, different enzymatic activities are released from sperm at various times following the acrosome reaction (3Talbot P. Franklin L.E. J.

The differential temporal release of secretory components occurs in other regulated secretory tissues such as the pancreas, but since cells of such tissues contain multiple secretory granules, it has been proposed that this “non-parallel secretion” is due to exocytosis from heterogeneous sources within the tissue or cell of study (9Adelson J.W. Miller P.E. Science. 1985; 228: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In guinea pig sperm, the acrosome reaction results in the differential release of acrosomal components possibly due to their compartmentalization within soluble or insoluble phases of the acrosome (5Hardy D.M. Oda M.N. Friend D.S. Huang Jr., T.T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8DiCarlantonio G. Talbot P. Gamete Res. 1988; 21: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following the exocytotic acrosome reaction, certain acrosomal proteins, such as proacrosin, remain associated with the matrix that establishes the “dense core” of the acrosome and are released at a slower rate than components, such as dipeptidyl peptidase, that are found in a more readily solubilized compartment.The results presented here and in recent papers (10Noland T.D.

Biol. 1995; 167: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrate that two of the components of the dense core (matrix) of the acrosome, AM50 and AM67, represent monomers of large homopolymeric proteins. AM50 has been shown to be a novel, testis-specific member of the pentraxin family of proteins (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary tryptic peptide sequencing indicated that AM67 is related to members of the complement-binding protein family (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that AM67 is, indeed, a member of this class of proteins. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of AM67 is most closely related to that of the mouse sperm protein sp56. This protein is a candidate for the cell-surface receptor of ZP3, a glycoprotein of the egg's extracellular matrix, the zona pellucida (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A standard post-embedding immunoelectron microscopic technique demonstrated that AM67 is restricted to a specific dorsal compartment (M1 domain of the apical segment) within the acrosome of guinea pig sperm, while mouse sp56 was detected only within the acrosome and not on the plasma membrane over the acrosome as was previously reported using an unconventional colloidal gold surface replica immunoelectron microscopic procedure (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the guinea pig sperm acrosome contains a testis-specific protein related to mouse sperm sp56 and other members of the complement regulatory protein superfamily. This result is reminiscent of our previous reports concerning the acrosomal matrix protein AM50, which was found to be a member of the pentraxin superfamily (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like AM50, AM67 was found to be a testis-specific member of a protein superfamily, was localized to a specific domain within the acrosome, and also formed high molecular weight homopolymers. Similar to C4BPα, we estimate that six to eight monomers of AM67 oligomerize to constitute the unreduced form of the protein (M r ∼380,000). Based upon the C4BPα sequence homology, AM67 might be predicted to form calcium-dependent complexes with other ligands within the acrosome or, after exocytosis, with extracellular ligands. Comparable calcium-dependent binding of AM50 to the apical segment complex (containing the acrosomal matrix) has already been demonstrated (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Of all the sequences found to be homologous to AM67, mouse sperm protein sp56 and the serum complement component 4-binding proteins within the complement regulatory protein superfamily ranked the highest in a BLAST search of GenBank™ sequences (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar). The significance of this is not clear at the present time; but it is noteworthy that serum C4BP has been shown to interact with serum pentraxins (C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component) (38Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12896-12901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21749-21757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Garcı́a de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2430-2436PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, AM67 might be predicted to interact with AM50. Although immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that AM67 and AM50 are localized in distinct regions of the acrosomal matrix of acrosome-intact sperm, it is possible that these components could interact following the acrosome reaction. C4BPα and the pentraxins are known to bind to plasma membranes, and based upon the homologies to these proteins, AM67 and AM50 might also be expected to interact with components of the acrosomal membranes. If AM67 and AM50 bind to different ligands of the acrosomal membrane, aggregation of these proteins with their ligands during acrosome biogenesis may help to establish the M1 and M3 domains. Additionally, AM50 and AM67 may interact with membranes or react with each other upon their release following the acrosome reaction and the dissolution of the acrosomal matrix.AM67 is not the first member of the complement regulatory protein superfamily to be found in sperm. Additional members recently identified include another guinea pig sperm C4BP distinct from AM67 (13Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as decay-accelerating factor (CD55), membrane cofactor protein (CD46), and protectin (CD59), which have been shown to be membrane-bound components of the sperm acrosomal region (41Rooney I.A. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Immunol. Res. 1993; 12: 276-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Clusterin, another regulator of complement, is secreted by the Sertoli cells and the epididymal epithelium and has also been shown to be associated with sperm (42Sylvester S.R. Morales C. Oko R. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 43Law G.L. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The roles of these complement regulatory proteins in fertilization and reproductive immunology are debatable at this point, but several of them appear to be present in sperm-specific forms. The testis-specific expression of AM67 is also intriguing considering C4BPα proteins are generally considered to be liver-specific proteins.The very remarkable similarity of the amino acid sequence of guinea pig AM67 to that of mouse sp56 suggests that these proteins are orthologues. Although the apparent molecular weights of the native AM67 and sp56 multimeric proteins were ∼380,000 and 110,000, respectively (14Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these sizes are similar to the differences in the properties of the C4BPs from other mammalian species compared with mouse (44Barnum S.R. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AM67 and sp56 are soluble at low pH, a commonly used condition for the extraction of acrosomal proteins (45Meizel S. Mukerji S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1976; 14: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, our finding that AM67 is intracellular contrasts with previous reports characterizing mouse sp56 as a cell-surface protein (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 46Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).To examine the discrepancy in the localizations of AM67 and sp56, we used the post-embedding immunoelectron microscopic method, but found that both AM67 and sp56 were localized to the acrosomal contents in mature guinea pig and mouse sperm, respectively, while neither was observed on the plasma membrane. It seems unlikely that there is a pool of sp56 on the mouse sperm surface that was not detected by this method since both surface and intracellular antigens should be detected equally well. This conclusion was further substantiated by results from pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy, a standard method used to localize cell-surface antigens, showing that sp56 was associated with acrosomal material in damaged sperm, but not on the plasma membrane (data not shown). It is possible that the colloidal gold labeling of sp56 interpreted as surface labeling by the immunogold surface replica method (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Suzuki-Toyota F. Maekawa M. Cheng A. Bleil J.D. J. Electron Microsc. 1995; 44: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar) could, in fact, be due to the exposure of acrosomal sp56 on the surface by permeabilization of the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes. The outer acrosomal membrane and the plasma membrane over the acrosome are known to be susceptible to mechanical and chemical disruption, and these membranes are also destabilized during capacitation (47Langlais J. Zollinger M. Plante L. Chapdelaine A. Bleau G. Roberts K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7266-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mouse sperm utilized for the localization of sp56 by the immunogold surface replica technique were capacitated and lightly fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, but not embedded prior to immunolabeling (36Suzuki-Toyota F. Maekawa M. Cheng A. Bleil J.D. J. Electron Microsc. 1995; 44: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar). Since formaldehyde fixation is reversible (48Barka T. Anderson P.J. Histochemistry: Theory, Practice, and Bibliography. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., New York1963: 28-29Google Scholar), it appears that the “surface labeling” of sp56 may actually be attributable to the exposure of intra-acrosomal sp56 caused by the permeabilization, rupture, or partial fusion of the destabilized outer acrosomal and plasma membranes during the course of the sample manipulations.These results do not negate the results showing the ability of mouse sp56 to bind to the zona pellucida, but should cause us to reassess our concepts regarding sperm capacitation, sperm-egg recognition, and the acrosome reaction. Evidence from a variety of systems indicates that small dynamic fusion pores form in a common bilayer created by the apposing leaflets of the vesicular and plasmalemmal membranes (reviewed by Monck and Fernandez (49Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). These small pores are thought to occasionally close after the release of small non-quantal amounts of secretory products. In an application of this “dynamic fusion pore” hypothesis to sperm, capacitation may represent a state where the small fusion pores are dynamically opening and closing between the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes, thereby exposing acrosomal components. Thus, it might be possible that a capacitated sperm encountering an egg may actually bind to the zona via the transiently exposed acrosomal proteins, not a cell-surface molecule. Binding to the zona in this manner might “lock” the fusion pore into the static open state, driving exocytosis to completion.In consideration of the resistance of the acrosomal matrix to Triton X-100 solubilization, we propose that acrosomal matrix components such as AM67 and AM50 help form the dense core of the acrosome and establish the different compartments (M1, M2, and M3 domains) within this organelle. As proposed for the dynamic fusion pore hypothesis, the relative distribution of these proteins may position them for binding to other molecules such as the zona pellucida glycoproteins, and the affinity of AM67 and AM50 for other acrosomal components may regulate the differential release of certain secretory products following the acrosome reaction. Other acrosomal proteins such as dipeptidyl peptidase, autoantigen 1, and soluble hyaluronidase may not associate tightly with the matrix, and thus, they would be freely released following the acrosome reaction (5Hardy D.M. Oda M.N. Friend D.S. Huang Jr., T.T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6de Vries J.W.A. Willemson R. Geuze H.J. Eur. J.

Cytochem. 1985; 33: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins such as proacrosin would be more firmly associated with certain components of the matrix (e.g. AM67, AM50, and proacrosin-binding protein) (50Green D.P.L. Hockaday A.R. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar, 51Green D.P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar, 52Green D.P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 137-157PubMed Google Scholar). The gradual dissolution of the matrix may result from the dissociation of matrix components resulting from partial proteolysis following the progressive conversion of the zymogen proacrosin to enzymatically active acrosin. With the activation of proteolysis, AM50 would be processed to AM50AR by proteolysis, leading to the destabilization of the AM50 oligomers and continued dissolution of the matrix (12Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This working hypothesis opens up new avenues for examining the release of materials following acrosomal exocytosis. In studies in progress, the binding properties of AM67 and AM50 are being examined to identify ligands for these large oligomers and to determine their roles in acrosomal biogenesis and fertilization. The sperm acrosome reaction has the characteristic hallmarks of regulated secretion: 1) secretory products are concentrated and condensed; 2) secretory granules are stored for long periods of time; and 3) secretion is coupled to an extracellular stimulus (in this case, the zona pellucida) (1Burgess T.L.

Comparable calcium-dependent binding of AM50 to the apical segment complex (containing the acrosomal matrix) has already been demonstrated (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Of all the sequences found to be homologous to AM67, mouse sperm protein sp56 and the serum complement component 4-binding proteins within the complement regulatory protein superfamily ranked the highest in a BLAST search of GenBank™ sequences (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar). The significance of this is not clear at the present time; but it is noteworthy that serum C4BP has been shown to interact with serum pentraxins (C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component) (38Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12896-12901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Schwalbe R.A. Dahlbäck B. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21749-21757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Garcı́a de Frutos P. Dahlbäck B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2430-2436PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, AM67 might be predicted to interact with AM50. Although immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that AM67 and AM50 are localized in distinct regions of the acrosomal matrix of acrosome-intact sperm, it is possible that these components could interact following the acrosome reaction. C4BPα and the pentraxins are known to bind to plasma membranes, and based upon the homologies to these proteins, AM67 and AM50 might also be expected to interact with components of the acrosomal membranes. If AM67 and AM50 bind to different ligands of the acrosomal membrane, aggregation of these proteins with their ligands during acrosome biogenesis may help to establish the M1 and M3 domains. Additionally, AM50 and AM67 may interact with membranes or react with each other upon their release following the acrosome reaction and the dissolution of the acrosomal matrix.AM67 is not the first member of the complement regulatory protein superfamily to be found in sperm. Additional members recently identified include another guinea pig sperm C4BP distinct from AM67 (13Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as decay-accelerating factor (CD55), membrane cofactor protein (CD46), and protectin (CD59), which have been shown to be membrane-bound components of the sperm acrosomal region (41Rooney I.A. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Immunol. Res. 1993; 12: 276-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Clusterin, another regulator of complement, is secreted by the Sertoli cells and the epididymal epithelium and has also been shown to be associated with sperm (42Sylvester S.R. Morales C. Oko R. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 45: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 43Law G.L. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The roles of these complement regulatory proteins in fertilization and reproductive immunology are debatable at this point, but several of them appear to be present in sperm-specific forms. The testis-specific expression of AM67 is also intriguing considering C4BPα proteins are generally considered to be liver-specific proteins.The very remarkable similarity of the amino acid sequence of guinea pig AM67 to that of mouse sp56 suggests that these proteins are orthologues. Although the apparent molecular weights of the native AM67 and sp56 multimeric proteins were ∼380,000 and 110,000, respectively (14Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), these sizes are similar to the differences in the properties of the C4BPs from other mammalian species compared with mouse (44Barnum S.R. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 28-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AM67 and sp56 are soluble at low pH, a commonly used condition for the extraction of acrosomal proteins (45Meizel S. Mukerji S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1976; 14: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, our finding that AM67 is intracellular contrasts with previous reports characterizing mouse sp56 as a cell-surface protein (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 46Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).To examine the discrepancy in the localizations of AM67 and sp56, we used the post-embedding immunoelectron microscopic method, but found that both AM67 and sp56 were localized to the acrosomal contents in mature guinea pig and mouse sperm, respectively, while neither was observed on the plasma membrane. It seems unlikely that there is a pool of sp56 on the mouse sperm surface that was not detected by this method since both surface and intracellular antigens should be detected equally well. This conclusion was further substantiated by results from pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy, a standard method used to localize cell-surface antigens, showing that sp56 was associated with acrosomal material in damaged sperm, but not on the plasma membrane (data not shown). It is possible that the colloidal gold labeling of sp56 interpreted as surface labeling by the immunogold surface replica method (15Cheng A. Le T. Palacios M. Bookbinder L.H. Wassarman P.M. Suzuki F. Bleil J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Suzuki-Toyota F. Maekawa M. Cheng A. Bleil J.D. J. Electron Microsc. 1995; 44: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar) could, in fact, be due to the exposure of acrosomal sp56 on the surface by permeabilization of the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes. The outer acrosomal membrane and the plasma membrane over the acrosome are known to be susceptible to mechanical and chemical disruption, and these membranes are also destabilized during capacitation (47Langlais J. Zollinger M. Plante L. Chapdelaine A. Bleau G. Roberts K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7266-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mouse sperm utilized for the localization of sp56 by the immunogold surface replica technique were capacitated and lightly fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, but not embedded prior to immunolabeling (36Suzuki-Toyota F. Maekawa M. Cheng A. Bleil J.D. J. Electron Microsc. 1995; 44: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar). Since formaldehyde fixation is reversible (48Barka T. Anderson P.J. Histochemistry: Theory, Practice, and Bibliography. Harper & Row Publishers, Inc., New York1963: 28-29Google Scholar), it appears that the “surface labeling” of sp56 may actually be attributable to the exposure of intra-acrosomal sp56 caused by the permeabilization, rupture, or partial fusion of the destabilized outer acrosomal and plasma membranes during the course of the sample manipulations.These results do not negate the results showing the ability of mouse sp56 to bind to the zona pellucida, but should cause us to reassess our concepts regarding sperm capacitation, sperm-egg recognition, and the acrosome reaction. Evidence from a variety of systems indicates that small dynamic fusion pores form in a common bilayer created by the apposing leaflets of the vesicular and plasmalemmal membranes (reviewed by Monck and Fernandez (49Monck J.R. Fernandez J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). These small pores are thought to occasionally close after the release of small non-quantal amounts of secretory products. In an application of this “dynamic fusion pore” hypothesis to sperm, capacitation may represent a state where the small fusion pores are dynamically opening and closing between the outer acrosomal and plasma membranes, thereby exposing acrosomal components. Thus, it might be possible that a capacitated sperm encountering an egg may actually bind to the zona via the transiently exposed acrosomal proteins, not a cell-surface molecule. Binding to the zona in this manner might “lock” the fusion pore into the static open state, driving exocytosis to completion.In consideration of the resistance of the acrosomal matrix to Triton X-100 solubilization, we propose that acrosomal matrix components such as AM67 and AM50 help form the dense core of the acrosome and establish the different compartments (M1, M2, and M3 domains) within this organelle. As proposed for the dynamic fusion pore hypothesis, the relative distribution of these proteins may position them for binding to other molecules such as the zona pellucida glycoproteins, and the affinity of AM67 and AM50 for other acrosomal components may regulate the differential release of certain secretory products following the acrosome reaction. Other acrosomal proteins such as dipeptidyl peptidase, autoantigen 1, and soluble hyaluronidase may not associate tightly with the matrix, and thus, they would be freely released following the acrosome reaction (5Hardy D.M. Oda M.N. Friend D.S. Huang Jr., T.T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6de Vries J.W.A. Willemson R. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 37: 81-88Google Scholar, 8DiCarlantonio G. Talbot P. Gamete Res. 1988; 21: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Talbot P. DiCarlantonio G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins such as proacrosin would be more firmly associated with certain components of the matrix (e.g. AM67, AM50, and proacrosin-binding protein) (50Green D.P.L. Hockaday A.R. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar, 51Green D.P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar, 52Green D.P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 32: 137-157PubMed Google Scholar). The gradual dissolution of the matrix may result from the dissociation of matrix components resulting from partial proteolysis following the progressive conversion of the zymogen proacrosin to enzymatically active acrosin. With the activation of proteolysis, AM50 would be processed to AM50AR by proteolysis, leading to the destabilization of the AM50 oligomers and continued dissolution of the matrix (12Westbrook-Case V.A. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This working hypothesis opens up new avenues for examining the release of materials following acrosomal exocytosis. In studies in progress, the binding properties of AM67 and AM50 are being examined to identify ligands for these large oligomers and to determine their roles in acrosomal biogenesis and fertilization. This study demonstrates that the guinea pig sperm acrosome contains a testis-specific protein related to mouse sperm sp56 and other members of the complement regulatory protein superfamily. This result is reminiscent of our previous reports concerning the acrosomal matrix protein AM50, which was found to be a member of the pentraxin superfamily (11Noland T.D. Friday B.B. Maulit M.T. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32607-32614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Reid M. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32615-32620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like AM50, AM67 was found to be a testis-specific member of a protein superfamily, was localized to a specific domain within the acrosome, and also formed high molecular weight homopolymers. Similar to C4BPα, we estimate that six to eight monomers of AM67 oligomerize to constitute the unreduced form of the protein (M r ∼380,000). Based upon the C4BPα sequence homology, AM67 might be predicted to form calcium-dependent complexes with other ligands within the acrosome or, after exocytosis, with extracellular ligands.

We have used one of the few integral membrane proteins known to be involved in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), 1The abbreviations used are: PAM, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase; TGN, trans-Golgi network; kb, kilobase pair(s); RHP, RACE hybrid primer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; pBS, pBluescript II (SK−); aa, amino acids; nt, nucleotide(s); DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CD, cytosolic domain; LAR, leukocyte common antigen-related; MCS, multiple cloning site. to search for cytosolic proteins involved in these processes (17Alam M.R.

PAM is a bifunctional enzyme and integral membrane forms contain an NH2-terminal signal sequence, the two catalytic domains that catalyze the sequential reactions required for peptide amidation, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytosolic domain (18Eipper B.A. Milgram S.L. Husten E.J. Yun H.-Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PAM is involved in the production of all α-amidated peptides and functions only after neuroendocrine-specific endoproteases and carboxypeptidases have exposed the COOH-terminal glycine residue that serves as the nitrogen donor for amide formation (19Bradbury A.F. Smyth D.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 112-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical evidence indicates that PAM begins to function in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but most peptide amidation occurs in immature secretory granules (20Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Using immunoelectron microscopy, integral membrane forms of PAM have been localized to the TGN, especially to distal tubuloreticular regions, and to large dense core vesicles (21Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed independently in neuroendocrine cells, each lumenal catalytic domain of PAM is targeted to large dense core vesicles (22Milgram S.L. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Integral membrane forms of PAM are localized to the TGN region of both neuroendocrine and nonneuroendocrine cells (7Tausk F.A. Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2185-2196PubMed Google Scholar, 8Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A small percentage of membrane PAM is present on the cell surface or in endosomes at steady state. Elimination of the distal 40 amino acids of the 86-amino acid cytosolic domain results in relocation of membrane PAM to the plasma membrane (8Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When transferred to a plasma membrane protein such as the interleukin 2 receptor α-chain (Tac), the cytosolic domain of PAM directs the majority of the protein to the TGN region and confers the ability to undergo internalization from the plasma membrane (9Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutation of a tyrosine residue in the COOH-terminal domain of PAM greatly diminishes internalization of PAM from the cell surface without dramatically altering its TGN localization (9Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The TGN localization of membrane PAM is greatly compromised upon deletion of an 18-amino acid domain that includes the tyrosine residue essential for internalization. Integral membrane PAM proteins are phosphorylated, and mutagenesis studies indicate that phosphorylation affects routing (23Yun H.-Y. Milgram S.L. Keutmann H.T. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30075-30083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Using a rat hippocampal library and the yeast two-hybrid system, we recently identified partial cDNAs encoding two PAMCOOH-terminal interactor proteins (P-CIPs) (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D.

The biological relevance of these interactions is supported by the fact that the interactions are eliminated when the 18-amino acid segment identified as essential for proper routing of PAM is eliminated. P-CIP2 is similar to serine/threonine dual specificity protein kinases, while P-CIP10 contains at least five spectrin-like repeats (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study we identify the full-length P-CIP10 protein as a member of the Dbl family of GDP/GTP exchange factors (24Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Op. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and establish the phenotype of stably transfected AtT-20 cell lines expressing PAM-1 and P-CIP10. The 2.0-kb P-CIP10 cDNA fragment identified using the yeast two-hybrid system (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used to screen 1 × 106 plaque-forming units from a random primed rat hippocampal cDNA library in λ-ZAPII (Stratagene). Seven positive clones were plaque-purified, and the two largest cDNA inserts recovered were overlapping 4.7-kb (clone 10/28) and 4.1-kb (clone 10/34) fragments. Both strands of these cDNAs were sequenced completely; only the 5′ ends of clones 10/28 (upstream sequence from nucleotide 36) and 10/34 (upstream sequence from nucleotide 419) differed. Attempts to extend these sequences by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) were unsuccessful. The five shorter cDNAs were fragments of the larger pieces. DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols. Since no in-frame stop codon was identified in clones 10/28 and 10/34, 3′ RACE was used to extend the 3′-end of the 10/28 cDNA (25Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly (A)+ RNA from adult rat parietal cortex (200 ng) or olfactory bulb (140 ng) was reverse transcribed with the Promega reverse transcription system (Madison, WI) using a RACE hybrid primer (RHP) 5′-GGAATTCGAGCTCATCGAT17-3′ (0.75 μm) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (15 units). After the initial 35-cycle amplification using 5′-CAGGATGCCTTTCAAGTG-3′ (nt 4375–4392 of final P-CIP10a) and RHP, an aliquot of the PCR product was used in a nested PCR with 5′-CCTCTAGAGCACCCCATCCTCAGACAAT-3′ (nt 4592–4611 of P-CIP10a) and RHP. A 770-base pair fragment (674 nt of new sequence) from independent amplifications of both tissues was purified, subcloned into pBluescript II (SK−) (pBS), and sequenced. The additional 3′-sequence contained no in-frame stop codon, so 3′-RACE was repeated as above using sense primers 5′-CTGCTTCTTCCCCCTGGTGA-3′ (nt 5097–5116 of P-CIP10a) for the first round of amplification and 5′-GGTCTAGAATGGAGGCAAGTCTGAGT-3′ (nt 5144–5164 of P-CIP10a) for the second round of PCR reactions with the same RHP. The 650-base pair fragment (444 nt of new 3′ sequence) obtained in this second 3′-RACE reaction had an in-frame stop codon. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to verify that the novel sequence contained in the 3′-RACE products was contiguous to clone 10/28. Full-length P-CIP10a (10/28 cDNA at the 5′ end) and P-CIP10b (10/34 cDNA at the 5′ end) cDNAs were constructed using a PCR-generated pBS.P-CIP10–3′ (nt 4255–5724) intermediate. Full-length P-CIP10a cDNA (pBS.P-CIP10a) was created by a three-way ligation ofBsp106I/BamHI-digested pBS, a 4.45-kb fragment obtained from clone 10/28 by digestion with Bsp106I (5′-MCS)-AspEI (nt 4401) and a 1.32-kb fragment obtained from AspEI/BamHI-cut pBS.P-CIP10–3′. To create the full-length P-CIP10b cDNA (pBS.P-CIP10b), clone 10/34 was digested with BstBI (nt 2674) and XbaI (3′-MCS), and the 10/34 sequence downstream of BstBI was replaced with the 3.4-kb BstBI (nt 2291 of P-CIP10a)-XbaI (3′-MCS) fragment from pBS.P-CIP10a. Construction of pGEX-CIP10, an expression vector encoding a GST fusion protein containing P-CIP10a (aa 447–1138), was described (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To construct pET-HisDH, a bacterial expression vector encoding all of the Dbl homology (DH) domain and most of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of P-CIP10a (P-CIP10a (aa 1254–1537)), the 857-base pair fragment from clone 10/28 was subcloned into pET28a (Novagen) in-frame with the histidine tag. A mammalian expression vector encoding full-length P-CIP10a (pSCEP.P-CIP10a) was constructed by inserting the full-length cDNA piece from pBS.P-CIP10a into pSCEP (26Paquet L. Massie B. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 964-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pBS.Myc.P-CIP10, the c-Myc epitope (underlined) with a Gly5linker (MEQKLISEEDLNGGGGG) was joined in-frame to Gly5 of P-CIP10a using standard methods. The full-length cDNA insert was then transferred to pSCEP to generate p.SCEP.Myc.P-CIP10. All PCR-generated cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Truncated forms of P-CIP10 cDNAs were used as templates for in vitro transcription and translation reactions. pBS.10a (nt 1–1142) was generated by digesting pBS.P-CIP10a with BglII (cuts at nt 1142) and BamHI (cuts in 3′-MCS) and religating. pBS.10b (nt 1–1525) was generated in the same manner from pBS.P-CIP10b. Radiolabeled proteins ([35S]methionine, 40 μCi/40-μl reaction; Amersham Corp.) were synthesized using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription and translation system (TNT; Promega Corp.) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with or without prior immunoprecipitation. Total RNA (10 μg) prepared from different adult rat tissues was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (25Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared with the Promega PolyATtract® mRNA isolation system II. RNA transferred to nitrocellulose membranes was hybridized with a cDNA probe encompassing nt 1363–3398 of P-CIP10a using standard protocols (25Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In situ hybridization was carried out as described (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody JH2000 was raised by immunization with GST.P-CIP10a (aa 447–1138). The fusion protein purified by SDS-PAGE and electroelution was used as antigen. Antibody JH2000 recognizes full-length P-CIP10 only after denaturation. Monoclonal antibody 4C9 was generated to recombinant P-CIP10a (aa 1254–1537) (His-DH) expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by adsorption to nickel-bound His-Bind resin (Novagen) (9Milgram S.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared from conditioned medium or ascites fluid (Hazleton, HRP). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 10% Nu serum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). Transfected cell lines were grown with appropriate drug selection: G418 (0.5 mg/ml) for pMt.Neo or pMc.Neo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cotransfections; hygromycin (200 units/ml) for pCEP4 (Invitrogen) or pSCEP (26Paquet L. Massie B. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 964-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cotransfections. AtT-20/PAM-1 cells were transfected with pSCEP.P-CIP10a or pSCEP.Myc.P-CIP10a using lipofection. Cells resistant to both hygromycin and G418 were selected, expanded, and screened for expression of P-CIP10 or Myc.P-CIP10 transcript by Northern blot analysis. Cell lines were subcloned and again screened by Northern blot analysis. Cells plated on 15-mm culture dishes and grown to 70–90% confluency were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free complete serum-free medium for 10 min and then labeled with the same medium containing 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (ProMix; Amersham) for 15 or 30 min followed by a nonradioactive chase in complete serum-free medium. Cells were either directly extracted into SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min or were scraped into TMT buffer (10 mm sodium TES, pH 7.5, 20 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing and centrifugation to pellet insoluble material. For the subcellular fractionation experiment, cells were removed from the dishes by scraping into an isotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose), disrupted using a ball bearing cell cracker (15-μm clearance), and subjected to differential centrifugation (23Yun H.-Y.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Apparent molecular masses were determined using prestained molecular weight standards (Rainbow standards; Amersham). The capacities of Ab JH2000 and mAb 9E10 were determined by adding increasing amounts of AtT-20/P-CIP10a or AtT-20/Myc.P-CIP10 cell extract to a fixed amount of antibody plus radiolabeled in vitro translated Myc.P-CIP10. Live AtT-20 cells were photographed at low magnification using phase contrast optics. Coded images were analyzed using a BioQuant TCW (version 3.00; R & M Biometrics, Nashville, TN) to record the total number of cells, number of cells with processes (longer than 1 cell body length), number of round cells, number of giant cells (cell body bigger than 3 nuclei), length of each process, and number of bifurcations (branch points). Four or five images were analyzed for each cell line (215–460 cells); after decoding, data were analyzed for statistical significance using a t test. E. coli transformed with vectors encoding GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, and GST-Cdc42Hs were obtained from Dr. Richard C. Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). The purified fusion proteins were prepared, dialyzed, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and depleted of bound nucleotide (29Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.-G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G.

AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1 or PAM-1 with Myc.P-CIP10 were extracted into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100.

For each binding reaction, about 50 μg of GST-GTPase bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads was mixed with an aliquot of cell extract containing 2 mg (0.25 mg/ml) of protein from nonlabeled cells or 5 × 107 cpm/ml acid-precipitable protein from radiolabeled cells. After mixing for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with nucleotide depletion buffer. The beads incubated with nonlabeled extracts were eluted with Laemmli buffer, and bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using Ab JH2000. The beads incubated with radiolabeled cell extracts were eluted by boiling in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, diluted, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (9Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with Ab JH2000. P-CIP10 was identified in a hippocampal/cortical cDNA library prepared from 3-week-old rat pups that had been subjected to a single maximal electroconvulsive stimulus (17Alam M.R. Caldwell B.D. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28636-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Before trying to clone a full-length P-CIP10 cDNA, we used Northern blot analysis to determine the size of the P-CIP10 transcript and the tissues expressing the highest levels of P-CIP10 (Fig. 1 A). A somewhat heterogeneous set of P-CIP10 transcripts was visualized in total RNA prepared from olfactory bulb, parietal cortex, and hippocampus, with lower levels detected in hypothalamus and none detected in cerebellum. P-CIP10 mRNA was detectable in total RNA prepared from kidney and spleen but was not visualized in anterior or neurointermediate pituitary or atrium, tissues that contain high levels of PAM mRNA. Multiple forms of P-CIP10 mRNA were apparent in all of the tissues examined; when poly(A)+ mRNA from olfactory bulb and parietal cortex was subjected to Northern blot analysis, distinct bands of 8.0 and 5.7 kb were detected (Fig. 1 A, inset). A similar distribution of P-CIP10 transcripts was observed whenin situ hybridization was performed on sections of adult rat brain (Fig. 1, B and D). P-CIP10 transcripts were prevalent in the olfactory bulb, including the internal granular layers, internal plexiform layer, mitral cell layer, and accessory olfactory bulb. P-CIP10 transcripts were also prevalent in all layers of the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, and amygdala and in the dentate gyrus and CA1–3 regions of the hippocampus. P-CIP10 transcripts were present at lower levels in several hypothalamic structures, including the paraventricular, supraoptic, dorsomedial, and arcuate nuclei. Our partial cDNA was substantially shorter than the P-CIP10 mRNAs observed in tissues. We used the 2.0-kb P-CIP10 cDNA fragment to screen a rat hippocampal cDNA library. The two largest cDNA fragments isolated (10/28 and 10/34) were identical except at their 5′-ends (Fig.2 A). No in-frame stop codons were found at either end of either cDNA. The GC content of the 5′-ends of both clones was high, and attempts to extend the sequences by 5′-RACE were unsuccessful (25Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); sequence and in vitro translation data (see below) indicated that an initiator Met was included in each clone. By sequentially employing 3′-RACE, we extended the sequence to include an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 2 A). No sequence diversity was found in the newly amplified 3′-fragments. The fragments were assembled to form two full-length P-CIP10 cDNAs, P-CIP10a (5′-end of 10/28) and P-CIP10b (5′-end of 10/34) (Fig. 2 A). A single long open reading frame with a stop codon near the 3′-end was found in both P-CIP10 cDNAs. The GC-rich nature of the 5′-end of both P-CIP10a and P-CIP10b and the presence of a single Met residue in both unique regions raised the possibility that a transcriptional start site was present in each clone. The nucleotide sequence surrounding each Met agreed with the consensus translational initiation sequence defined for higher eukaryotes (Fig. 2 B) (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 32Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2662-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine whether these potential translational initiation sites were functional, we performed coupled in vitrotranscription/translation reactions. We truncated P-CIP10a and P-CIP10b at a common site less than 1200 nt from the potential translational initiation sites so that the predicted 20-amino acid difference between the translation products of P-CIP10a and P-CIP10b would be detectable (Fig. 2 B). Each P-CIP10 cDNA yielded a protein of the size predicted if translation were initiated at the Met in each unique 5′-region (Fig. 2 C); for both P-CIP10a and P-CIP10b, the next Met is more than 80 amino acid residues downstream. The P-CIP10a transcription/translation reaction proceeded much more efficiently than the P-CIP10b reaction, and we used the P-CIP10a cDNA for all further studies. P-CIP10a encodes a protein of 1899 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 217 kDa and pI of 5.67 (Fig. 2 D). P-CIP10 is largely hydrophilic, with the characteristics of a cytosolic protein. The NH2 terminus of P-CIP10 lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence, and no hydrophobic stretches typical of transmembrane domains are present. By homology search and computer-based structural analysis, P-CIP10 can be divided into five regions: a short NH2-terminal region, a region of spectrin-like repeats, a DH domain, a PH domain, and the COOH-terminal region (Fig.2 E). The NH2-terminal 150 amino acids of P-CIP10 are homologous to Trio, a new member of the Dbl family of proteins identified by virtue of its interaction with the cytosolic domain of the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (33Debant A.

The next 1000 amino acid residues of P-CIP10 are most homologous to Trio (33Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

L., Tran, D., Neubauer, M., and Wahl, A. F. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6050–6061). Cyclin G2 is highly expressed in the immune system where immunologic tolerance subjects self-reactive lymphocytes to negative selection and clonal deletion via apoptosis. Here we investigated the effect of growth inhibitory signals on cyclin G2 mRNA abundance in different maturation stage-specific murine B cell lines. Upon treatment of wild-type and p53 null B cell lines with the negative growth factor, transforming growth factor β1, or the growth inhibitory corticosteroid dexamethasone, cyclin G2 mRNA levels were increased in a time-dependent manner 5–14-fold over control cell levels. Unstimulated immature B cell lines (WEHI-231 and CH31) and unstimulated or IgM B cell receptor (BCR) -stimulated mature B cell lines (BAL-17 and CH12) rapidly proliferate and express low levels of cyclin G2 mRNA. In contrast, BCR-stimulated immature B cell lines undergo growth arrest and coincidentally exhibit an ∼10-fold increase in cyclin G2 transcripts and a decrease in cyclin D2 message. Costimulation of WEHI-231 and CH31 cells with calcium ionophores and protein kinase C agonists partially mimics anti-IgM stimulation and elicits a strong up-regulation of cyclin G2 mRNA and down-regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA. Signaling mutants of WEHI-231 that are deficient in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway and consequently resistant to the BCR stimulus-induced growth arrest did not display a significant increase in cyclin G2 or decrease in cyclin D2 mRNAs when challenged with anti-IgM antibodies. The two polyclonal activators lipopolysaccharide and soluble gp39, which inhibit the growth arrest response of immature B cells, suppressed cyclin G2 mRNA expression induced by BCR stimulation. These results suggest that in murine B cells responding to growth inhibitory stimuli cyclin G2 may be a key negative regulator of cell cycle progression. Human cyclin G2 together with its closest homolog cyclin G1 defines a novel family of cyclins (Horne, M. C., Goolsby, G. L., Donaldson, K. L., Tran, D., Neubauer, M., and Wahl, A. F. (1996)J. Biol.

Proliferation signals promote the coordinated progression of a cell through the cell division cycle. In eukaryotes this process is controlled by the sequential formation, activation, and inhibition of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; ORF, open reading frame; PCD, programmed cell death; BCR, B cell receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Ca2+i, cytoplasmic calcium; DAG, diacylglycerol; PdBu, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate; gp, glycoprotein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β1; PKC, protein kinase C; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CDKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; ORF, open reading frame; PCD, programmed cell death; BCR, B cell receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Ca2+i, cytoplasmic calcium; DAG, diacylglycerol; PdBu, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate; gp, glycoprotein; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β1; PKC, protein kinase C; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. complexes (1Pines J.

The levels of many cyclins oscillate during the cell cycle and act as rate-limiting positive regulators of CDK activity. Mammalian cyclins are classified into different types based on their structural similarity, functional period in the cell division cycle, and regulated expression (1Pines J. Adv.

Cyclin-CDK activity is also subject to regulation by CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) such as p15INK4 and p16INK4, p21WAF1/CIP1, and p27KIP1 which, in response to negative stimuli, bind cyclin-CDK complexes and block cell cycle progression (5MacLachlan T.K.

We studied the effects of stimulatory and inhibitory signals on cell cycle components expressed in B lymphocytes representative of two different maturation stages of development. A robust immune system has to deliver specific and effective immune responses to foreign antigens and yet be immunologically tolerant of self-antigens. Such tolerance is achieved because T and B cells pass through stages in their development when ligation of their antigen receptors by self-antigens results in negative regulatory signals that induce either unresponsiveness and functional inactivation (clonal anergy) or their physical elimination (clonal deletion) (22Nossal G.J.

During clonal deletion, activated autoimmune cells are eliminated from the repertoire of potentially reactive immune cells by the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis (25Hartley S.B. Cooke M.P.

This process is contextual and dependent on such factors as the type of antigen, strength of the antigen-induced signal, the ontogeny of the cell, the microenvironment of the immune cell, and the presence of positive costimulatory signals (27Goodnow C.C.

Thus, a developmental switch in the differentiation pathway of B cells coupled to a sensing of the microenvironment through appropriate costimulatory signals has a profound effect on cell cycle regulation in response to antigen receptor stimulation of B lymphocytes. Because the cyclin G gene was identified as a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, a key cell cycle check point control protein (37Hartwell L.

Nature. 1996; 381: 643-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and its expression is induced following DNA damage, cyclin G is hypothesized to play a role in cell cycle check point control (40Okamoto K. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar,41Zauberman A. Lupo A. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2361-2366PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of cyclin G has not yet been determined, cDNAs encoding a longer form of human and murine cyclin G, referred to as cyclin G1, and a novel human homolog, cyclin G2, were recently cloned and characterized (6Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6050-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for human cyclins G1 and G2 are strongly expressed in tissues rich in terminally differentiated cells (cardiac and skeletal muscle for cyclin G1 and cerebellum for cyclin G2) and tissues populated with cells subjected to PCD (spleen and thymus). Murine cyclin G1 mRNA is expressed independently of p53 in a number of tissues of p53 null mice (e.g. brain, heart muscle, and stomach) and can be up-regulated in a p53 null murine B cell line by TGF-β treatment (6Horne M.C.

While cyclin G1 mRNA is constitutively expressed and encodes a protein with no prototypic “destruction box” involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation (42Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1995; 349: 132-138Crossref Scopus (1881) Google Scholar), or protein destabilizing PEST sequences (43Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), human cyclin G2 mRNA oscillates through the cell cycle, peaks in S-phase, and encodes a protein containing a carboxyl-terminal PEST sequence (6Horne M.C.

The closest homolog of this family, cyclin I, is also strongly expressed in differentiated tissues and has been localized by in situ hybridization to terminally differentiated neurons of the hippocampus and cerebellum (7Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y.F. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We cloned the cDNA encoding the murine form of cyclin G2 and investigated its expression pattern in rodent tissues and various murine cell lines. Our results indicate that cyclin G2 transcripts are present at high levels in murine B cells treated with agents causing growth inhibition or growth arrest but not in cells receiving a positive costimulus that promotes cell cycle progression. In contrast, we found that transcripts for cyclin D2, the D-type G1-phase cyclin associated with proliferation in B cells (44Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar), are down-regulated during G1-phase growth arrest. The up-regulation of cyclin G2 mRNA during cell cycle arrest and its expression in terminally differentiated tissues suggest that this cyclin, and perhaps the related cyclins G1 and I, may function in specific contexts as negative coordinators of cell cycle progression.

Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in 6% CO2. During experiments, the cultures were maintained in the exponential phase of growth (1–6 × 105/ml). Cyclin G2 DNA probes were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using the Genius™ system digoxigenin-labeled dNTP mix from human G2 cDNA clones (Boehringer Mannheim). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the GeneClean II® DNA purification kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA) and used to screen a λ Zap II murine thymus cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cross-species screening of the murine cDNA library with human cyclin G2 cDNA probes was done at low stringency with the hybridization buffer containing 30% formamide and filters hybridized and washed at 37 °C. Development of the filters with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies and the Lumi-Phos™ 530 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) was done according to manufacturer's protocol. The isolated phagemid DNA was amplified, extracted, and purified for sequence analysis following the manufacturer's recommended methods and standard techniques (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined using the Sequenase™ (version 2.0) system following procedures recommended by the manufacturer (United States Biochemical Corp.). cDNA fragments present in the Lambda Zap® II phagemid (Stratagene) cloning vectors were sequenced from reactions primed with either a vector-specific oligonucleotide or oligonucleotides homologous to the cloned fragment's internal sequences. [α33P]dATP or [α32P]dATP (at 800 Ci/mmol) was used to radioactively label the DNA fragments. Nucleotide sequences were read from scanned gels with the aid of BioImage® sequence analysis software. The computer-aided editing and alignment of DNA sequences was accomplished using Genetics Computer Group (GCG) (Madison, WI) sequence analysis software. Additional nucleotide and cDNA-derived peptide sequence comparisons were performed using the BLAST program. Final alignments were performed using the GCG Pileup and Pretty programs. Murine lymphocytes were separated into progressive stages of the cell cycle by centrifugal elutriation, and the cell cycle position of elutriated fractions was determined as described previously (6Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6050-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Unelutriated cell populations stimulated with different reagents were examined using dual-parameter flow cytometric analysis of total DNA content and newly incorporated BrDu. Briefly, following a 20–30-min pulse of a culture with 10 μm BrDu, ∼2.0 × 106 cells were sedimented by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4 °C until staining and analysis could be performed. The permeabilization and staining with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrDu antibodies were done following protocols supplied by Becton-Dickinson. Flow cytometry was performed utilizing either a FACScan and Lysis II software (Becton-Dickinson Instruments, San Jose, CA) or Coulter EPICS Profile II Analyzer with Multigraph and MultiCycle software (Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL). Total RNA was isolated from murine tissues and cells utilizing TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The glyoxal denaturation of total RNA and electrophoresis in glyoxal-agarose was done following a standard protocol (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the relative amount and quality of the RNA was controlled by short wave UV fluorescent shadowing of the ribosomal RNAs on a F-254 TLC plate. The fractionated RNAs were transferred and fixed to MagnaGraph® nylon membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA) followed by removal of residual glyoxal as described (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were routinely stained with methylene blue to control for RNA transfer efficiency as described (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The [α32P]dTTP and [α32P]dCTP radioactive labeling of DNA fragments was done using polymerase chain reaction generated and GeneClean II®-isolated DNA fragments as templates and reagents obtained from the Life Technologies, Inc. random priming kit. Hybridization of DNA probes to Northern blots was done according to the methods described by the manufacturer of the nylon membrane and standard protocols (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics) of the washed Northern blot filters was routinely obtained immediately before autoradiography. All Northern blot experiments were performed at least twice with reproducible results. Hybridization screening of a murine thymic cDNA library with an internal cDNA fragment of the human cyclin G2 ORF (6Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol.

One clone comprised nearly the full ORF lacking only the first two nucleotides of the translation initiation codon. In contrast to the human cDNA fragments of cyclin G2 cloned from a Jurkat lambda ZapII cDNA library (6Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol.

Double-stranded nucleotide analysis verified that the cDNA clones encompassed a 1035-base pair ORF with 85% nucleic acid sequence identity to the human cyclin G2 ORF. It encodes a predicted 345-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 41 kDa which has 94.5% identity to the predicted human cyclin G2 protein (Fig.1). Like the human homolog, murine cyclin G2 features a PEST-rich sequence near the carboxyl terminus, a motif thought to direct protein degradation (43Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Murine and human cyclins G1 and G2 share a carboxyl-terminal sequence motif, previously identified in rat cyclin G (51Tamura K. Kanaoka Y. Jinno S. Nagata A. Ogiso Y. Shimizu K. Hayakawa T. Nojima H.

Our analysis indicates that human cyclin I, a cyclin of unknown function highly expressed in brain and skeletal muscle (7Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y.F. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is more related to full-length human cyclins G1 and G2 (52% similarity and 30% identity for both) than to cyclin A (46% similarity and 24% identity). Crystallography of cyclin A has defined a new structural motif consisting of two tandem repeats of a five-helix bundle referred to as the “cyclin fold” (10Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E.

The amino acid identity between the cyclin G family and cyclin A is highest in the cyclin box region, yet it extends to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions suggesting that the G family of cyclins possess a cyclin fold structure similar to cyclin A (Fig. 1). The amino-terminal region of cyclin A contributes important residues for CDK binding and structural integrity of cyclin A and is likely to have a similar function for cyclins G1, G2, and I. Cyclin A residues Arg-211 and Asp-240 form a buried salt bridge connecting helix 1 with helix 2 and are essential for cyclin A-CDK activity (9Lees E.M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell.

ATP can cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+(Ca2+i) in embryonic cells and so regulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. We have isolated aXenopus cDNA encoding a novel P2Y receptor, XlP2Y, which is expressed abundantly in developing embryos. Recombinant XlP2Y responds equally to all five naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP, and ITP), which elicit a biphasic Ca2+-dependent Cl− current (I Cl,Ca) where the second phase persists for up to 60 min. XlP2Y also causes a continuous release of Ca2+i and a low level persistent activation ofI Cl,Ca in Xenopus oocytes through the spontaneous efflux of ATP. mRNAs for XlP2Y are expressed transiently in the neural plate and tailbud during Xenopusdevelopment, coincident with neurogenesis.

Receptors for extracellular nucleotides (P2 receptors) are found on the cell surface of all higher animal tissues, where they regulate a broad range of physiological processes (1Burnstock G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have been categorized into two major groups (P2X and P2Y), based on their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties, as well as their molecular structure (2Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 3Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, while P2Y receptors have seven transmembrane domains and belong to the G-protein-coupled-receptor superfamily. To date, seven P2X (P2X1–7) and seven P2Y (P2Y1–7) receptors have been cloned from mammalian and avian species (3Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Different P2Y receptors show preferential selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides; whereas P2Y1 is responsive to ATP but not UTP (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), P2Y2is equally responsive to both ATP and UTP (5Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and P2Y4 is responsive to UTP and much less to ATP (6Nguyen T. Erb L. Weisman G.A.

In most cell types P2Y receptor activation results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, a process catalyzed by PLC-β (12Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell-cell interactions are crucially important during early embryonic development, providing the impetus to establish and maintain different cell fates, regulate morphogenesis, and control cell differentiation (13Jessell T.M. Melton D.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). While most of the current evidence suggests that secreted polypeptide growth factors, such as the fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β superfamilies, are the major intercellular signaling molecules in embryonic development (14Kessler D. Melton D.A. Science. 1994; 266: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), there is some evidence to suggest a role for nonpeptide signaling molecules such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine (15Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a serotonin receptor is expressed in even parasegments at the cellular blastoderm, an expression pattern similar to that of the pair-rule genefushi-tarazu (16Colas J.-F. Launay J.-M. Kellermann O. Rosay P. Maroteaux L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5441-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the role of this receptor inDrosophila development is currently unknown, that it must be functioning is suggested by the presence of ligand at the same stage of development. In Xenopus neurulae, while α-adrenergic receptor antagonists and inhibitors of dopamine β-hydroxylase inhibit neuronal differentiation, exogenous noradrenaline or dopamine can increase the number of neurons differentiating in neural cultures (17Rowe S.J. Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1993; 119: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that endogenous noradrenaline, acting via α-adrenergic receptors, is part of the mechanism controlling neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. Very little is known about the roles of extracellular ATP in early embryonic development, but this molecule has been shown to cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+(Ca2+i) 2The abbreviations used are: Ca2+i, intracellular Ca2+; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 2The abbreviations used are: Ca2+i, intracellular Ca2+; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). concentration in a number of embryonic cell types, including dissociated cells from early chick embryos (18Lohmann F.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar), all important processes during embryonic development. The P2 receptor(s) responsible for most of these ATP-activated developmental signals have not been identified, and none have been cloned, although the response of embryonic chick retina is thought to be mediated by a P2Y receptor responsive to UTP (20Sugioka M. Fukuda Y. Yamashita M. J. Physiol. 1996; 493.3: 855-864Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In this study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel P2Y receptor, XlP2Y, that is expressed during neurulation inXenopus embryos. XlP2Y is equally responsive to all five naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP, and ITP) and, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, exhibits an unusually long response to agonists. Our results show that expression of this receptor occurs transiently during embryonic development, being coincident with the phase of primary neurulation, and suggest that this receptor may play an important role in the early development of neural tissue in Xenopus laevis.DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a cDNA for a G-protein-coupled receptor for extracellular nucleotides (P2Y receptor) that is expressed during early embryonic development in X. laevis. To our knowledge this is the first receptor of this class to be cloned in amphibians, and the first vertebrate P2Y shown to be expressed during early embryonic development.From expression studies in defolliculated Xenopus oocytes, XlP2Y possessed several unique pharmacological features when compared with previously described recombinant P2Y1–7 subtypes. The first major feature involved the duration of biphasic responses to agonists, some 40–60 min for the second phase with any of the naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates. These biphasic responses were considerably longer than the 1–3 min observed following expression of P2Y1, P2Y2, and p2y3 inXenopus oocytes (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G.

Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prolonged membrane currents evoked by XlP2Y activation were carried mainly byI Cl,Ca, based on their sensitivity to 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (43Wu G. Hamill O.P. Pflüger's Arch. 1992; 420: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and thapsigargin (44Thastrup O Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The long duration of XlP2Y responses may not necessarily reflect the situation in the neural plate for a number of reasons, including receptor density, agonist concentration, and receptor/signaling cross-talk. We are currently investigating this issue in neural plate-derived cells.A second unique feature of XlP2Y is the broad agonist selectivity, where all of the naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, CTP, GTP, ITP, and UTP) proved equally effective. None of the previously described (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A.

Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Since defolliculated oocytes are devoid of native P2Y or P2X receptors (31King B.F. Pintor J. Wang S. Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. Burnstock G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar, 32King B.F. Wang S. Burnstock G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494.1: 17-28Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that stimulation of an endogenous receptor contributed to this broad selectivity. A third distinguishing feature of XlP2Y is a low level of continuous activation, probably by the basal efflux of ATP from oocytes, although a constitutive activation of XlP2Y without the need of an agonist cannot be ruled out. The rate of spontaneous release of ATP was 2 nmol/h, although the local concentration of ATP at the surface of the oocyte may be higher. We found the threshold for activation of a macroscopic whole-cell current was in the region of 10 nm, but small differences in the resting conductance of the oocyte membrane may occur at ATP concentrations lower than this level. Webb and colleagues (8Webb T.E. Henderson D. King B.F. Wang S. Simon J. Bateson A.N. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that chick p2y3 expressed in Jurkat cells may be activated by ATP efflux from the host cell, since this P2Y receptor remains desensitized until an ecto-ATPase, apyrase, is added to the bathing medium. A similar desensitization was observed for bovine P2Y1 expressed in Jurkat cells, and relaxed by the addition of apyrase to the bathing medium (45Henderson D.J. Elliot D.G. Smith G.M. Webb T.E. Dainty I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, Nakamura and Strittmatter (46Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that human P2Y1 expressed in oocytes is activated transiently by ATP efflux, which is augmented following the stimulation of stretch-activated mechanosensory ion channels. Thus, it may be the case that all recombinant P2 receptors are partially activated/desensitized in most expression systems, but the prolonged responses of XlP2Y make this feature more noticeable. The persistent activation of XlP2Y expressed in oocytes considerably depolarized these cells, and we are currently looking for a similar effect in neural plate-derived cells.Increases in Ca2+i are a common response to ATP stimulation in many cell types (12Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increases in Ca2+i are thought to play important roles in regulating cell proliferation, migration and differentiation (15Lauder J.M.

In the Urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl, reagents that cause an increase in Ca2+i promote neural development in ectoderm isolated from early gastrulae. Treating gastrula ectoderm with either caffeine or ryanodine has been reported to cause a transitory (10–20 min) release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the ectoderm subsequently differentiating neurons and glia (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, reagents such as the lectin concanavalin A and phorbol esters, which can induce neural development in amphibian ectoderm (48Takata K. Yamamoto K.Y. Ozawa R. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1981; 190: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 49Otte A.P. Van Run P. Heldelveld M. Rian-Driel R. Durston A.J.

A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, preloading gastrula ectoderm with the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA, suppresses neural differentiation in response to dorsal mesoderm, the source of endogenous neuralizing signals (47Moreau M.

These results demonstrate the potential importance of signaling pathways that control Ca2+i levels in neural development. It is therefore of great interest that XlP2Y is expressed in the developing neural plate, and that it can induce prolonged (40–60 min) cellular responses, including increases in Ca2+i.In amphibians, the neural plate forms in the dorsal ectoderm as a result of inductive signals released by the underlying dorsal mesoderm, a process initiated during gastrulation (50Kelley O.G. Melton D.A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The onset ofXlP2Y transcription during the later stages of gastrulation suggests that it is highly unlikely that this receptor mediates a primary neuralizing signal. Instead, it suggests that expression ofXlP2Y is an early response to these signals, and that it might participate in secondary neuralizing signals responsible for establishing different cell identities within the neural plate, the birth of primary neurons, the maintenance of neuronal fates, and the morphogenetic movements whereby the neural plate folds about the midline to form the neural tube. In Xenopus embryos the first neurons do not differentiate until after the neural tube is formed (51Hartenstein V. Neuron. 1989; 3: 399-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 52Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1989; 107: 43-54PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be significant that this coincides with a significant reduction in XlP2Y transcripts. ATP may not be the only neurotransmitter involved in neural development during neural plate stages in Xenopus. Inhibition of dopamine β-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline, during neural plate stages results in a substantial reduction in the number of neurons that differentiate in culture, as do antagonists of the α-adrenergic receptor (17Rowe S.J. Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1993; 119: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of noradrenaline or dopamine increases the number of neurons that differentiated in similar cultures. This suggests that endogenous noradrenaline is part of the mechanism controlling neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. It will be interesting to see what effects, if any, extracellular ATP has on the differentiation of neurons. Receptors for extracellular nucleotides (P2 receptors) are found on the cell surface of all higher animal tissues, where they regulate a broad range of physiological processes (1Burnstock G. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors have been categorized into two major groups (P2X and P2Y), based on their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties, as well as their molecular structure (2Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 3Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, while P2Y receptors have seven transmembrane domains and belong to the G-protein-coupled-receptor superfamily. To date, seven P2X (P2X1–7) and seven P2Y (P2Y1–7) receptors have been cloned from mammalian and avian species (3Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Different P2Y receptors show preferential selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides; whereas P2Y1 is responsive to ATP but not UTP (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), P2Y2is equally responsive to both ATP and UTP (5Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and P2Y4 is responsive to UTP and much less to ATP (6Nguyen T. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Marchese A. Heng H.H.Q. Garrad R.C. George S.R. Turner J.T. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30845-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Communi D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26152-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), while p2y5 and P2Y7bind ATP with a greater avidity than UTP (10Webb T.E. Kaplan M.G. Barnard E.A.

In most cell types P2Y receptor activation results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate to the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, a process catalyzed by PLC-β (12Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-cell interactions are crucially important during early embryonic development, providing the impetus to establish and maintain different cell fates, regulate morphogenesis, and control cell differentiation (13Jessell T.M. Melton D.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). While most of the current evidence suggests that secreted polypeptide growth factors, such as the fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β superfamilies, are the major intercellular signaling molecules in embryonic development (14Kessler D. Melton D.A. Science. 1994; 266: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), there is some evidence to suggest a role for nonpeptide signaling molecules such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine (15Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a serotonin receptor is expressed in even parasegments at the cellular blastoderm, an expression pattern similar to that of the pair-rule genefushi-tarazu (16Colas J.-F. Launay J.-M. Kellermann O. Rosay P. Maroteaux L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5441-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the role of this receptor inDrosophila development is currently unknown, that it must be functioning is suggested by the presence of ligand at the same stage of development. In Xenopus neurulae, while α-adrenergic receptor antagonists and inhibitors of dopamine β-hydroxylase inhibit neuronal differentiation, exogenous noradrenaline or dopamine can increase the number of neurons differentiating in neural cultures (17Rowe S.J. Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1993; 119: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that endogenous noradrenaline, acting via α-adrenergic receptors, is part of the mechanism controlling neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. Very little is known about the roles of extracellular ATP in early embryonic development, but this molecule has been shown to cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+(Ca2+i) 2The abbreviations used are: Ca2+i, intracellular Ca2+; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 2The abbreviations used are: Ca2+i, intracellular Ca2+; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPβS, adenosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). concentration in a number of embryonic cell types, including dissociated cells from early chick embryos (18Lohmann F.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar), all important processes during embryonic development. The P2 receptor(s) responsible for most of these ATP-activated developmental signals have not been identified, and none have been cloned, although the response of embryonic chick retina is thought to be mediated by a P2Y receptor responsive to UTP (20Sugioka M. Fukuda Y. Yamashita M. J. Physiol. 1996; 493.3: 855-864Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel P2Y receptor, XlP2Y, that is expressed during neurulation inXenopus embryos. XlP2Y is equally responsive to all five naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, UTP, CTP, GTP, and ITP) and, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, exhibits an unusually long response to agonists. Our results show that expression of this receptor occurs transiently during embryonic development, being coincident with the phase of primary neurulation, and suggest that this receptor may play an important role in the early development of neural tissue in Xenopus laevis. DISCUSSIONWe have isolated a cDNA for a G-protein-coupled receptor for extracellular nucleotides (P2Y receptor) that is expressed during early embryonic development in X. laevis. To our knowledge this is the first receptor of this class to be cloned in amphibians, and the first vertebrate P2Y shown to be expressed during early embryonic development.From expression studies in defolliculated Xenopus oocytes, XlP2Y possessed several unique pharmacological features when compared with previously described recombinant P2Y1–7 subtypes. The first major feature involved the duration of biphasic responses to agonists, some 40–60 min for the second phase with any of the naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates. These biphasic responses were considerably longer than the 1–3 min observed following expression of P2Y1, P2Y2, and p2y3 inXenopus oocytes (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G.

Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prolonged membrane currents evoked by XlP2Y activation were carried mainly byI Cl,Ca, based on their sensitivity to 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (43Wu G. Hamill O.P. Pflüger's Arch. 1992; 420: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and thapsigargin (44Thastrup O Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar), and long term dependence on extracellular Ca2+ to help replenish Ca2+i stores. The long duration of XlP2Y responses may not necessarily reflect the situation in the neural plate for a number of reasons, including receptor density, agonist concentration, and receptor/signaling cross-talk. We are currently investigating this issue in neural plate-derived cells.A second unique feature of XlP2Y is the broad agonist selectivity, where all of the naturally occurring nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, CTP, GTP, ITP, and UTP) proved equally effective. None of the previously described (4Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18363-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) recombinant P2Y receptors (P2Y1–7) are stimulated by all five nucleotides, while P2Y2 is the only other P2 receptor to be stimulated by ATP and UTP equally (5Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Since defolliculated oocytes are devoid of native P2Y or P2X receptors (31King B.F. Pintor J. Wang S. Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. Burnstock G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar, 32King B.F. Wang S. Burnstock G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494.1: 17-28Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that stimulation of an endogenous receptor contributed to this broad selectivity. A third distinguishing feature of XlP2Y is a low level of continuous activation, probably by the basal efflux of ATP from oocytes, although a constitutive activation of XlP2Y without the need of an agonist cannot be ruled out. The rate of spontaneous release of ATP was 2 nmol/h, although the local concentration of ATP at the surface of the oocyte may be higher. We found the threshold for activation of a macroscopic whole-cell current was in the region of 10 nm, but small differences in the resting conductance of the oocyte membrane may occur at ATP concentrations lower than this level. Webb and colleagues (8Webb T.E. Henderson D. King B.F. Wang S. Simon J. Bateson A.N. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that chick p2y3 expressed in Jurkat cells may be activated by ATP efflux from the host cell, since this P2Y receptor remains desensitized until an ecto-ATPase, apyrase, is added to the bathing medium. A similar desensitization was observed for bovine P2Y1 expressed in Jurkat cells, and relaxed by the addition of apyrase to the bathing medium (45Henderson D.J. Elliot D.G. Smith G.M. Webb T.E. Dainty I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, Nakamura and Strittmatter (46Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that human P2Y1 expressed in oocytes is activated transiently by ATP efflux, which is augmented following the stimulation of stretch-activated mechanosensory ion channels. Thus, it may be the case that all recombinant P2 receptors are partially activated/desensitized in most expression systems, but the prolonged responses of XlP2Y make this feature more noticeable. The persistent activation of XlP2Y expressed in oocytes considerably depolarized these cells, and we are currently looking for a similar effect in neural plate-derived cells.Increases in Ca2+i are a common response to ATP stimulation in many cell types (12Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increases in Ca2+i are thought to play important roles in regulating cell proliferation, migration and differentiation (15Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 25Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). In the Urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl, reagents that cause an increase in Ca2+i promote neural development in ectoderm isolated from early gastrulae. Treating gastrula ectoderm with either caffeine or ryanodine has been reported to cause a transitory (10–20 min) release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the ectoderm subsequently differentiating neurons and glia (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, reagents such as the lectin concanavalin A and phorbol esters, which can induce neural development in amphibian ectoderm (48Takata K. Yamamoto K.Y. Ozawa R. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1981; 190: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 49Otte A.P. Van Run P. Heldelveld M. Rian-Driel R. Durston A.J. Cell. 1989; 58: 641-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), also increase Ca2+i levels (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, preloading gastrula ectoderm with the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA, suppresses neural differentiation in response to dorsal mesoderm, the source of endogenous neuralizing signals (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Since defolliculated oocytes are devoid of native P2Y or P2X receptors (31King B.F. Pintor J. Wang S. Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. Burnstock G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 93-100PubMed Google Scholar, 32King B.F. Wang S. Burnstock G. J. Physiol. 1996; 494.1: 17-28Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that stimulation of an endogenous receptor contributed to this broad selectivity. A third distinguishing feature of XlP2Y is a low level of continuous activation, probably by the basal efflux of ATP from oocytes, although a constitutive activation of XlP2Y without the need of an agonist cannot be ruled out. The rate of spontaneous release of ATP was 2 nmol/h, although the local concentration of ATP at the surface of the oocyte may be higher. We found the threshold for activation of a macroscopic whole-cell current was in the region of 10 nm, but small differences in the resting conductance of the oocyte membrane may occur at ATP concentrations lower than this level. Webb and colleagues (8Webb T.E. Henderson D. King B.F. Wang S. Simon J. Bateson A.N. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that chick p2y3 expressed in Jurkat cells may be activated by ATP efflux from the host cell, since this P2Y receptor remains desensitized until an ecto-ATPase, apyrase, is added to the bathing medium. A similar desensitization was observed for bovine P2Y1 expressed in Jurkat cells, and relaxed by the addition of apyrase to the bathing medium (45Henderson D.J. Elliot D.G. Smith G.M. Webb T.E. Dainty I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, Nakamura and Strittmatter (46Nakamura F. Strittmatter S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10465-10470Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) found that human P2Y1 expressed in oocytes is activated transiently by ATP efflux, which is augmented following the stimulation of stretch-activated mechanosensory ion channels. Thus, it may be the case that all recombinant P2 receptors are partially activated/desensitized in most expression systems, but the prolonged responses of XlP2Y make this feature more noticeable. The persistent activation of XlP2Y expressed in oocytes considerably depolarized these cells, and we are currently looking for a similar effect in neural plate-derived cells. Increases in Ca2+i are a common response to ATP stimulation in many cell types (12Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increases in Ca2+i are thought to play important roles in regulating cell proliferation, migration and differentiation (15Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 25Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). In the Urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl, reagents that cause an increase in Ca2+i promote neural development in ectoderm isolated from early gastrulae. Treating gastrula ectoderm with either caffeine or ryanodine has been reported to cause a transitory (10–20 min) release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the ectoderm subsequently differentiating neurons and glia (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, reagents such as the lectin concanavalin A and phorbol esters, which can induce neural development in amphibian ectoderm (48Takata K. Yamamoto K.Y. Ozawa R. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1981; 190: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 49Otte A.P. Van Run P. Heldelveld M. Rian-Driel R. Durston A.J. Cell. 1989; 58: 641-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), also increase Ca2+i levels (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, preloading gastrula ectoderm with the Ca2+chelator, BAPTA, suppresses neural differentiation in response to dorsal mesoderm, the source of endogenous neuralizing signals (47Moreau M. Leclerc C. Gualandris-Parisot L. Duprat A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12639-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the potential importance of signaling pathways that control Ca2+i levels in neural development. It is therefore of great interest that XlP2Y is expressed in the developing neural plate, and that it can induce prolonged (40–60 min) cellular responses, including increases in Ca2+i. In amphibians, the neural plate forms in the dorsal ectoderm as a result of inductive signals released by the underlying dorsal mesoderm, a process initiated during gastrulation (50Kelley O.G. Melton D.A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 273-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The onset ofXlP2Y transcription during the later stages of gastrulation suggests that it is highly unlikely that this receptor mediates a primary neuralizing signal. Instead, it suggests that expression ofXlP2Y is an early response to these signals, and that it might participate in secondary neuralizing signals responsible for establishing different cell identities within the neural plate, the birth of primary neurons, the maintenance of neuronal fates, and the morphogenetic movements whereby the neural plate folds about the midline to form the neural tube. In Xenopus embryos the first neurons do not differentiate until after the neural tube is formed (51Hartenstein V. Neuron. 1989; 3: 399-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 52Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1989; 107: 43-54PubMed Google Scholar), and it may be significant that this coincides with a significant reduction in XlP2Y transcripts. ATP may not be the only neurotransmitter involved in neural development during neural plate stages in Xenopus. Inhibition of dopamine β-hydroxylase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline, during neural plate stages results in a substantial reduction in the number of neurons that differentiate in culture, as do antagonists of the α-adrenergic receptor (17Rowe S.J. Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1993; 119: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, addition of noradrenaline or dopamine increases the number of neurons that differentiated in similar cultures. This suggests that endogenous noradrenaline is part of the mechanism controlling neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. It will be interesting to see what effects, if any, extracellular ATP has on the differentiation of neurons.

In eukaryotes, DNA topoisomerase I transiently cleaves a single strand of duplex DNA to yield a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate in which the active-site tyrosine is attached to the 3′-phosphate of the broken DNA strand. The transient formation of this protein-linked gate in the DNA allows for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, while conserving the energy of the broken phosphodiester backbone bond. The gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I,TOP1, has been cloned from a variety of sources, including the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, mouse and human, and exhibits a considerable degree of conservation (reviewed in Refs. 1Bjornsti M.-A.

In addition, DNA topoisomerase I constitutes the cellular target of the antitumor drug, camptothecin (reviewed in Refs. 4Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochem. Biophys.

Camptothecin reversibly stabilizes the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate by interfering with the rejoining of the cleaved DNA strand (9Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M.

Numerous studies suggest that during S phase, collision of the replication forks with the drug-stabilized ternary complexes produces double-stranded DNA breaks, an inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell cycle arrest in G2 and cell death (12Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368PubMed Google Scholar, 13D'Arpa P. Beardmore C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6919-6924PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsao Y.-P. D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1823-1829PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism of camptothecin-induced cell killing appears to be conserved in S. cerevisiae, as drug treatment of yeast cells expressing yeast or human TOP1 produces similar effects on cell cycle progression and cell viability (6Bjornsti M.-A.

Since the TOP1 gene is nonessential in yeast (17Goto T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7178-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Thrash C. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G.

For example, yeast strains deleted for the TOP1gene (top1Δ) are resistant to camptothecin, while the expression of yeast or human DNA topoisomerase I from plasmid-borne sequences restores top1Δ cell sensitivity to the drug (16Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar). Camptothecin treatment of TOP1 + yeast cells induces the expression of the DNA damage-responsive genesDIN3 and RNR3 (23Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem.. in press, 1997: 272Google Scholar), while deletion of theRAD52 gene, which is required for recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, enhances cell sensitivity to camptothecin (16Bjornsti M.-A.

The camptothecin-induced toxicity of cells expressing wild-type DNA topoisomerase I has recently been shown to be mediated by the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) pathway (15Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,24Reid R.j.D. Kauh E. A Bjornsti M.A J. Biol. Chem.. in press, 1997: 272Google Scholar). Specific amino acid substitutions in DNA topoisomerase I have been defined that reduce enzyme sensitivity to camptothecin, with little effect on catalytic activity (19Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar, 21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Substitution of Lys for Arg420 in Top1–103p appeared to mimic the action of camptothecin, resulting in DNA damage and RAD9 dependent cell cycle arrest (25Levin N.A. Bjornsti M.-A. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1993; 133: 799-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in yeast Top1p, centering on residue Arg517 or the active-site tyrosine, Tyr727, identified top1mutants that are lethal when expressed from the galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter. Expression of mutants top1T722Aand top1R517G (in which Thr722 was mutated to Ala and Arg517 was changed to Gly, respectively) coincided with a rapid drop in cell viability and the accumulation of a terminal, G2-arrested phenotype, independent of a functionalRAD9 cell cycle checkpoint. Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that top1T722A- and top1R517G-induced cell killing was achieved by distinct mechanisms, as the single amino acid substitutions had different effects on catalytic activity and enzyme sensitivity to camptothecin. Yet, in both cases, cell lethality could be attributed to a stabilization of the covalent reaction intermediate. Apparently, eukaryotic cells are able to repair the low levels of DNA damage that occur as a consequence of wild-type DNA topoisomerase I function; however, the extent of DNA topoisomerase I-induced DNA damage may be exacerbated by mutation or by drug action, producing elevated rates of recombination, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Camptothecin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at a final 4 mg/ml and aliquots stored at −20 °C. S. cerevisiae strains JCW1 (Mat a, his4–539, lys2–801, ura3–52, top1::HIS4), EKY1 (MATα, ura3–52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::HIS3), and EKY3 (MATα, ura3–52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1) have been described (15Kauh E.A.

Christman (University of California San Francisco), respectively. The single copy vector, YCpGAL1-TOP1, contains yeast TOP1under the control of the galactose-inducible pGAL1 promoter (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid BM125 (herein called YCpGAL1) contains thepGAL1 promoter in a URA3, ARS/CENvector (30Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of yeast TOP1 were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of TOP1 sequences cloned into the M13mp19 vector, using a kit supplied by Amersham. Substitution of Phe for the active-site tyrosine, Tyr727, in top1Y727F, has been described (31Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The single mutanttop1R517G (Arg517 mutated to Gly) and the double mutant top1T722A,Y727F (Thr722 changed to Ala, Tyr727 changed to Phe) were generated using the oligonucleotides 5′-AAGTTTTCGGTACATATA-3′ and 5′-CAGGTTTCACTGGGCGCTTCCAAAATCAATTTTATAGACCCTAGAC-3′, respectively. A degenerate oligonucleotide spanning the region around the active-site tyrosine, 5′-GTTTCACTGGGCACTTCCAAAATCAATTATATAG-3′, was synthesized by spiking each nucleotide precursor with 1.7% of the other three nucleotides (32Hill D.E. Oliphant A.R. Struhl K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 558-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This ratio maximized the yield of random single nucleotide substitutions following oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The entire pool of mutated sequences in the M13 RF DNA was excised and used to replace the wild-type TOP1 sequences in plasmid ptacTOP1 (33Bjornsti M.-A. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8971-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Of the individual top1 mutant plasmids identified, ptac-top1T722A, encoded a substitution of Ala for Thr722. To express the top1 mutants from thepGAL1 promoter, DNA fragments bearing the mutations were excised from ptacTOP1 and exchanged for the wild-type sequences in YCpGAL1-TOP1 to yield plasmids YCpGAL1-top1Y727F, YCpGAL1-top1T722A, YCpGAL1-top1T722A, Y727F, and YCpGAL1-top1R517G. The plasmid YCpGAL1-top1R517G, Y727F, was generated by replacing the corresponding wild-type sequences in YCpGAL-top1Y727F with a DNA fragment containing the Arg517 to Gly mutation. For constitutive expression, a 3302-base pair DNA fragment containing the TOP1 coding region and 5′-flanking promoter sequences (ScTOP1) was excised from plasmid pIG (17Goto T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7178-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), then ligated into the SmaI/NheI sites of YEp24 to yield YEpScTOP1. Plasmid YCpScTOP1 was constructed by ligating theScTOP1 sequences from YEpScTOP1 into theApaI/BamHI DNA sites of the ARS/CENvector pRS416 (34Sikorski R. Hieter P.

The indicated top1Δyeast strains were transformed with the YCpGAL1-TOP1 constructs and selected on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% dextrose (SC-uracil, dextrose). To assess cell viability, exponentially growing cultures of individual transformants were serially 10-fold diluted and 5-μl aliquots spotted onto SC-uracil plates supplemented with 2% dextrose or galactose. Alternatively, the cultures were diluted 1:100 into SC-uracil media containing 2% raffinose and, at an OD595 of 0.3, induced with a final 2% galactose. At various time points, aliquots were serially diluted and plated onto SC-uracil, dextrose. Cell viability was assessed following incubation at 30 °C. Yeast strain JCW28 (top1Δ,top2ts) was co-transformed with plasmid YEptopA-PGPD, which constitutively expresses the bacterialtopA gene (35Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and one of the following plasmids; YCpGAL1, YCpGAL1-TOP1, YCpGAL1-top1R517G, YCpGAL1-top1T722A, or YCpGAL1-top1T722A,Y727F. Individual transformations were grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C) in selective dextrose media, diluted into raffinose containing media and induced with 2% galactose at an OD595 of 1.0. After 5 h, half the culture volume was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (35 °C) for an additional 3 h. Intracellular plasmid DNA topology was preserved by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 95% ethanol, 3% toluene, 10 mm EDTA, prechilled to −20 °C (36Johnston L.H. Williamson D.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 164: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were converted to spheroplasts and the plasmid DNAs were purified, resolved in two-dimensional agarose gels (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and blotted onto nylon membrane. The membranes were probed for 2-μm plasmid sequences with a 32P-labeled DNA fragment prepared using a random-primed DNA labeling kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Plasmid DNA topoisomer distributions were visualized by autoradiography. Wild-type and mutant Top1 proteins were purified to homogeneity from galactose-induced cultures of JCW1 cells transformed with YCpGAL-TOP1, YCpGAL1-top1T722A, or YCpGAL1-top1R517G, as described (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified proteins was determined in plasmid DNA relaxation assays, while camptothecin sensitivity was assayed in DNA cleavage assays (21Knab A.M. Fertala J.

For DNA cleavage, a single 3′-end labeled, 944-base pair DNA fragment was purified from plasmid pBlue-site, which is pBluescript II (Stratagene) containing a high affinity DNA topoisomerase I cleavage site (37Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) ligated into theEcoRI site. Approximately 10 ng (5100 cpm) of DNA was incubated with purified preparations of Top1p (37 ng), Top1T722Ap (25 ng), or Top1R517Gp (48 ng) in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 4% Me2SO. Where indicated, camptothecin was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS and heating to 75 °C for 10 min, treated with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K, and the cleaved DNA fragments were resolved in a 7 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. To assess the relative stability of the cleavable complexes formed in the presence or absence of camptothecin, the DNA was incubated with Top1p (25 ng), Top1T722Ap (17 ng), or Top1R517Gp (32 ng) in 250-μl reaction volumes. As above, a final 100 μm camptothecin was added as indicated. After 10 min at 30 °C, a 50-μl aliquot was removed and treated as a no salt control. Additional KCl was added to a final 500 mm in the remaining volume. At the times indicated, 50-μl aliquots were treated with 1% SDS and heating to 75 °C and the extent of DNA cleavage determined as above. Yeast cells were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with DAPI, 1The abbreviation used is: DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and mounted on glass slides with media containing calcofluor, as described (38Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The cells were viewed on a Nikon Optiphot photomicroscope with an epi-fluorescence attachment EF-D mercury set with UV filter block. For rapid staining of DNA in RAD9 and rad9Δstrains, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with dH2O, and fixed in 70% ethanol. After 1 h, the cells were resuspended in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 3–5 μl of DAPI (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Following three successive washes in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), the DAPI-stained cells were mounted and viewed as described above. Yeast cells, fixed in 70% ethanol, were prepared for flow cytometry as described (15Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CY185 cells, transformed with plasmids YCpScTOP1, YCpSctop1T722A, or YCp50, were grown in SC-uracil, -leucine, -adenine, dextrose media, and plated onto sectoring medium (39Holm C. Stearns T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) containing: yeast nitrogen base, ammonium sulfate, 20 mg/liter each of histidine and tryptophan, 100 mg/liter of lysine; 6 mg/liter of adenine, and 2% glucose. The resultant colonies were scored for the presence of red sectors within a white colony. Completely red colonies resulted from the loss of the ADE2marker from the rDNA locus prior to plating, whereas colonies with individual red sectors represented recombination events that occurred after plating. Representative colonies were photographed using Kodak Ektachrome 160T slide film at 8 × magnification. Mutation of conserved amino acid residues in eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I has previously been shown to affect enzyme activity and sensitivity to camptothecin (6Bjornsti M.-A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P.

Substitution of Phe or Ser for the active-site tyrosine in yeast or human DNA topoisomerase I (Tyr727 or Tyr723, respectively) abolishes catalytic activity (31Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R.

In the yeast mutanttop1vac, changing the conserved Ile725-Asn726 residues to Arg-Ala altered the sensitivity of the enzyme to a variety of DNA topoisomerase poisons, without any apparent effect on specific activity (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To expand these studies on DNA topoisomerase I function, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the conserved residues preceding the active-site tyrosine (Tyr727) or of the conserved residues surrounding Arg517 was undertaken as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two mutant alleles,top1T722A, which encodes a Thr722 to Ala substitution, and top1R517G, in which Arg517 is changed to Gly, were cloned under the GAL1 promoter in a single copy ARS/CEN plasmid and transformed intotop1Δ yeast strains. Expression from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter produces a significant increment in TOP1 expression, relative to that obtained with the endogenous yeast TOP1promoter (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This increased level of wild-type DNA topoisomerase I is easily tolerated in top1Δ strains (Fig.1). However, GAL1 promoted expression oftop1T722A or top1R517G produced a substantial drop in yeast cell viability that was evident 2 h following galactose induction (Fig. 1). By 8 h, cell viability had dropped by more than 30-fold in top1T722A expressing cells and 10-fold in top1R517G expressing cells. This time course closely paralleled the accumulation of Top1 protein in these cells, as assessed in immunoblots of crude cell extracts (data not shown). To examine the mechanism oftop1-mediated cytotoxicity, the mutant proteins Top1T722Ap and Top1R517Gp were purified to homogeneity as described (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When incubated in plasmid DNA relaxation assays (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the specific activity of Top1T722Ap was reduced about 3-fold relative to wild-type Top1p (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 2, mutation of Thr722 to Ala increased the stability of the covalent intermediate formed between the mutant enzyme and DNA. In these assays, purified Top1p was incubated with a single, 3′-end labeled DNA fragment in the presence or absence of camptothecin. After 30 min at 30 °C, the covalent complexes were irreversibly trapped by the addition of 1% SDS and heating to 75 °C. The extent of covalent-intermediate formation could then be assessed by resolving the reaction products in a DNA sequencing gel and quantitating the relative amounts of cleaved and intact DNA substrates (21Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the absence of camptothecin, Top1T722Ap produced an average 9.4-fold increase in the intensity of cleaved DNA bands, relative to wild-type Top1p. Although the pattern of cleavage sites differed, this increment in Top1T722A-induced DNA cleavage was comparable to the 7.6-fold increase in DNA cleavage induced by camptothecin plus wild-type Top1p. Upon addition of camptothecin to the Top1T722A-containing reactions, the distribution of cleavage sites reverted to that of wild-type Top1p plus drug. In reactions corrected for protein concentration, overall band intensity was about 1.8-fold higher, suggesting that the Top1T722Ap was actually hypersensitive to camptothecin. Similar results were obtained with shorter incubation times. In contrast, the catalytic activity of Top1R517Gp was only detectable in purified preparations and was reduced ∼1,000-fold relative to wild-type DNA topoisomerase I (data not shown). An increase in Top1R517Gp-mediated cleavage was also observed in the absence of camptothecin, albeit at a small number of sites, such as the high affinity Top1p cleavage site (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 2. Top1R517Gp was resistant to camptothecin, as the pattern of DNA cleavage was unaffected by addition of the drug (Fig. 2). However, the Top1R517Gp-DNA complexes, once formed, appeared to be quite stable. This was evidenced by the increased half-life of the Top1R517Gp-DNA covalent complexes in high salt, relative to those formed either by Top1T722Ap or Top1p in the presence or absence of camptothecin (Fig.3). In all cases, the observed differences in enzyme activities were not due to any detectable differences in DNA binding, as assayed in DNA band shift assays (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest a common mechanism of top1-induced cell killing, resulting from alterations in the stability of the covalent intermediate formed between the mutant enzyme and DNA. As the covalent intermediate is formed by a linkage between the active-site tyrosine (Tyr727) and the 3′-phosphate of the cleaved DNA, such a mechanism o"

Stimulation with vasopressin, bradykinin, epidermal growth factor, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was without effect. Ang II-induced down-regulation of IP3Rs could be detected within 2 h and resulted in an inhibition of IP3-induced Ca2+ release from permeabilized cells. IP3R down-regulation was reversible, and both homo- and heterooligomers of IP3Rs were equally susceptible to Ang II-induced degradation. Chloroquine and NH4Cl increased the basal levels of IP3Rs by 2-fold, suggesting that the basal turnover of IP3Rs occurs via a lysosomal pathway. However, Ang II-induced degradation of IP3R was not affected by these inhibitors, suggesting that stimulated degradation of IP3Rs occurs via a non-lysosomal pathway. The cysteine protease and proteasomal inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal completely prevented Ang II-mediated down-regulation of IP3Rs, whereas the structural analog N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal was without effect. Lactacystin, a highly specific proteasome inhibitor, also blocked Ang II-mediated IP3R degradation. Stimulation with Ang II increased the amount of IP3R immunoprecipitated by anti-ubiquitin antibodies. We conclude that Ang II-stimulated IP3R degradation involves enhanced ubiquitination of the protein and degradation by the proteasome pathway.

Based on metabolic labeling studies, it has been concluded that the decreased expression of IP3Rs caused by carbachol treatment of SHY-SY5Y cells is due to enhanced degradation of IP3R protein rather than an inhibition of receptor biosynthesis (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H.

To further study the mechanisms regulating biosynthesis and degradation of the IP3R protein, we have examined the effect of chronic agonist stimulation of WB cells. This nontransformed, cultured rat liver epithelial cell line (17Tsao M.S. Smith J.D. Nelson K.G. Grisham J.W. Exp.

Affinity-purified polyclonal ubiquitin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Arthur L. Haas (Medical College of Wisconsin) and was also purchased from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Early passage WB cells were kindly given by Dr. Robert Whitson (Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA) and were used between passages 14–20. The cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in Richter's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. At approximately 70% confluence, the cells were serum-deprived for 72 h and then treated with agonists as described in the text. At the end of the treatment period, the medium was aspirated and the plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into 350 μl of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8); 1% Triton X-100 (w/v); 1 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin (WB solubilization buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g, and the soluble lysate was quenched in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.14m β-mercaptoethanol and 5% glycerol). Twenty-five μg of protein was loaded in duplicate on 5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose. Repeated immunoblotting of the same nitrocellulose sheet was carried out after treating blots for 30 min at 60 °C in a stripping buffer containing 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were serum-deprived for 72 h and treated in the presence or absence of 100 nm Ang II for 6 h. Cells were released from the culture plate by trypsin treatment and pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 100 × g). The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4). IP3-induced calcium release was measured with a Ca2+-sensitive mini-electrode using experimental conditions as described previously, except that a final incubation volume of 0.2 ml was used (21Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Williams R.J. Irvine R.F. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3077-3081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WB cells grown in 100-mm dishes were labeled with 5 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the end of the labeling period the medium was removed and the cells were stimulated with 100 nm Ang II for 30 s or 6 h. Where present, losartan was added together with Ang II or 5.5 h after Ang II stimulation. After treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were extracted five times with 2 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether and neutralized by the addition of 0.6 m NaHCO3 and 0.3 m EDTA. The samples were applied to 1-ml Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin columns (formate form, 200–400 mesh), and inositol phosphates were separated by stepwise elution with ammonium formate buffers as described previously (22Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Radioactivity of 4-ml column fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting in 4 ml of True-Count scintillation fluid. After treatment, the medium was removed and the plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into WB solubilization buffer, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. All extracts were precleared with 25 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry ofStaphylococcus aureus cell wall (Pansorbin, Calbiochem). Isoform-specific IP3R Abs were added together with protein A-Sepharose, and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in WB solubilization buffer, analyzed by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. For immunoprecipitations using ubiquitin antibodies, IP3Rs in the lysates were partially purified by heparin-agarose chromatography (23Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates prepared from control and Ang II-treated cells were centrifuged at 25,000 × gand applied to 1-ml heparin-agarose columns (type IIS, Sigma). The column was washed with 8 ml of WB solubilization buffer, and IP3Rs were eluted with 3 ml of WB solubilization buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (23Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control and Ang II-treated eluates were then assayed for protein, and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitations. Eluates from the two columns were split into two aliquots, and each aliquot was immunoprecipitated with type I IP3R Ab (Affinity BioReagents) or ubiquitin Ab (Dako Corp.). Immunocomplexes were processed as described above. For this series of experiments, commercially available type I IP3R Ab (Affinity Bioreagents) and ubiquitin Ab (Dako Corp.) were used for immunoprecipitation, because a lower background was obtained in subsequent ubiquitin Ab immunoblots. However, similar experimental results were obtained with C-terminal type I IP3R Ab or polyclonal ubiquitin Ab (kindly given by Dr. A. Haas). WB rat liver epithelial cells contain predominantly the type I and type III isoforms of IP3Rs (6Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The effect of chronic stimulation of WB cells for 6 h with 100 nm Ang II, 10 nm EGF, 50 nmTPA, 100 nm bradykinin, or 100 nm vasopressin on the levels of both these receptor isoforms is shown in Fig.1 A. It has been previously reported that Ang II, EGF, and vasopressin can elevate cytosolic free Ca2+concentration and activate tyrosine kinases in WB cells (24Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bradykinin also increased cytosolic free Ca2+ in WB cells (data not shown). When WB cells were treated for 6 h with the above agonists, only Ang II specifically down-regulated IP3Rs, whereas EGF, TPA, bradykinin, and vasopressin were ineffective (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1, B andC, shows the cumulative data assembled from densitometric scans of several experiments. Ang II down-regulated the type I and type III isoforms to 12 and 20% of the control levels, respectively (Fig.1, B and C). Type I IP3R levels were not significantly altered by any of the other agonists. However, the other agonists caused a small reduction in type III IP3R expression, with the effect of TPA being statistically significant (p < 0.01). To further assess the specificity of down-regulation, calnexin was studied as a control protein, because, like the IP3R, it is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (26Bergeron J. Brenner M. Thomas D. Williams D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Calnexin functions as a molecular chaperone to several newly synthesized proteins participating in protein folding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. None of the agonists altered the levels of calnexin in WB cells (Fig. 1 A). A prominent band at approximately 100 kDa, consistently observed in type I IP3R Ab immunoblots of total cell lysates, was also not altered by agonist treatment (data not shown). 2This band was not immunoprecipitated by type I IP3R Ab. It was also not recognized on immunoblots by nonimmune serum, type III IP3R Ab, or Ab to type I N-terminal amino acids 401–414 (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the band represents a C-terminal fragment of the IP3R. The data indicate that the effects of Ang II are specific and do not reflect a general down-regulation of integral membrane proteins of the ER. Additional characterization of the effects of Ang II with respect to the time course and dose response is shown in Fig. 2. WB cells were treated for various times with 100 nm Ang II, and the lysates were processed for immunoblotting with IP3R isoform-specific Abs (Fig. 2 A). Densitometric analysis of data from several experiments indicates that down-regulation of both IP3R isoforms can be detected at 2 h, with peak inhibition being observed between 6 and 15 h. Incubation of the cells with Ang II for longer periods resulted in partial recovery of both IP3R isoforms (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 Cshows that Ang II-induced down-regulation occurs in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal down-regulation, requiring approximately 0.1 nm Ang II for both IP3R isoforms. To determine whether down-regulation of IP3Rs modifies intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, we measured IP3-induced Ca2+ release in permeabilized control and Ang II-treated WB cells (Fig.3). ATP was added to initiate the sequestration of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca2+release in response to added IP3 was measured when Ca2+ uptake had reached a steady state. IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from Ang II-treated cells was decreased to 50–60% of the control when measured with subsaturating concentrations of 45 and 150 nmIP3, respectively (Fig. 3 A). No difference between control and Ang II-pretreated cells was observed when Ca2+ release was measured with a saturating concentration of 10 μm IP3 (Fig. 3 B). The relatively modest decrease in IP3-induced Ca2+mobilization induced by Ang II pretreatment compared with the large drop in immunoreactive IP3Rs may be indicative of a substantial IP3 receptor reserve in WB cells. A marked variation in the degree of attenuation of Ca2+ signaling has been observed after carbachol-mediated IP3R down-regulation in SH-SY5Y, cerebellar granule, or Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Simpson P.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether down-regulation of IP3Rs is reversible, WB cells were treated with 100 nm Ang II for 6 h and type I IP3R levels were measured at different times after Ang II was removed. Fig. 4 shows that the immunoreactive type I IP3R had returned to control levels within 18 h after removal of Ang II. A partial reversal of the down-regulation response was seen even with continuous exposure to Ang II (Fig. 4, last two lanes; Fig. 2 B). However, a more complete and rapid recovery was observed when Ang II was removed from the incubation medium. To determine the shortest period of Ang II exposure required to induce IP3R down-regulation, the experiments shown in Fig.5 were carried out. WB cells were treated with Ang II for 15, 30, 60, or 90 min and type I IP3R levels were measured 4 h after the removal of Ang II. A short exposure of cells to Ang II for 30 min was sufficient to initiate IP3R down-regulation when measured 4 h later. Indeed, IP3R down-regulation caused by a transient 1-h exposure to Ang II was comparable to that observed in the continuous presence of Ang II for 4 h (Fig. 5, last two lanes). These data show that the sequence of events committing the cell to IP3R down-regulation is initiated by Ang II within a 1-h exposure and that a continuous exposure to the agonist is not required.Figure 5Down-regulation of IP3R after a short exposure to Ang II and removal. WB cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm Ang II for the times indicated. Ang II was then withdrawn, and type I IP3R was measured after 4 h. For comparison, the last two laneswere exposed to Ang II continuously for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been suggested that the ability of an agonist to maintain a prolonged elevation of IP3 levels in a cell is a causative factor in initiating degradation of IP3 receptors (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether Ang II causes a sustained increase in IP3 levels, WB cells were labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol and IP3measurements were made 30 s or 6 h after Ang II stimulation (Table I). When WB cells were stimulated with Ang II for 30 s, a 3.3-fold increase in IP3 was obtained. This increase was effectively blocked by 1.5 μm losartan, an antagonist of the type I Ang II receptor (28Pieter B.M. Timmermans W.M. Pancras C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A 1.6-fold elevation of IP3 could still be detected 6 h after Ang II stimulation. Addition of losartan at 5.5 h returned IP3 to basal levels, indicating that the occupied Ang II receptor was continuously activating phospholipase C over prolonged periods in WB cells. By contrast, the changes in IP3 levels after vasopressin or EGF stimulation were below the detection limit of our assays at 30 s or 6 h (data not shown).Table IEffect of Ang II treatment on IP3 levelsAdditionsTime of treatment[3H]IP3 levels (% control)Ang II30 s333 ± 27Ang II + losartan30 s138 ± 18Ang II6 h158 ± 15Ang II + losartan6 h110 ± 15WB cells were labeled with 5 μCi/ml ofmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h and treated with Ang II in the presence or absence of 1.5 μm losartan for the times indicated.

The data are the mean ± S.E. from four independent experiments, with each measurement made in duplicate. A pool of type I and type III IP3R isoforms exists as heterotetrameric complexes in WB cells (6Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown that antibodies specific to one IP3R isoform can coimmunoprecipitate additional isoforms (6Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The isoform specificity of the IP3R antibodies has been studied in detail, and it has been established that the coimmunoprecipitation occurs as a consequence of the association of receptor isoforms and not as a result of antibody cross-reactivity (6Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ang II down-regulates hetero-oligomers, WB cells were treated in the presence or absence of 100 nm Ang II for 6 h and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with either type I- or type III-specific Abs (Fig. 6). Each immunoprecipitate was successively immunoblotted with type I and type III IP3R Abs. Both type I and type III IP3R isoforms were decreased by Ang II treatment in lysate samples that were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the same antibody (Fig. 6, A, lanes 1 and 2, and B, lanes 3 and4). This fraction of IP3Rs represents both homo- and hetero-oligomers. Hetero-oligomers represented by the population of type III IP3Rs coprecipitated by type I Ab (Fig.6 B, lanes 1 and 2) or type I IP3Rs coprecipitated by type III Ab (Fig. 6 A,lanes 3 and 4) were also reduced by Ang II treatment. A quantitative assessment of the proportion of hetero-oligomers present in the presence or absence of Ang II is not possible from these experiments because of the inherent difficulties of comparing immunoblots carried out with two different antibodies. Nevertheless, it is clear that IP3Rs present as homo- or hetero-oligomers are both susceptible to down-regulation upon exposure of WB cells to Ang II. Previous studies on the down-regulation of type I IP3R by carbachol in SH-SY5Y cells have established that the effects of agonists are mediated by stimulation of IP3R degradation and does not involve an inhibition of biosynthesis (10Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In WB cells down-regulation of IP3Rs by Ang II was not affected by pretreatment with 6–30 μg/ml cycloheximide, suggesting that the primary effect of Ang II also does not involve changes in receptor biosynthesis (data not shown). Lysosomal proteolysis and proteosomal degradation are the two major pathways of cellular protein degradation. To determine whether lysosomes are involved in the degradation of IP3Rs by Ang II, WB cells were pretreated with th"

This interaction requires the respective bZIP domains, which form a typical bZIP heterodimer with altered DNA binding selectivity. C/EBPα and ATF-2 homodimers bind CRE sites, but ATF-2:C/EBPα heterodimers do not. Heterodimers bind an asymmetric sequence composed of one consensus half-site for each monomer, and may thus have a unique regulatory function.

In contrast, C/EBPα and ATF-2 function cooperatively to activate transcription driven by the asymmetric sequence. Both factors are expressed in liver, where immunoprecipitation experiments show that ATF-2 co-precipitates with C/EBPα. These results are consistent with the interpretation that C/EBPα and ATF-2 can associate in vivo.

The bZIP domain consists of the leucine zipper, a heptad repeat of leucines, preceded by the basic region, a sequence with net positive charge (4Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

The co-crystal structure of the bZIP domain of GCN4 bound to DNA showed that the coiled helices of the leucine zipper separate, positioning one helix from each chain for sequence specific interaction with DNA (10Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Leucine zippers accommodate both homotypic and heterotypic dimerization. For example, the first C/EBP protein characterized, C/EBPα, is one of at least five gene products comprising the C/EBP gene family (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 17Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). These proteins show extensive sequence similarity that is restricted to the bZIP domain, such that each homodimer binds the same DNA element. Additionally, all proteins in the C/EBP family can pair with each other to form DNA binding heterodimers (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 17Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). When not bound to DNA, the subunits of bZIP dimers are in a rapid monomer:dimer equilibrium such that the lifetime of dimers is estimated in seconds (18Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T.Y. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ready dissociation of bZIP dimers in vitro suggests that heterodimers with potentially unique regulatory properties may form in vivo. In the case of Fos, a bZIP protein in the AP1 family, no homodimers form. Instead, Fos forms heterodimers with Jun, another AP1 family protein (20Rauscher III, F.J. Voulaias P.J. Franza B.R. Curran T. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific interaction with DNA increases the lifetime of bZIP dimers more than 10-fold (18Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T.Y. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Patel L. Abate C. Curran T. Nature. 1990; 347: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the apparent DNA affinity constants are lower than might be anticipated (18Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T.Y. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GCN4, a protein that binds the core sequenceTGAGTCA, exhibited similar affinity for a core motif containing an extra nucleotide, TGACGTCA(18Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T.Y. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The structures of GCN4 and Fos:Jun bound to DNA revealed that most of the amino acids involved in base specific contacts are those that are highly conserved among all bZIP proteins (11Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), including those with distinct DNA binding specificity. Thus, the basic mechanism by which bZIP proteins interact with DNA is known, while the determinants of sequence discrimination are less clearly understood. C/EBPα activates transcription of several liver and fat cell-specific genes (22MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

Interestingly, over-expression of C/EBPα in cultured cells results in growth arrest (26Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L.

Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar,30Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J.

The role of C/EBPα in the adipogenic program was further verified by antisense experiments (32Lin F-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and by ectopic expression of C/EBPα in a variety of fibroblastic cell lines, where efficient promotion of fat cell differentiation was observed (33Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Support for the notion that C/EBPα plays a central role in regulating energy homeostasis (34McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was provided by targeted gene disruption. Homozygous C/EBPα knockout mice are born with apparently normal blood glucose levels, but become severely hypoglycemic within minutes (35Wang N. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). These animals exhibit glycogen storage defects and morphological anomalies in fat and liver tissues. Although these defects are consistent with a role for C/EBPα in energy homeostasis, expression of several putative C/EBP target genes was normal (35Wang N. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been difficult to identify genes that are C/EBPα targets in vivo. Activator proteins like C/EBPα bind specific DNA sequences located either upstream or downstream of the core promoter. In response to physiological cues, activators stimulate transcription initiation by interacting with general transcription factors, with TATA-associated factors, or with adaptor proteins (36Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 37Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The observation that C/EBPα binds a range of DNA sequences, coupled with the observation that its subunits exchange rapidly, suggests that the monomer may be a target for regulation. We screened a λgt11 expression cDNA library for proteins that physically interact with C/EBPα. Three independent cDNA clones encoding ATF-2, a bZIP protein, were isolated. We mapped the interacting protein domains to the respective leucine zippers, and demonstrated formation of a bZIP heterodimer with restricted DNA binding selectivity, in vitro. C/EBPα and ATF-2 are expressed in liver, and transient transfection analysis shows that co-transfected ATF-2 impacts C/EBPα function. Together with immunoprecipitation results showing that ATF-2 coprecipitates with C/EBPα, these results are consistent with the interpretation that functional ATF-2:C/EBPα heterodimers form in vivo. pGEX-2T (Pharmacia, Uppsala Sweden) was modified by the insertion of a protein kinase A phosphorylation site as described (38Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). pMSV-C/EBPΔ1–2 (24Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used for construction of N-terminal GST-C/EBP fusions. Truncated constructs lacking the leucine zipper and the bZIP domain were prepared by placing in-frame stop codons at amino acids 310 and 272, respectively (39Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 469-471Google Scholar).MluI digestion and fill-in created the fusion to amino acid 192. Constructs 218–358 and 281–342 have been described (19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A diagram of the fusion proteins is shown (see Fig. 2 A). Our cDNA clones were identical to rat ATF-2 (GenBank accessionM65148), with the exception of 294 nucleotides inserted at nucleotide 393 from the 5′ end. A full-length rat ATF-2 cDNA was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the primer pair 5′-GGATCCATGAGTGATGACAAACCCTTTCTATGCA-3′ and 5′-ATCGATTGCAGGTTTTAATCAACTTCCTGAGGG-3′. ATF-2 fusions to GST were prepared by polymerase chain reaction. The primers used to prepare 1–323 were 5′-GCGGATCCATGAGTGATGACAAACCCTTTCTATGCA-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATTTAACTTGTATTTTGGGTCTGTGGAGT-3′. The primer pairs for 323–492 were 5′-GCGGATCCGGCCGTCGAAGAAGAGCAGCTAATG-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATTGCAGGTTTTAATCAACTTCCTGAGGG-3′. The primer pairs for 323–352 were 5′-GCGGATCCGGCCGTCGAAGAAGAGCAGCTAATG-3′ and 5′-CCATCGATTTAGCATCTTGAAGCTGCTGCTCTATT-3′. A diagram of the fusion proteins is shown (see Fig. 2 B). Polymerase chain reaction products were verified by sequencing. pCMX1 was a gift from Catherine Thompson (Carnegie Institution of Washington) and was used in coupled transcription-translation reactions. C/EBPα and ATF-2 were subcloned as BamHI (24Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and BamHI/KpnI fragments, respectively. CREB was produced by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (BamHI/EcoRI) with the primer pair 5′-GCGGATCCATGACCATGGACTCTGGAGCAGACAA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAATCTGACTTGTGGCAGTAAAGGTCC-3′. In vitrotranslation products were verified by [35S]Met incorporation and SDS-PAGE analysis. The reporter vector 2X C/EBP-Luc contains two direct repeats of the consensus C/EBPα-binding site, TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA, and was a gift from P. Rorth (Carnegie Institution of Washington). 2X C/EBP-Luc has the minimal thymidine kinase promoter (40McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and aBamHI site for proximal insertion of transcription factor-binding sites. Three iterations of the chimeric binding site (5′-GCCGTGACGCAATCTC-3′) were inserted into the thymidine kinase promoter/luciferase vector, producing the reporter 3X Chimera-Luc. A GST (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 67: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5043) Google Scholar) fusion protein encoding C/EBPα amino acids 1–10 fused to amino acids 60–358 (see Fig. 2 A) was radiolabeled with protein kinase A (Sigma) as described (33Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled protein was used for interaction screening immediately. A λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) prepared from rat liver mRNA was plated for screening essentially as described (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Filters were blocked for 1 h in Hyb75 (50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5% nonfat milk. Radiolabeled GST-C/EBPα was added at 100,000 cpm/ml in Hyb75, 5% nonfat milk, 25 ml/filter, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Filters were washed 3 × for 5 min each at 4 °C in 50 ml/filter of Hyb75, 0.25% nonfat milk. Filters were dried briefly and exposed to film. Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain BL21. Log phase cultures were induced at an OD600 of 0.8 for 2 h. Cells were harvested, and GST (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 67: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5043) Google Scholar) or MBP (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) fusion proteins were purified according to established protocols. Detailed purification of “C/EBP short” was described previously (19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ATF-2 cDNA (EcoRI) was subcloned into the vector pMal (New England Biolabs), for protein expression in bacteria. MBP-ATF-2 was affinity purified, and the antigen was excised from a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Purification of an NH2-terminally deleted C/EBPα protein (C/EBPα short) was described previously (19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This protein was used to prepare antiserum. Antisera were raised according to standard protocols, and appropriate reactivity was verified against recombinant proteins. The specificities of all antisera were verified against purified recombinant proteins. ATF-2 and C/EBPα antisera do not cross-react against purified recombinant proteins. 2.5 mg of MBP-ATF-2 was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Following the removal of lipids with Seroclear (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA), clarified serum was passed 3 × over a 0.2-ml bed of MBP-ATF-2 equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. Columns were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with 750 μl of 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.0), dripping directly into 750 μl of 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 9.2) for neutralization. Affinity purified antibody was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline to remove glycine, and biotinylated as described (43Kendall C. Ionescu-Matiu I. Dreesman G.R. J. Immunol. Methods.56. 1983: 329-339Google Scholar). This protocol was adapted for purification and biotinylation of the antisera against intact C/EBPα, kindly provided by Pernille Rorth, and C/EBPα short proteins. Proteins from SDS-PAGE were electroblotted to Immobilon P membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore) and developed with polyclonal antiserum. Secondary detection utilized horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit serum (Amersham), which was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Amersham). For biotinylated antibodies, secondary detection utilized streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) and ECL reagent. To map protein interaction domains, equal amounts of each truncated protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and incubated in Hyb150 containing soluble GST-C/EBP (ATF-2 proteins on the membrane) or soluble GST-ATF-2 (C/EBP proteins on the membrane). After 4 washes, the interaction of soluble protein with membrane-bound protein was probed with specific antiserum. Equivalent amounts of MBP or MBP-ATF-2 were coupled to Sepharose 4B. 100-μl columns were equilibrated in Hyb150 (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). 70 μg of rat liver nuclear extract (RLNE) was loaded onto each column, and washed with 15 volumes of Hyb150. Protein was eluted stepwise with 1.8 volumes of buffer containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl. Equivalent percentages of the unbound and eluted fractions were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analysis. Protein-DNA complexes were formed in standard TBE gels (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Binding reactions (10 μl) were 10 min at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05 μg/μl poly(dI-dC). Full-length C/EBP, ATF-2, and CREB were prepared by coupled in vitro transcription/translation (TNT, Promega, Madison, WI). The three DNA probes were radiolabeled to comparable specific activities. One strand of each probe is shown. Consensus C/EBP site: 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′; CRE site: 5′-GATCAGCATTACCTCATCCC-3′, from the junpromoter (44van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. De Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); chimeric site: 5′-GATCGCCGTGACGCAATCTC-3′. All reactions were performed in probe excess, but free probe was run off the gels to improve the resolution of heterodimeric complexes from homodimeric complexes. Freshly prepared RLNE (45Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) was pre-cleared with an irrelevant antiserum and protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies). After a brief spin, supernatants were separated and adjusted to 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 15% glycerol, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40. 3 μl of affinity purified antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Precipitates were collected onto protein A beads and washed 5 × with 500 μl of 50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, proteins were detected with biotinylated, affinity purified antibodies and visualized as described above. For co-immunoprecipitation, primary precipitates were formed with the first affinity purified antibody (as above), separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and detected with a second antibody (affinity purified and biotinylated) as above. 20 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide-binding sites were included where indicated, and blots were developed as described above. The hepatoma cell line Fao (46Deschatrette J. Weiss M.C. Biochimie. 1974; 56: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was transfected by the standard calcium phosphate method (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pCMX1-βGal, a gift from C. Thompson, was included in all transfections to normalize the data. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and relative luciferase (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI) and β-Gal activities (Promega) were determined in duplicate, and the average was determined. Cells transfected with the reporter vector alone determined relative luminescence. All results are the average of three independent experiments. To search for proteins that physically interact with C/EBPα, a rat liver expression cDNA library was screened with a radiolabeled GST-C/EBPα fusion protein. From 2 × 106 phage screened, eight positive cDNAs were isolated. The phage inserts were subcloned and sequenced, revealing that three of them encoded the bZIP protein ATF-2, a member of the ATF/CREB transcription factor family. The interaction between ATF-2 and C/EBPα was specific as both GST-GCN-4, a yeast bZIP protein, and GST failed to interact with ATF-2 in this assay (not shown). To test whether ATF-2 and C/EBPα would interact under more stringent conditions, rat liver nuclear extract (RLNE) was fractionated on a column displaying ATF-2 (fused to MBP). As a specificity control, a column displaying MBP alone was run in parallel. Equivalent percentages of the unbound fraction and the salt eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and probed with C/EBPα antiserum. Multiple forms of C/EBPα are expressed in the liver, including the full-length protein (42 kDa) and several internal translation initiation products (47Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 48An M.R. Hsieh C.C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MBP-ATF-2 affinity column, but not the MBP column alone, selectively binds all forms of C/EBPα present in the nuclear extract (Fig. 1, compare the eluates from the two columns). Note that elution of C/EBPα from the ATF-2 column requires 0.5–1.0m KCl, an indication of a relatively high affinity interaction. To map the domains required for interaction between C/EBPα and ATF-2, a sequential deletion strategy was used. C/EBPα deletion constructs were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, and purified on glutathione-agarose. Equivalent amounts of each protein were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated with purified GST-ATF-2, washed extensively, and subsequently developed with anti-ATF-2 serum. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST-C/EBP constructs containing the leucine zipper bound soluble GST-ATF-2 efficiently (lanes 1, 4, 5, and 6). Analogously, truncated versions of ATF-2, similarly prepared as GST fusions, were tested for the ability to bind soluble C/EBPα (Fig. 2 B). Again, only those constructs containing the leucine zipper efficiently retained soluble C/EBPα (lanes 1 and 3). The weak binding observed in the absence of the leucine zippers (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2) is likely due to the putative zinc finger motif in ATF-2 and will be addressed under “Discussion.” As controls, each blot (Fig.2, A and B, respectively) was incubated with antiserum without prior exposure to soluble proteins, showing that the antisera for C/EBPα and ATF-2 are not cross-reactive (not shown). These results show that the leucine zippers are sufficient to mediate interaction between these bZIP proteins. Formation of an ATF-2:C/EBPα heterodimer would bring together different DNA-binding domains, which may lead to a change in DNA binding selectivity. To assay for DNA binding heterodimers, three DNA sites were tested in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA): a consensus C/EBP-binding site; a consensus CRE-binding site; and a chimeric site consisting of one C/EBP half-site directly abutted to one CRE half-site. To distinguish heterodimeric DNA binding complexes from homodimeric DNA binding complexes, a truncated C/EBPα protein encompassing the bZIP domain (19Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was used. DNA binding complexes formed with one short C/EBPα subunit and one full-length C/EBPα, ATF-2, or CREB subunit migrate intermediate to DNA binding complexes composed of two full-length or two short subunits (homodimers), and demonstrate subunit exchange. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both full-length (lane 4) and short (lane 2) C/EBPα homodimers shift the consensus C/EBP-binding site. When full-length and short C/EBPα are mixed, a shift of intermediate migration is observed (lane 3), showing that subunits exchanged. ATF-2 homodimers do not shift this probe (lane 7), and no ATF-2:C/EBPα heterodimers are evident upon co-incubation with the short C/EBPα protein (lane 6). As expected, CREB homodimers bind the probe (lane 10), and no heterodimeric complex forms when CREB and C/EBPα short are mixed (lane 9). When a radiolabeled CRE site is tested (Fig. 3 B), a shift is observed with C/EBPα (lanes 2–4). When C/EBPα short and ATF-2 are mixed, it is predominantly ATF-2 homodimers that shift the probe (lanes 5–7). Although both homodimers bind, no heterodimeric DNA binding complex is observed (see lane 6). Analogous results are obtained when C/EBPα and CREB are mixed (lanes 8–10), where the predominant shift is by CREB homodimers, and no heterodimeric complex is detected (lane 9). Upon EMSA analysis using the chimeric binding site (Fig.3 C), a gel shift complex of intermediate migration is observed (lane 6), which is consistent with formation of an ATF-2:C/EBPα heterodimer. In fact, C/EBPα, ATF-2, and CREB homodimers (lanes 4, 7, and 10, respectively) all bind the chimeric sequence. T"

A. F., & Westwick, J. (1995) Br. J. Pharmacol.116, 2866–2872). IL-13 is a potent inhibitor of cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression and nitric oxide generation in HT-29 cells via an unknown mechanism. We report here that in HT-29 cells, IL-13 induces a concentration and time-dependent increase in the formation of the lipid products of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase, namely phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. IL-13 also induces a parallel concentration and time-dependent increase in thein vitro lipid kinase activity present in immunoprecipitates of the p85 regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase. In addition, we also demonstrate that IL-13 stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor molecule insulin receptor substrate 1, which may facilitate receptor coupling to PtdIns 3-kinase. Both the increases in D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipids and the increased in vitro lipid kinase activity of p85 immunoprecipitates were inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002. Inhibition of the PtdIns 3-kinase activity was paralleled by a reversal of the ability of IL-13 to inhibit iNOS mRNA expression and nitrite generation in HT-29 cells.

In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes, IL-13 also acts as a suppressor of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type α, IL-1, and IL-6), chemokines (e.g.IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α), and hematopoietic growth factors (e.g. granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) expression by activated monocytes/macrophages or endothelial cells (1Minty A.

Another target of IL-13 is epithelial cells, and we have recently demonstrated that IL-13 can modulate IL-8 generation from the human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 (7Kolios G. Robertson D.A.F. Jordan N.J. Minty A. Caput D. Ferrara P. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Little is currently known about IL-13 signal transduction, although evidence points to similarities with IL-4 signal transduction. For instance, IL-13 can cross-compete with IL-4 for binding, leading to the suggestion that their receptors (IL-4R and IL-13R) share a common component (8Zurawski S.M. Vega F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Both the IL-4Rα chain and the common γ chain subunit have been proposed as likely shared components (9Kondo M. Takeshita T.

More recently, it has been proposed that the IL-13R may comprise the recently cloned IL-13Rα chain (12Aman M.J. Tayebi N. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Modi W.S. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29265-29270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), an IL-13-binding protein related to the IL-5 receptor α chain (13Caput D. Laurent P. Kaghad M.

A common receptor may explain the observations that IL-4 can mimic every cellular response mediated by IL-13. In contrast, human T cells and mouse T and B cells respond to IL-4 but not to IL-13 (14Callard R.E. Matthews D.J. Hibbert L. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 108-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Unlike other cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 do not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc or its association with Grb-2, and they do not activate the mitogen-activated family of protein kinases such as extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (11Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, Janus family kinases and STAT proteins have been shown to be significant signal transduction components of cytokine receptors (15Lin J.X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedman M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou I. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Indeed, the IL-4Rα chain associates with JAK1, whereas the common γ chain associates with JAK3, and both are required for IL-4 activation of STAT-6 (15Lin J.X. Migone T.S. Tsang M. Friedman M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). IL-4 and IL-13 share the ability to induce phosphorylation of several cellular proteins including the IL-4Rα chain itself (11Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 377: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). IRS-2, like its homolog, IRS-1, contains multiple specific YXXM motifs, which after tyrosine phosphorylation may bind the SH2 domains of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase, which associates through SH2 domains in the p85 subunit with proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinases (20Sun X.J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Indeed, several groups have shown that phosphorylation of the 170-kDa protein results in its tight association with PtdIns 3-kinase after IL-4 and IL-13 treatment (11Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,19Lefort S. Vita N. Reeb R. Caput D. Ferrara P.

PtdIns 3-kinase belongs to a growing family of lipid kinases (23Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and can potentially generate three products: phosphatidylinositol-(3)-monophosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol-(3,4)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which are referred to collectively as D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipids (reviewed in Ref. 24Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). PtdIns 3-kinase may in fact be a multifunctional molecule because the different lipid products formed by the p110 catalytic subunit (24Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) may mediate different functions such as trafficking of cell-surface receptors (e.g. PtdIns(3)P) and cell signaling (e.g.PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (24Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Moreover, the p85 subunit may act as an adaptor molecule that facilitates protein-protein interactions via its SH2 and SH3 domains and/or its proline-rich regions (24Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 25Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The significance of the association of PtdIns 3-kinase with IRS-2 after IL-4 and IL-13 treatment has yet to be established, but IL-4 treatment of mast cells, myeloid cells, and T cells results in the accumulation of D-3 phosphatidylinoistol lipids (26Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the function of PtdIns 3-kinase is probably not restricted to that of a p85 subunit-mediated adaptor function and that the putative signaling cascade regulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 contributes to IL-4 signaling. Recent advances in understanding the role of PtdIns 3-kinase as an upstream element in an important signaling pathway have largely been made possible by the availability of inhibitors of the enzyme, in particular the fungal metabolite wortmannin (27Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and the structurally unrelated synthetic quercetin derivative LY294002 (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin irreversibly inhibits, at concentrations up to 100 nm (K i 1–10 nm), both the lipid kinase and serine kinase activity of PtdIns 3-kinase through covalent interaction with the p110 catalytic subunit (29Wymann M.P. Bugaelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). With the possible exception of a soluble PtdIns 4-kinase (30Nakanishi S. Catt K. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and phospholipase A2 (31Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), PtdIns 3-kinase is the only high-affinity target for wortmannin in mammalian cells, but higher concentrations (>1 μm) have been shown to inhibit other enzymes and signaling pathways (25Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 27Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Because wortmannin inhibits several cellular responses and biochemical events initiated by a variety of receptors in numerous cell systems (reviewed in Ref. 25Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), PtdIns 3-kinase has been implicated in the regulation of a growing number of diverse physiological events, in particular cell growth and proliferation (25Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that epithelial cells of the colonic mucosa derived from patients with ulcerative colitis are a rich source of the nitric oxide-generating enzyme iNOS, 2G. Kolios, N. Rooney, C. Murphy, D. Robertson, and J. Westwick, submitted for publication. 2G. Kolios, N. Rooney, C. Murphy, D. Robertson, and J. Westwick, submitted for publication. which belongs to a family of nitric-oxide synthases (32Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar) responsible for the production of nitric oxide, an important molecular messenger that has been implicated in sepsis, ischemia, and inflammation (33Nathan C. Qiao-wen X. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 can be used to express iNOS mRNA, protein, and nitrite in response to a mixture of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α, TNF-α, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (34Kolios G. Brown Z. Robson R. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, iNOS expression can be inhibited by pretreatment of the HT-29 cells with IL-13 or IL-4, but not by IL-10.2 Thus, we have used the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29 to explore the signaling mechanism of IL-13-induced suppression of iNOS induction. In this report, we describe the activation of the PtdIns 3-kinase signaling pathway after IL-13 treatment in HT-29 cells and that inhibition of this signaling pathway reverses the suppressive effect of IL-13 on iNOS expression and activity that is induced in response to a combination of IL-1α, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase may be a pivotal pathway in determining the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-13. Human recombinant IL-13 was kindly provided by Dr A. Minty (Sanofi Elf Bio Recherches, Laberges, France). Human recombinant IL-1α (specific activity, 5 × 107units/mg) and TNF-α (specific activity, 6 × 107units/mg) were generous gifts from Glaxo (Greenford, United Kingdom) and Bayer (Slough, United Kingdom), respectively. Human recombinant IFN-γ (specificity, >2.0 × 107 units/mg) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Mouse p85α monoclonal antibody (mAb) was a gift from Doreen Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). 4G10 phosphotyrosine mAb (αPY) as well as the rabbit IRS-1 and IRS-2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. All cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. 2,3-Diaminonapthalene was purchased from Lancaster Synthesis Ltd. 5′-Digoxigenin-labeled probe for iNOS was a mixture containing 3 antisense 30-mer oligonucleotides purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). Wortmannin and standard phosphatidylinositol lipids were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) was purchased from Affiniti (Exeter, United Kingdom). The human colon epithelial carcinoma cell line HT-29 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. Cells were cultured in humidified incubators at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone. For experiments, HT-29 cells were seeded at 2–3 × 104 cells/ml until confluent. Confluent cells were washed and cultured in fresh medium without fetal bovine serum 24 h before stimulation. Growth-arrested cells were treated with the appropriate concentrations of stimuli in medium without serum and incubated as described above. Cell counting and viability were checked by trypan blue exclusion at the beginning and the end of each experiment using representative wells. Cell viability was always greater than 95%. Nitric oxide production by HT-29 cells was determined by measuring the stable end-product nitrite in the cell culture supernatants by flourometric assay that is based upon the reaction of nitrite with 2,3-diaminonapthalene to form the fluorescent product 1-(H)-naphthotriazole, as described previously (35Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). 200 μl of freshly prepared 2,3-diaminonapthalene (0.05 mg/ml in 0.62 m HCl) were added in 2 ml of sample and mixed immediately. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the reaction was terminated with 100 μl of 2.8 N NaOH. The samples were measured using a Photon Technology International Inc. dual-wavelength spectrofluorometer (excitation at 365 nm and emission at 405 nm) and compared with known concentrations of sodium nitrite. The sensitivity of the assay is 10 nm. Total cellular RNA from HT-29 cells was isolated as described previously (34Kolios G. Brown Z. Robson R. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Streiter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.G. Phan S.H. Ward P.A. Marks R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT-29 monolayers were solubilized in a solution containing 25 mmTris (pH 8.0), 4 m guanidine isothiocyanate, 0.5% (v/v) Sarcosyl, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. After homogenization, the above-described suspension was added to an equal volume of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) SDS. The RNA was then extracted with chloroform-phenol (1:1, v:v) and chloroform-isoamyl (24:1, v:v). The total RNA was alcohol-precipitated, and the pellet was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The concentration of RNA was measured by obtaining the absorbance at A 260 andA 280 nm, and 10 μg of RNA was loaded into each well of the agarose gel. Total RNA was separated by electrophoresis using formaldehyde and 1% (w/v) agarose gels and transferred overnight to nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) by capillary blotting, and iNOS mRNA was detected using a digoxigenin luminescent detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were baked at 120 °C for 20 min and then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes (10 ng/ml) for iNOS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound probes were detected using anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase with lumigen PPD (Boehringer Mannheim) as the chemiluminescent substrate. Blots were exposed after hybridization to x-ray film. Equivalent amounts of total RNA loaded/lane were assessed by monitoring 18 and 28 S RNA (34Kolios G. Brown Z. Robson R. Robertson D.A.F. Westwick J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 3.5 × 106 cells/ml were stimulated and incubated at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmiodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were performed for 2 h at 4 °C as described (37Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to in vitro lipid kinase assays as described (37Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23862-23869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a lipid mixture of 100 μl of 0.1 mg/ml PtdIns and 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine dispersed by sonication in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and 100 μm ATP to the immunoprecipitates suspended in 80 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was terminated after 15 min, and phospholipids were then separated by TLC (37Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23862-23869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When appropriate, cells were lysed after stimulation by IL-13 as already described. Immunoprecipitates were generated using either anti-p85 (1 μg/ml), anti-IRS-1 (1 μl/ml), or anti-IRS-2 (1 μl/ml) antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated samples for immunoblotting were electrophoresed through 10% acrylamide gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schull) as described previously (11Welham M.J.

Blots were probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (0.5 μg/ml), and proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham) with a goat anti-mouse Ig (0.1 μg/ml) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Dako). When appropriate, blots were completely stripped of antibodies by incubation at 55 °C for 60 min with stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After extensive washing, blots were reblocked before reprobing. 4 × 108 HT-29 cells were labeled with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) as described (39Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled HT-29 cells were aliquoted at 107 cells/120 μl and stimulated as described in the figure legends, and phospholipids were extracted with 750 μl of chloroform:methanol:H2O (32.6:65.3:2.1%, v/v/v, respectively) as described (39Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The samples were deacylated and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC analysis using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman) (39Ward S.G. Wilson A. Turner L. Westwick J. Sansom D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The eluate was fed into a Canberra Packard A-500 Flo-One on-line radiodetector, and the results were analyzed by the Flo-One data program (Radiomatic). Eluted peaks were compared with retention times for standards prepared from 3H-labeled phosphatidylinositol lipids (Amersham) and 32P-labeled D-3 phosphatidylinositols as described elsewhere (39Ward S.G.

To investigate the signaling mechanisms activated by IL-13 treatment, 32P-labeled HT-29 cells were stimulated with IL-13, and the outcome on PtdIns 3-kinase activation was determined by measuring the accumulation of D-3 phosphatidylinositol lipids. Treatment of HT-29 cells with IL-13 (0.3–30 ng/ml) resulted in the concentration-dependent accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was transient, with maximum accumulation occurring at 30 s post-IL-13 treatment (Fig. 1 B). The levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 had declined back to basal levels within 10 min of IL-13 treatment. In addition, IL-13 also induced the accumulation of another D-3 phosphatidylinositol, namely PtdIns(3,4)P2. However, the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 occurred with slower kinetics, such that maximum accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 occurred at 1 min post-IL-13 treatment (Fig. 1 B), although the levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 also declined back to basal levels within 10 min.

In addition to GAL4-VP16, the SWI/SNF complex stimulated nucleosome binding by the Zn2+ fingers of Sp1, the basic helix-loop-helix domain of USF, and the rel domain of NF-κB. In each case SWI/SNF action resulted in the formation of a stable factor-nucleosome complex that persisted after detachment of SWI/SNF from the nucleosome. Thus, stimulation of factor binding by SWI/SNF appears to be universal. The degree of SWI/SNF stimulation of nucleosome binding by a factor appears to be inversely related to the extent that binding is inhibited by the histone octamer. Cooperative binding of 5 GAL4-VP16 dimers to a 5-site nucleosome enhanced GAL4 binding relative to a single-site nucleosome, but this also reduced the degree of stimulation by SWI/SNF. The SWI/SNF complex increased the affinity of 5 GAL4-VP16 dimers for nucleosomes equal to that of DNA but no further. Similarly, multimerized NF-κB sites enhanced nucleosome binding by NF-κB and reduced the stimulatory effect of SWI/SNF. Thus, cooperative binding of factors to nucleosomes is partially redundant with the function of the SWI/SNF complex.

In eukaryotic cells the DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, the primary order of chromatin structure that provides an inherent barrier for activator proteins and the basal transcription machinery. There are several mechanisms that help transcription factors contend with nucleosomal DNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Owen-Hughes T.A. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar and 2Steger D.J. Workman J.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). One such mechanism involves energy-dependent remodeling of chromatin, which allows transcription factors to access otherwise inaccessible promoters. Such activities have been purified from yeast (3Cairns B.R. Kim Y-J. Sayer M.H. Laurent B.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The first of these activities to be identified was the yeast SWI/SNF complex.SWI/SNF was originally identified in yeast as a set of positive regulators of the HO gene (mating type switch, SWI) and theSUC2 gene (sucrose non-fermenting, SNF) (reviewed in Ref.10Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The connection to chromatin was revealed when mutant suppressors were identified in histones as well as in other chromatin proteins (11Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar,12Kruger W. Peterson C.L. Sil A. Coburn G. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Herskowitz I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2770-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These SWI/SNF proteins were biochemically isolated as an 11-subunit complex of approximately 2 megadaltons. Members of this complex include SWI1, SWI2-SNF2, SWI3,SNF5, SNF6 (3Cairns B.R. Kim Y-J. Sayer M.H. Laurent B.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3308-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), although the latter two do not demonstrate a swi− phenotype. The SWI2-SNF2 subunit contains a conserved ATPase domain and has been shown to function as a DNA-dependent ATPase. This domain is required for SWI/SNF function in vivo(16Laurent B.C. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SWI/SNF homologs have also been identified in mammals and have a conserved function. In contrast to yeast, however, multiple forms of the complexes can be found within the same cell (17Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Two SWI2-SNF2 homologs (brm and BRG1) have been identified in mouse and human systems. Both are found in large (2-megadalton) complexes, but each is present in separate complexes (8Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments showed that ySWI/SNF can enhance the binding of GAL4 derivatives to nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent reaction (18Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). This enhancement required only the GAL4 DNA binding domain and was accompanied by an ATP-dependent disruption of histone-DNA contacts. The human SWI/SNF complex was also shown to enhance the binding of GAL4 derivatives (7Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 8Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) as well as TBP to nucleosomes (19Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).The SWI/SNF complex is able to disrupt nucleosome structure in a sequence-independent manner (20Utley R.T. Owen-Hughes T.A. Juan L-J. Côté J. Adams C.A. Workman J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 276-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Côté J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) suggesting that it may be able to function at diverse promoters. Consistent with this possibility is the fact that transcription of a set of diversely regulated genes was found to require SWI/SNF. These genes include HO, SUC2,ADH1–2, INO1, Ty elements, and to some degree the GAL1–10 genes (10Winston F. Carlson M. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In addition, certain yeast activators as well as the function of several heterologous activators were shown to require the SWI/SNF complex in yeast (22Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 23Laurent B.C. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, transcription of several other yeast genes does not depend on the SWI/SNF complex in vivo. For example, transcription of thePHO5 gene is SWI/SNF-independent (13Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2131-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, transcription from several yeast promoters or from artificial promoters driven by heterologous activators in yeast is differentially affected by mutations in the SWI/SNF subunit Swp73 (13Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2131-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The differential requirement for SWI/SNF function in different promoter contexts might be explained in part by at least two possibilities. First, SWI/SNF function may be available to only a subset of transcriptional activators. In other words, the disruption of DNA-histone interactions by the SWI/SNF complex may be effectively exploited by activators with particular DNA binding domains but insufficient to enhance the affinity of others. Second, SWI/SNF function may be redundant with alternative mechanisms mediating access of transcription factors to binding sequences in chromatin. To test these possibilities we have analyzed the ability of the SWI/SNF complex to stimulate nucleosome binding by transcription factors with diverse DNA binding domains and whether stimulation by SWI/SNF was affected by cooperative binding of activators to nucleosomes.RESULTSWhen bound to nucleosomes, the SWI/SNF complex alters the path of DNA bending around the nucleosome core in an ATP-dependent reaction that does not by itself displace the underlying histones (18Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar,21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Côté J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). While the structural basis of this alteration is unknown, it results in the enhanced binding of GAL4 derivatives (7Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 18Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and TBP to nucleosome cores (19Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In principle, GAL4 and TBP could occupy nucleosomal DNA without major steric clashes with the histone octamer (19Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 32Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Thus, SWI/SNF-induced alteration of the path of DNA bending around the histone octamer might suffice to stimulate binding of these factors by providing optimum exposure of their binding sites on the nucleosome surface. A priori, it would seem less likely that this mechanism would effectively stimulate the binding of factors with DNA binding domains that surround the DNA helix.To determine whether different types of DNA binding domains affected a factor's ability to exploit SWI/SNF disruption of nucleosomes, we tested 3 different transcription factors for ySWI/SNF stimulation of nucleosome binding. These included Sp1, which has three Zn2+ fingers in its DNA binding domain interacting with 9 consecutive base pairs essentially covering a turn of the DNA helix (33Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar), USF, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to DNA as a dimer with the two basic regions of the monomers bound to the major groove on opposite sides of the helix essentially grasping DNA like a scissors (34Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and NF-κB, which belongs to the rel domain family of proteins of which the entire rel homology region is required for DNA binding. The crystal structure of the p50 homodimer form of NF-κB demonstrated a new mode of DNA binding that is very different from those of previously characterized transcription factors. The p50 homodimer wraps itself around DNA almost completely surrounding the DNA helix (35Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 36Ghosh G. Van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Nucleosome-length DNA fragments bearing DNA binding sites for each of these respective factors were reconstituted into nucleosome cores. Fig. 1 A shows a mobility shift assay demonstrating that each of the DNA fragments used in the following experiments were 90–95% reconstituted into nucleosomes.DNase I footprinting was employed to assay the ability of SWI/SNF to stimulate binding to nucleosomes by each of these factors. An analysis of Sp1 binding is shown in Fig. 1 B. Reconstitution of the DNA fragment bearing the Sp1 recognition sequence resulted in a pattern of DNase I cutting that was distinct from that of naked DNA (comparelanes 1 and 5). When the nucleosomes were treated with the SWI/SNF complex, the DNase cutting pattern was perturbed (compare lanes 5 and 9), illustrating SWI/SNF interaction with these nucleosomes. While Sp1 readily bound the mock-reconstituted naked DNA control resulting in a clear footprint at 1 nm Sp1 (lane 2), binding was not observed to the reconstituted nucleosomes at even 100 nm Sp1 (lane 8). However, Sp1 binding was observed when the nucleosomes were also treated with the SWI/SNF complex (comparelanes 9 and 12).The effect of SWI/SNF treatment on nucleosome binding by USF and NF-κB is shown in Fig. 1, C and D, respectively. Each of these factors also bound the mock-reconstituted naked DNA probes with nanomolar affinities (lanes 1–4 of each panel). In the case of USF, at high concentrations of the factor alone some protection of the USF site from DNase I cleavage was observed on the nucleosome template (Fig. 1 C,lanes 5–8). However, in the presence of the SWI/SNF complex nucleosome binding by USF was stimulated greater than 10-fold (Fig.1 C, lanes 9–12). There was no detectable binding of NF-κB to the nucleosome template at 110 nm factor (Fig. 1 C, lanes 5–9). By contrast, when the NF-κB site nucleosome was treated with the SWI/SNF complex a clear footprint was observed at 11 nm (lane 10) indicating greater than 10-fold stimulation of NF-κB binding. Similar to the Sp1 site nucleosome (Fig. 1 B) the action of SWI/SNF also altered the DNase I digestion pattern of the USF site and NF-κB site nucleosomes (compare lanes 5 and 9 of Fig.1, C and D, respectively). Thus, as with GAL4 derivatives the disruption of nucleosomal DNA by the SWI/SNF complex also resulted in enhanced affinity of Sp1, USF, and NF-κB for nucleosomal DNA.Since the nucleosomes in Fig. 1 did not display a strong rotational phasing pattern by DNase I (i.e. a 10-bp ladder), it is likely that a mixed population of rotational orientations of the DNA on nucleosomes were present. Thus, in these cases the precise orientation of the binding sites with respect to the histone octamer was heterogeneous. However, stimulation of factor binding by SWI/SNF was observed in all cases indicating that stimulation by SWI/SNF was not dependent on a particular rotational phasing of the DNA relative to the histone octamer.The data in Fig. 1 illustrate that the SWI/SNF complex is able to stimulate nucleosome binding by transcription factors with diverse DNA binding domains. However, the SWI/SNF complex also binds to DNA (37Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and nucleosomes 2J. Côté and J. L. Workman, unpublished data. with nanomolar affinities. Thus, in the DNase I footprinting experiments shown in Fig. 1 as well as in footprinting experiments from previous reports (7Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 8Wang W. Côté J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L.

Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) the enhanced affinity of the factors represents a comparison of its affinity to a SWI/SNF-nucleosome complex versus that of a nucleosome alone. Therefore, it is useful to determine whether the observed enhanced binding is dependent on the continued binding of the SWI/SNF-complex or whether it persists once SWI/SNF has detached from the nucleosome. Indeed, only GAL4 derivatives have been shown (i.e. by gel shift analysis) to form a stable ternary complex with nucleosomes as a result of SWI/SNF action that persists following detachment of the SWI/SNF complex (18Côté J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Côté J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).While the SWI/SNF complex binds to nucleosomes with nanomolar affinity, it can be competed off of nucleosomes to which it is bound by the addition of cold nucleosomes and/or naked DNA (21Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Côté J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether the SWI/SNF-induced nucleosome binding by Sp1, USF, or NF-κB resulted in a stable ternary factor-nucleosome complex we competed SWI/SNF off the target nucleosomes following the binding reactions (Fig. 2). Following this competition we tested for the presence of stable factor-nucleosome complexes by gel shift analysis. This analysis is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Ashows mobility shift of Sp1 site nucleosomes that were incubated with SWI/SNF in the presence or the absence of ATP and Sp1 followed by competition of the SWI/SNF complex. In the absence of ATP very little Sp1-nucleosome complex was observed (lanes 3 and5). By contrast, when ATP was present to allow SWI/SNF function there was a clear stimulation of Sp1-nucleosome complex formation (compare lane 3 to 4 and lane 5 to 6). The loss of a fraction of the Sp1-nucleosome complexes into Sp1 aggregates (not resolved on the gel) due to the self-association properties of Sp1 accounts for the reduction of total radioactivity in lanes 4 and 6. While this effect and nonspecific competition of Sp1 by the added competitor chromatin and nonspecific DNA reduced the apparent amount of Sp1 binding relative to the footprinting reactions above, it is clear that Sp1-nucleosome ternary complexes persisted following the detachment of SWI/SNF. Thus, the ATP-dependent Sp1-nucleosome complexes formed by the action of SWI/SNF did not require the continued presence of SWI/SNF.Figure 2Schematic illustration of the assay to determine whether the SWI/SNF complex induced the formation of a stable activator-nucleosome complex that persists after detachment of the SWI/SNF complex. 32P-Labeled (asterisk) nucleosome cores bearing an activator binding site are incubated in the presence of the activator, the SWI/SNF complex, and ATP (Step 1). This results in the formation of a activator-nucleosome-SWI/SNF complex in which the affinity of the activator can be tested by DNase I footprinting. To determine whether enhanced binding of the activator persists following detachment of the SWI/SNF complex, it was competed onto unlabeled oligonucleosomes and DNA (Step 2). Persistent activator-nucleosome complexes that are not bound by SWI/SNF are revealed by gel shift analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3SWI/SNF-stimulated binding of Sp1, USF, and NF-κB is stable to complex removal. A, nucleosomes (Sp1 probe from Fig. 1 A, lane 1) were incubated in the presence of 10 nm ySWI/SNF alone (lanes 1 and2), with 25 nm (lanes 3 and4) or with 75 nm (lanes 5 and6) Sp1, competed with an excess of cold HeLa oligonucleosomes and calf thymus DNA, and assayed by mobility shift.Lanes 2, 4, and 6 contain 1 mm ATP. Free DNA and nucleosomes are indicated at theleft. Arrows point to the Sp1-containing complexes.

ATP (1 mm) is present inlanes 2, 4, and 6. Mobility of complexes is indicated as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both USF and NF-κB also formed stable factor nucleosome complexes as a consequence of SWI/SNF action (Fig. 3, B andC). Fig. 3 B clearly indicates that stable USF binding to nucleosomes was also stimulated by the SWI/SNF complex in the presence of ATP. The formation of a stable USF-nucleosome complex that persisted after competition of the SWI/SNF complex was stimulated by the presence of ATP (compare lane 3 to 4 and5 to 6). Fig. 3 C shows a similar analysis using NF-κB. In the presence of SWI/SNF and ATP the formation of a stable NF-κB/nucleosome complex was enhanced (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 3 and 4, and5 and 6). Thus, the data in Fig. 1 illustrate that the SWI/SNF complex stimulates the binding of disparate transcription factors to nucleosomes. The data in Fig. 3 illustrate that SWI/SNF action also results in the formation of transcription factor-nucleosome complexes, which persisted independent of continued SWI/SNF binding.The experiments described above argue that SWI/SNF stimulation of transcription factor binding to nucleosomes is universal and therefore unlikely to provide distinction between SWI-dependent and -independent promoters. We therefore considered the alternative possibility that SWI/SNF function in stimulating factor binding is in part redundant with alternative mechanisms of nucleosome binding. For example, many promoter/enhancer regions contain multiple transcription factor binding sites, which may lead to cooperative binding in chromatin. Cooperative binding of 5 GAL4 dimers to nucleosomes has been shown to occur in vitro (27Taylor C.A. Workman J.L. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 38Vettese-Dadey M. Walter P. Chen H. Juan L-J. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The observed cooperativity is in response to inhibition from the histone octamer and stimulates the binding of multiple GAL4 dimers relative to binding of individual GAL4 dimers to a single GAL4 site (especially near the center of the nucleosome). We thus tested whether cooperative binding of GAL4-VP16 to nucleosome cores would enhance or reduce the stimulation observed by the SWI/SNF complex.Analysis of GAL4-VP16 binding to DNA or nucleosome cores bearing 5 GAL4 sites is illustrated Fig. 4. When increasing amounts of GAL4-VP16 were added to the mock-reconstituted naked DNA (lanes 1–6), complete protection of the 5 sites was observed at 14 nm protein (lane 4). When reconstituted into a nucleosome, this DNA fragment generates a distinct 10–11-bp repeating pattern of hypersensitive cutting by DNase I indicating that this fragment has a preferred path of DNA bending around the histone octamer (lane 7). When GAL4-VP16 was titrated into reactions containing the reconstituted 5-site nucleosome, complete protection of the GAL4 sites was apparent at 140 nm protein (lane 12). Thus, a 10-fold repression of GAL4-VP16 binding to the 5 GAL4 site probe resulted from the presence of the histone octamer. When SWI/SNF was also included, the DNase I digestion pattern of the 5-site nucleosome was disrupted (lane 14). Concurrent with nucleosome disruption by SWI/SNF, the affinity of GAL4-VP16 was enhanced allowing full protection of the GAL4 sites at 14 nm GAL4-VP16 (lanes 14–20).Figure 410-fold repression of 5 GAL4 dimers binding to nucleosomes (relative to naked DNA) is overcome by ySWI/SNF. A 156-bp DNA probe containing 5 GAL4 sites was reconstituted into nucleosomes. Titrations of GAL4-VP16 on DNA (lanes 1–6) and nucleosomes in the absence (lanes 7–13) and presence (lanes 14–20) of 20 nm ySWI/SNF were performed and subjected to DNase I digestion. ATP (1 mm) is present in all lanes. GAL4-VP16 concentrations are illustrated above. Thelong vertical bar represents the position of the 5 GAL4 sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data in Fig. 4 illustrate that under conditions of cooperative nucleosome binding the SWI/SNF complex stimulated the binding of GAL4-VP16 to nucleosomes 10-fold. By contrast, stimulation of GAL4-VP16 binding to a nucleosome bearing only a single GAL4 site was greater. Fig. 5 illustrates the binding of GAL4-VP16 to a mock-reconstituted naked DNA fragment (lanes 1–6) or the same fragment after reconstitution into nucleosome cores (lanes 7–13). Greater than 50% protection of the GAL4 site on the naked DNA was observed at 4.5 nm GAL4-VP16 with complete protection at 14 nm (lanes 3 and 4). When binding to the nucleosome core, however, half-protection of the GAL4 site required 1400 nm GAL4-VP16 (lane 12) indicating that GAL4-VP16 binding to this single site in the nucleosome was inhibited approximately 300-fold relative to naked DNA. However, when the SWI/SNF complex was included, half-protection of the GAL4 site occurred between 14 and 45 nm GAL4-VP16 (lane 16). Thus, the SWI/SNF complex stimulated the binding of a single GAL4 dimer to a nucleosome core by approximately 100-fold.Figure 5Binding of GAL4 to a single site shows more repression by nucleosomes (compared with 5 sites), which allows greater stimulation by the ySWI/SNF complex. A 156-bp probe bearing a consensus GAL4 site 60 bp from the end was subject to binding reactions with increasing amounts of GAL4-VP16 (indicated at the topof figure), both as free DNA (lanes 1–6) and nucleosomes (lanes 7–20). The ySWI/SNF complex (20 nm) was included in lanes 14–20. The location of the GAL4 binding site is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data in Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate several important conclusions regarding GAL4-VP16 binding to nucleosome cores and the function of the SWI/SNF complex. 1) Five GAL4-VP16 dimers bound nucleosomes with an affinity that was more than 10-fold greater than the binding of a single GAL4-VP16 dimer. Indeed, the cooperative binding of 5 dimers was only inhibited by the presence of the histone octamer 10-fold relative to GAL4-VP16 binding to naked DNA. 2) The SWI/SNF complex simulated the binding of GAL4-VP16 to the single-site nucleosome 100-fold but only stimulated the binding of GAL4-VP16 to the 5-site nucleosome 10-fold. Thus, SWI/SNF exerted the most dramatic effect where inhibition of GAL4-VP16 binding to nucleosomes was greatest. 3) The SWI/SNF complex did not enhance the affinity of GAL4-VP16 for nucleosomes beyond its affinity for naked DNA. The binding of 5 GAL4-VP16 dimers to nucleosomes in the presence of SWI/SNF occurred with an affinity equal to that of naked DNA.To determine whether cooperative binding might similarly reduce the extent of SWI/SNF stimulation of different factors we have also tested SWI/SNF stimulation of NF-κB binding to nucl"

HSSB is essential for the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA and nucleotide excision repair. It also has important functions in other DNA transactions, including DNA recombination, transcription, and double-stranded DNA break repair. The p34 subunit of HSSB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Both Cdc2 kinase and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) phosphorylate HSSB-p34 in vitro. In this study, we show that efficient phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 by DNA-PK requires Ku as well as DNA. The DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in HSSB-p34 have been mapped at Thr-21 and Ser-33. Kinetic studies demonstrated that a phosphate residue is first incorporated at Thr-21 followed by the incorporation of a second phosphate residue at Ser-33.

This is underscored by the observations that mutations within the p70 subunit ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae SSB affect DNA recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair (21Firmenich A.A.

These observations suggest that HSSB also has important functions in transcription and its regulation.The p34 subunit of HSSB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Din S.-U.

Phosphorylated forms first appear during the G1 to S transition and persist through the S phase. As the cell cycle progresses through late M phase, HSSB-p34 is dephosphorylated. In x-ray or UV-irradiated cells, the level of p34 phosphorylation also increases dramatically (32Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K.

While the protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of p34 in vivo are not known, in vitro studies have shown that the HSSB-p34 subunit is phosphorylated by both the Cdc2 kinase and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 34Pan Z.-Q.

Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Din S.-U. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the biological significance of HSSB-p34 phosphorylation is still not clear. Several studies have shown that HSSB-p34 phosphorylation does not affect its ability to bind single-stranded DNA, support SV40 DNA replication (35Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HSSB, reconstituted with a mutant p34 subunit containing a deletion of 30–33 N-terminal amino acids, was not phosphorylated by either the Cdc2 kinase or DNA-PK, but efficiently supported SV40 DNA replication (35Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mutant HSSB, reconstituted with a C-terminal 30-amino acid truncated p34 subunit, was phosphorylated by both kinases, but did not support SV40 DNA replication (37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These studies showed that phosphorylation of the p34 subunit of HSSB has no detectable effect on the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA.The phosphorylation sites in HSSB-p34 have been inferred from the presence of putative kinase consensus sequences but have not been identified. In this study, a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches were used to define both DNA-PK and Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites in the p34 subunit of HSSB. We have mapped two DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in the HSSB-p34 subunit at Thr-21 and Ser-33 and have identified Ser-29 as the major Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the p34 subunit of HSSB is efficiently phosphorylated at residues Thr-21 and Ser-33 by DNA-PK in the presence of Ku and calf thymus DNA. In this reaction, Thr-21 was more rapidly phosphorylated than Ser-33. We also identified Ser-29 as the primary Cdc2 phosphorylation site in HSSB-p34 (Fig. 9).DNA-PK preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues that are followed or preceded by glutamine residues ((S/T)-Q or Q-(S/T)) (50Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such target sequences are found within the HSSB-p34 subunit, including five serine residues (Ser-23, -33, -52, -72, and -174) and one threonine residue (Thr-21). However, of the six potential target sites, only Thr-21 and Ser-33 were efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Earlier studies have shown that, in addition to the target sequences described above, poorly characterized additional sequences and/or tertiary protein structures may be required for efficient DNA-PK phosphorylation (40Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These additional considerations may explain why only a few of the synthetic peptides that contain Ser-23, Ser-33, Ser-52, Ser-72, or Ser-174 were efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PK (data not shown). Since only Thr-21 and Ser-33 in HSSB-p34 were phosphorylated efficiently, the other potential phosphorylation sites may not meet the poorly defined additional requirements. Another consideration is that the sites not phosphorylated may be inaccessible to DNA-PK due to the association of p34 with p70 and p11 subunit. It has been shown that the p34 subunit is tightly associated with the p70 and p11 subunits via interactions with the middle and C-terminal regions of p34 (51Lin Y.-L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although the last 33 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of p34 are not essential for this interaction (37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This association may sterically block the phosphorylation sites (Ser-52, -72, and -174) located within these regions of p34. Proteolysis experiments done by Gomes et al. (48Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and protease digestion results shown in this report suggest that the N-terminal region of HSSB-p34 may be more accessible for enzymatic modification.The association of p34 with p70 and p11 enabled a more efficient phosphorylation of Thr-21 and Ser-33 in the N-terminal region. As we have previously shown, whereas the p34 subunit alone was a poor substrate for DNA-PK, its association with the p11 subunit dramatically increased phosphorylation of the p34 subunit to a level equivalent to that observed with the p70-p34-p11 trimeric complex (39Gibbs E. Pan Z-Q. Niu H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This suggests that, although only the p34 subunit contains DNA-PK phosphorylation sites, the other two associated subunits, especially the p11 subunit, are important for the efficient phosphorylation of HSSB-p34. The mechanism underlying this observation is not known. One possibility is that the interaction between the p11 subunit and the p34 subunit renders the substrate more accessible to DNA-PK.It has been shown recently that HSSB interacts with DNA in at least two different modes. Different physical changes occur in the HSSB protein structure when HSSB binds to single-stranded DNAs of different length. This could alter the efficiency of HSSB-p34 phosphorylation by DNA-PK (52Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mastrangelo I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4798-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, depending on the type of DNA used in the reaction, an additional phosphorylation product was observed. For example, when single-stranded DNAs such as φX174 or poly(dT)170 were used in the phosphorylation reaction, an extra hyperphosphorylated p34 protein band was observed migrating even slower than p34-P2 on SDS-PAGE, which suggests that additional phosphorylation sites might exist in the p34 subunit of HSSB (34Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this species of phosphorylated HSSB-p34 accounted for less than 4% of total input substrate (34Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2H. Niu, H. Erdjument-Bromage, Z.-Q. Pan, S.-H. Lee, P. Tempst, and J. Hurwitz, unpublished data. Furthermore, under the phosphorylation conditions described in this report, p34-P1 and p34-P2, which resulted from phosphorylation of Thr-21 and Ser-33, accounted for more than 99% of the phosphorylated products.The consensus motif for the Cdc2 kinase is a serine or threonine residue followed by proline ((S/T)-P). There are two such serine residues in HSSB-p34 (Ser-23 and Ser-29). We identified Ser-29 as the predominant phosphorylation site. This result is consistent with the observations made by Henricksen and Wold (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that HSSB containing a serine to alanine substitution at position 23 in the p34 subunit was phosphorylated as efficiently as the wild-type protein. However, a mutant HSSB with an alanine substitution at Ser-29 in the p34 subunit was poorly phosphorylated. When both Ser-23 and Ser-29 in HSSB-p34 were changed to alanine residues, this mutant protein was still phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase in vitro. Although this result points to the presence of an additional Cdc2 kinase target sequence differing from the (S/T)-P motif in the p34 subunit, the same mutant protein, however, was not phosphorylated under DNA replication conditions (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of this mutant protein may be an in vitro artifact.HSSB is an essential protein in DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, transcription, DNA recombination, and double-stranded DNA break repair. The biological significance of the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is still unclear. One possibility is that HSSB phosphorylation may act as a signal for ongoing DNA replication to be sensed by other cell cycle check point proteins. This would ensure that premature cell division does not occur before DNA replication is complete. Alternatively, HSSB-p34 phosphorylation may have a more direct role in changing the interaction between HSSB and other essential DNA replication proteins contributing to the regulation of replication.In UV-irradiated cells, enhanced phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is associated with the cessation of cell cycle progression and a decrease in replication activity (32Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 may also play a role in coordinating the repair of damaged DNA with normal DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression.Currently the construction of HSSB containing mutations in both the DNA-PK and the Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites is underway. Biochemical characterization of this mutant protein may allow us to determine directly the role of the phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 in the cell.

HSSB was initially discovered as a protein essential for several stages of the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA. It stimulates SV40 T antigen (T-Ag) catalyzed unwinding of origin-containing duplex DNA (2Wold M.S. Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is underscored by the observations that mutations within the p70 subunit ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae SSB affect DNA recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair (21Firmenich A.A. Elias-Arnanz M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1620-1631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Longhese M.P. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Mol. Cell.

It has also been shown that HSSB binds to the acidic domains of transcription factors VP16 and p53 (24He Z. Brinton B.T. Greenblatt J. Hassell J.A. Ingles C.J.

A. 1995; 92: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HSSB also has important functions in transcription and its regulation. The p34 subunit of HSSB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Dutta A. Stillman B.

Phosphorylated forms first appear during the G1 to S transition and persist through the S phase. As the cell cycle progresses through late M phase, HSSB-p34 is dephosphorylated. In x-ray or UV-irradiated cells, the level of p34 phosphorylation also increases dramatically (32Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). While the protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of p34 in vivo are not known, in vitro studies have shown that the HSSB-p34 subunit is phosphorylated by both the Cdc2 kinase and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar,30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 34Pan Z.-Q.

A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 may play an important role in cell cycle regulation of DNA synthesis and in coordinating DNA replication and repair (29Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Din S.-U. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the biological significance of HSSB-p34 phosphorylation is still not clear. Several studies have shown that HSSB-p34 phosphorylation does not affect its ability to bind single-stranded DNA, support SV40 DNA replication (35Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 4636-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions at Ser-23 and Ser-29, two putative Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites in HSSB-p34, do not affect the binding of HSSB to single-stranded DNA or its ability to support SV40 DNA replication (35Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HSSB, reconstituted with a mutant p34 subunit containing a deletion of 30–33 N-terminal amino acids, was not phosphorylated by either the Cdc2 kinase or DNA-PK, but efficiently supported SV40 DNA replication (35Brush G.S. Anderson C.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12520-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, a mutant HSSB, reconstituted with a C-terminal 30-amino acid truncated p34 subunit, was phosphorylated by both kinases, but did not support SV40 DNA replication (37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These studies showed that phosphorylation of the p34 subunit of HSSB has no detectable effect on the in vitro replication of SV40 DNA. The phosphorylation sites in HSSB-p34 have been inferred from the presence of putative kinase consensus sequences but have not been identified. In this study, a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches were used to define both DNA-PK and Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites in the p34 subunit of HSSB. We have mapped two DNA-PK phosphorylation sites in the HSSB-p34 subunit at Thr-21 and Ser-33 and have identified Ser-29 as the major Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the p34 subunit of HSSB is efficiently phosphorylated at residues Thr-21 and Ser-33 by DNA-PK in the presence of Ku and calf thymus DNA. In this reaction, Thr-21 was more rapidly phosphorylated than Ser-33. We also identified Ser-29 as the primary Cdc2 phosphorylation site in HSSB-p34 (Fig. 9).DNA-PK preferentially phosphorylates serine or threonine residues that are followed or preceded by glutamine residues ((S/T)-Q or Q-(S/T)) (50Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Such target sequences are found within the HSSB-p34 subunit, including five serine residues (Ser-23, -33, -52, -72, and -174) and one threonine residue (Thr-21). However, of the six potential target sites, only Thr-21 and Ser-33 were efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PK. Earlier studies have shown that, in addition to the target sequences described above, poorly characterized additional sequences and/or tertiary protein structures may be required for efficient DNA-PK phosphorylation (40Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). These additional considerations may explain why only a few of the synthetic peptides that contain Ser-23, Ser-33, Ser-52, Ser-72, or Ser-174 were efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PK (data not shown). Since only Thr-21 and Ser-33 in HSSB-p34 were phosphorylated efficiently, the other potential phosphorylation sites may not meet the poorly defined additional requirements. Another consideration is that the sites not phosphorylated may be inaccessible to DNA-PK due to the association of p34 with p70 and p11 subunit. It has been shown that the p34 subunit is tightly associated with the p70 and p11 subunits via interactions with the middle and C-terminal regions of p34 (51Lin Y.-L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although the last 33 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of p34 are not essential for this interaction (37Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This association may sterically block the phosphorylation sites (Ser-52, -72, and -174) located within these regions of p34. Proteolysis experiments done by Gomes et al. (48Gomes X.V. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5586-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and protease digestion results shown in this report suggest that the N-terminal region of HSSB-p34 may be more accessible for enzymatic modification.The association of p34 with p70 and p11 enabled a more efficient phosphorylation of Thr-21 and Ser-33 in the N-terminal region. As we have previously shown, whereas the p34 subunit alone was a poor substrate for DNA-PK, its association with the p11 subunit dramatically increased phosphorylation of the p34 subunit to a level equivalent to that observed with the p70-p34-p11 trimeric complex (39Gibbs E. Pan Z-Q. Niu H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This suggests that, although only the p34 subunit contains DNA-PK phosphorylation sites, the other two associated subunits, especially the p11 subunit, are important for the efficient phosphorylation of HSSB-p34. The mechanism underlying this observation is not known. One possibility is that the interaction between the p11 subunit and the p34 subunit renders the substrate more accessible to DNA-PK.It has been shown recently that HSSB interacts with DNA in at least two different modes. Different physical changes occur in the HSSB protein structure when HSSB binds to single-stranded DNAs of different length. This could alter the efficiency of HSSB-p34 phosphorylation by DNA-PK (52Blackwell L.J. Borowiec J.A. Mastrangelo I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4798-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, depending on the type of DNA used in the reaction, an additional phosphorylation product was observed. For example, when single-stranded DNAs such as φX174 or poly(dT)170 were used in the phosphorylation reaction, an extra hyperphosphorylated p34 protein band was observed migrating even slower than p34-P2 on SDS-PAGE, which suggests that additional phosphorylation sites might exist in the p34 subunit of HSSB (34Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this species of phosphorylated HSSB-p34 accounted for less than 4% of total input substrate (34Pan Z.-Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2H. Niu, H. Erdjument-Bromage, Z.-Q. Pan, S.-H. Lee, P. Tempst, and J. Hurwitz, unpublished data. Furthermore, under the phosphorylation conditions described in this report, p34-P1 and p34-P2, which resulted from phosphorylation of Thr-21 and Ser-33, accounted for more than 99% of the phosphorylated products.The consensus motif for the Cdc2 kinase is a serine or threonine residue followed by proline ((S/T)-P). There are two such serine residues in HSSB-p34 (Ser-23 and Ser-29). We identified Ser-29 as the predominant phosphorylation site. This result is consistent with the observations made by Henricksen and Wold (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that HSSB containing a serine to alanine substitution at position 23 in the p34 subunit was phosphorylated as efficiently as the wild-type protein. However, a mutant HSSB with an alanine substitution at Ser-29 in the p34 subunit was poorly phosphorylated. When both Ser-23 and Ser-29 in HSSB-p34 were changed to alanine residues, this mutant protein was still phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase in vitro. Although this result points to the presence of an additional Cdc2 kinase target sequence differing from the (S/T)-P motif in the p34 subunit, the same mutant protein, however, was not phosphorylated under DNA replication conditions (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of this mutant protein may be an in vitro artifact.HSSB is an essential protein in DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, transcription, DNA recombination, and double-stranded DNA break repair. The biological significance of the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is still unclear. One possibility is that HSSB phosphorylation may act as a signal for ongoing DNA replication to be sensed by other cell cycle check point proteins. This would ensure that premature cell division does not occur before DNA replication is complete. Alternatively, HSSB-p34 phosphorylation may have a more direct role in changing the interaction between HSSB and other essential DNA replication proteins contributing to the regulation of replication.In UV-irradiated cells, enhanced phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is associated with the cessation of cell cycle progression and a decrease in replication activity (32Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar).

Furthermore, under the phosphorylation conditions described in this report, p34-P1 and p34-P2, which resulted from phosphorylation of Thr-21 and Ser-33, accounted for more than 99% of the phosphorylated products. The consensus motif for the Cdc2 kinase is a serine or threonine residue followed by proline ((S/T)-P). There are two such serine residues in HSSB-p34 (Ser-23 and Ser-29). We identified Ser-29 as the predominant phosphorylation site. This result is consistent with the observations made by Henricksen and Wold (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that HSSB containing a serine to alanine substitution at position 23 in the p34 subunit was phosphorylated as efficiently as the wild-type protein. However, a mutant HSSB with an alanine substitution at Ser-29 in the p34 subunit was poorly phosphorylated. When both Ser-23 and Ser-29 in HSSB-p34 were changed to alanine residues, this mutant protein was still phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase in vitro. Although this result points to the presence of an additional Cdc2 kinase target sequence differing from the (S/T)-P motif in the p34 subunit, the same mutant protein, however, was not phosphorylated under DNA replication conditions (53Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of this mutant protein may be an in vitro artifact. HSSB is an essential protein in DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, transcription, DNA recombination, and double-stranded DNA break repair. The biological significance of the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is still unclear. One possibility is that HSSB phosphorylation may act as a signal for ongoing DNA replication to be sensed by other cell cycle check point proteins. This would ensure that premature cell division does not occur before DNA replication is complete. Alternatively, HSSB-p34 phosphorylation may have a more direct role in changing the interaction between HSSB and other essential DNA replication proteins contributing to the regulation of replication. In UV-irradiated cells, enhanced phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 is associated with the cessation of cell cycle progression and a decrease in replication activity (32Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 may also play a role in coordinating the repair of damaged DNA with normal DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Currently the construction of HSSB containing mutations in both the DNA-PK and the Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites is underway. Biochemical characterization of this mutant protein may allow us to determine directly the role of the phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 in the cell.

Acid-denatured GFP can fold spontaneously upon dilution into the neutral buffer. When Escherichia coli GroEL/ES was present, folding of GFP was arrested. Folding was resumed by subsequent addition of 100 μm or 1 mm ATP, and native GFP was regenerated to 100% yield. When folding was resumed by 10 μM ATP (1.4 mol/mol GroEL subunit), about 60% of GFP recovered native structure, and one-half of them (30%) was found to be still bound to GroEL/ES, indicating the occurrence of folding in the central cavity of the GroEL ring underneath GroES (cis-folding). Because the overall rates of GroEL/ES-, ATP-mediated GFP folding were all similar to that of spontaneous folding, it was concluded thatcis-folding proceeded as fast as spontaneous folding. The GroEL/ES-bound native GFP was observed only when both GroES and ATP (but not ADP) were present in the folding mixture.

The best studied chaperonin is Escherichia coliGroEL. GroEL is composed of 57-kDa subunits arranged in two seven-membered rings stacked back to back, forming a central cavity ∼45 Å in diameter (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C.

GroEL binds a variety of substrate polypeptides in nonnative form, and the addition of ATP is sufficient to allow the folding of some proteins in vitro. However, GroEL-mediated folding is dependent on the cochaperonin GroES in many cases, especially under the conditions where only very poor spontaneous folding can occur (10Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GroES is a dome-shaped seven-membered ring of 10-kDa subunits (11Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) that can bind to one or both ends of the GroEL cylinder.Binding of substrate polypeptide occurs exclusively to the GroEL ring not occupied by GroES, as observed by electron micrograph (trans-complex) (12Ishii N.

Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). On addition of ATP, either polypeptide or GroES is released. When polypeptide is released, it rebinds to the trans GroEL ring to regenerate trans-complex, or it completes folding by itself in the medium if conditions are suitable for spontaneous folding. When GroES is released, it rebinds to either one of two GroEL rings. If it binds to the GroEL ring not containing polypeptide, trans-complex is regenerated. If it binds to the GroEL ring containing polypeptide (cis-complex), it sequesters polypeptide in the central cavity, and productive folding can proceed there (cis-folding). ATP acts as a set timer (∼15 s) to induce dissociation of the GroES from the GroEL ring, and the substrate protein is released into the medium. How much of the fraction of the substrate protein in the cis-complex has acquired the native conformations before the release differs from one protein to another (14Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V.

Is the microscopic folding process of substrate proteins in cis-folding the same as that of spontaneous folding, or does it include a different process?

Affinity-purified antibodies, raised against a synthetic peptide based on the predicted DGCN2 sequence, specifically immunoprecipitated an eIF-2α kinase activity and recognized an ∼175 kDa phosphoprotein in Western blots ofDrosophila embryo extracts. Protein synthesis is mainly regulated at the initiation of mRNA translation. The best-characterized mechanism of translational regulation in eukaryotes involves the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: eIF-2α, the α subunit (38 kDa) of eukaryotic polypeptide chain initiation factor 2; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor; PKR, double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase; GCN2, yeast general amino acid control eIF-2α protein kinase; DGCN2,Drosophila GCN2-like eIF-2α protein kinase; DGCN2-peptide, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 610–622 with a cysteine and a glycine residue in its NH2-terminal end; anti-DGCN2 antibodies, affinity-purified anti-DGCN2-peptide antibodies; HisRS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase(s); ORF, open reading frame; CNS, central nervous system; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: eIF-2α, the α subunit (38 kDa) of eukaryotic polypeptide chain initiation factor 2; HRI, heme-regulated inhibitor; PKR, double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase; GCN2, yeast general amino acid control eIF-2α protein kinase; DGCN2,Drosophila GCN2-like eIF-2α protein kinase; DGCN2-peptide, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 610–622 with a cysteine and a glycine residue in its NH2-terminal end; anti-DGCN2 antibodies, affinity-purified anti-DGCN2-peptide antibodies; HisRS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase(s); ORF, open reading frame; CNS, central nervous system; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Three distinct protein kinases regulate protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by phosphorylating the α subunit of eIF-2 at serine 51 (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

They are two mammalian eIF-2α kinases, the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) and the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), and the yeast GCN2 (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These kinases contain twelve conserved subdomains characteristic of all eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases (5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar) and reveal similarities that make them distinguishable from other eukaryotic protein kinases. It is notable that eIF-2α kinases possess relatively large insert sequences between catalytic subdomains IV and V (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Even though the subdomain V is less conserved among the eukaryotic protein kinases (5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar), the known eIF-2α kinases share significant homology in this domain. In contrast to the catalytic domains, the regulatory regions of the eIF-2α kinases are very different (6Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 7de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). HRI from rabbit and rat contains two heme regulatory motifs, ACPYVM and RCPAQA, located within the HRI kinase domain and that are not found in either PKR or GCN2 (6Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar,7de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PKR has been cloned from human, mouse, and rat cells (7de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The PKR amino-terminal half contains three clusters of basic amino acids. The first two contain two divergent copies of a double-stranded RNA binding motif that are required for RNA binding (3Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 217-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Yeast GCN2 contains a 530-amino acid sequence related to histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) in the carboxyl-terminal region, adjacent to the kinase domain. This domain is required for GCN2 activation in vivo (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-2α prevents initiation of protein synthesis by sequestration of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF-2B in an inactive complex (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eIF-2α was first detected in rabbit reticulocyte lysates deprived of hemin. The absence of hemin results in the activation of HRI (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 6Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). PKR, constitutively expressed in reticulocytes and inducible by interferon in other mammalian cells, is activated by low concentrations of double-stranded RNA in the presence of ATP (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 8Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 217-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The yeast GCN2 kinase is activated by amino acid deprivation (9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Until recently, phosphorylation of eIF-2α was believed to nonspecifically down-regulate translation initiation, but recent results have suggested that it can up-regulate the synthesis of specific proteins (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitroexperiments indicated that the activity of the yeast GCN2 kinase is regulated through the interaction of the HisRS-related domain with uncharged tRNAs that accumulate when cells are starving for amino acids. In this case, eIF-2α phosphorylation enhances the translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that in vitrophosphorylation of Drosophila eIF-2α by reticulocyte HRI inhibits the exchange reaction catalyzed by mammalian eIF-2B (11Mateu M.G. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recent results have provided evidence that translational regulation by phosphorylation of eIF-2α and sequestration of eIF-2B can operate in insect cells (12Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an endogenous eIF-2α kinase may be present in such cells. However, to date, no eIF-2α kinase activity has been detected in Drosophila. Here we report the cloning of a Drosophila melanogaster eIF-2α kinase (DGCN2). Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that DGCN2 is closely related to yeast GCN2 kinase. Genomic DNA was prepared from adult flies as described (13Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sense (5′-CTBYWYATYCARATG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCAAARTCWCCDATYTT-3′) degenerated oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on regions of homology between all known eIF-2α kinases. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using each primer at 5 μm and 500 ng of genomic DNA. A “hot start” PCR was performed by adding the DNA polymerase after an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 95 °C and then 35 cycles consisting of 95 °C for 1 min, 37 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final step of 72 °C for 10 min. The amplification was carried out in an Ericomp TwinBlock System (Ericomp, San Diego, CA). The reaction products were gel purified and subcloned into a pCRII vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). A cDNA library in Uni-Zap XR, made from 2- to 14-h-old embryos (Stratagene), was screened according to standard procedures (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 1 × 106plaque-forming units were transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). The 278-bp DGCN2 genomic DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The membranes were prehybridized 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml denaturated salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in this solution containing a 32P-labeled DGCN2 probe (1 × 107 cpm/ml). The membranes were subjected to high stringency washings and processed for autoradiography. Positive phages were purified by successive rounds of screening. Insert cDNAs in positive phages were excised in vivo by plasmid rescue of a pBlueScript SK− phagemid, after superinfection with a helper phage, as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). A second cDNA library in a λZAPII vector, made from 0- to 4-h-old embryos (Stratagene), was screened, as described above, using the 1131-bpDGCN2 cDNA isolated from the first library. The cDNA inserts were sequenced across both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar) using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase FS and the Automatic Sequencer System 373A (Applied Biosystem). All primers for sequencing were from Isogen Bioscience (Amsterdam). Sequence homology searches were performed using BLAST (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69731) Google Scholar) and FASTA (17Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9364) Google Scholar) programs. Similarity and identity values were obtained by using the BESTFIT and GAP programs (Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison). 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA of 0–12 hDrosophila Oregon R embryos, obtained according to Campuzanoet al. (18Campuzano S. Carramolino L. Cabrera C.V. Ruı́z-Gómez M. Villares R. Boronat A. Modolell J. Cell. 1985; 40: 327-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), was reverse-transcribed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To avoid amplification of nonspecific products, “hot start” PCR was performed by adding TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH) to the DNA polymerase (Expand long template PCR system, Boehringer Mannheim). Amplifications were performed in a GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) as recommended by the Marathon kit protocol. The antisense primer (5′-ACATTCTCATGATTCAGCCGCGAAAGAAGC-3′), complementary to nucleotides 2033–2062 of DGCN2 cDNA was used to amplify the 5′-end, in combination with the adaptor primer AP1 supplied with the Marathon kit. The sense primer (5′-ACTCACCGCTCTTATCCCCACTTTCCGCAA-3′) complementary to nucleotides 3289–3318 of DGCN2 cDNA was used to amplify the 3′-end in combination with the adaptor primer AP1. The 5′ and 3′ RACE products were subcloned into the pCRII vector and sequenced across both strands. The sequence of three independent cDNA clones of each product were compared to detect errors that could have occurred during the reverse-transcription and the PCR amplification. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared as described (18Campuzano S. Carramolino L. Cabrera C.V. Ruı́z-Gómez M. Villares R. Boronat A. Modolell J. Cell. 1985; 40: 327-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Five μg of poly(A)+ RNA from each developmental stage were separated on a formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, hybridized, and exposed as described (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Localization of RNA in whole-mount embryos with antisense digoxigenin-labeled probes was performed essentially as described (19Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Based on theDGCN2 cDNA coding sequence, a synthetic peptide (CG-SQSQQDLSVKPAK) was made, corresponding to amino acids 610–622 (see Fig. 1) with two additional residues (CG) in its NH2-terminal end. The peptide was synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using an Applied Biosystems 431A automated solid-phase synthesizer in the Protein Chemistry Facility of the Centro de Biologı́a Molecular “Severo Ochoa.” The purity of the peptide, monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, was 95%, and peptide identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. This peptide was coupled by the terminal cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem), and rabbits were immunized as described (20Méndez R. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6170-6176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serum was purified by affinity chromatography by coupling synthetic peptide through the cysteine terminal residue to Sulfolink beads, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). The specific IgGs were further purified by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column as described (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For simplicity, these affinity purified anti-DGCN2-peptide antibodies will be named in the future as anti-DGCN2 antibodies. One g of dechorionized 0- to 12-h-oldDrosophila Oregon R embryos was suspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmEDTA, 20 μg/ml DNAase, and 20 μg/ml RNAase. The embryos were homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (Type B pestle) and incubated 30 min on ice, and then the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) that was equilibrated in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing, the supernatant was recovered and incubated with anti-DGCN2 antibodies (10 μg of IgG) for 1 h at 4 °C. In control experiments, the peptide immunogen (90 μg/ml) was also included in this incubation just before the antibody was added. Protein A-Sepharose (40 μl), equilibrated in TBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 1% Nonidet P-40, was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three more times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The immunoprecipitates were then assayed for their ability to phosphorylate eIF-2. Assay mixtures (30 μl) containing 10 μl of pellet suspension were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm ATP, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2. All samples were subsequently incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2 (0.5 μg) as substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Incubations were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE as described (22Méndez R. Moreno A. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11500-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was exposed to x-ray film for visualizing phosphorylated proteins and subsequent immunodetection with anti-DGCN2 antibodies. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on regions of homology between all previously known eIF-2α kinases. These primers correspond to conserved sequences L(F/H)IQM (kinase subdomain V) and KIGDFG (kinase subdomain VII). Despite the fact that subdomain VII is well conserved in all protein kinases, any one of the amplified products had to belong to an eIF-2α kinase gene because the subdomain V is specific to eIF-2α kinases (23Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Following PCR with the indicated primers on genomic DNA, a product of 278 bp was subcloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and the amino acid analyses of this product revealed a gene fragment that showed an ORF (nucleotides 2397–2608) displaying 73.3% similarity to yeast GCN2. This amplified gene fragment contained an intron of 64 nucleotides interrupting the ORF. The intron boundaries presented the donor/acceptor splice signals (GT/AG) and were inserted after the position 2437 of the DGCN2 cDNA (data not shown). Because of its potential authenticity, this gene fragment was used to screen a cDNA library from Drosophila embryos. From 1 × 106 phages, one positive plaque (clone N1) was purified, excised into pBlueScript SK− and sequenced. It contained an ORF of 1131 bp, that was 56% similar to yeast GCN2. The N1 cDNA was used to screen a second embryo cDNA library, leading to the isolation of three independent positives. One of the clones (S24), that overlapped 534 nucleotides with the 3′-N1 clone, contained an ORF of 1060 bp. This ORF shared homology with eIF-2α kinase catalytic domains and with motifs m1 and m2 of HisRS. Amino acid sequence analyses of N1 and S24 cDNA clones revealed that they lacked the full coding sequence. To get the missing 5′- and 3′-ends, additional sequences were obtained by 5′ and 3′ RACE experiments producing two additional cDNA clones, AR5 and DR3, of 2062 and 2433 bp, respectively. Taken together, all the overlappingDGCN2 cDNA clones, (AR5, N1, S24, DR3) span a total of 5721 nucleotides (GenBankTM accession number U80223). The resulting full-length cDNA displays a large ORF of 4767 bp (nucleotides 318–5084) flanked by 317 bp of a 5′ non-coding sequence and 637 bp of a 3′ non-coding sequence, which contains a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA, nucleotides 5679–5684). The first methionine codon of the ORF (ATG, nucleotides 318–320) is likely to represent the translational start since it matches theDrosophila consensus for translational initiators at positions -2, -1, +4, and +5 (24Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Moreover, in-frame termination codons are present upstream from the initiation codon, suggesting that this is indeed the authentic start site. The full-lengthDGCN2 cDNA encodes for a protein of 1589 amino acids (Fig. 1), with a predicted molecular mass of 178.7 kDa. Note that yeast GCN2 is a 1590-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of about 180 kDa (9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of Drosophilagenomic DNA revealed that DGCN2 is present as a single copy gene (data not shown). The eIF-2α kinase domain of DGCN2 (residues 523–898) contains the 12 conserved catalytic subdomains of Ser/Thr protein kinases (Fig. 1). This domain, as in HRI and yeast GCN2, possesses a large (94 residues) insert between subdomains IV and V (Fig.2). DGCN2 kinase domain is more closely related to the rat PKR (there are 40.2% identities and 61.3% similarities) and the yeast GCN2 (39.4% identities and 60.3% similarities) although it shares high homology with all of the known eIF-2α kinases (37 to 40% identities and 56 to 61% similarities). Downstream from the eIF-2α kinase domain, DGCN2 contains a 519 amino acid sequence (residues 919–1437) related to histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS) (Fig. 2). HisRS enzymes share three relatively short sequence motifs (m1, m2, and m3) (Fig. 1; Ref. 25Cusack S. Härtlein M. Luberman R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3489-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Like yeast GCN2 (26Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vázquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the highest degree of similarity between DGCN2 and HisRS occurs in the roughly 360 amino acids stretching from motif 1 to motif 3 (47 to 50% similarities and 22 to 24% identities). In addition, the amino-terminal portion of DGCN2 contains a sequence (residues 304–518) related to subdomains III to XI of eukaryotic protein kinases (5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). The partial kinase segment (Fig. 2) is comparable with that observed in yeast GCN2 kinase, although in the case of yeast, the sequences in the amino-terminal segment are only related to subdomains VIb to XI (10Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that DGCN2 is very closely related to the yeast GCN2 kinase. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different developmental stages revealed a unique transcript of approximately 6.5 kb. The transcript is expressed throughout development and with two major peaks of accumulation, one during early embryogenesis and the second in the adult stage (Fig. 3). To determine the embryonic transcriptional regulation of theDGCN2 gene, we performed in situ hybridization on embryos with antisense digoxigenin-labeled probes. Fig.4 depicts the spatio-temporal pattern ofDGCN2 expression in embryonic stages classified according to Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein (27Campos-Ortega J.A. Hartenstein V. The Embryonic Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985: 3-84Crossref Google Scholar). DGCN2 mRNA can be first detected at high levels during stages 2 and 3 prior to cellularization of blastoderm nuclei (Fig. 4 A). Later, at the stage of syncytial blastoderm (late 4), the mRNA concentrates peripherally in the so-called cortex (Fig. 4 B). By stage 5, when the cellularization is complete, the concentration of the mRNA in the cortex is more evident (Fig. 4, C and D). By the onset of gastrulation, DGCN2 expression concentrates in several areas of cell movement, including all the furrows and the proctodeal primordium (Fig. 4, E and F). During the stages of germ band elongation, the mRNA accumulates in the primordia of the gut (anterior and posterior) and in the mesoderm (Fig.4, G and H). This mesodermal staining diffuses during stages 11 and 12, corresponding to the reorganization of this mesodermal germ layer. By the end of the stage 12, the mRNA accumulates in the anterior and posterior midgut as well as in areas of the primitive brain (supraesophageal ganglion) and in the central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. 4I). During stage 13 and extending into later stages, accumulation of DGCN2 transcripts are seen throughout the CNS including the supraesophageal ganglia and the ventral cord. Although by stage 14 where many cells of the ventral cord express DGCN2 transcripts (Fig. 4J), in later stages, this expression becomes restricted to a few cells (four per neuromer) that probably correspond to neurons (Fig. 4, K andL). To determine that DGCN2 is an eIF-2α kinase, we immunoprecipitated DGCN2 from 0- to 12-h-old Drosophilaembryo extracts by using the anti-DGCN2 antibodies. The isolated immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of highly purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF-2 as a substrate, and the radiolabeled products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control experiments, the reticulocyte heme-reversible HRI (20Méndez R. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6170-6176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated in the presence (Fig. 5, A andB, lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of eIF-2. In addition to the eIF-2α phosphorylation, the phosphorylated HRI was observed. Note that the eIF-2 preparation is free of endogenous protein kinases (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). As expected, the anti-DGCN2 antibodies did not recognize either HRI (Fig.5 B, lanes 1 and 2) or eIF-2 (lane 3). A single labeled polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 175 kDa was produced by DGCN2 immune complexes (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). This phosphopolypeptide was recognized by the anti-DGCN2 antibodies in Western assays (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4and 5). More importantly, DGCN2 immune complexes phosphorylated the α subunit of the eIF-2 (Fig. 5 A,lane 4). The immunoprecipitation was specific because it was prevented by addition of the peptide immunogen in the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5, A and B,lanes 6 and 7). All together, our results indicate that DGCN2 is, indeed, an eIF-2α kinase of Drosophila melanogaster and is phosphorylated in the immune complexes. This reaction may occur by autophosphorylation as in yeast GCN2 (28Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the eIF-2 function by phosphorylation of its α subunit is the best-characterized mechanism for regulating total protein synthesis in mammalian cells (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 2Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The regulation ofGCN4 expression in yeast represents gene-specific translational control by phosphorylation of eIF-2α. This unique response depends on four short upstream ORFs in the leader sequence ofGCN4 mRNA (9Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, previous studies provided evidence that protein synthesis in insect cells can be regulated by phosphorylation of eIF-2α and inhibition of eIF-2B activity (11Mateu M.G. Sierra J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have cloned a Drosophila eIF-2α kinase through a PCR-based strategy. The data reported here strongly suggest that we have succeeded in characterizing the first homologue of yeast GCN2 fromDrosophila melanogaster. The amino-terminal portion of yeast GCN2 contains a sequence related to subdomains VIb to XI of eukaryotic protein kinases. Similarly, DGCN2 contains a sequence, in the amino-terminal region, related to subdomains III to XI of eukaryotic protein kinases (5Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). It is especially noteworthy that this partial kinase domain of DGCN2 (Fig. 2) displays a significant homology to mammalian Raf proto-oncogene and to yeast BCK1, which are involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades in vertebrates and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively (29Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). Our finding raises the possibility that DGCN2 may also play additional roles in the signal transduction pathways. In this respect, it has been reported that interleukin 3 stimulates protein synthesis by regulating PKR (30Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and that PKR is autophosphorylated in vivo in response to platelet-derived growth factor (31Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DGCN2 mRNA is dynamically expressed during embryogenesis. During gastrulation, high levels are detected in the furrows, active areas of cell rearrangements during which cells change their neighbors and environments, allowing interactions and inductive processes between various regions of the developing body (32Leptin M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 189-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since these morphogenetic movements represent the first morphological manifestation of cell fate and differentiation programs, the localized expression of DGCN2 in these areas may indicate a putative role in some of these processes, for example, helping to differentiate the three different germ layers of mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. In fact, the early expression in the mesoderm suggests that DGCN2could be involved in determining mesoderm germ layer identity during early stages of development. At late stages of embryogenesis, during the formation of the axon scaffold, DGCN2 expression concentrates in the nervous system. Interestingly, when the commissures are almost completely formed, this expression is selectively restricted to a few cells of the ventral cord (two pairs of cells per neuromer) that probably correspond to neurons. This surprising selectivity is also consistent with the idea that DGCN2 might be involved in determining neural cell identity for these cells. Anti-DGCN2 antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of about 175 kDa from Drosophila embryo extracts that specifically phosphorylated the α subunit of eIF-2 (Fig.5 A). This polypeptide is a phosphoprotein and is identified by Western blotting with the antibodies (Fig. 5B). The same results were obtained previously when yeast GCN2 immune complexes were used (28Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results indicate that DGCN2 is aDrosophila eIF-2α kinase homologue of the yeast GCN2 kinase. In the future, it will be important to know whether uncharged tRNA or other activators act as a signal to regulate DGCN2. The fact that HRI, as well as PKR, functionally substituted for GCN2 in theGCN4 translational control of yeast (34Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) may suggest that DGCN2 will play a similar role. It is noteworthy that amino acid starvation or a defective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase leads to increased levels of eIF-2α phosphorylation in mammalian cells (35Clemens M.J. Galpine A. Austin S.A. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. Pollard J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 767-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) although the kinase responsible for that has yet to be identified. It will also be interesting to see whether translation of any Drosophilaembryonic gene is modulated by a system of short upstream ORFs, like that present at GCN4, in response to modest changes in the level of eIF-2α phosphorylation. Several recent studies suggest a role for eIF-2α phosphorylation in the control of cell growth and differentiation (7de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although they mostly concern PKR, it will be of great interest to determine whether DGCN2 is involved in the translational control of mRNAs that encode key growth regulating proteins and to determine whether eIF-2α phosphorylation has any role in cell-cycle control and cellular differentiation in Drosophila.

In this study we have examined the effects on dioxin receptor function of a potentially novel ligand, omeprazole, which is widely clinically used as a gastric anti-ulcer drug. In primary human hepatocytes omeprazole potently induced cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA expression, whereas this effect was not detected in mouse primary hepatocytes. In human hepatoma cells omeprazole was found to induce transcription of reporter genes via the xenobiotic response element that is recognized by the ligand-activated dioxin receptor. In contrast, the human dioxin receptor was not activated by omeprazole upon expression in a receptor-deficient mouse hepatoma cell line. In a reconstituted yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) model system, however, both the mouse and human dioxin receptors were potently activated by omeprazole. Although omeprazole failed to displace dioxin in in vitro ligand binding assays, a residue within the ligand binding domain that is critical for dioxin binding in vitro was also critical for omeprazole responsiveness in vivo. Consistent with this observation, both omeprazole and dioxin responsiveness of the dioxin receptor was inhibited in mutant yeast cells expressing low levels of the molecular chaperone hsp90 that is critical for ligand binding activity. The sulfoxide group that is essential for formation of a planar conversion product of omeprazole was found to be critical for dioxin receptor activation. Taken together, these data suggest that omeprazole represents a precursor for a novel class of dioxin receptor agonists that are bona fide dioxin receptor ligands but generated in a strictly species-specific manner.

Birkhäuser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1995: 177-205Google Scholar). In various animal models, dioxins and structurally related compounds elicit a broad spectrum of biological effects ranging from hepato-, neuro-, and immunotoxic effects, reproductive and teratogenic disorders to carcinogenic effects (3Poland A. Knutson J.-C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar, 4Safe S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 371-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dioxin receptor functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of DNA binding proteins (5Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 6Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Within this large family of proteins the dioxin receptor is distinguished by a region of homology, the PAS domain, that is contiguous with the bHLH motif and is common to the Drosophila circadian rhythm regulatory protein period, the Drosophila developmental regulators trachealess and single-minded, the mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, the constitutively active transcription factor Arnt, and a human putative Down syndrome-critical factor (7Dahmane N. Charron G. Lopes C. Yaspo M.L. Maunoury C. Decorte L. Sinet P.M. Bloch B. Delabar J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9191-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Wang G.L.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, and references therein). Upon exposure to ligand the dioxin receptor acquires an increased affinity for xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) that confer dioxin regulation on target genes, e.g. a battery of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P4501A1 (11Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor to an XRE binding form is accompanied by its apparent translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of target cells (12Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). The receptor activation pathway is not fully understood but is clearly a multistep process. In nonstimulated cells the receptor is recovered as a complex with the molecular chaperone hsp90. The ligand binding process induces release of hsp90 from the receptor (13Wilhelmsson A. Cuthill S. Denis M. Wikström A.-C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and concomitant recruitment of the bHLH/PAS factor Arnt, enabling both proteins to specifically recognize the XRE motif (14Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 15Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Targeted disruption of the dioxin receptor gene in mice has indicated that the receptor may play a role in hepatic development (18Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.T.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). However, a physiological ligand of the dioxin receptor, if any, has not yet been identified. Among the known xenobiotic dioxin receptor ligands, all of which have a planar structure (3Poland A. Knutson J.-C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar, 20Gillner M. Bergman J. Cambilleau C. Alexandersson M. Fernström B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 336-345PubMed Google Scholar), there seems to exist a good correlation between the affinity of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, their in vitro dioxin receptor activating capacity (measured as in vitro induction of XRE binding activity of the receptor in cellular extracts), and their potency to induce transcription of the cytochrome P450IA1 gene in vivo(21Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Other classes of dioxin receptor ligands include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzo[a]pyrene and 3-methylcholanthrene), flavonoids, and indole derivatives, most notably indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, a dioxin receptor agonist of dietary origin that binds to the receptor with the same affinity as the prototypical dioxin TCDD (20, 22Poellinger L. Göttlicher M. Gustafsson J.-Å. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 241-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23, and references therein). Within the latter three classes of ligands, resistance to metabolism plays a very important role in the biological potency of the compound (23Kleman M.I. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5137-5144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Riddick D.S. Huang Y. Harper P.A. Okey A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12118-12128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, omeprazole, a benzimidazole derivative clinically used as a gastric proton pump inhibitor (25Lind T. Cederberg C. Ekenved G. Haglund U. Olbe L. Gut. 1983; 24: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26Lindberg P. Nordberg P. Alminger T. Brändström A. Wallmark B. J. Med.

Toxicol. 1995; 35: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar and references therein), has been demonstrated to induce expression of the dioxin receptor target gene cytochrome P4501A1 in both primary human hepatocytes (28Diaz D. Fabre I. Daujat M. Saint-Aubert B. Bories P. Michel H. Maurel P. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 737-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), human hepatoma cells (29Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar), tissues of the human alimentary tract (30McDonnell W.M. Schalman J.M. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1509-1516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and human colon adenocarcinoma cells (31Daujat M. Charasse S. Fabre I. Lesca P. Joinaidi Y. Larroque C. Poellinger L. Maurel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this context, the mechanism of action of omeprazole remains, however, unclear. Whereas omeprazole has been shown to induce XRE binding activity of the dioxin receptor in nuclear extracts of human hepatoma cells (29Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar), the failure to detect any binding of omeprazole to the dioxin receptor has been reported (32Daujat M. Peryt B. Lesca P. Fourtainier G. Domergue J. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, these data would argue against the simple model that omeprazole represents a dioxin receptor ligand. In the present study we have investigated regulation of dioxin receptor function by omeprazole. We demonstrate that induction of cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA expression by this compound, and activation of a minimal XRE-driven reporter gene construct, was species-specific. Thus, the omeprazole-induced activation response was only observed in human but not mouse primary hepatocytes or hepatoma cell lines. In contrast, omeprazole potently activated both the mouse and human dioxin receptors in a reconstituted yeast model system. Strikingly, a specific point mutation that abrogates dioxin binding in vitro by the receptor inhibited the omeprazole activation response in yeast, strongly suggesting that receptor activation was mediated by the ligand binding domain. Moreover, omeprazole as well as dioxin responsiveness in yeast was totally impaired at low levels of expression of hsp90 that is a critical chaperone for ligand binding activity. We failed, however, to observe any binding by omeprazole in in vitroreceptor ligand binding assays. In conclusion, dioxin receptor-mediated signal transduction by omeprazole appears to be regulated at two distinct levels. Although the mouse dioxin receptor is responsive to omeprazole treatment per se, the omeprazole activation response is repressed in mouse hepatocytes or hepatoma cells. Furthermore, omeprazole appears to require chemical conversion or metabolism in vivo to an active, planar principle of transient nature that regulates dioxin receptor function via the ligand binding domain, possibly as a novel class of receptor ligand. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from human hepatic tissue fragments following lobectomy, or from C57BL/6 mouse liver as described (28Diaz D. Fabre I. Daujat M. Saint-Aubert B. Bories P. Michel H.

The resulting supernatant was taken as the cytosolic fraction and used either immediately or frozen in small aliquots at −70 °C. DNA binding activity of the dioxin receptor was monitored by a gel mobility shift assay performed essentially as described previously (41Hapgood J. Cuthill S. Denis M. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å.

In vitro translation mixtures (50 μl) or Hepa 1c1c7 cell cytosolic extracts were incubated for 3 h at 0–4 °C with 50 μl of TEG buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and [3H]TCDD (40 Ci/mmol; Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS) at a final concentration of 2.5 nm in the absence or presence of a 400, 4,000, or 20,000-fold molar excess of competitor ligand. Ligand binding activity was analyzed by centrifugation on 5–20% (w/v) or 10–40% (w/v) sucrose density gradients, respectively, prepared in TEG buffer containing 25 mm KCl and 20 mm sodium molybdate. Prior to sucrose gradient centrifugation, sodium molybdate was added to the samples to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the samples were treated with dextran-coated charcoal (13Wilhelmsson A. Cuthill S. Denis M. Wikström A.-C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) for 5 min to remove unbound ligand. After rapid centrifugation the resulting supernatants were layered onto sucrose gradients that were centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 15 h to a cumulative centrifugal force of 1.7 × 10 12 rad2/s in a Beckman L8–60 ultracentrifuge. Fractions were collected by gravity flow, starting from the bottom of the gradients, and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Yeast strain GRS4 transformed with the mouse pHG/GRDBD/mDR83-805 or human pHG/GRDBD/hDR84-848 glucocorticoid-dioxin receptor fusion proteins, respectively, has been described previously (44Whitelaw M.L.

St. Jean A. Woods R. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Single colonies were grown to saturation in selective medium containing either 2% galactose or 2% glucose at 25 °C for the chimeric receptors and with 2% glucose at 30 °C for the full-length dioxin receptor constructs. Cultures were diluted 1:6 in fresh medium and grown overnight in the absence or presence of either omeprazole or the high affinity dioxin receptor ligand indolo[3,2-b]carbazole, synthesized as described (48Robinson, B. (1963) J. Chem. Soc. 3097–3099.Google Scholar). Omeprazole analogues, timoprazole (TI), and desoxytimoprazole (D-TI), were prepared as described (49Kühler T.C. Fryklund J. Bergman N.-Å. Weilitz J. Lee A. Håkan L. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4906-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were collected from the overnight culture by centrifugation and assayed for enzyme activity as described previously (50Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol.

Yeast cells expressing wild-type or point-mutated dioxin receptor forms were grown at 30 °C in appropriate selection media containing 2% glucose. Extracts were prepared as described previously (52Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For assaying expression levels of wild-type and mutant dioxin receptor forms, 20 μg of total yeast extract protein was analyzed in immunoblot experiments using a dioxin receptor antiserum as described previously (15Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To investigate effects of omeprazole on dioxin receptor function in vivo, we transiently transfected mouse Hepa 1c1c7 and human HepG2 cells with the XRE-driven reporter gene construct pXRE-MMTV-AP. As schematically represented in Fig.1 A, this reporter gene contains a minimal mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter in which endogenous glucocorticoid responsive elements have been substituted with a single XRE from the cytochrome P4501A1 gene (15Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In Hepa 1c1c7 cells this reporter gene shows very low basal activity in the absence of ligand treatment and strong transcriptional activation following the addition of 10 nm dioxin (15; Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, activation of the reporter gene was not detected upon addition of 50 μm omeprazole to Hepa 1c1c7 cells (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, transcription of the XRE-driven reporter gene was induced about 3-fold by omeprazole in human HepG2 cells. This induction response represented only a fraction of the maximal activation response (around 9–10-fold induction) produced by dioxin treatment (Fig.1 B), possibly due to rapid metabolism of the inducing compound during the prolonged (24–48 h) reporter gene assay. Consistent with the modest reporter gene activation response observed in the present study, omeprazole has been demonstrated to induce cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells to approximately 30% of the response observed with dioxin (29Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar). Within the asymmetric P4501A1 XRE core motif TGCGTG (53Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; E box half-site shown in italics) a single point mutation (TGAGTG; mutation underlined) abrogates recognition of the XRE target sequence by the ligand-activated dioxin receptor in in vitro DNA binding assays (42Cuthill S. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 404-411Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and dioxin receptor functionin vivo (15Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Given the XRE-driven reporter gene activation response that was produced by omeprazole treatment of human HepG2 cells, we also examined the effect of omeprazole on the activity of a reporter gene driven by a single copy of a mutated XRE motif, XREmut (Fig. 1 A), containing this single point mutation. In HepG2 cells, omeprazole failed to induce reporter gene activity from the XREmut-driven promoter (Fig.1 B), demonstrating that the XRE sequence motif was the target for regulation and strongly implying the XRE binding dioxin receptor-Arnt complex in mediating the omeprazole induction response. The failure to activate either the XRE-driven reporter gene construct (Fig. 1 B) or cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA levels (data not shown) by omeprazole treatment of mouse Hepa 1c1c7 cells prompted us to examine if the absence of this response was due to the loss of a possible differentiation-sensitive cofactor. We therefore compared by a sensitive RNase protection assay (37Muntane-Relat J. Ourlin J.-C. Domergue J. Maurel P. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) regulation of cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA expression by omeprazole in human primary hepatocytes and primary hepatocytes from the dioxin- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-responsive (3Poland A. Knutson J.-C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar) mouse strain C57BL/6. In human or mouse primary hepatocytes treated with vehicle (Me2SO) alone, no basal expression levels of cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA were detected (Fig. 2, A andB, lane 2). As demonstrated earlier (28Diaz D. Fabre I. Daujat M. Saint-Aubert B. Bories P. Michel H. Maurel P. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 737-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Curi-Pedroza R. Daujat M. Pichard L. Ourlin J.C. Clair P. Gervot L. Lesca P. Domergue J. Joyeux H.

Ther. 1994; 269: 384-392PubMed Google Scholar) exposure of human primary hepatocytes to 50 μm omeprazole resulted in potent induction of cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA steady-state levels. A similar induction response was produced by an identical dose of the well characterized (3Poland A. Knutson J.-C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar, 4Safe S.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In contrast, no induction of cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA levels was detected upon incubation of mouse primary C57BL/6 hepatocytes with increasing concentrations (up to 50 μm) of omeprazole. In control experiments, cytochrome P4501A1 mRNA levels were maximally induced in the mouse primary hepatocytes by 10 μmβ-naphthoflavone (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2–6). Thus, although the XRE reporter gene experiments strongly implicated the dioxin receptor in"

Previous studies on CopA-CopT pairing in vitro revealed the existence of a primary loop-loop interaction (kissing complex) that is subsequently converted to an almost irreversible duplex. However, the structure of more stable binding intermediates that lead to the formation of a complete duplex was speculative. Here, we investigated the interaction between CopA and CopT by using Pb(II)-induced cleavages. The kissing complex was studied using a truncated antisense RNA (CopI) that is unable to form a full duplex with CopT. Furthermore, RNase III, which is known to process the CopA-CopT complex in vivo, was used to detect the existence of a full duplex. Our data indicate that the formation of a full CopA-CopT duplex appears to be a very slow process in vitro. Unexpectedly, we found that the loop-loop interaction persists in the predominant CopA-CopT complex and is stabilized by intermolecular base pairing involving the 5′-proximal 30 nucleotides of CopA and the complementary region of CopT. This almost irreversible complex suffices to inhibit ribosome binding at the tap ribosome binding site and may be the inhibitory complex in vivo.

This almost irreversible complex suffices to inhibit ribosome binding at the tap ribosome binding site and may be the inhibitory complex in vivo. Natural antisense RNAs control a variety of biological functions, mainly in prokaryotic accessory genetic elements such as phages, transposons, and plasmids (1Wagner E.G.H. Simons R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Most antisense RNAs found regulate the plasmid copy number. The efficiency of antisense RNA control depends on the rate constant for the binding between antisense and target RNA and on the intracellular concentration of the inhibitor RNA. The binding pathways were extensively studied in ColE1 (2Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Tomizawa J. Cell. 1986; 47: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and R1 (5Persson C.

In both systems, the binding process is seen as a series of reactions leading to a stable duplex. The initial, rate-limiting step involves the formation of a transient loop-loop interaction (kissing complex) that is followed by a subsequent nucleation step via the single-stranded 5′ segment of the antisense RNA. This interaction is believed to result in the formation of a double-stranded RNA along the entire length of the target site. However, the full duplex may not be required for inhibition since the transient kissing complex appears to be sufficient for control in ColE1 (8Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), R1 (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and IncB (10Siemering K.R. Praszkier J. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmids. Plasmid R1 belongs to the IncFII group whose initiation frequency is controlled by an antisense RNA, CopA. CopA inhibits RepA synthesis by binding to the leader region of the repA mRNA (CopT) 80 nucleotides upstream of the repA translational start codon (11Nordström K. Molin S. Light J. Plasmid. 1984; 12: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). RepA synthesis requires the translation of a short leader peptide (Tap) encoded immediately downstream of the CopA target site, overlapping the repA reading frame by two nucleotides (12Blomberg P. Nordström K. Wagner E.G.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2675-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This implies that CopA inhibits repA translation indirectly by preventing tap translation in vivo (13Blomberg P. Engdahl H.M. Malmgren C. Romby P. Wagner E.G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Extensive mutational analyses revealed that the structures of both the antisense and the target RNAs are critical for obtaining an optimal binding rate and in vivo control (1Wagner E.G.H. Simons R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, although the role of loop-loop interactions in the binding pathway of the antisense RNA and its target has been characterized (7Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1991; 65: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the structure(s) of more stable binding intermediate(s) that lead to a complete duplex remained speculative. In the present study, the interaction between CopA and CopT was followed by using Pb(II)-induced cleavages. The loop-loop interaction was also probed using a truncated antisense RNA (CopI) that is unable to form a full duplex with CopT (6Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNase III that processes the CopA-CopT complex (14Blomberg P. Nordström K. Wagner E.G.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was used to distinguish between antisense-target RNA complexes differing in the extent of duplex formation. Our results indicate that the stable CopA-CopT complex is not fully base-paired in the region of complementarity. Remarkably, an extended loop-loop interaction persists in the CopA-CopT complex, maintaining the structures of the major CopA and CopT stem loops. This kissing complex is additionally stabilized by an intermolecular helix involving the 5′-proximal 30 nucleotides of the antisense RNA and its counterpart in CopT. The significance of this CopA-CopT complex for the regulatory mechanism is discussed. CopT, CopA, and CopI were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase from polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments as described by Hjalt and Wagner (15Hjalt T. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transcription of CopT yields a run-off product of 302 nucleotides that carries two G residues at its 5′ end instead of the GU sequence of the wild type repA mRNA. The CopA RNA contains a 5′-terminal G instead of an A residue. 5′-End labeling of dephosphorylated RNA was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Labeled RNAs were purified by polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis, eluted, and precipitated twice with ethanol. Before use, the different RNAs were dissolved in RNase-free water and renatured by incubation at 90 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling at room temperature in TMN buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm sodium acetate). Experimental conditions were adapted from Hjalt and Wagner (15Hjalt T. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Complex formation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 or 15 min in TMN buffer with 5′-end-labeled CopT (3 × 10−8m) and a 5-fold excess of unlabeled CopA or CopI (1.5 × 10−7m) or with 5′-end-labeled CopA or CopI (4 × 10−8m) and a 5-fold excess of unlabeled CopT (2 × 10−7m). Full duplexes between 5′-end-labeled CopT and CopA or CopI were formed by incubation at 90 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to 37 °C in TMN buffer. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained end-labeled RNA (20,000 cpm) either free or in complex, carrier tRNA (2.5 μg), and lead(II) acetate at a final concentration of 8 or 16 mm in TMN buffer. Incubation was done at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.1 m EDTA followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of stop buffer (93% formamide, 30 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.5% SDS). Before electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide-urea 8 m gels, the samples were heated at 90 °C for 3 min. 5′-End-labeled CopT was incubated with a 5-fold excess of CopA or CopI (10−7m) in 10 μl of TMN buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 5, 15, or 30 min. Full RNA duplexes were formed as described above. Cleavage of free or complexed CopT was at 37 °C from 25 s to 10 min with 0.002 μg of RNase III or from 1 to 10 min with 0.25 μg of RNase III (a gift from D. Court). All reactions contained 10 μg of carrier tRNA. Reactions were stopped by phenol extraction followed by RNA precipitation. Pellets were dissolved in 10 μl of stop buffer and analyzed as described above. The primary binding intermediate involving the loop-loop interaction was studied by using the truncated antisense RNA, CopI, which is unable to promote a full duplex with CopT (6Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In both free RNAs, the major cleavages occur in single-stranded regions, mainly in the hairpin loops and the interhelical regions (Fig. 1). The cleavage positions are shown schematically on the secondary structures of the RNAs (Fig. 2). The cleavages in loop II of CopI (but also CopA) and in loop II′ of CopT extend into the helical regions, which is probably due to the presence of several bulged nucleotides (15Hjalt T. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under native conditions (kissing complex), CopI binding induces significant changes in the Pb(II) cleavage pattern of CopT (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6). Strong protection is observed on the 3′ side of the upper stem II′ at U117 to A123 and to a lesser extent at U102 to C107. Furthermore, increased reactivity induced by CopI binding occurs at U109 and G112. The Pb(II) sensitivity of the non-complementary regions is not altered, indicating that CopI binding induces structural changes restricted to the upper part of stem loop II′ of CopT (Fig.1 A). When full duplexes are formed, complete resistance to Pb(II) hydrolysis is observed in the region encompassing U94 to C138 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8 and 9). Therefore, Pb(II) is a sensitive probe that allows discrimination between a full duplex and the kissing complex. Conversely, binding of CopT induces enhanced Pb(II) cleavages at A29 and, to a lesser extent, at C28, A30, and A31 in CopI (Fig. 1 A). Most of the nucleotides located in loop II of CopI are still cleaved by Pb(II) upon CopT binding, indicating that the upper part of helix II participates in the formation of the intermolecular helix that characterizes the kissing complex. Significant protection on both sides of the upper helix of CopI is observed, especially on the 5′ side of helix II at U33 to A39 (Fig.1 B).Figure 2Pb(II) probing and effect of binding of antisense RNA or CopT. The results are summarized on the secondary structure of CopA (left), CopI, and CopT (right). Positions of Pb(II) cleavages in the free RNAs are indicated byarrows. Large filled arrows, strong; small shaded arrows, moderate; and open head arrows, weak cleavages. The effect of antisense RNA or CopT binding is indicated as follows: strong (•) and moderate (○) protection. Enhancements are represented by stars proportional to the intensity. The labeled RNA used is indicated by an asterisk. The effects of CopT binding on CopI or CopI binding on CopT are shown in theinsets, using the same symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A CopA-CopT complex in which either CopA or CopT was labeled at the 5′ end was formed under native conditions at 37 °C and subjected to Pb(II) probing. Under these conditions, stable complexes were formed within 5 min at 37 °C (data not shown). Unexpectedly, CopA binding induces the same reactivity changes in stem loop II′ of CopT as CopI (cf. lanes 5 and 6 withlanes 11 and 12 in Fig. 1 A). In particular, the bulged cytosine 101 and part of the external loop II′ of CopT remain accessible to Pb(II). Additional protections occur in the 140–162 region (Fig. 2). No major structural rearrangement of CopT RNA occurs in the non-complementary region since the Pb(II) sensitivity remained unchanged (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the formation of a full CopA-CopT duplex entails complete protection of the CopA binding site from nucleotide 81 to 162 of CopT (Fig. 1 A, lanes 14 and 15). Conversely, CopT binding induces the same reactivity changes in stem loop II of CopI and CopA (see Fig. 1,B and C). This is clearly illustrated by a strong enhancement at A60 and weaker increase at C59, A61, and A62 in CopA. In addition, the 5′-proximal 30 nucleotides of CopA are protected from Pb(II) in the presence of CopT (Fig. 2). Altogether, these results suggest that a full duplex is not the major product of the CopA-CopT complex in vitro. The extended loop-loop contact, as found in the CopI-CopT complex, persists in the CopA-CopT complex, but this complex is additionally stabilized by the formation of an intermolecular helix that involves the 5′-proximal 30 nucleotides of CopA and the complementary region of CopT. RNase III was shown to process the CopA-CopT complex in vivo (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reinvestigated RNase III-dependent cleavages under conditions of full duplex formation and native CopA-CopT complex formation to define the extent of duplex formation. The cleavage positions were mapped using 5′-end-labeled CopT RNA (Fig.3 A). The cleavage sites are indicated on a schematic drawing (Fig. 3 B). When CopA or CopI was heated and slowly cooled in the presence of labeled CopT, allowing the formation of full RNA duplexes, the same concentration of RNase III was able to fully digest both duplexes. The strongest cleavages were located at A93, U94, U99, and U100 (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, with the native CopA-CopT complex, RNase III produced two major cleavages in CopT at U149 and C154 (Fig. 3 A). This result is in agreement with the primary RNase III cleavage identified at C154 in vivo and in vitro (14Blomberg P. Nordström K. Wagner E.G.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, weak cleavages corresponding to the presence of the full duplex were also found in CopT bound to CopA, especially after a prolonged time of incubation (at least up to 15 min, Fig.1 A). Under the same conditions, the CopI-CopT complex formed at 37 °C was completely resistant to RNase III hydrolysis (data not shown). Therefore, these experiments indicate that the full duplex is not the major product of CopA-CopT complex in vitro and that its formation appears to be a slow process in vitro. Previous studies suggested that the binding of CopA to CopT proceeds in at least two experimentally distinguishable steps: kissing and hybridization duplex formation (5Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The first, rate-limiting step is the formation of a transient loop-loop interaction (a so-called kissing complex) that was supposed to permit the subsequent formation of a complete RNA duplex. The present structural probing performed on the kissing complex shows that most of the nucleotides in loop II of the truncated antisense RNA CopI, as well as in the complementary loop, are accessible to Pb(II). However, since point mutations within the CGCC sequence in loop II of CopA strongly affect the pairing rate and result in copy number-up phenotypes (5Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Nordström K. Molin S. Light J. Plasmid. 1984; 12: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Hjalt T. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these nucleotides are inferred to be part of the primary kissing complex (Fig.4 B). This intermediate, not detectable by the present probing approach, rapidly rearranges to an extended kissing complex in which the 5′ side of the upper part of stem II interacts in an interstrand pairing with CopT (Fig. 4 C). This is further supported by RNase V1 cuts in the upper stem II of CopI and increased accessibility of the 3′ side of loop II toward RNase T2 (6Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Notably, the formation of the extended kissing complex induces a strong Pb(II) cleavage in the loop II of the antisense RNA. This cleavage may be due to the presence of a magnesium binding site. In line with this view, Gregorian and Crothers (18Gregorian R.S. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) showed that the uptake of at least two magnesium ions stabilized the loop-loop interaction in the RNAI-RNAII stem loop complex of plasmid ColE1. The Pb(II) probing experiment also demonstrates that the extended kissing complex persists in the CopA-CopT complex. Furthermore, extensive protection in the 5′ segment of CopA and the complementary region of CopT supports the formation of 30–34 interstrand base pairs. We also showed that RNase III, which processes the CopA-CopT complexin vivo (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), cleaves the native CopA-CopT complex and the full duplex, respectively, in completely different ways. The major RNase III cleavage site in CopT bound to CopA under native conditions is centered within the 30-base pair intermolecular helix (Fig.3 B), which is consistent with known site preferences of RNase III (19Li H. Nichloson A.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The extended kissing complex CopT-CopI that is not processed in vivo (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) is also resistant to RNase III hydrolysis in vitro. The RNase III experiments indicate that only a minor fraction of the CopA-CopT complex proceeds to a full duplex in vitro. This suggests that the asymmetric extended kissing complex induces a structural bend that brings together the two complementary single-stranded segments neighboring the hairpins II and II′ to facilitate their rapid pairing (Fig. 4 D). Since previous studies showed that stable CopA-CopT complexes were formed very rapidly (5Persson C. Wagner E.G.H. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the identification of a stable and not fully base-paired CopA-CopT complex is somewhat unexpected. The present work indicates that this long lived intermediate (Fig. 4 D) predominates for at least 15 min under conditions in which kissing complex formation occurs within a few seconds and that conversion to a full duplex is very slow, as it was proposed in the ColE1 system (4Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions for the binding pathway of the antisense RNA involved in translational control of repA in IncB plasmids have been reported (10Siemering K.R. Praszkier J. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense RNAI primarily inhibits the formation of a pseudoknot structure that activates repAtranslation (20Wilson I.W. Praszkier J. Pittard A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 6476-6483Crossref Google Scholar). Both CopA and RNAI contain stable hairpins with identical hexanucleotide sequences within the loops. However, RNAI has only a short 5′ tail (9 nucleotides) and lacks a 5′ stem loop structure. Enzymatic probing indicated that RNAI and the target RNAII of plasmid pMU720 do not rapidly form a full duplex in vitrobut rather form an extended kissing complex stabilized by additional base pairs involving the 5′ tail of RNAI. In ColE1, NMR spectroscopy experiments showed that a kissing complex between two complementary stem loops of RNAI-RNAII involves base pairing of all loop residues (21Marino J.P. Gregorian R.S. Csankovski G. Crothers D.M. Science. 1995; 268: 1448-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this system, the stems of both hairpins are rather short (6 base pairs) and lack bulges. Comparing the different structures of the RNAI-RNAII stem loop complex (ColE1) with that of CopI (or CopA)-CopT (R1) and RNAI-RNAII (pMU720), it is tempting to speculate that bulges near a recognition loop permit an induced rearrangement to obtain a transient but stable extended kissing complex. Removal of the bulged residues in stem II of CopA and stem II′ of CopT strongly decreases both binding rate and kissing complex stability (22Hjalt T. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The same major RNase III cleavage site was identified in vitro and in vivo at C154 in CopT RNA (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of the CopA-CopT complexes that inhibitrepA expression in vivo may not be fully base-paired. The extent of complete pairing in vivo may be underestimated due to RNase III processing followed by very rapid decay of the RNAs. Nevertheless, we propose that the formation of the long lived CopA-CopT complex detected in vitro is sufficient to account for the observed translational control. We have recently shown that this complex prevents initiation complex formation at thetap ribosome binding site (23Malmgren C. Engdahl H.M. Romby P. Wagner E.G.H. RNA. 1996; 2: 1022-1032PubMed Google Scholar). Even the extended kissing complex (CopI-CopT) was able to transiently interfere with ribosome binding that correlates well with in vivo results (9Wagner E.G.H. Blomberg P. Nordström K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous observations (24Öhman M. Wagner E.G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2557-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the present data also show that the binding of CopI or CopA does not induce major conformational changes in the non-complementary sequences of CopT, i.e. in the tap and repA ribosome binding site regions. That Pb(II) is very sensitive to subtle conformational changes suggests that the structure of the kissing complex itself, rather than an induced RNA structure change downstream, prevents ribosome binding attap. In the wild type situation, the presence of the 5′ segment of CopA stabilizes the transient kissing complex, providing approximately three helical turns of double-stranded RNA immediately 5′ of the tap Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which is sufficient to completely and irreversibly block tap translation. The finding that complete pairing between an antisense and a target RNA is slow and can be unnecessary for inhibition may illustrate a rule rather than an exception. Structurally complex recognition stem loops of antisense and target RNAs appear to be intrinsically difficult to unfold during complex formation, and hence many biological control systems may have evolved to employ binding intermediates active in the inhibitory step. An advantage of such a mechanism is that inhibition kinetics can be faster than pairing kinetics (e.g. see Ref.25Brantl S. Wagner E.G.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3599-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) since the involved stem loops appear optimized for binding rate (26Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 27Nordström K. Wagner E.G.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 294-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas unfolding rates may be difficult to optimize (unless unwinding activities are present). We suggest that such considerations may be relevant for the design of efficient antisense RNA inhibitors.

Two forms of protein kinase C-δ were isolated from COS cells and characterized by differences in gel mobility, GAP-43 binding, and specific GAP-43 and histone kinase activities. A slow migrating, low specific activity form of protein kinase C-δ bound directly to immobilized GAP-43. Binding was abolished in the presence of EGTA, suggesting Ca2+ dependence of the interaction. The free catalytic domain of protein kinase C-δ did not bind GAP-43, suggesting the existence of a binding site in the regulatory domain. Glutathione S-transferase-protein kinase C-δ regulatory domain fusion proteins were generated and tested for binding to GAP-43.

PKC isotypes are activated by Ca2+, phospholipids, and diacylglycerol (or its pharmacomimetic phorbol ester), which bind at conserved (C) regions in the regulatory domain. Three PKC subfamilies are distinguished on the basis of the variability in their regulatory domains and consequential differences in cofactor dependence. The regulatory domains of PKC-α, -β, and -γ contain a C1 and a C2 region, rendering them responsive to diacylglycerol/phorbol ester, which bind at C1, as well as to Ca2+, which binds at C2. The regulatory domains of PKC-δ, -ε, -η, and -θ contain C1, but lack C2, resulting in Ca2+ independence. A variable extension (V0) is present N-terminal of the C1 region. PKC-ζ and -ι/λ resemble the isotypes in the latter subfamily; however, their C1 region is different and will not bind phorbol ester or diacylglycerol (1Stabel S. Parker P.J.

The growth-associated protein GAP-43 (also known as neuromodulin, p57, B-50, F1, pp46, and γ5) is one of the better characterized cellular PKC substrates known (8Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 9Coggins P.J. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has an almost exclusively neuronal localization and is present at high levels during development or during neuronal regeneration processes (10Liu Y.C. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Strittmatter S.M. Vartanian T. Fishman M.C. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In early stages of development, it is not confined to any particular part of the neuron; however, upon maturation, its expression becomes restricted to the axon, where it remains detectable in the axon shaft as well as in the axon terminal (12Van Lookeren Campagne M.

GAP-43 is a very acidic, “rod-shaped” protein with a predicted molecular mass of 23 kDa (9Coggins P.J. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It contains a single PKC phosphorylation site at Ser-41 and is further modified by dipalmitoylation at two adjacent Cys residues, Cys-2 and Cys-3 (9Coggins P.J. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This allows for membrane localization of the protein in the absence of an obvious hydrophobic domain. Phosphorylation of GAP-43 in vivo is significantly stimulated by phorbol ester and, in various systems, by membrane depolarization, nerve growth factor treatment, and conditions under which hippocampal slices show long-term potentiation (14Dekker L.V.

Manipulation of GAP-43 levels suggests a role for the protein in neurite outgrowth, possibly by modulating the adhesive properties of the growth cone (17Aigner L. Caroni P. J.

Furthermore, a role for GAP-43 in transmitter release has been proposed based on observations that interference with GAP-43 affects the release of neurotransmitter (19Dekker L.V. De Graan P.N.E.

Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10023-10028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some of the biochemical properties of GAP-43, such as its capacity to bind calmodulin and actin or to affect GTP-binding proteins, may underlie its cellular functions (8Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). It has been shown that GAP-43 serves as a substrate for a number of PKC isotypes (25Sheu F. Marais R. Parker P. Bazan N. Routtenberg A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Oehrlein S. Parker P. Herget T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of GAP-43 directly modulates its calmodulin binding capacity (8Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 9Coggins P.J. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that in addition to being effector molecules, PKC substrates also bind to the kinase directly, a property that may be important for intracellular targeting of PKC. Little is known concerning the manner in which PKC interacts with GAP-43, although the existence of a high affinity binding site outside the phosphoacceptor region has been proposed on the basis of enzyme kinetic studies (26Oehrlein S. Parker P. Herget T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we have addressed this issue by investigating the molecular determinants in PKC involved in GAP-43 binding. We demonstrate that GAP-43 interacts directly with PKC-δ outside the catalytic domain at the V0/C2 region. This defines a protein interaction domain on PKC-δ and suggests new ways to evaluate the functional relevance of the PKC/GAP-43 system. A monoclonal antibody to GAP-43 was obtained from Affinity Laboratories. The PKC-δ rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a C-terminal 10-mer peptide (27Olivier A. Parker P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was obtained from Pat Warne and Julian Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). The calmodulin polyclonal antibody, produced by Dr. A. Means, was obtained from Dr. E. Wood (Department of Biochemistry, University of Leeds). COS-7 cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from the Cell Production Unit at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (London). The PKC-δ expression plasmid pKS1-PKC-δ (27Olivier A. Parker P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation, and three 15-cm dishes of transfected COS cells were grown. Three days post-transfection, COS cells were washed three times in ice-cold buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) and scraped in harvesting buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 250 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The resulting cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer by 20 strokes, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, diluted to 10 ml in buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a MonoQ column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer B. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a 25-min isocratic wash followed by a gradient of NaCl in buffer B (0–0.5 min 120 min). After collection, an equal volume of glycerol was added to each fraction, and fractions were stored at −20 °C. DNA representing the human GAP-43 coding domain (28Ng S.C. De La Monte S.M. Conboy G.L. Karns L.R. Fishman M.C. Neuron. 1988; 1: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a human fetal brain library as template. The DNA was cloned inBamHI-XhoI sites of pRSETb (Invitrogen) using restriction sites engineered in the primers, and the resulting construct was used to transform XL-1 Blue bacteria. For protein production, 400 ml of LB medium was inoculated (1:20) with an overnight culture of XL-1/pRSETb-GAP-43 cells and grown for 3 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and after a further incubation of 5 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1m NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 50 μg/ml leupeptin and 200 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell suspension was sonicated for 1 min on ice using a Soniprep 2000, cooled for 1 min, and sonicated twice more for 2 min separated by 1 min of cooling. The resulting extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was taken and tumbled with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (QIAGEN Inc.; 0.5-ml bed volume, washed in buffer A) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed three times with 50 ml of buffer C and three times with 50 ml of buffer D (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1 m NaCl, 3 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 30 mm imidazole, 10 mmbenzamidine, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol) at 4 °C. Finally, hisGAP-43 was eluted by tumbling the beads twice for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of buffer D + 350 mm imidazole. The resulting preparation was dialyzed overnight against MilliQ H2O at 4 °C. A BanI (filled in)-HindIII cDNA fragment representing the regulatory domain of PKC-δ was inserted in EcoRI (filled in)-HindIII-digested pGEX-KG (Pharmacia) to generate pGEX-KG-PKC-δ-(1–298). ABamHI-HindIII fragment was taken out of this construct and inserted into pKSII(+) (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was digested with HindIII and ApaI and treated with exonuclease III, resulting in random deletion of the plasmid from the HindIII site. The digested mixture was blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease, religated, and used to transform XL-1 Blue bacteria. Plasmids with inserts of different lengths were selected and verified by sequence analysis. The inserts were taken out and reinserted into pGEX-KG. For the construction of pGEX-KG-PKC-δ-(1–121), a BamHI-BstNI fragment was taken out of pKSII(+)-PKC-δ-(1–298) and inserted into pGEX-KG. For protein production, 400 ml of LB medium was inoculated (1:20) with an overnight culture of XL-1 Blue cells transformed with the appropriate pGEX-KG-PKC-δ regulatory domain construct and grown for 3 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and after further incubation for 3–5 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A. The cell suspension was sonicated three times for 1 min on ice using a Soniprep 2000 each time, interrupted by 1 min of cooling on ice. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and to the supernatant was added Triton X-100 (final concentration of 1% (v/v)). The supernatant was tumbled with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia; 0.25-ml bed volume, washed in buffer A) for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were spun down and washed twice with 50 ml of ice-cold buffer A. The GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads in 0.5 ml of buffer E (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm reduced glutathione). Routinely, hisGAP-43 and GST fusion proteins were mixed and incubated in 50 μl of buffer E for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, a 20-μl bed volume of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads in 150 μl of buffer E was added, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Subsequently, the beads were spun down, drained completely, and washed twice with 1 ml of buffer E. Proteins bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose were eluted by shaking the beads in 30 μl of buffer E + 350 mm imidazole at 1300 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C. Beads were spun down, and the supernatant was taken. Adjustments to the incubation conditions are described below and in the figure legends and were made both before and after the addition of the beads. A GAP-43 expression construct was generated by inserting the GAP-43 coding sequence into pcDNA3. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-GAP-43 and pKS1 or pKS1-PKC-δ (27Olivier A. Parker P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 3 days, the cells were treated for 15 min with 1.3 μm ionomycin. Subsequently, the cells were homogenized in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm benzamidine and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. To the supernatants were added 50 μl of PKC-δ antiserum PP084 and 100 μl of protein A-agarose (50% bead volume in buffer A). The mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C, after which the protein A beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A. PKC-δ was eluted from the protein A-antibody complex by incubation for 1 h with 20 μg of peptide antigen (27Olivier A. Parker P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in 65 μl of buffer A. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. PKC enzyme activity was measured as described (30Dekker L.V. McIntyre P. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as indicated in the figure legends. GAP-43 phosphorylation was quantified by analyzing the phosphorylation mixture by SDS-PAGE and Cerenkov counting of the 32P incorporation in the GAP-43 protein band. Western analysis of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was performed according to Towbin et al. (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filters were incubated with antiserum (specified in the figure legends) in buffer A containing 1% fat-free skimmed milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Filters were processed using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Silver staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was performed according to Merril et al. (32Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). It has been reported that GAP-43 is phosphorylated by a number of PKC isotypes (25Sheu F. Marais R. Parker P. Bazan N. Routtenberg A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1236-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Oehrlein S. Parker P. Herget T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction may involve a complex interaction between GAP-43 and PKC since the kinetics of phosphorylation of GAP-43 polypeptide and phosphorylation site oligopeptide differ (26Oehrlein S. Parker P. Herget T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We noticed differences among PKC-δ preparations in their activity toward GAP-43, but not peptide substrates, also indicating complexity of interaction (data not shown). To investigate this in more detail, PKC-δ was overexpressed in COS cells and partially purified by MonoQ ion-exchange chromatography. MonoQ fractions were analyzed for kinase activity using exogenous recombinant hisGAP-43 or histone III-S as substrate. GAP-43 kinase activity eluted in three main peaks (peaks 1–3), two of which were dependent on cofactor, with the third being largely cofactor-independent (Fig. 1 A). Histone kinase activity in these fractions showed an additional cofactor-dependent activity (peak 4) eluting before peak 3 (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C shows a Western blot of the individual fractions probed with an antibody recognizing the PKC-δ C terminus. Full-length forms of PKC-δ coeluted with peaks 1 and 2, whereas a PKC-δ breakdown product of ∼45 kDa (representing the catalytic domain) eluted in peak 3. Peak 1 contained a fast migrating form of PKC-δ, and peak 2 contained a slower migrating form; fraction 25, between these peaks, contained both. Neither of the forms reacted with an antibody recognizing phosphotyrosine. Western blotting also revealed that peak 4 represents endogenous PKC-α present in COS cells (data not shown). To visualize all PKC-δ immunoreactivity in the different fractions, an overexposed autoradiograph is shown in Fig. 1 C. Densitometric scanning of an exposure in the linear range (Fig.1 D) revealed the amount of PKC-δ in peak 1 to be 10–20% of that in peak 2. By dividing the GAP-43 kinase activity of these fractions by the amount of antigen, an indication (albeit a semiquantitative one) of the specific GAP-43 kinase activity in these PKC-δ peaks was obtained. The specific GAP-43 kinase activity of peak 1 PKC-δ (fraction 23) was estimated to be 7-fold that of peak 2 PKC-δ (fraction 26). Specific GAP-43 kinase activity in fractions 30–33 did not differ from that in fractions 26–29. This analysis also revealed that the PKC-δ catalytic domain (peak 3) had much higher specific GAP-43 kinase activity than either peak 1 or 2. To assess the potential interaction of PKC-δ with GAP-43, the individual MonoQ fractions were incubated with hisGAP-43, after which hisGAP-43 was immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads, washed, and eluted from the beads by imidazole. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for PKC-δ and hisGAP-43. Fig. 2 A shows that peak 2 PKC-δ bound to immobilized GAP-43, whereas no GAP-43 binding was detected for peak 1. PKC-δ did not bind directly to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, no binding of the PKC-δ catalytic domain (peak 3) to GAP-43 occurred (Fig. 2 C). PKC-δ is known for its Ca2+-independent catalytic activity. Indeed, both PKC-δ forms phosphorylated histone III-S in a Ca2+-independent manner, whereas PKC-α (peak 3) showed Ca2+ dependence under the same conditions (Fig.3 A). Surprisingly, GAP-43 binding to PKC-δ (peak 2) was found to be reduced in the presence of EGTA, suggesting Ca2+ dependence of this interaction (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of histone by peak 2 PKC-δ, phosphorylation of GAP-43 increased upon EGTA addition (Fig. 3 C). This was not the case for peak 1 PKC-δ, which showed Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of histone as well as GAP-43 (Fig. 3, A and C). These data indicate that GAP-43 and PKC-δ interact directly with each other in a Ca2+-dependent fashion at a site outside the catalytic domain. Furthermore, PKC-δ is functionally heterogeneous since only the later eluting, slow migrating form (peak 2) bound to GAP-43. (It should be noted that since GAP-43 is not expressed in COS cells, the lack of binding to peak 1 is not due to a pre-existing GAP-43·PKC-δ complex.) In view of the fact that full-length PKC-δ bound to GAP-43, but the the catalytic domain of PKC-δ did not, we investigated where the interaction occurs in the regulatory domain. PKC-δ regulatory domain fragments of different length were produced as recombinant GST fusion proteins. Fig. 4shows the relative yield of the various fragments after extraction of the proteins and purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Of four regulatory domain fragments, GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) showed the highest levels of expression and the highest yield. PKC-δ-(1–121) represents the region of PKC-δ that previously has been identified as V0 (1Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) and that shares structural homology with the C2 region of the classical PKC isotypes (33Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). GST-PKC-δ-(1–298) and GST-PKC-δ-(1–165) showed, in addition to proteins of the predicted size, a breakdown product of ∼40 kDa. GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) and GST-PKC-δ-(1–61) were homogeneous proteins of the predicted molecular mass. To establish whether the regulatory domain of PKC-δ was able to bind GAP-43, the various GST-PKC-δ fusion proteins were assayed for binding to hisGAP-43 as described above. Fig.5 A shows that both GST-PKC-δ-(1–298) and GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) co-immobilized with hisGAP-43 on Ni2+-NTA beads. GST-PKC-δ-(1–61) and GST did not associate with hisGAP-43. In the absence of hisGAP-43, GST-PKC-δ-(1–298) and GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) were not present in the eluate, indicating that they do not bind directly to the beads. Fig.5 B shows the concentration dependence of the binding of GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) to hisGAP-43. At 0.5 μm GAP-43, half-maximum binding of GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) was estimated to occur at 50 nm. The binding of GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) to hisGAP-43 was not affected by high concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, 2 mm CaCl2 did not change binding, but it was completely lost in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (Fig. 6 A). The interaction between PKC-δ-(1–121) and hisGAP-43 may therefore be supported by trace calcium ions present in the incubation buffers. Analysis of the Ca2+ dependence of GAP-43 binding to PKC-δ-(1–121) in an EGTA-buffered system showed binding to occur at Ca2+ concentrations higher than 10−7m (Fig. 6 B). At a concentration of 10−7m or lower, binding was dramatically reduced. The binding of hisGAP-43 to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads was not affected by these Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown). To refine the binding of PKC-δ-(1–121) to GAP-43, we generated a C-terminal truncation mutant of GAP-43 (hisGAP-43-(1–146)) and analyzed its capacity to bind the various GST-PKC-δ regulatory domain constructs. In all aspects, hisGAP-43-(1–146) behaved in the same way as full-length hisGAP-43 both in terms of the binding preferences and concentration dependences of binding (Fig. 7). Thus, the binding of PKC-δ to GAP-43 occurs in the N-terminal part of the protein between residues 1 and 146. Since GAP-43 is a calmodulin-binding protein, we investigated whether the binding of GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) would preclude calmodulin binding to GAP-43. Calmodulin was identified on SDS gel by silver stain (Fig.8 B) based on its migration at the appropriate size (17 kDa) and by Western blotting using a calmodulin antibody (Fig.8 C). In line with existing literature, calmodulin bound to hisGAP-43 (immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads) in the absence, but not in the presence, of CaCl2 (Fig. 8,B and C). GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) binding to hisGAP-43 occurred whether or not calmodulin was associated, and similarly, calmodulin binding was unaffected when increasing amounts of GST-PKC-δ-(1–121) were bound to hisGAP-43 (Fig. 8). hisGAP-43 association with the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads was identical under all conditions (Fig. 8 A). Thus, PKC-δ binding to hisGAP-43 occurs at a site that is different from the calmodulin-binding site. To test whether GAP-43 and PKC-δ are able to form a productive complex in intact cells, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. A GAP-43 and a PKC-δ expression construct were transfected into 293 cells; PKC-δ was immunoprecipitated; and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for the presence of GAP-43 by Western blotting. Since GAP-43 binds to PKC-δ in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro, transfected cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin to elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels. Fig.9 shows GAP-43 to be present in PKC-δ immunoprecipitates from 293 cells cotransfected with GAP-43 and PKC-δ and treated with ionomycin. In the absence of ionomycin treatment, very little GAP-43 was detected. As a control, immunoprecipitations were carried out on cell lysates from cells that were transfected with GAP-43, but not PKC-δ. In these immunoprecipitates, background levels of GAP-43 were detected comparable to the level detected in the immunoprecipitates from cells not treated with ionomycin. We conclude that GAP-43 and PKC-δ form a complex in cells in response to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ as predicted on the basis of the in vitro binding studies. Evidence has been presented for the formation of a GAP-43·PKC-δ complex in intact cells and for the direct binding of GAP-43 at the regulatory domain of PKC-δ. Within the regulatory domain, the V0 region presents a minimal binding site. Little is known about the structure and function of this region, which is present in novel as well as atypical PKC isotypes. Recently, it was proposed that it may share structural homology with the C2 region in PKC-α, -β, and -γ (33Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our observation that GAP-43 binding occurs at the V0/C2 region of PKC-δ indicates that it may serve as a protein-protein interaction domain. Furthermore, the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction shows that circumstances may exist in which “Ca2+-independent” PKCs, such as PKC-δ, may still respond to changes in Ca2+ levels. The PKC-δ employed in this study was partially purified from COS cells and separated into two forms, characterized by differences in mobility on SDS gels. The slow migrating form of PKC-δ (peak 2) binds GAP-43, and binding of GAP-43 to this form was abolished by EGTA treatment, suggesting Ca2+ dependence of the interaction. No GAP-43 binding to the fast migrating form of PKC-δ (peak 1) was detected. The difference in migration of the two PKC-δ forms is likely to be a result of phosphorylation, as was previously shown for many other PKC isotypes (34Cazaubon S.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17559-17563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ is a well established phenomenon (36Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Soltoff S.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13490-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we could find no evidence that one of the forms in this study is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Under all circumstances, we observed a reciprocal correlation between the ability of PKC-δ to bind GAP-43 and its specific GAP-43 kinase activity. The high binding form shows low specific activity andvice versa. EGTA treatment of the binding form (abolishing GAP-43 binding) results in an increase in GAP-43 kinase activity. Under these conditions, histone kinase activity is not affected, indicating that EGTA impinges on a component in the reaction specifically related to GAP-43. Phosphorylation of GAP-43 by peak 1, the non-binding form, is not affected by EGTA, indicating that the effect of EGTA on GAP-43 phosphorylation is restricted to the binding form. The free catalytic domain of PKC-δ, which does not bind GAP-43, shows high activity. A unifying explanation for our observations is that GAP-43 binding may affect the specific GAP-43 kinase activity of PKC-δ, measured in thein vitro phosphorylation reaction. In addition to GAP-43 binding, other properties of PKC-δ play a role in the phosphorylation reaction. We observed that differences occur in histone kinase activity between the PKC-δ forms, although there is no complete quantitative agreement between the histone kinase activity of the two PKC-δ forms and their respective GAP-43 kinase activities (Fig. 1, A andB). In this respect, the difference in histone kinase activity may be a reflection of the intrinsic catalytic capacity of the two PKC-δ forms since histone is essentially a non-physiological substrate. Other determinants become relevant when a physiological substrate such as GAP-43 is used to assay kinase activity, as exemplified here by the non-catalytic interaction between the PKC-δ V0/C2 domain and GAP-43. Although the exact mechanism by which binding of GAP-43 to V0/C2 would contribute to specific activity is not formally demonstrated here, one possibility is that it affects the off-rate of phosphorylated product and hence the turnover of the phosphorylation reaction. Earlier work showing a low catalytic rate of phosphorylation of full-length GAP-43 versus GAP-43 phosphorylation site oligopeptide also implied rate-limiting interactions outside the direct site of catalysis (26Oehrlein S. Parker P. Herget T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), consistent with the above conclusion. Binding of V0/C2 to GAP-43 is not prevented by binding of calmodulin to GAP-43. Therefore, calmodulin and V0/C2 have different binding sites on GAP-43. This binding site is not in the C-terminal part of the molecule since the binding characteristics of GAP-43-(1–146) are identical to those of full-length GAP-43. The binding site may therefore lie between the calmodulin-binding site (residues 43–51) and residue 146 or in the extreme N terminus of GAP-43. Binding of GAP-43 to the regulatory domain of PKC-δ indicates that this domain is not just a target region for cofactor, but in fact serves as a protein-protein interaction domain. As such, this observation falls within the more general pattern of data suggesting such a role for the regulatory domain (39Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 40Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). For instance, several phospholipid-binding proteins have been shown to interact with the regulatory domain of PKC in a phospholipid-dependent way. This binding occurs, at least in part, at the pseudosubstrate site, which itself has phospholipid binding capacity (39Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 41Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although GAP-43 has been shown to bind phospholipid (9Coggins P.J. Zwiers H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), phospholipids were not present in the binding studies here. The binding of GAP-43 to PKC-δ at the V0/C2 region is reminiscent of the binding of RACK1 to PKC-β, which takes place at the C2 region (40Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 42Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to GAP-43, RACK1 is not a PKC substrate. Furthermore, PKC-δ does not need to be in an active conformation to bind to GAP-43. It was suggested that RACK1 binding to the C2 region is important for the subcellular redistribution of PKC-β, but not of PKC-δ and -ε, upon phorbol ester stimulation of cells (42Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Such specificity is intriguing in light of our observations, in that the interaction between PKC-δ and GAP-43 at the V0/C2 region may be important for the subcellular localization of PKC-δ. The finding that, on coexpression of GAP-43 and PKC-δ, a complex of the two proteins can be immunoprecipitated indicates that interaction can occur physiologically. The demonstration that this complex formation is dependent on the pretreatment of cells with the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin indicates that the interaction is regulated by Ca2+ in a manner consistent with that determined in vitro for the binding of GAP-43 to the V0/C2 region in PKC-δ. C2-like regions are present not only in PKC, but also in a number of other proteins (33Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and in these contexts appear to be involved in protein-protein interaction as well. The C2-like regions in synaptotagmin, for example, have been shown to bind syntaxin and AP-2 and also to dimerize (43Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 44Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions are Ca2+-dependent, and structural analysis of the C2A region of synaptotagmin I has revealed a Ca2+-binding site involving four aspartate residues forming a “cup-like cavity” to accommodate a Ca2+ ion (46Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Sudhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Our results show that Ca2+-dependent interactions can take place at a C2-like region that does not contain these four aspartate residues, indicating that the basis of the Ca2+ responses of the C2 regions may be more complex than initially thought. This can be concluded also from the recent molecular cloning of a large number of synaptotagmin isotypes, which revealed that at least two of them, while containing the same four aspartate residues in their C2A region as synaptotagmin I, did not show Ca2+-dependent syntaxin binding (43Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The data presented demonstrate that PKC-δ interacts with GAP-43 in a manner controlled by two regulatory devices. First, the binding is Ca2+-dependent both in vitro andin vivo. Second, fractionation of PKC-δ reveals the presence of binding and non-binding forms. Since this heterogeneity is stable to fractionation, it is likely to be a consequence of PKC-δ post-translational modification. In vivo, the combined effects of these two regulatory devices will serve to determine whether or not PKC-δ and GAP-43 interact. Future efforts will need to address this interaction in situ to assess its physiological role. We thank Drs. Clive Dickson and Enrique Rozengurt for critical comments on this manuscript."

Here, the substitutions Phe-10 → Ser, Thr-45 → Lys, Thr-77 → Ser, and Leu-78 → Val were most powerful. In addition, replacing four VH residues diminished cell lysis during fermentation. Thereby the product was preferentially located in the periplasm instead of the growth medium, and the total yield was more than 700 mg/liter. All engineered products retained a high affinity for the tumor-associated antigen.

Recently, a concept for cancer therapy using recombinant fusion proteins of tumor-reactive Fab fragment and immunostimulatory bacterial superantigens was presented (11Kalland T. Dohlsten M. Lind P.

The murine antibody 5T4 is directed against a trophoblast-related antigen found on several solid tumor types including carcinomas in lung, breast, colon, and ovary (16Southall P.J. Boxer G.M.

However, when produced as a secreted fusion protein in E. coli, the production level is 5–10-fold lower compared with several similar products. To investigate the molecular components behind this phenomenon, several amino acid residues in the Fv framework were altered. Significantly, by replacing only a few light chain residues the level of active product increased, while heavy chain substitutions affected the product distribution between growth medium and periplasmic space. Restriction endonucleases and Taqpolymerase were from Boehringer Mannheim or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The recombinant work was carried out mainly as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) in the E. coli strain HB101. Plasmid preparation was performed with Wizard™ Midipreps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) from bacteria grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an ABI 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Antibodies against murine κ chain were obtained from Bio-Zac (Stockholm, Sweden) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against SEA from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL). The Fv-encoding portions of 5T4 were cloned from the 5T4 hybridoma obtained from Dr. Peter Stern (CRCT, Paterson Inst. for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK). The cDNA was made from total RNA using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). The coding regions of the entire variable domains and parts of the signal sequences as well as the constant domains of the heavy and light chains were amplified by PCR. All PCR products and DNA linkers were sequenced on an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the supplier. The oligonucleotides 5′-CAATTTTCTTGTCCACCTTGGTGC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTCGACATGGGATGGAGCTITATCATI(C/T)TCTT-3′ were used for the heavy chain resulting in a 553-base pair fragment, while 5′-ACTAGTCGACATGGGCITCAAGATGGAGTCACA(G/T)(A/T)(C/T)(C/T)C(A/T)GG-3′ and 5′-GCGCCGTCTAGAATTAACACTCATTCCTGTTGAA-3′ were used for the light chain yielding a 724-base pair fragment. For each chain three separate clones were sequenced and found to be identical. DNA fragments suitable for insertion into the expression vector (12Dohlsten M. Abrahmsén L. Björk P. Lando P.A.

All 5T4 mutants were made as one-chain constructs and combined with the partner chain in the expression plasmid. The point mutations coding for Phe-10 → Ser, Ile-63 → Ser, and Tyr-67 → Ser, as well as the heavy chain mutations were introduced by PCR while Thr-45 → Lys, Phe-73 → Leu, Thr-77 → Ser, Leu-78 → Val, and Leu-83 → Ala used synthesized oligonucleotide linkers. Gene segments containing the various point mutations were also combined (Table I).

The products were expressed in the E. coli K-12 strain UL 635 (xyl-7, ara-14, T4R, ΔompT) using a plasmid with a kanamycin resistance gene and lacUV5 promoter. Bacteria from frozen stock were incubated at 25 °C for approximately 21 h in shaker flasks containing (per liter) 2.5 g of (NH4)2SO4, 4.45 g of KH2PO4, 11.85 g of K2HPO4, 0.5 g of sodium citrate, 1 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 11 g of glucose monohydrate, 0.11 mm kanamycin, and 1 ml of trace element solution (19Forsberg G. Baastrup B. Brobjer M. Lake M. Jörnvall H. Hartmanis M. Biofactors. 1989; 2: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar), however, without Na2MoO4·2H2O. The cells were grown to an A 600 of 1–2, and 450 ml of culture medium was used to inoculate a fermenter (Chemap, Switzerland) to a final volume of 5 liters. The fermenter medium contained (per liter) 2.5 g of (NH4)2SO4, 9 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of K2HPO4, 0.5 g of sodium citrate, 22 g of glucose monohydrate, 1 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.11 mm kanamycin, 1 ml of a decanol (Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K., Japan), and 1 ml of trace element solution. The pH was kept at 7.0 by titration with 25% ammonia; the temperature was 25 °C and aeration was 5 liters/min. The partial pressure of dissolved O2 was controlled to 30% by increasing agitation from 300 to 1000 rpm during batch phase and regulating the feed of 60% (w/v) glucose during fed batch phase. Product formation was induced at an A 600 of 50 by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After fermentation the cells were removed by centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C. The clarified medium was either analyzed and purified directly or stored at −70 °C. DNA present in the clarified medium was removed using precipitation with 0.19% polyethylenimine and 0.2m NaCl for 30 min (20Atkinson A. Jack G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 308: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After centrifugation as above, the supernatant was collected, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.5 m. This medium was applied to a protein G-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 6.0, containing 0.05% Tween 80. The column was washed with 1.5–2 column volumes of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 0.05% Tween 80, 7.5 column volumes of 20 mm citric acid, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80, pH 4.7, and bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m acetic acid and 0.05% Tween 80. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 5.0 using 0.5m sodium citrate, pH 7.5, diluted to a conductivity of 4.7 millisiemens/cm, applied to an SP-Sepharose HP column (Pharmacia), and equilibrated with 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.02% Tween 80. The column was then washed with 7.5 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and the fusion protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 60 to 350 mm sodium acetate over 13 column volumes. Cell extracts were prepared from 10 ml of freeze-thawed cell suspension containing both growth medium and cells. The samples were sonicated on an ice bed at an amplitude control of 35% for 3 min using a 3-mm probe, pulsing 70% of the time (VCX .600, Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT). After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatants were analyzed. Product levels were measured in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detecting assembled heterodimeric fusion protein. The wells were coated with antibodies directed against murine light chains, and full-length fusion protein was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against SEA. Standard curves were obtained for respective variant fusion proteins. After cell separation, DNA levels in the culture broth were measured using a DynaQuant 200 minifluorometer (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA) as recommended by the supplier. Reverse phase HPLC was carried out on an AsahiPak ODP-50 column (4 × 250 mm) (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) using a linear gradient from 30 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 40 min and a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 60 °C. Absorbance was measured at 215 nm using a diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on precast Tris/glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) containing 12% polyacrylamide. The products were analyzed as both reduced and non-reduced samples using the methods recommended by the supplier. Isoelectric focusing was performed on precast gels (Servalyt® Precotes®, Serva, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany) with a pH working range from 3 to 10 using the methods recommended by the supplier. Mass spectrometry was carried out on a MALDI-TOF MS (Hewlett-Packard), and amino acid analysis was performed using a Beckman 6300 essentially as described (19Forsberg G. Baastrup B. Brobjer M. Lake M. Jörnvall H. Hartmanis M. Biofactors. 1989; 2: 105-112PubMed Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was measured in a51Cr release assay after 4 h using the 5T4 antigen-positive Colo205 cultured in complete tissue culture medium (21Dohlsten M. Hedlund G. Åkerblom E. Lando P.A. Kalland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9287-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as target cells and human SEA-reactive T cell lines (12Dohlsten M. Abrahmsén L. Björk P. Lando P.A. Hedlund G. Forsberg G. Brodin T. Gascoigne N.R.J. Förberg C. Lind P. Kalland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8945-8949Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) at an effector to target ratio of 30:1. 51Cr-labeled target cells were used in the assay at 2500 cells/200 μl of tissue culture medium in V-bottomed microtiter wells. 5T4Fab-SEch fusion proteins were added at various concentrations, and 51Cr release was measured in a γ-counter. Specific cytotoxicity was calculated as 100 × [(cpm experimental release − cpm background release)/(cpm maximal release − cpm background release)]. The human cancer cell lines Calu-1 (ATCC HTB 54) and ME-180 (ATCC HTB 33), both expressing high levels of 5T4 antigen as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining, were cultivated in tissue culture medium as above. Adhered cells were detached from the flasks using non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma), washed twice in a CO2 independent medium without l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, and finally suspended in that medium at a density of 6 × 105cells/ml. The 5T4Fab-SEch was radiolabeled with the lactoperoxidase technique using Enzymobeads (DuPont NEN). The reaction was stopped with 0.05% NaN3, and the labeled protein was desalted by gel filtration (PD-10, Pharmacia) using culture medium as elution buffer. Conditions were chosen to obtain a ratio of iodine to protein of ≤2:1. In a direct binding assay, 3 × 104 cells in 50 μl of solution were mixed with 50 μl of serially diluted radioiodinated fusion protein in a conical polypropylene tube in triplicate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with intermittent mixing. Each tube was washed three times using 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, which was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. After the final wash, cell-bound radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. The apparent dissociation constant and number of binding sites at saturation were calculated (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17746) Google Scholar) after subtraction of nonspecific binding (i.e. binding after incubation in the absence of cells). This method was modified to an inhibition assay. Here serially diluted fusion proteins competed with wild-type125I-5T4Fab-SEch at a concentration corresponding to theK d value determined in the direct assay. The concentration yielding half-maximum inhibition, IC50, was determined after linear regression of log-logit transformed binding data, and the relative affinity index was determined as the ratio between the IC50 values of competitor and wild-type 5T4Fab-SEch. The individual 5T4 VH and VL domains were built by homology modeling to known structures using the COMPOSER module in SYBYL 6.22 (Molecular modeling program SYBYL 6.22, Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO). A family of structurally homologous molecules with sequence identities of at least 60% to the modeled chains were used as templates. For the heavy chain, 7 immunoglobulin fragments were selected, while for the light chain, 22 fragments were used. The structurally conserved regions were built by averaging the template structures according to the COMPOSER algorithm. The remaining LOOP regions were built using template loop fragments found among Fab fragments in the protein structure data base of COMPOSER. The individual VH and VL domains were docked to each other to form the Fv fragments. A structural alignment between the individual VH and VL chains and the crystallographic structure of a murine Fab, entry 1MCP in the Protein Data Bank (23Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D.J. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8135) Google Scholar), was made using the ALIGN procedure of the ICM program (24Abagyan R.M. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Finally, hydrogen atoms were added, and the structure was refined by a regularization procedure in the ICM algorithm (24Abagyan R.M. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The variable regions of the antibody 5T4 were cloned using PCR and introduced into an expression vector (12Dohlsten M. Abrahmsén L. Björk P. Lando P.A. Hedlund G. Forsberg G. Brodin T. Gascoigne N.R.J. Förberg C. Lind P. Kalland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8945-8949Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) coding for a Fab product with a superantigen linked to the C terminus of the heavy chain. The plasmid was transformed into an ompT strain ofE. coli, UL635, and expression of the recombinant product was induced with IPTG. The product was secreted as two separate polypeptide chains that assembled to a heterodimeric product in theE. coli periplasm. During fermentation, a significant amount of the two-chain product is excreted to the growth medium and usually connected by a significant cell lysis. Normally the levels of Fab superantigen products range from 100 to 400 mg/liter in the growth medium (data not shown). However, for 5T4Fab-SEch the production level was around 40 mg/liter in the growth medium and less than 10 mg/liter in the periplasm, as determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Table I). To increase the yield, several parameters in the fermentation procedure were varied such as time point and level of induction, temperature, and medium composition, but no further improvement in production level was achieved. To determine whether one of the two polypeptide chains dominated the production problem, hybrid molecules of 5T4Fab-SEch and C215Fab-SEch were made. C215 is a murine antibody recognizing a colon cancer epitope (25Björk P. Jönsson U. Svedberg H. Larsson K. Lind P. Dillner J. Hedlund G. Dohlsten M. Kalland T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fusion proteins between C215Fab and SEA-based superantigens are normally secreted at levels up to 400 mg/liter in E. coli. Fermentation of variant V1 with the 5T4 light and C215 heavy chain yielded 39 mg/liter product in the growth medium, while variant V2 with C215 light and 5T4 heavy chain yielded 224 mg/liter (Table I). For V1 and V2, most of the product was found in the growth medium instead of the periplasm (Table I). Hence, replacing the heavy chain of 5T4 did not affect the low production level, while replacement of the light chain resulted in a more than 5-fold increase. One further observation was made during fermentation. For the 5T4 wild-type construct, as well as variant V2 that contained the C215 light chain, the A 600 started to decline and the cell viability decreased more than 10-fold within a few hours after induction (Fig. 3), followed by an increased DNA level in the growth medium. The variant V1 that contained the C215 heavy chain behaved differently. The amount of viable E. coli cells was more than 10-fold higher for V1 than for V2 with 5T4 heavy chain when fermentation was terminated. In addition, the final cell density was much higher (Fig. 3). The fusion proteins were purified using protein G affinity and then ion exchange chromatography to remove degraded forms. The purified products were analyzed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reverse phase HPLC, mass spectrometry, isoelectric focusing, and amino acid analysis. The latter technique was also used to determine protein concentrations. All of these assays indicated that the main product contained and constituted 85–95% of the expected characteristics. However, both products showed a strongly reduced affinity for the 5T4 antigen (16Southall P.J. Boxer G.M. Bagshawe K.D. Hole N. Bromley M. Stern P.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1990; 61: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and only variant V2 with the 5T4 heavy chain had measurable affinity. The IC50 value was lowered approximately 1000-fold, and the products were at least 1000-fold less potent in cytotoxic activity (Table I). Three important conclusions could be made from these data. The low yield of product was mainly associated with the 5T4 light chain; the high cell lysis during fermentation was primarily associated with the 5T4 heavy chain, and both chains contain residues important for binding to the 5T4 antigen. To explain the low production level of 5T4, a model was built. Here information regarding exposed hydrophobic residues, structural identification of the complementarity-determining regions, CDRs, and insights into the structural environment of the residues described below was obtained. The high sequence identity of more than 60% to a relatively large number of template structures ensured that the overall accuracy of the model was good. The most uncertain regions are those modeled as LOOP regions, e.g. either not structurally conserved within the family of template structures or not highly homologous to them. However, for these LOOP regions such templates, which fitted well to the structurally conserved regions, were found among other immunoglobulin structures. Of the residues investigated only Tyr-67 in the light chain and Val-113 in the heavy chain were situated in the LOOP regions. Therefore, the model most likely correctly predicts whether the residues studied were exposed or buried and whether a certain residue is needed to support the CDR loop structure. Based on the finding that VL replacement in 5T4Fab efficiently increased the production level but affected the binding properties, the molecule was modified to identify residues that hampered high level production. Hydrophobic residues, suggested to be on the Fab surface by computer modeling (Fig. 2), were replaced by serine residues. Selected residues differing from the equivalents in more readily produced Fab fragments such as C215 were exchanged for the latter (Fig. 1). To minimize putative effects in affinity and specificity, residues in the CDRs were not altered. The CH1 and CL regions were identical in all antibodies studied. The chosen substitutions were Phe-10 → Ser, Thr-45 → Lys, Ile-63 → Ser, Tyr-67 → Ser, Phe-73 → Leu, Thr-77 → Ser, Leu-78 → Val, and Leu-83 → Ala in the light chain. In addition, to identify heavy chain residues that could affect the yield or cell lysis as suggested by the hybrid studies, the substitutions His-41 → Pro, Ser-44 → Gly, Ile-69 → Thr, and Val-113 → Gly were investigated. The positions of these residues and a sequence alignment between the Fv regions of 5T4 and C215 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the model, Phe-10, Thr-45, Ile-63, and Thr-77 in the light chain are exposed side-chain residues. Consequently, the replacements Phe-10 → Ser, Ile-63 → Ser, and to a lower degree Thr-77 → Ser should make the product less hydrophobic. The substitutions Phe-73 → Leu and Leu-78 → Val were made in the completely buried hydrophobic core of the light chain. The light chain residue Tyr-67 is in a loop close to the CDRs. Replacing this residue may therefore change the binding properties of the molecules. The heavy chain substitutions His-41 → Pro and Ser-44 → Gly involved exposed side chains positioned at the N and C terminus, respectively, of a sharp turn connecting two framework β strands. Both proline and glycine residues are important in"

Transport was dependent on galactose induction and was temperature-dependent and saturable with an apparentK m of 2.9 μm. Transport was inhibited by CMP, and upon vesicle disruption with Triton X-100 parameters were very similar to the previously described CMP-sialic acid transport characteristics observed with mammalian Golgi vesicles. CMP-sialic acid transport induction was specific as no transport of UDP-galactose was observed even though the latter putative transporter has a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the CMP-sialic acid transporter. Together, the above results demonstrate that the previously described cDNA encoding the putative CMP-sialic acid transporter encodes the transporter protein per se and suggests that this heterologous expression system may be used for further structural and functional studies of other Golgi membrane transporter proteins.

So far in every instance, a highly hydrophobic multitransmembrane spanning domain protein was found to correct the mutant phenotype, suggesting that the protein is the corresponding Golgi membrane nucleotide sugar transporter. In some studies, the protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus (3Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverly S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol.

Russell D.G. Beverly S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have expressed the murine Golgi apparatus membrane putative CMP-sialic acid transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the following reasons. (a) Because yeast cells do not synthesize sialoglycoconjugates and do not have such transporters, expression of transport activity would provide strong evidence that the putative CMP-sialic acid transporter is, indeed, the transporter protein per se and not a protein regulating the transporter in a mammalian cell. (b) Expression would allow a rapid and easy manner to obtain relatively large amounts of the transporter protein to be used for future structural as well as organellar targeting studies. The cDNA for the CMP-sialic acid transporter tagged in the C terminus with 33 nucleotides coding for the hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. epitope (1.1 kilobase pairs) was obtained by digesting pME8-HA (7Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with NcoI, filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase, and then digested withXbaI and isolated from agarose using Spin-X filters (Costar), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. pYES2 (Invitrogen, Inc.) was digested withSacI, filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase, and then digested with XbaI and ligated to the 1.1-kilobase pair fragment. Following transformation of DH5α Escherichia coli, plasmid DNA obtained from transformants was analyzed by restriction digestion. One of the plasmids, pPB11, was used for further studies. S. cerevisiae INVSc1 (MATα, his3-d1, Leu2, trp1–289, ura3–52) (Invitrogen, Inc.) cells were made competent for electroporation by extensive washing in ice-cold sterile water, resuspended in 10% glycerol, and electroporated with 1 μg of pYES2 or pPB11 using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (2.5 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 ohms). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in YPD medium before plating in SD agar plates containing 30 mg/literl-leucine, 2 mg/liter l-histidine, and 20 mg/liter l-tryptophan. Transformants grown at 30 °C for 2 days were isolated and grown in liquid selective medium (0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose, 2 mg/literl-histidine, 20 mg/liter l-tryptophan, 30 mg/liter l-leucine). For induction experiments, transformants were grown in liquid selective medium in which dextrose was replaced by 4% raffinose, until they reached anA 600 of 2.0. Samples were taken uninduced, and the remaining cells were spun at 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove the medium. Cells were then resuspended in the same volume of selective medium in which raffinose had been replaced by 2% galactose and allowed to grow at 30 °C for the times indicated in each case. To determine expression of the CMP-sialic acid transporter protein, samples of uninduced and induced cells were taken at different times (A 600 of 1.0 each), and total extracts were prepared as described previously (9Arnond C.E. Wittrup K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30412-30418PubMed Google Scholar). Total extracts were fractionated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and following blocking with 3% gelatin, 1% milk, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with monoclonal anti-HA (1:1,000; Babco, Inc.). Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse IgG (Promega) followed by chemiluminescence using Lumiglo (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Preparation of Golgi-enriched vesicles from induced and uninduced cells was as described previously, and transport assays were performed as described previously (10Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6935-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To express the mammalian putative CMP-sialic transporter inS. cerevisiae, a yeast expression vector with an inducible promoter was chosen, since this would allow the separation of the growth phase under uninduced conditions from the expression phase in the presence of the inducer. This approach may also circumvent the possibility that high levels of expressions of this heterologous protein may be toxic or growth inhibitory. For these reasons, pYES2, a 2-μm derived plasmid containing the strong galactose 1 promoter was chosen. The putative CMP-sialic acid transporter cDNA, tagged with an HA epitope to facilitate the detection of the expressed protein, was cloned into pYES2 giving rise to pPB11. S. cerevisiae INVSc1 was transformed with pYES2 (vector alone) and pPB11. Total cell extracts were prepared from the transformants grown under uninduced conditions (4% raffinose) and following different times of induction with 2% galactose. As shown in Fig. 1, cells transformed with pPB11 when induced by galactose expressed a protein of approximately 30 kDa that strongly reacted with anti-HA antibody. This protein was not detected in the same cells prior to galactose induction and in cells transformed with the vector alone regardless of the presence of galactose. The mobility of the above immunoreactive protein (∼30 kDa) is lower than that of the predicted molecular mass of the HA-tagged mammalian CMP-sialic acid transporter (39 kDa). A total extract of COS-1 cells transfected with pME8-HA and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in parallel with the yeast samples showed a strong immunoreactive protein of the same mobility as in yeast (∼30 kDa). The difference between predicted molecular mass and the apparent one, based on mobility, is thus also observed when the protein is expressed in mammalian cells. To determine whether the mammalian putative CMP-sialic acid transporter expressed in S. cerevisiae was functional, Golgi-enriched vesicles from uninduced and induced pPB11-transformed cells were prepared, and transport of CMP-[3H]sialic acid was measured into these vesicles. Table I shows that vesicles from induced cells transport CMP-sialic acid in a temperature-dependent manner with a 50-fold higher rate at 30 °C than at 0 °C; in contrast transport into vesicles derived from uninduced cells was not significantly different at both temperatures. Transport of CMP-sialic acid in the induced cells was dependent on vesicle integrity because Triton X-100 caused virtually complete absence. Transport of CMP-sialic acid was also inhibited by 5′-CMP as previously reported (12Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Table ITransport of CMP-sialic acid and UDP-galactose into S. cerevisiae vesicles from uninduced and galactose-induced cellsCellsSubstrateAdditionsTemperatureStSoSi[Si][Si]/[Sm]°Cpmol/mg proteinμmUninducedCMP-sialic acid00.40.5000UninducedCMP-sialic acid300.70.50.20.20.2UninducedUDP-galactose00.50.6000UninducedUDP-galactose300.60.6000InducedCMP-sialic acid00.60.50.10.10.1InducedCMP-sialic acid305.70.55.27.29.0InducedCMP-sialic acid0.05% Triton X-100300.70.50.20.30.4InducedCMP-sialic acid20 μm 5′ CMP301.90.51.42.02.5InducedCMP-sialic acid15 μmUDP-galactose307.10.66.59.011.2InducedUDP-galactose01.90.61.31.81.8InducedUDP-galactose302.30.61.72.32.3InducedUDP-galactose0.05% Triton X-100302.10.61.52.12.1A P3 vesicle fraction (1 mg of protein) was incubated for 3 min.

Open table in a new tab A P3 vesicle fraction (1 mg of protein) was incubated for 3 min.

The concentration of CMP-sialic acid in the incubation medium was 0.8 μm, and that of UDP-galactose was 1 μm. Results are the average of two independent determinations. To determine the specificity of the CMP-sialic acid transport measurements including the substrate specificity of the CMP-sialic acid transporter per se, transport of UDP-galactose into the same vesicles as described above was also measured. S. cerevisiaedo not have galactose in their mannan chains and do not transport UDP-galactose into the Golgi lumen. As shown in Table I, the putative UDP-galactose transport signal was not dependent on temperature or vesicle integrity, both very important controls for true transport into vesicles. In addition, transport of CMP-sialic acid wasnot affected by the presence of 15 μmUDP-galactose in the incubation medium (Table I) demonstrating that UDP-galactose was not competing with CMP-sialic acid for entering into the vesicles. Finally, it was important to determine whether transport of CMP-sialic acid into yeast vesicles was saturable, as previously found in mammalian Golgi vesicles. Fig. 2 shows that transport was saturable within an apparent K m of 2.9 μm. The following criteria provide strong evidence that we have expressed the murine Golgi membrane CMP-sialic acid transporter protein in S. cerevisiae. (a) A protein of apparent mobility of 30 kDa was expressed in S. cerevisiae only as a result of induction of the galactose 1 promoter. Induction of cells with plasmids without the cDNA did not result in expression of the above protein. The murine putative Golgi CMP-sialic acid transporter expressed in yeast cells has the same mobility as COS-1 cells that were transfected with pME8HA and expressed. (b) Upon isolation of a Golgi-enriched fraction from S. cerevisiae and measurements of CMP-sialic acid transport into these vesicles, the following characteristics of this transport activity were obtained. (i) Transport of CMP-sialic acid was temperature-dependent with the value at 30 °C being 50-fold that at 0 °C. (ii) Transport was dependent on time and protein concentration and was saturable with an apparent K m of 2.9 μm, a value very similar to that previously described for rat liver Golgi membrane CMP-sialic acid transport (1Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). (iii) Transport was inhibited by 20 μm of CMP in a manner analogous to the previously described transport of CMP-sialic acid into rat liver Golgi-derived vesicles (1Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar); (iv) transport was specific for CMP-sialic acid, andS. cerevisiae Golgi-enriched vesicles from induced and uninduced cultures were unable to transport UDP-galactose. (v) Treatment of vesicles with Triton X-100 abolished transport. (vi) Following transport of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi lumen, the concentration of solutes derived from this nucleotide sugar was concentrated 8–10-fold in relation to the concentration in the reaction medium. Together, these results provide strong evidence that the protein encoded by the plasmid pMEB-HA that corrected the phenotype of the Chinese hamster ovary Lec2 mutant of mammalian cells (7Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) does indeed encode the Golgi membrane CMP-sialic acid transporter protein. The likelihood of the protein being an activator of the Golgi membrane CMP-sialic acid transporter protein is remote. This heterologous expression also opens the possibility of expressing and purifying large amounts of the CMP-sialic acid transporter in other yeast and reconstituting this protein into proteoliposomes (12Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as we have also done previously with the transporters for UDP-galactose (13Milla M.E. Clairmont C.A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), UDP-glucuronic acid (13Milla M.E. Clairmont C.A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and adenosine 3′-phosphate,5′-phosphosulfate (12Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Mandon E.C. Milla M.E. Kempner E.S. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10707-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although reconstitution is a powerful direct proof that the protein is the transporter per se this approach has such problems that insertion of all the transporter protein molecules into liposomes may not be of the same topographical orientation as the protein in vivo; some molecules may be facing the liposomes “right-side-out” while others may be “inside-out,” as was found to occur with sialyltransferases (12Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Some transporter proteins may also be intercalated into the lipid bilayer without particular functionality. It is for these reasons that the in vivoinsertion of the CMP-sialic acid transporter protein into S. cerevisiae vesicles, a yeast which neither has the transporter nor transports CMP-sialic acid naturally, is of major importance in organellar targeting and structure-function studies. Subcellular fractions of galactose-induced cultures suggest that the majority of the CMP-sialic acid transporter protein is notin a Golgi vesicle fraction but in a fraction containing a mixture of vacuolar and endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles (not shown). This is not surprising in view of other studies in which mammalian Golgi proteins have been expressed in yeast and found to be functional even though the majority of the protein was not targeted to the predicted organelle (see below). We do not know whether the onlyfunctional expression of the CMP-sialic acid transporter occurred in the Golgi vesicles or also other organelles. Mammalian Golgi proteins have been expressed in an active form inS. cerevisiae; so far active expression and correct targeting has apparently required the construction of chimeras between amino-terminal regions of either the rat liver α-1,6-sialyltransferase attached to mature invertase (15Schwientek T. Lorenz C. Ernst J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5483-5489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or the amino-terminal region from the yeast α-1,2-mannosyltransferase attached to the luminal domain of the human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (16Schwientek T. Narimatsu H. Ernst J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3398-3405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In many instances, the transmembrane domain of mammalian and yeast Golgi glycosyltransferases appears to contain the necessary information for correct Golgi targeting of non-Golgi membrane proteins (17Graham T.R. Krasnov V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Chapman R.E. Munro S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4896-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are many exceptions to this in mammals and yeast (19Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Nothwehr S.F. Roberts C.J. Stevens T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When the intact full-length human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase or α-2,3-sialyltransferase were expressed in S. cerevisiae, the active enzymes appeared to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (21Krezdorn C.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3398-3405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggest that mammalian Golgi-targeting domains can be used in S. cerevisiae, the latter do not (21Krezdorn C.H.

The apparent concentration within the lumen of S. cerevisiaevesicles of CMP-sialic acid, relative to its concentration in the reaction medium, deserves some attention. Assuming this observation is correct, where does the energy for concentration within the lumen come from? In mammals, studies in vitro have strongly suggested that the CMP-sialic acid transporter is an antiporter with CMP, the reaction product following sialylation of proteins and lipids (1Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 12Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CMP-sialic acid is unique as a nucleotide sugar in that it does not need a nucleoside diphosphatase in the Golgi lumen to generate the nucleoside monophosphate as antiporter solute (1Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, where CMP-sialic acid is not a donor in sialylation, the mechanism for CMP-sialic acid concentration in the vesicle lumen remains to be determined. Is there an amino acid sequence motif for targeting these multitransmembrane proteins to the Golgi membrane in S. cerevisiae and mammals? To date, answers to this question are not available and the topography of such proteins is not known in the Golgi membrane. The expression system described here should be helpful in providing answers to these questions as well as determining the nucleotide sugar and nucleoside monophosphate binding sites in these proteins. We thank Dr. Claudia Abeijon for helpful discussions and Karen Welch for excellent secretarial assistance."

GSH is the most abundant cellular thiol and functions as the principal reducing reagent in all cell types (1Meister A. Greenberg D.M. Metabolism of Sulfur Compounds. 3rd Ed. VII.

GSH metabolism also provides a source of cysteine for cells (3McIntyre T.M. Curthoys N.P. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT; EC2.3.2.2) 1The abbreviations used are: γ-GT, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase; ENU, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). catalyzes the initial step in the degradation of GSH (4Curthoys N. Hughey R. Enzyme. 1979; 24: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). γ-GT is a key step in the γ-glutamyl cycle (5Meister A. Tate S.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 559-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), a series of degradative and synthetic reactions that mediate cellular GSH metabolism. Several reviews of γ-GT physiology and function have been published (4Curthoys N. Hughey R. Enzyme. 1979; 24: 383-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Meister A. Tate S.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 559-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 6Meister A. Larsson A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1461-1477Google Scholar), but despite intensive investigation, the exact role γ-GT plays in GSH metabolism or its putative contribution to renal amino acid transport have not been definitively determined. Bound to secretory endothelial cell membranes in several organs but predominantly in proximal renal tubule cells, γ-GT participates in the transmembrane transport of GSH and in interorgan GSH exchange (Fig. 1) (7Meister A. Fed. Proc. 1984; 53: 3031-3042Google Scholar). Meister (8Meister A. Science. 1973; 180: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) proposed that γ-GT also contributes to amino acid transport in the proximal renal tubule through transpeptidation of GSH and subsequent tubule cell uptake of γ-glutamyl amino acids. In vivomodel systems that have lost γ-GT activity are an exquisitely powerful tool for the study of γ-GT function and its relationship to GSH metabolism. Administration of chemical inhibitors of γ-GT to animals results in both glutathionuria and glutathionemia (9Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but chemically treated animal models are limited by several drawbacks including the temporary nature of inhibition and the difficulty of long-term continuous inhibitor administration. Also, the degree and specificity of enzyme inhibition in various tissues (particularly the brain) of these chemically treated animals is unknown. Genetic γ-GT deficiency has been described in only five humans (6Meister A. Larsson A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. I. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1461-1477Google Scholar), and the effects of various different disease states or environmental influences upon γ-GT deficient individuals cannot be adequately evaluated given the rarity of the disorder. A genetic animal model of total γ-GT deficiency overcomes the limitations of previously existing experimental systems and provides a useful tool for the study of γ-GT function and GSH physiology. N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is the most potent point mutagen known (10Russell W.L. Kelly E.M. Hunsicker P.R. Bangham J.W. Maddux S.C. Phipps E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5818-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), yielding mutation rates up to 300 × 10−5 in mice, depending upon the specific locus tested. ENU mutagenesis has been used by several laboratories to generate mutant mouse strains that model specific human genetic diseases (11Harding C.O. McDonald J.D. Wolff J.A. Monastersky G.M. Robl J.M. Strategies in Transgenic Animal Science. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 245-270Google Scholar). Since the report of phenylketonuria secondary to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in ENU-generated mouse mutants (12Shedlovsky A. McDonald J.D. Symula D. Dove W.F. Genetics. 1993; 134: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our laboratory has focused upon developing mouse models of other human inborn errors of metabolism. To this end, we screen the progeny of ENU-treated mice for metabolic abnormalities using a variety of urine biochemical analyses. Using this protocol, we have previously isolated a mouse strain with recessively inherited sarcosine dehydrogenase deficiency (13Harding C.O. Williams P. Pflanzer D.M. Colwell R.E. Lyne P.W. Wolff J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a genetic mouse model of autosomal recessively inherited γ-GT deficiency developed by random mutagenesis using ENU. These mice exhibit glutathionuria/emia, severe growth failure, shortened life spans, and inability to reproduce. This strain, designated GGT enu1, provides a useful experimental system for the study of γ-GT physiology and GSH metabolism. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Male C57Bl/6J mice were treated with 50 mg/kg body weight ENU weekly for a total of three doses according to the method of King et al. (14King T.R. Dove W.F. Herrmann B. Moser A.R. Shedlovsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Breeding and metabolic screening of potentially mutant progeny was carried out as described previously (13Harding C.O. Williams P. Pflanzer D.M. Colwell R.E. Lyne P.W. Wolff J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Urine samples were collected on filter paper from all G3 progeny after weaning (21–28 days of age) following an overnight fast. Each urine sample was evaluated using a battery of qualitative chemical analyses including sodium cyanide-sodium nitroprusside reagent for the detection of disulfides and free sulfhydryls (15Shih V.E. Mandell R. Sheinhait I. Hommes F. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 49-68Google Scholar). Urine amino acids were examined with one-dimensional paper chromatography using butanol:acetic acid:water (12:3:5) solvent and detection with ninhydrin according to the method of Smith (16Smith I. Chromatographic and Electrophoretic Techniques. Interscience, New York1960: 82-142Google Scholar). Quantitative urine and plasma amino acid analysis and quantitative urinary organic acid analysis were performed in any mouse that had an abnormal result by amino acid paper chromatography. Quantitative urine and plasma amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman System 6300 automatic amino acid analyzer according to the methods of Slocum and Cummings (17Slocum R.H. Cummings J.G. Hommes F.A. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 87-126Google Scholar). Quantitative urine organic acids were measured by trimethylsilyl derivatization followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry according to the method of Hoffmannet al. (18Hoffmann G. Aramaki S. Blum-Hoffmann E. Nyhan W.L. Sweetman L. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Duplicate one-dimensional paper chromatograms were examined specifically for the presence of sulfur-containing amino acids using platinic iodide reagent (15Shih V.E. Mandell R. Sheinhait I. Hommes F. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 49-68Google Scholar) in any mouse that had an abnormal cyanide-nitroprusside screening test. Urine from the mouse mutant described in this report and the identity of the sulfur-containing compounds therein were further examined by two-dimensional high voltage thin layer chromatography with ninhydrin detection (15Shih V.E. Mandell R. Sheinhait I. Hommes F. Techniques in Diagnostic Human Biochemical Genetics. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 49-68Google Scholar) in the laboratory of Dr. Vivian Shih, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Total glutathione concentration in urine, plasma, and tissues of control and glutathionuric (GGT enu1) mice was determined enzymatically using the method of Tietze (19Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). GSH reacts with the sulfhydryl reagent 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB or Ellman's reagent) to produce 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and its glutathionyl adduct. Yeast glutathione reductase added to the reaction mixture reduces GSSG in the presence of NADPH to form GSH which is then free to react with DTNB. The rate of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid production is measured by monitoring absorbance at 412 nm and is proportional to the total GSH concentration in the solution. For the assay, all reagents are prepared in 125 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 6.3 mm sodium EDTA buffer. 700 μl of 0.3 mm NADPH, 100 μl of 6 mm DTNB, and 200 μl of sample are combined in a 1-ml cuvette and allowed to equilibrate at 30 °C in a water bath for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 50 unit/ml yeast glutathione reductase, and the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was recorded for 6 min at 30 °C. Total glutathione concentration in unknowns was calculated from a standard curve of known GSSG concentrations varying from 0 to 0.02 mm but are reported as millimoles/liter GSH. The absorbance at 412 nm does not appreciably change over 6 min without the addition of glutathione reductase. Urine samples for total glutathione measurement were collected from urine- soaked filter paper by NH4OH elution. Urine glutathione concentration was measured without further sample modification and was corrected for urine creatinine concentration. Blood was obtained by direct cardiac puncture and anticoagulated with 25 μl of 0.1 m EDTA. Plasma, collected by centrifugation, was deproteinized with 0.1 volume 35% w/v sulfosalicylic acid. Following centrifugation, total glutathione concentration was measured in the supernatant. Solid tissue samples were weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid with five up and down strokes of a Pro2000 tissue homogenizer (Pro Scientific, Inc.). Following centrifugation at 3000 × g, total glutathione concentration was measured in the supernatant and corrected for wet weight of the tissue sample. γ-GT activities in whole kidney homogenates of control (C57Bl/6J) and GGT enu1 mice were determined by the method of Orlowski and Meister (20Orlowski M. Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10% w/v kidney homogenates were prepared in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, with five strokes of a Pro2000 electric homogenizer while the samples remained on ice. The samples were kept on ice or stored at −20 °C until γ-GT activity was measured. In this assay, the γ-glutamyl moiety of the artificial substrate, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, is transferred to glycylglycine by γ-GT and the optically active product, p-nitroaniline, is generated. 1.8 ml of 11.11 mm glycine-glycine + 2.78 mm γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, is added to 10–500 μg of sample protein in a 200-μl volume. The reaction is incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped with the addition of 50 μl of 50% w/v trichloroacetic acid followed by 2 ml of 2 m acetic acid. The absorbance of the sample at 410 nm is measured versus a duplicate reaction to which trichloroacetic acid and acetic acid had been added immediately to stop the reaction at time 0. The amount ofp-nitroaniline produced in the reaction was calculated using the molar absorptivity of p-nitroaniline at 410 nm (ε = 8.8 mm−1 cm−1) and γ-GT activity was expressed in terms of nanomoles ofp-nitroaniline produced/min/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of a bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18712) Google Scholar). γ-GT was partially purified from wild type Harlan Sprague Dawley rat, wild type C57Bl/6J mouse, andGGT enu1 mouse kidney homogenates according to the method of Hughey and Curthoys (22Hughey R.P. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, kidney microsomal fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.0, 1% Triton X-100. Alkaline phosphatase (Sigma diagnostic kit) and γ-GT activities were measured on the microsomal fractions from each animal. Protein electrophoresis was performed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred by electrophoretic elution (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). γ-GT protein was identified using polyclonal rabbit antisera (courtesy of Dr. Henry Pitot) raised against purified rat γ-GT. As a control, an integral renal tubule membrane protein, the β1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase, was detected on a duplicate immunoblot using polyclonal rabbit sera raised against amino acids 152–340 of the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit as deduced from the cDNA sequence (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). On both blots, the primary antibodies were localized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma), and alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/bromochloroindolyl phosphate substrate (Pierce). Male C57Bl/6J inbred mice were treated weekly with ENU by intraperitoneal injection for a total of three doses as described previously (14King T.R. Dove W.F. Herrmann B. Moser A.R. Shedlovsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After the mice had regained fertility, each was bred to C57Bl/6J females to generate five to ten G1 males. G1 (n = 31) males were bred with females to generate G2 offspring and then each of the G1 males were back-crossed with two or three of their G2 daughters to generate a total of 553 potentially homozygous mutant G3 mice. Urine samples from two male mice in a single sibship gave a positive test result with sodium cyanide-sodium nitroprusside reagent, indicating the presence of a disulfide or free sulfhydryl-containing compound in the urine. Qualitative urine amino acid analysis by one-dimensional paper chromatography and ninhydrin detection demonstrated a large red-purple spot with R F 0.13 and a smaller pink spot withR F 0.31 which are not present on the amino acid chromatograms of control mouse urine. The larger spot reacted with both the cyanide-nitroprusside and iodoplatinate reagents indicating the presence of sulfur in the compound. This large spot had the sameR F and color on ninhydrin-staining as GSSG purchased from Sigma. The smaller pink spot corresponded to GSH, which was present at much lower concentrations than GSSG in the mutant mouse urine. Oxidized and reduced glutathione were also identified by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis of mutant mouse urine by Drs. Kimiyo Mogami and Vivian Shih, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Quantitative urine amino acid analysis using the Beckman amino acid analyzer (high pressure liquid chromatography) showed three abnormal peaks on the chromatogram (Fig. 2). A single, sharp peak with a retention time of 12.0 min co-chromatographed with both GSH and γ-glutamylcysteine. A broad peak at 18–27 min corresponded to GSSG. The third peak at 37 min was broad and smaller than the first two peaks and has been tentatively identified as bis-γ-glutamylcystine (γ-glutamylcysteine disulfide), a substance which has also been detected in the urine of humans with γ-GT deficiency (25Griffith O.W. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The method of urine collection used in our screening protocol likely promoted oxidation of GSH to GSSG (and of γ-glutamylcysteine to bis-γ-glutamylcystine), yielding the large amount of GSSG compared with GSH in most urine samples from the affected mice. Pretreatment of mutant mouse urine with dithiothreitol resulted in complete disappearance of the broad peaks associated with GSSG and bis-γ-glutamylcystine and accentuation of the peak corresponding to GSH and γ-glutamylcysteine (data not shown). At birth, glutathionuric mice were indistinguishable from their unaffected litter mates. The total number of offspring in litters which contained glutathionuric pups was not significantly different from the size of control C57Bl/6J litters (5–12 pups/litter) in our colony. By approximately 14 days of age, glutathionuric pups appeared smaller than their litter mates, and at weaning (3–4 weeks of age), the body weight of affected mice was significantly lower (Fig. 3). Other than their size, the mice at weaning appeared physically healthy and morphologically normal (Fig. 4).Figure 4Physical phenotype of GGT mice. A male glutathionuric GGT enu1 mouse (left) and a phenotypically normal male sibling (right) at 5 weeks of age.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Severe growth failure persisted after weaning (Fig. 3). As the glutathionuric mice aged, their fur became rough and dull, but there was no change in coat color. The mice became less active, but were easily agitated. Many of the glutathionuric mice developed a severe thoracolumbar kyphosis. One severely kyphotic mouse developed paralysis of the hindlimbs, and two males suffered maceration of the penis due to priapism. Approximately 10% of the mice exhibit unilateral cataracts which are physically apparent by 2–3 months of age. A single mouse had bilateral cataracts. Unfortunately, neither male nor female glutathionuric mice have produced offspring. The line of glutathionuric mice has been maintained with considerable difficulty only by breeding unaffected siblings of glutathionuric mice which potentially are heterozygous for the glutathionuric trait. Gross anatomic examination of several mice revealed no abnormalities except for small size of all organs in proportion to the small body size overall. In one mouse sacrificed at age 14 months, a large cystic mass completely replaced the right kidney. The right ureter, urinary bladder, and the left kidney and ureter appeared grossly normal. In another mouse sacrificed at age 15 months, a solitary solid tumor was found in the liver. Aortic perfusion with formalin-saline was performed on two male glutathionuric mice. Microscopic examination of most internal organs with hematoxylin-eosin staining was completely normal except for oligospermia apparent in the testes. Nissl staining of coronal sections from the lens of a single mouse confirmed the subcapsular location of a clinically apparent unilateral cataract. Histology of the contralateral lens in that mouse was normal. The brain and spinal cord of two mice were sectioned and examined with hematoxylin-eosin or Nissl staining. No anatomic abnormalities of the nervous system were detected. The hematocrit of four different glutathionuric mice was similar to that of control mice, ranging from 50–55%. The microscopic appearance of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears from glutathionuric mice was normal compared with blood smears from control C57Bl/6J mice. Neither male nor female glutathionuric mice have successfully produced offspring. The mean age of glutathionuric mice (n = 60) at death was 242 ± 15 days (±S.E.) with a range of 70–512 days, while the phenotypically normal siblings of glutathionuric mice (n = 88) lived an average of 339 ± 22 days (p < 0.001) with a range of 74–929 days. In addition to the large amount of glutathione detected, quantitative urine amino acid analysis revealed slight elevations of many amino acids including threonine, glycine, cystine, isoleucine, leucine, ornithine, and lysine compared with control mouse urine samples (Table I). This may indicate a mild generalized defect of amino acid reabsorption in the renal tubules of glutathionuric mice. Additionally, taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid that is usually the most abundant amino acid in control mouse urine, was consistently low in urine from glutathionuric mice. Plasma cystathionine levels were slightly lower in mutant mice (3.1 ± 3.8 μmol/liter) than in controls (8.5 ± 1.8 μmol/liter), but no other significant differences in plasma amino acid concentrations were detected. Specifically, the plasma levels of other sulfur-containing amino acids including methionine and non-protein-bound cystine were normal in glutathionuric mice. Quantitative amino acid analysis was performed on trichloroacetic acid extracts of liver, kidney, and brain of glutathionuric and control mice. No significant differences in any amino acids including free cystine were detected (data not shown).Table IQuantitative urine amino acid analysisAmino acidGGT enu1 (n = 5)1-aKey: *p < 0.05; **p< 0.01; xxxp < 0.001 by Student's ttest.Wild type (n = 12)aKey: *p < 0.05; **p< 0.01; xxxp < 0.001 by Student's ttest.mmol/g creatinineTaurine3.41 ± 1.99*7.16 ± 2.79Threonine0.464 ± 0.194xxx0.169 ± 0.0616Glycine1.97 ± 1.08**0.886 ± 0.344Cystine0.488 ± 0.385**0.172 ± 0.0439Methionine0.127 ± 0.1180.153 ± 0.0612Cystathionine0.161 ± 0.1480.0969 ± 0.0709Isoleucine0.752 ± 0.181xxx0.151 ± 0.121Leucine0.383 ± 0.173*0.217 ± 0.117Ethanolamine0.330 ± 0.120**1.44 ± 0.725Ornithine1.51 ± 1.30*0.565 ± 0.317Lysine0.253 ± 0.131xxx0.0896 ± 0.0424Amino acid concentrations in urine of glutathionuric (GGT enu1) and wild type (C57B1/6J) mice corrected for urine creatinine concentration.

Using the method of Tietze (19Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar), glutathione concentration was measured in urine and plasma, and trichloroacetic acid extracts of liver, kidney, and brain from glutathionuric and control mice (Table II). As expected, urine glutathione excretion was very elevated in the mutant mice. Plasma glutathione concentration was also elevated in the mutant mice. Total glutathione was also elevated in trichloroacetic acid extracts of kidney and brain from glutathionuric mice. However, total glutathione in liver extract from glutathionuric mice was significantly decreased compared with control mice.Table IITissue total glutathione concentrationsTissueTotal glutathioneaData expressed as mean concentration ± 1 S.D. **p < 0.01; xxxp < 0.001 by Student's t test.GGTenu1ControlUrine (μmol GSH/mg creatinine)68.8 ± 32.3xxx0.116 ± 0.157(4 mice, 10 samples)(8 mice, 8 samples)Plasma (μmol GSH/liter)213 ± 125xxx42.5 ± 18.0(5 mice, 13 samples)(4 mice, 5 samples)Kidney (μmol GSH/g tissue wet weight)3.27 ± 1.98xxx1.21 ± 1.38(5 mice, 17 samples)(9 mice, 26 samples)Liver (μmol GSH/g tissue wet weight)3.07 ± 1.73xxx8.93 ± 3.30(5 mice, 14 samples)(11 mice, 37 samples)Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) concentrations in tissues from glutathionuric (GGT enu1) and control (C57B1/6J) mice.a Data expressed as mean concentration ± 1 S.D. **p < 0.01; xxxp < 0.001 by Student's t test.

Kidney γ-GT activity of glutathionuric mice was nearly 100-fold lower than γ-GT activity measured in control C57Bl/6J mice. Under reaction conditions similar to those used to measure γ-GT activity in kidney extracts from control mice (25–50 μg of protein added to the reaction and 10 min of incubation), γ-GT activity was frequently undetectable in kidney extracts from glutathionuric mice. Increasing the amount of glutathionuric mouse kidney extract in the reaction to 500 μg of protein allowed the measurement of a slight amount of γ-GT activity. Incubation of the reaction with glutathionuric mouse kidney extract at 37 °C for up to 4 h did not result in appreciably higherp-nitroaniline production (data not shown). A 1:1 mixture of kidney extracts from a glutathionuric mouse and from a control mouse had measured γ-GT activity equaling 50% of specific γ-GT activity measured in control extracts alone, indicating that kidney extract from glutathionuric mice did not inhibit the γ-GT reaction when active enzyme was added. Kidney γ-GT activity was also measured in four mice that had produced glutathionuric offspring and were therefore carriers of the glutathionuric trait. Mean kidney γ-GT activity in the carriers was 72% of that in control mice.Table IIIKidney γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activityGGT enu1GGT enu1/+Controlnmol p-nitroaniline produced/mg protein/min10.2 ± 19.8*aData expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. *p < 0.001, **p < 0.02 by Student'st test.573 ± 239**789 ± 327(n = 14, 4 mice)(n = 14, 4 mice)(n = 43, 12 mice)γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase activity in kidney extracts from glutathionuric (GGT enu1), heterozygous (GGT enu1/+) and control (C57B1/6J) mice.a Data expressed as mean ± 1 S.D. *p < 0.001, **p < 0.02 by Student'st test.

Kidney microsomal fractions from the Harlan Sprague Dawley rat, C57Bl/6J mouse, and GGT enu1mouse were analyzed for the presence of γ-GT protein by Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit sera raised against purified rat γ-GT protein. The specific activity of γ-GT in each kidney microsomal fraction was 557 ± 10.1 nmol/min/mg of protein in wild type C57Bl/6J mouse, 64.6 ± 5.9 nmol/min/mg inGGT enu1 mouse, and 2070 ± 365 nmol/min/mg in the Harlan Sprague Dawley rat. The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase, another renal tubule membrane-associated enzyme, in these microsomal fractions was 788 ± 39.1 nmol/min/mg of protein in the wild type C57Bl/6J mouse (ratio of γ-GT to alkaline phosphatase activity = 0.71), 839 ± 35.2 nmol/min/mg in theGGT enu1 mouse (ratio = 0.071), and 703 ± 16.6 nmol/min/mg in the Harlan Sprague Dawley rat (ratio = 2.9). Aliquots containing approximately 10 μg of total protein from each microsomal fraction were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting revealed two densely stained bands with apparent molecular masses of approximately 55 and 35 kDa in the rat kidney microsomal fraction (Fig. 5). This result agrees with the immunoblot of purified rat γ-GT obtained by Coloma and Pitot (26Coloma J. Pitot H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two additional less intensely stained bands with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 25 kDa were also detected in the rat.

Chem. 263, 9965–9972). This enzyme has now been sequenced, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The enzyme contains 230 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 24.7 kDa. It has a high helical content in its predicated secondary structure, which is also indicated in its CD spectrum. The cloned LysoPLA I was purified to homogeneity from the transformed E. coli cells by a gel filtration column and an ion exchange column. The specific activity of the purified protein is 1.47 μmol/min·mg toward 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine at pH 8.0 and 40 °C, corresponding to the reported value of 1.3–1.7 μmol/min·mg for the protein purified from the P388D1cells. In addition, the cloned protein cross-reacted with an antibody raised against LysoPLA I also purified from the P388D1cells. The deduced LysoPLA I sequence contains a well conserved GXSXG motif found in the active site of many serine enzymes, and the activity of the LysoPLA I was irreversibly inhibited by the classical serine protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to change Ser-119 in the GXSXG motif to an Ala. The resulting mutant protein lost all of its lysophospholipase activity, even though it had the same overall protein conformation as that of the wild-type LysoPLA I. Therefore, LysoPLA I has been demonstrated to be a serine enzyme with Ser-119 at the active site.

Lysophospholipases (LysoPLAs) 1The abbreviations used are: LysoPLA, lysophospholipase; PLA2, phospholipase A2; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. are widely distributed enzymes that hydrolyze lysophospholipids, the detergent-like intermediates in phospholipid metabolism. The in vivo levels of lysophospholipids are critical for cell survival and function, since the accumulation of lysophospholipids can perturb the activities of many membrane-bound signal-transducing enzymes (1Shier W.T.

Several enzymes are involved in regulating lysophospholipid levels. However, LysoPLAs are considered to be the major route by which lysophospholipids are removed because of their relatively high activities (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Research on LysoPLA is further complicated by the fact that more than one isoform of LysoPLA can exist in a single cell and that the high molecular mass enzymes (>50 kDa) generally have other enzymatic activities as well as lysophospholipase activity (12Duan R.D. Borgström B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Holtsberg F.W. Ozgur L.E. Garsetti D.E. Myers J. Egan R.W. Clark M.A. Biochem.

Among the small mammalian LysoPLAs, only two have been sequenced and cloned, namely, a human Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (16.5 kDa) and a rat liver (24.7 kDa) protein (15Ackerman S.J. Corrette S.E. Rosenberg H.F. Bennett J.C. Mastrianni D.M. Nicholson-Weller A. Weller P.F. Chin D.T. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 456-468PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sugimoto H. Hayashi H.

These two LysoPLAs seem to be very different from one another in terms of their primary sequence and enzymatic properties. Despite its importance, the catalytic mechanism of LysoPLA action and the relative roles these enzymes play in regulating lysophospholipid levels in cells are largely unknown. As part of our continuing effort to study phospholipid metabolism and its regulation in the mouse macrophage-like P388D1 cells (31Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we previously reported the purification and kinetic characterization of two small lysophospholipases, LysoPLA I (27 kDa) and LysoPLA II (28 kDa) (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 20: 9965-9972Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Stafford R.E. Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The macrophage-like P388D1 cells express at least four enzymes that have lysophospholipase activity, providing a model system for studying the relative contribution of each enzyme to lysophospholipid metabolism in intact cells. The two large enzymes (the Group IV cytosolic PLA2 and the Group VI Ca2+-independent PLA2, both of 80–85 kDa) have PLA2 and transacylase activities as well as lysophospholipase activity (30Reynolds L.J.

Dennis, unpublished results. while the small LysoPLA I and LysoPLA II are specific LysoPLAs (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 20: 9965-9972Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present work, we report the sequencing, cloning, and expression of the LysoPLA I. We have also carried out inhibition and mutation studies to determine the catalytic requirements of the enzyme. Mouse macrophage-like P388D1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/ml). The cell cultures were started with 105 cells/ml in 150-cm2 culture flasks. After 2 days, the cultures were inoculated into 1-liter roller bottles containing 450 ml of culture medium and incubated at 0.3 rpm on a bottle roller at 37 °C without CO2. After growing for 5 days, all of the adherent cells were suspended into the medium by agitation and then harvested by centrifugation at 700 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. LysoPLA I was purified from the mouse macrophage-like P388D1 cells using the procedure of Zhanget al. (8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LysoPLA I activity was measured at 40 °C in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0), 125 μm1-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcoline (1.6 μCi/μmol) (obtained from Avanti and DuPont NEN) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The assay was initiated by adding an aliquot of enzyme solution to the substrate mixture and incubating for the desired time. The 14C-labeled palmitic acid formed was extracted by the Dole method and then quantified by scintillation counting (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 20: 9965-9972Google Scholar). Protein concentration was quantified by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. For inhibition studies, various amounts of DFP (CalBiochem) were included in the assay mixture, and the LysoPLA I activities in the presence and absence of inhibitor were measured. To examine whether the inhibition was reversible, LysoPLA I was preincubated in the presence or absence of 63.7 mm DFP for 10 min at 40 °C and then diluted 100-fold into the enzyme assay mixture equilibrated at 40 °C. At the indicated time intervals, aliquots of the reaction were removed and quenched, and the fatty acid released was measured as described above. LysoPLA I purified from the mouse macrophage-like P388D1 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then stained by Coomassie Blue. After destaining the gel, the LysoPLA I band at about 27 kDa was cut and digested by trypsin. The resulting peptide fragments were separated by HPLC (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Smart System), and selected peptide peaks were sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer Sequencer Precise model 492 at the Scripps' Sequencing Facility. For DNA sequencing, both strands were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Corp.) and/or the automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems 373 from Perkin-Elmer) at the University of California at San Diego Center for AIDS Research Molecular Biology Core. Total RNA from the mouse macrophage-like P388D1 cells was isolated using a guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform extraction method. Then, the mRNA was selected from the total RNA by oligo(dT) columns (Stratagene), and the eluted mRNA was ethanol-precipitated and washed. Finally, the mRNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water at about 1 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. For RT-PCR, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized at 37 °C for 1 h using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and random primers (Promega). Aliquots of the synthesized first-strand cDNA were used to amplify the LysoPLA I gene by PCR (Microcycler, Eppendorf) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The sequences of the primers used in the PCR cycles were: primer set A (internal primers), 5′-TTTGAAGGTTACATTGGCTGGATT-3′ and 5′-GCCTTGATAGATCAAGAAGTGAAG-3′; primer set B (external primers), 5′-CGCTGTCCGCCAGCCGGTGG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTACTCAAGGCCTCTTAGTGACA-3′; primer set C (cloning primers), 5′-GCGCGAATTCTCAATCAATTGGAGGTAGGAAGCTTAT-3′ and 5′-CCGGCATATGTGCGGCAACAACATGTC-3′. All of these primers were custom-synthesized by Life Technology, Inc., and their positions are indicated in Fig. 1. To clone the cDNA encoding the enzyme, the open reading frame of LysoPLA I was amplified by RT-PCR using primer set C (sequences shown above), which has the restriction sites (EcoRI and NdeI) near the 5′-ends. The amplified product was purified and then digested byEcoRI and NdeI restriction enzymes (Pharmacia). The digested insert was purified and ligated to the pLEX vector (pL expression system from Invitrogen) linearized by the same two restriction enzymes. The ligated products were transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli GI724 cells. To confirm the cloning procedures, plasmids were isolated and the insert was verified by both restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. To express the cloned enzyme, a glycerol stock of GI724 cells harboring pLEX/LysoPLA I vector was streaked on a RMG-Amp plate (Invitrogen) and grown overnight at 30 °C. Then, a liquid culture in RM medium (Invitrogen) was started from a single colony on the RMG-Amp plate, and it was grown overnight in a 30 °C shaker. The overnight liquid culture was diluted to A 550 nm of 0.1 with the induction medium, and incubated at 30 °C until theA 550 nm reached 0.5. A tryptophan stock solution (10 mg/ml, from Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the cells were put into a 37 °C shaker. After growing to the desired time intervals, the cell density was measured, and the cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until needed. A pair of mutagenic primers with the Ser to Ala mutation at position 119 in the protein sequence was synthesized (primer set D: 5′-ATTTTGGGAGGATTTGCTCAGGGAGGCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGCCTCCCTGAGCAAATCCTCCCAAAAT-3′) and used to generate the mutated LysoPLA I (S119A) by PCR, according to the method of QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis from Stratagene. Here, the pLEX/LysoPLA I plasmid isolated from the GI724 cells was used as the template for the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). After PCR, the wild-type parent plasmids remaining in the PCR product were selectively digested by the DpnI restriction enzyme (Stratagene), and the resultant mixture was used to transform the chemically competent E. coli GI724 cells. The Ser to Ala mutation at position 119 was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and it was found to be the only change introduced in the S119A mutant when the entire coding region of the mutated cDNA was sequenced. After protein expression had been induced by tryptophan for about 4 h, the E. coli cells (about 500 ml) were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The collected cells were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). Lysozyme (10 mg/ml, Sigma) was then added to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, and the cells/lysozyme were incubated at 4 °C for about 2 h. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C) and discarded. To the cleared supernatant, 10% streptomycin sulfate (w/v, Sigma) was added dropwise to a final concentration of 1%. After stirring for 20 min at 0 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C), and the pellet was discarded. Ammonium sulfate (Fisher) was added slowly to the cleared supernatant to 70% saturation, and the mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min at 0 °C to precipitate proteins. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, resuspended in 20 ml of cold buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA), and applied to a Sephadex G-75 column (2.5 × 80 cm, Pharmacia) already equilibrated in buffer A at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted from the column with buffer A at a flow rate about 1.4 ml/min. The LysoPLA I fractions (as judged by SDS-PAGE and/or enzyme activity) were pooled and loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 34 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. After washing the column with more than 200 ml of buffer A, the proteins were eluted with a NaCl linear gradient (0–0.24m) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, and the LysoPLA I fractions were saved. CD spectra were measured using a Cary 61 spectropolarimeter that was modified by replacing the original Pockel cell with a 50-KHz photoelastic modulator (Hinds International FS-5/PEM-80), used in conjunction with a lock in amplifier (EG and G Princeton Applied Research No. 128) to detect and integrate the modulation. System automation, multiple scan signal averaging, and base-line subtraction were accomplished by a DEC 11/02 computer interfaced directly to both the Cary 61 and the amplifier. The system software and custom hardware interfaces were designed by Allen MicroComputer Services, Inc. CD spectra were collected at 7 °C using a cylindrical quartz cuvette with path length of 0.5 mm. The proteins used in CD measurements were purified from the DEAE columns (in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2m NaCl) and were concentrated to 0.26 and 0.34 mg/ml for the wild-type and S119A mutant, respectively. For each sample and blank solution, 10 separate spectra were collected and averaged. The final protein spectra were obtained by subtracting the blank spectra from the sample spectra and converting the difference to mean residue ellipticity. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE along with prestained protein molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) using the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, the proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking the nonspecific binding by 5% non-fat milk, the membrane was probed first with anti-mouse LysoPLA I antibody (8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and then with the horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A (Amersham). Finally, the protein bands were detected by the ECL system (Amersham). Since the N terminus of the LysoPLA I purified from mouse P388D1 cells was found to be blocked for direct sequencing, the protein was subjected to trypsin digestion, and the resulting peptide fragments were separated by HPLC and then sequenced. Three peptide sequences were obtained, as indicated in Fig. 1. These peptides showed very high homology to a recently sequenced rat liver lysophospholipase (20Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To obtain the sequence for the mouse LysoPLA I, mRNA from P388D1 cells was isolated, and PCR primers (shown as primer set A in Fig. 1) were designed according to the mouse peptide sequences and the codon usage of the rat lysophospholipase. RT-PCR using cDNA synthesized from the mouse mRNA gave a dominant product of about 310 base pairs, a size expected if the mouse and rat proteins have similar sequences. Furthermore, RT-PCR with primer set B, which was designed according to the sequences adjacent to the coding region of the rat protein (Fig. 1), resulted in a dominant DNA band of about 700 base pairs. For genes that are highly conserved among different species, the noncoding regions are often less conserved; however, it appears that in this case, the noncoding regions of the rat and mouse sequences are sufficiently conserved to allow primer set B to hybridize to the mouse cDNA under our RT-PCR conditions. The sequence of this 700-base pair DNA band is given in Fig. 1, along with the translated protein sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence contained all three peptide sequences that had been determined for the mouse LysoPLA I. The calculated molecular mass for the 230-residue mouse protein is 24.7 kDa, with an isoelectric point of 6.1. The mouse protein seems to have many secondary structural elements such as helix and sheet (Fig. 1), as predicted by the method of Rost (36Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse LysoPLA I and the rat lysophospholipase share 95.5% homology on the DNA level, and 96.5% on the protein level, indicating that these two proteins are of the same origin. In addition, several other proteins with less homology were identified using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) program (Fig. 2). This included a Pseudomonas fluorescens protein reported as carboxylesterase (37Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2839-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and two putative esterases obtained by chromosome sequencing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae andCaenorhabditis elegans. As shown in Fig. 2, all of these proteins share more than 30% homology to each other, with certain residues conserved in all five proteins. Interestingly, the most conserved regions include the GXSXG motif found in the active site of serine proteases, esterases, and lipases. To clone the cDNA encoding the mouse protein, the LysoPLA I coding region with restriction sites (EcoRI and NdeI) at the ends was amplified by RT-PCR using the mouse cDNA and primer set C. The amplified product was digested by the restriction enzymesEcoRI and NdeI and then ligated to the pLEX vector linearized by the same two restriction enzymes. The resultant pLEX/LysoPLA I was used to transform chemically competent E. coli cells. The LysoPLA I gene in the pLEX/LysoPLA I vector was confirmed by both restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. To verify that pLEX/LysoPLA I indeed encoded a lysophospholipase, the lysophospholipase activities in E. coli cells transformed either with pLEX/LysoPLA I vector, or with a control vector pLEX/LacZ (encoding β-galactosidase), were examined. This expression system allows the regulated expression of foreign proteins by a tryptophan induction mechanism and is under the strong PL promoter from bacteriophage λ. After protein expression was induced by tryptophan for different times, cells were harvested and then lysed with lysozyme. The resultant cell homogenate was subjected to both the lysophospholipase activity assay and Western blot analysis using the antibody raised against the LysoPLA I from the P388D1cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, no protein band was recognized by the LysoPLA I antibody at the beginning of tryptophan induction, indicating that E. coli itself does not have LysoPLA I. However, after 90 min of induction, a protein band at about 27 kDa was recognized by the LysoPLA I antibody, and this protein band became more intense as the induction time became longer. It should be noted that the apparent molecular mass of this induced protein band was the same as that of LysoPLA I purified from the mouse P388D1 cells (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, lysophospholipase activity in E. coli cells harboring the pLEX/LysoPLA I vector also became higher as induction time went longer. After about 4 h of induction, it reached over 20-fold higher activity than the control, demonstrating that the induced protein is an active lysophospholipase (Fig. 3 B). To purify the cloned LysoPLA I, E. coli cells with the pLEX/LysoPLA I vector were induced by tryptophan for 4 h and then harvested. After cell lysis by lysozyme, the homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected first to 1% streptomycin sulfate and then to 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The resultant pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column. The LysoPLA I-containing fractions, which were determined by both the activity assay and SDS-PAGE, were applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column. More than half of the active fractions from the DEAE column were essentially free of contamination and were used for CD measurements after being concentrated. The specific activity of the purified LysoPLA I was 1.47 μmol/min·mg, agreeing well with the reported value of 1.3–1.7 μmol/min·mg for LysoPLA I purified from mouse P388D1 cells (8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As the mouse LysoPLA I contains the conserved GXSXG motif (Fig. 2) characteristic of serine proteases, esterases, and lipases, we examined whether the classical serine protease inhibitor DFP would inhibit the LysoPLA I activity. It was found that DFP inhibited LysoPLA I activity with an IC50 of 5 mm under the experimental conditions employed (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the inhibition was found to be irreversible (Fig. 4 B). As DFP is known to inactivate serine proteins by covalent attachment to the serine residue in the active site, the irreversible inhibition of LysoPLA I by DFP suggested that LysoPLA I has an essential serine residue for its function. To identify the serine residue that is essential for LysoPLA I function, the Ser-119 residue in the conserved GXSXG motif was changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. E. coli cells transformed with the pLEX/S119A vector expressed the S119A mutant protein at about the same efficiency as that of the wild-type protein. However, the lysophospholipase activity in the E. coli homogenate expressing the mutant protein was more than 10-fold lower than that of the wild-type, just a little above the control level (Fig.3 B). When the S119A mutant protein was purified by the procedures developed for the wild-type protein (where the mutant protein fractions were followed by SDS-PAGE), it was found that the activity of the purified mutant was reduced to 0.5 nmol/min·mg, significantly less than the 1470 nmol/min·mg of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5). To examine whether the loss of the enzyme activity in the S119A mutant was due to a conformational change in the mutant, CD spectra were measured for both the purified wild-type protein and the S119A mutant. As shown in Fig. 6, the CD spectra of the two proteins were essentially identical, demonstrating that the significant loss of enzyme activity in the S119A mutant is not the result of misfolding or a conformational change of the S119A. In addition, the CD spectra indicate that LysoPLA I has a high helical content, agreeing well with its secondary structure predication (Fig. 1). Lysophospholipids are important components of cell membranes and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. To understand the roles of LysoPLAs in lysophospholipid metabolism and cell function, we have further characterized a mouse lysophospholipase previously reported as LysoPLA I (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 20: 9965-9972Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Stafford R.E. Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). By RT-PCR, we were able to clone the cDNA encoding an active mouse lysophospholipase, which is composed of 230 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 24.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.1. Because we used primers to the noncoding regions of the rat sequence that immediately proceed and follow the coding region, it is possible that the mouse cDNA contains an additional initiator codon further upstream that is not present in the rat sequence. If such a N-terminal extension does exist, it should not be very long as the recombinant enzyme appears to have the same molecular mass as that of the native enzyme purified from the P388D1 cells (Fig. 3), and it should have little significance, since the recombinant and the native enzymes have identical characteristics and specific activity. LysoPLA I appears to have a high helical content in its secondary structure, as indicated by both its CD spectrum and the theoretical structure predication of its primary sequence. The enzyme contains a conserved GXSXG motif characteristic of many serine enzymes, and the serine residue in the center of the motif has been implicated as being part of the active site of LysoPLA I by the following evidence: 1) mutation of the central serine residue in the motif abolished all of the lysophospholipase activity (Figs. 3 and 5); 2) the global conformation of the mutant was the same as that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 6). The identification of LysoPLA I as a serine enzyme was also supported by the inhibition studies with the classical serine esterase inhibitor DFP, which inactivates serine esterases by covalent attachment to the serine in the active site. It was found that DFP inhibited the LysoPLA I activity with IC50 at 5 mm. The inhibition was essentially irreversible, presumably due to covalent modification of LysoPLA I at the active site Ser119 (Fig. 4). Many LysoPLAs have been purified from a variety of mammalian cells. However, no systematic groupings have been made for these LysoPLAs, apparently due to the lack of sequence information as well as the different conditions used to characterize the enzymes. As the sequence of the mouse LysoPLA I is now known, we have compared it with the human eosinophil LysoPLA (Charcot-Leyden crystal protein, 16.5 kDa) (15Ackerman S.J. Corrette S.E. Rosenberg H.F.

Acharya K.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and concluded that the two enzymes should be grouped differently based on the following reasons: 1) no sequence homology was found between them; 2) the crystal structure of the eosinophil lysophospholipase shows that it is mainly composed of β sheets, whereas LysoPLA I seems to have a high helical content; 3) the specific activity of the eosinophil lysophospholipase is only 0.39 nmol/min·mg, significantly lower than that of LysoPLA I (1,300–1,700 nmol/min·mg); 4) a putative catalytic site composed of a water, a tyrosine, and a histidine has been identified in the crystal structure of the eosinophil lysophospholipase, whereas LysoPLA I has been demonstrated herein to be a serine enzyme. On the other hand, the mouse LysoPLA I should be grouped together with the rat lysophospholipase, since the two enzymes share very high sequence homology (96% match) as well as similar properties (7Zhang Y. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 20: 9965-9972Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,20Sugimoto H. Hayashi H.

Other LysoPLAs that may belong to this group include (i) the major 22-kDa LysoPLA from pig gastric mucosa (26Sunaga H. Sugimoto H. Nagamachi Y. Yamashita S. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); (ii) the 24-kDa LysoPLA from HL60 (18Garsetti D. Holtsberg F. Steiner M.R. Egan R.W. Clark M.A. Biochem.

Acta. 1992; 1165: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); (iv) the 23-kDa LysoPLA from rabbit heart (11Gross R.W. Sobel B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5221-5226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (v) the 25-kDa LysoPLA from beef liver (24DeJong J.G.N. van den Bosch H. Rijken D. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 369: 50-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25van den Bosch H. DeJong J.G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All of these LysoPLAs exist as monomers with molecular masses around 25 kDa and are most active around pH 8. Generally, these enzymes have broad substrate specificity toward lysophospholipids, but lack other activities such as phospholipase or carboxylesterase activity. Also, the activity of all these enzymes are not affected by Ca2+, Mg2+, or EDTA. In addition, the first two enzymes in the list cross-reacted with the antibody raised against the rat liver lysophospholipase (20Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several other enzymes that shared more than 30% homology to the mouse LysoPLA I were identified in the protein data base maintained at the National Institutes of Health, namely, a P. fluorescenscarboxylesterase (37Hong K.H. Jang W.H. Choi K.D. Yoo O.J. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2839-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and two putative enzymes from S. cerevisiae and C. elegans (Fig. 2). Since the sequences in the GXSXG motif region are well conserved in all these proteins, it is likely that they are serine hydrolases as well. Besides the GXSXG motif, several His and Asp residues were also conserved in these proteins, suggesting that they may form the catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp), the catalytic mechanism found in many hydrolytic enzymes. Currently, site-directed mutagenesis experiments on LysoPLA I are in progress to identify other residues that may contribute to the catalytic triad. It is interesting to note that LysoPLA I shared sequence homology to the esterases even though it has no esterase activity. In summary, we have sequenced, cloned, and expressed a mouse LysoPLA I, and the Ser119 in the GXSXG motif was identified to be part of the active site of the enzyme. It will be of interest to identify the other residues in the catalytic triad, but it appears that the LysoPLA is a new member of the serine enzyme superfamily.

Goodman at University of California at San Diego for use of his CD spectrometer."
https://openalex.org/W2030952706,"Previous studies have shown that normal human intestinal epithelial cells stimulate CD8+ suppressor T cell proliferation in an allogeneic mixed epithelial/T cell co-culture system, which is neither restricted by class I or class II major histocompatibility complex antigens nor by any soluble factors from epithelial cells. Two epithelial specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb), mAb B9 and mAb L12, are potent inhibitors of this mixed epithelial/T cell reaction but not of conventional mixed lymphocyte reactions. While phenotypically distinct by tissue staining, both mAbs recognize a 180-kDa epithelial membrane glycoprotein (gp180). Further characterization of gp180 revealed the following. 1) The protein migrated between 150 and 180 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and could be resolved by Western blot using mAb B9 or mAb L12. 2) The molecule has two forms, an apically sorted glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form and a basolateral transmembrane form. 3) gp180 is heavilyN-glycosylated, sinceN-glycanase treatment results in a >50% reduction in size. 4) Purified gp180 can bind to peripheral blood T cells and activate p56lck. 5) gp180 can activate p56lck in 3G8 (a murine T cell hybridoma transfected with human CD8α cDNA) but not in 3G4 (CD4 transfectant), suggesting that gp180 binds to CD8. Thus, gp180 appears to be a novel regulator of mucosal immune responses.

Thus, gp180 appears to be a novel regulator of mucosal immune responses. The mucosal immune system of the gastrointestinal tract is distinct from the systemic immune system by the general immunologically suppressed tone in the gut and the induction of specific immune unresponsiveness after antigen challenge, termed oral tolerance. It is believed that CD8+ suppressor T cells primed in the gut may play an important role in oral tolerance (1Ngan J. Kind L.S. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 861-865PubMed Google Scholar, 2Richman L.K.

However, the mechanism underlying the generation of the CD8+ suppressor T cells has not been completely delineated. Previous studies in our lab as well as others have shown that intestinal epithelial cells are able to process and present antigens to T cells (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunology. 1986; 58: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar). More interestingly, intestinal epithelial cells are able to selectively induce CD8+ suppressor T cell proliferation in an allogeneic mixed epithelial cell/T cell reaction (METR) 1The abbreviations used are: METR, mixed epithelial cell/T cell reaction; DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; IEC, intestinal epithelial cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MLR, mixed lymphocyte reaction; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBT, peripheral blood T cell; PIPLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; TcR, T cell receptor; PAS, protein A-Sepharose 4B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MHC, major histocompatibility complex. 1The abbreviations used are: METR, mixed epithelial cell/T cell reaction; DTBP, dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate; IEC, intestinal epithelial cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MLR, mixed lymphocyte reaction; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBT, peripheral blood T cell; PIPLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; TcR, T cell receptor; PAS, protein A-Sepharose 4B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; MHC, major histocompatibility complex.system (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and conventional restriction elements do not appear to be involved, since neither antibodies against class I nor class II MHC block proliferation (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proliferation is not driven by soluble factors from the epithelial cells (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). One molecule that appears to be clearly involved in this interaction is CD8, since there is activation of CD8-associated p56lck and antibody to CD8 blocks CD8+ suppressor T cell proliferation in this system (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).We have hypothesized that the generation of CD8+ suppressor T cells is attributed to the expression of a unique CD8 binding ligand on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, a series of epithelial cell-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated and screened for their ability to inhibit CD8+ T cell proliferation in our culture system. Two of these mAbs, L12 and B9, were found to be potent inhibitors of this mixed epithelial cell/T cell reaction system but did not inhibit conventional MLRs (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Mayer L. Siden E. Becker S. Eisenhardt D. MacDonald T.T. Challacombe S.J. Bland P.W. Stokes C.R. Heatley R.V. Mowat A.M. Advances in Mucosal Immunology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar). The epithelial cell surface molecules recognized by these two mAbs might therefore be candidates for the ligand regulating the METR. Previous studies have documented phenotypic and functional differences between the molecules recognized by mAb L12 and mAb B9. These two mAbs have a different tissue distribution determined by immunohistochemical staining. Both antibodies can stain intestinal epithelium, but L12 stains epithelial cells from the airway as well, and B9 stains thymic epithelium and the syncytiotrophoblast in the placenta (11Mayer L. Siden E. Becker S. Eisenhardt D. MacDonald T.T. Challacombe S.J. Bland P.W. Stokes C.R. Heatley R.V. Mowat A.M. Advances in Mucosal Immunology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar). As described here, a 180-kDa epithelial cell membrane glycoprotein (gp180) is recognized in Western blot by both mAb B9 and mAb L12, in either normal human colon epithelial cells or in a colon cancer cell line, T84. In this paper, we studied the biochemical and functional characteristics of gp180. Our data suggest that gp180 may be one of the epithelial cell membrane proteins mediating epithelial cell/T cell interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMonoclonal Antibodies and Conjugation of mAb to Sepharose 4B BeadsFreshly isolated human intestinal epithelial cells were used to immunize Balb/c mice on days 0 and 21. Splenocytes were harvested 3 days later and fused with the nonsecreting myeloma line SP2/0 as described previously (11Mayer L. Siden E. Becker S. Eisenhardt D. MacDonald T.T. Challacombe S.J. Bland P.W. Stokes C.R. Heatley R.V. Mowat A.M. Advances in Mucosal Immunology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1990: 23-28Crossref Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened by 1) specificity (by staining) for intestinal epithelial cells but not T cells, B cells, or monocytes; 2) the ability of mAbs to inhibit CD8+ T cell proliferation in METR but not conventional MLRs; and 3) the ability to inhibit the activation of CD8-associated p56lck in METR. Two mAbs were identified in this screening, B9 and L12 (both IgG1 isotype) (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Mayer L. Siden E.

OKT4, OKT8, and W6/32 are hybridomas obtained from the ATCC that are capable of producing monoclonal antibodies against human CD4, CD8, and class I MHC, respectively. 3G8 and 3G4 are murine T cell hybridoma transfectants that constitutively express human CD8α and CD4, respectively. Their functional properties have been described previously (14Ratnofsky S.E. Peterson A. Greenstein J.L. Burakoff S.J. J. Exp.

These two cell lines were kind gifts from Dr. Steven Burakoff (Dana-Farber, Boston, MA).Isolation of EnterocytesEnterocytes were isolated by a method described previously (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Surgical specimens were obtained from the operating room. The specimens were then washed extensively with PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% fungizone (Flow Laboratory, Inc., McLean, VA). The mucosa was stripped off from the submucosa, minced into small pieces, and placed in 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature to remove mucus. The pieces were washed in PBS and incubated in dispase (3 mg/ml in RPMI 1640, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany) for 30 min at 37 °C, vortexing every 5 min. The tissue pieces were removed, and the cell suspension was then collected and centrifuged on a Percoll density gradient. Enterocytes were located at the 0–30% layer interface. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended in culture medium (CM) (RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Preparations of purified enterocytes were >90% viable and free of macrophage and B cell contamination as determined by staining with anti-CD14 and anti-CD20 mAbs (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL) and were contaminated with between 2 and 4% intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD3+ cells).Isolation of T Cells and Non-T Cells from Peripheral BloodPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized venous blood collected from normal donors, as described previously (16Mayer L. Posnett D.N. Kunkel H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. T cells and non-T cells were isolated from PBMCs by a rosetting method using neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells (16Mayer L. Posnett D.N. Kunkel H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).T cells were also enriched by a nylon wool column (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). PBMCs were adjusted to 75 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, prewarmed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. 1.5 ml of the PBMC suspension was loaded onto each prewarmed nylon wool column (each column contained 0.6 g of nylon wool, balanced with RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, preincubated at 37 °C for 45 min in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator). The loaded column was then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in an upright position. T cells were eluted by 18 ml of 37 °C RPMI 1640, 5% FCS and collected.Cell Staining and Flow Cytometry1–2 × 105 isolated enterocytes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies on ice for 45 min. The cells were washed 3 times with PBS/BSA solution (1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3, in PBS), and then resuspended in 50 μl of 1:50 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab)′2 goat anti-mouse IgG (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and incubated on ice for another 45 min. The cells were washed again 3 times and finally resuspended in 400 μl of PBS for flow cytometric analysis. Controls included IgG1 anti-DNP mAb (negative control) and W6/32 (anti-class I MHC, positive control).PIPLC1 TreatmentTen to twenty million isolated enterocytes, T84 cells harvested by non-enzyme cell dissociation solution (Sigma), or T84 cells in monolayer cultures were washed 3 times with PBS and treated with PIPLC (Sigma) at concentrations of 0.3–1 unit/ml RPMI at 37 °C for 45 min. At the end of this incubation, the cell-free supernatant was collected for further studies. The treated cells were stained by various monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry, to confirm the removal of GPI-anchored molecules.Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Methionine/CysteineSubconfluent intestinal epithelial cell line cultures in T75 tissue culture flasks were washed with PBS 3 times and starved for 4 h in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% dialyzed FCS. The starved cells were cultured with trans-label [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) (1 mCi/20 million cells) in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640, 10% dialyzed FCS for 18 h. Cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and lysed for immunoprecipitation studies.Western BlotWestern blot analyses were performed as described previously (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 15 V overnight in transfer buffer (20% methanol, 150 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3). After transfer, the nitrocellulose sheet was blocked by 50 ml of 5% nonfat milk in PBS. The nitrocellulose sheet was washed once with PBS and incubated with primary antibody (2–10 μg/ml) in a 0.5% nonfat milk/PBS solution at 4 °C overnight. After washing 3–5 times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1–2 μg/ml) (Cappel-Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) was added. This incubation was continued at room temperature for 1–2 h. The sheet was then washed 3–5 times with washing buffer and incubated with 12 ml of chemiluminescence reagent (Du Pont NEN) at room temperature for 1 min. XAR-5 films were exposed and developed.Epithelial Cell Membrane IsolationCultured T84 cells were washed 3 times with PBS and harvested by non-enzyme cell dissociation solution (Sigma). The cells were resuspended in cell disruption buffer (1 mm PMSF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, in PBS, pH 7.4, all from Sigma) and sonicated to disrupt the cellular structure, followed by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. The pellet containing nuclei was discarded, and the supernatant was subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing cytosol, was removed, and the membrane pellet was collected.Immunoaffinity Purification of gp180The supernatant generated by PIPLC treatment of T84 epithelial cell monolayer was obtained as described above. The PIPLC-generated supernatant from 80 × 106[35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled T84 cells was passed through a preclearing column of Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The precleared supernatant was then subjected to mAb B9-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The column was washed 5 times and eluted with 0.1m glycine HCl buffer, pH 2.7. The eluate was neutralized immediately with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl solution, pH 9.6, dialyzed exhaustively against PBS and concentrated to 80 μl. Part of the purified gp180 was examined for purity by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and the rest was stored at −70 °C for further studies.ImmunoprecipitationThe T84 cell pellet or cell membrane pellet (2 × 106 cell equivalents) was lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mmiodoacetamide, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) for 2 h on ice, vortexing every 15 min. The lysate was precleared with 20 μl of Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was mixed with monoclonal antibody B9-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl) and incubated at 4 °C for 8 h or overnight. The suspension was then spun in a microcentrifuge, and the beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, in PBS, pH 7.4). After the final wash, sample buffer was added to the beads. The sample was heated at 100 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis.Carbohydrate Analysis of gp180 Purified by B9 AntibodyEighty million T84 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. gp180 was immunoprecipitated as described above and then eluted with elution buffer (50 mmdiethylamine, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 11.5, Sigma). The purified gp180 was dialyzed against PBS and concentrated to 150 μl.N-Glycanase Treatment5.4 μl of digestion buffer (0.2m Na2HPO4, 0.2 mNaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm PMSF, 1% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was added to 16 μl of purified gp180, mixed, and boiled for 5 min. 1.4 μl of 20% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μl (0.25 unit) ofN-glycanase (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA) were added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The control without enzyme was placed with all components and treated exactly the same except that the 1 μl ofN-glycanase was replaced with 1 μl of PBS. The treated materials were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blot (mAb B9 and/or L12).Neuraminidase Treatment1 μl (1 milliunit) of neuraminidase (Calbiochem), 5 μl of 0.5 mNa2HPO4, 5 μl of 0.5 mNaH2PO4 were added to 48 μl of purified gp180 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 19 μl was sampled for SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blot analysis. The rest was saved for further study.O-Glycanase Treatment1 μl (1 milliunit) (Genzyme Diagnostics) ofO-glycanase was added into 40 μl of neuraminidase-treated gp180. The enzyme treatment was performed at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the treatment, 20 μl of treated gp180 was used for analysis, and the rest was saved for further treatment.Binding-Cross-linking-Western BlotTen million T84 cells were treated with PIPLC as described above, and the supernatant was collected. The PIPLC-generated supernatant was concentrated by centricon (Amicon) to 0.5 ml. Forty million T cells or non-T cells were washed 3 times with RPMI, and the cell pellets were resuspended in the concentrated PIPLC-generated supernatant with addition of 0.1% BSA into the mixture. After 15 min incubation at room temperature, 7 μl of a 15 mg/ml DTBP (dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate, a bifunctional cross-linker; Pierce) solution was added into the mixture, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed 5 times with 1% BSA in PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of PBS, and 17 μl of 4x reducing sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min and spun for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and mAb B9 Western blot.Stimulation of T Cells2 × 106 T cells were stimulated with either OKT4 + affinity purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM, Cappel), OKT8 + RAM, 2 × 106 intestinal epithelial cells, or purified gp180, for 1–10 min at 37 °C. The stimulation was stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (100 μmNa2VO3 in PBS). The cells were centrifuged and the stop buffer removed. Two hundred μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm Na2VO3, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) was added into the cell pellet and kept on ice for 30 min, vortexing every 5–10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was removed, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube for further studies. For the assays using epithelial cell lines as stimuli, a hypotonic lysis buffer was used to ensure that >80% of T cells were lysed, whereas >85% of epithelial cells were intact. The hypotonic lysis buffer contains 20% PBS, 80% deionized water, 100 μm Na2VO3, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin.Detection of Tyrosine Kinase Activation in T CellsAn anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot was used to detect induced tyrosine kinase activity in T cells. Ten μl of 4x sample buffer was added to 30 μl of the T cell lysate (either stimulated or unstimulated). The lysate was boiled for 3 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot using mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), using a technique described previously (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).T cell lysate (either stimulated or unstimulated, 2 × 106/200 μl) was precleared with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose 4B (PAS) at 4 °C for 1 h. 5 μl of antibody against p56lck (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or p60fyn(Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 50 μl of 50% PAS were added into the precleared lysate. The incubation was carried out at 4 °C for 2 h. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The PAS pellet was washed 3 times with wash buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmNa2VO3, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6) and once with kinase buffer (10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The PAS pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) was added. The kinase reaction was performed at room temperature for 20 min and stopped by addition of 20 μl of 4x reducing sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. The reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.DISCUSSIONConsistent exposure to exogenous antigen has unique effects on an immune response. By definition then, mucosal immune responses should be distinct from those in antigen pristine environments, such as the systemic immune system. Recent studies from a number of laboratories support such a concept. Antigen administered orally most often results in the induction of systemic tolerance, and this phenomenon has been the basis for new therapeutic approaches in a number of autoimmune disorders (19Al-Sabbagh A. Miller A. Santos L.M. Weiner H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2104-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Whitacre C.C. Gienapp I.E. Orosz C.G. Bitar D.M. J.

Oral tolerance may be mediated by several mechanisms (e.g. induction of anergy, activation of suppressor T cells, secretion of suppressive cytokines), but early studies supported a role for CD8+ suppressor T cells (2Richman L.K. Chiller J.M. Brown W.R. Hanson D.G. Vaz N.M. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2429-2434PubMed Google Scholar, 3Miller S.D. Hanson D.G. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 2344-2350PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mowat A.M.

That is, the transfer of CD8+ splenic T cells from an orally tolerized animal to a naive one would transfer antigen-specific nonresponsiveness (2Richman L.K. Chiller J.M. Brown W.R. Hanson D.G. Vaz N.M. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2429-2434PubMed Google Scholar, 3Miller S.D. Hanson D.G. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 2344-2350PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mowat A.M. Immunology. 1985; 56: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby CD8+ T cells were activated in this model has not been clearly defined. Several laboratories have proposed a scenario where the manner by which antigen is handled in the intestine would dictate the type of immune response generated. Specifically, it has been suggested that the intestinal epithelial cell is a key regulator of mucosal immune responses, acting as an antigen-presenting cell (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunology. 1986; 58: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar,22Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunology. 1986; 58: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Normal intestinal epithelial cells constitutively express class II molecules (small intestine > large intestine) and are capable of processing and presenting exogenous antigens to primed T cells in mouse, rat, and man (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunology. 1986; 58: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hoyne G.F. Callow M.G. Kuo M.C.

Sci. 1992; 664: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to conventional antigen-presenting cells, intestinal epithelial cells appear to selectively activate CD8+ suppressor T cells (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar,9Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunology. 1986; 58: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hoyne G.F. Callow M.G. Kuo M.C. Thomas W.R.

Sci. 1992; 664: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Conventional restriction elements, class I and class II, do not appear to regulate this event as blocking mAbs to such molecules fail to inhibit proliferation of the CD8+ T cells (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CD8 itself, however, does appear to be involved since antibodies to this surface molecule inhibit IEC-induced T cell proliferation (8Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of CD8-associated p56lck is a necessary but not sufficient event required to generate this response (10Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings led to the suggestion that nonclassical class I molecules (class Ib), such as CD1d in man and TL in mouse, both expressed on intestinal epithelium, might regulate IEC-T cell interactions (25Blumberg R.S. Balk S.P. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 11: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Panja A. Blumberg R.S. Balk S.P. Mayer L. J. Exp.

Med. 1993; 178: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), they fail to inhibit the activation of p56lck (29Campbell N.A. Yio X.Y. Toy L. Blumberg R. Mayer L. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110 (abstr.): A876Google Scholar), and there are no data to support the ability of CD1d to associate with CD8 itself. 2C. Terhorst, personal communication. To define an"

During purification, a vanadate- and nitrate-sensitive ATPase activity, consisting of partially disassembled V-ATPase complexes, was resolved from the V-ATPase peak. ATPase and H+-transport activities of the purified, reconstituted V-ATPases of both fruit and epicotyl exhibited similar inhibitor profiles, except that the fruit V-ATPase retained partial vanadate sensitivity. Since the V-ATPase activity of native fruit tonoplast vesicles is insensitive to inhibitors (Müller, M. L., Irkens-Kiesecker, U., Rubinstein, B., and Taiz, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1916–1924), membrane lipids or other factors may protect the fruit V-ATPase from inactivation in vivo. A kinetic analysis of H+-pumping and H+-leakage indicated that the reconstituted epicotyl V-ATPase exhibited twice as much intrinsic uncoupling or slip as the reconstituted fruit V-ATPase. Comparison of their subunit compositions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the reconstituted fruit V-ATPase is enriched in two polypeptides of 33/34 and 16 kDa. Moreover, the stalks of negatively stained juice sac V-ATPases appeared thicker than those of epicotyl V-ATPases in electron micrographs.

The juice sacs of lemon fruits contain cells that can acidify their vacuoles to as low as pH 2.2 (1Sinclair W.B. The Biochemistry and Physiology of the Lemon and Other Citrus Fruits. University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Oakland, CA1984: 109-156Google Scholar). In contrast, the vacuoles of the surrounding fruit tissues as well as those of vegetative tissues are maintained in the typical vacuolar pH range, 5.0–6.0. The occurrence in lemon of two types of vacuoles with vastly different lumenal pH values provides a convenient experimental system to probe the mechanisms underlying the control of steady state vacuolar pH. One hypothesis to explain the extreme acidity of the juice sac vacuoles is that their H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy-acridine; BCA, bicinchoninic acid; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS; 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; n, H+/ATP stoichiometry; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; QB, Econo-Q running buffer; RB, resuspension buffer; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a functionally specialized isoform capable of generating a greater pH gradient than vegetative V-ATPases. In an earlier report (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we compared the ATP-driven H+-pumping activities of tonoplast-enriched membrane vesicles isolated from juice sacs and seedling epicotyls. In native vesicles, the juice sac V-ATPase generated a steeper proton gradient than the V-ATPase of epicotyls. However, since the epicotyl tonoplast was more permeable to protons than the juice sac tonoplast, the steeper ΔpH generated by the juice sac V-ATPase may have resulted from differences in membrane permeability rather than from intrinsic properties of the pumps. On the other hand, the two H+-pumping activities differed with respect to several kinetic parameters. The epicotyl activity showed a typical V-ATPase profile with respect to ions and inhibitors (i.e.stimulation by chloride, inhibition by nitrate, bafilomycin A1, and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and insensitivity to vanadate). In contrast, the proton pumping activity of juice sac tonoplasts was insensitive to nitrate, bafilomycin, and NEM, and was partially inhibited by vanadate. Sensitivity of the juice sac ATPase activity to nitrate and NEM increased following detergent treatment, consistent with the juice sac proton pump's identity as a V-ATPase. However, evidence for the possible existence of a second H+-ATPase on the juice sac tonoplast was also obtained. In nitrate-induced V1-dissociation experiments, the epicotyl vacuolar H+-pumping activity became inactivated with the release of the catalytic subunit from the membrane. Despite the loss of a major portion of the catalytic subunit, the juice sac membranes retained 100% of their H+-pumping activity following nitrate treatment, although vanadate sensitivity increased (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Solubilization of the fruit membranes withn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and centrifugation on a glycerol gradient resulted in the resolution of two peaks of ATPase activity. The denser of the two peaks was strongly inhibited by nitrate, partially inhibited by vanadate, and exhibited a typical V-ATPase subunit composition on SDS-PAGE gels. The second peak was a vanadate- and nitrate-sensitive ATPase of unknown identity (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It appears that the V-ATPases of lemon fruits and epicotyls may be strongly influenced by their native membranes. To compare the two proton pumps in the same membrane environment we have characterized the properties of purified and reconstituted V-ATPases from fruits and epicotyls. In addition, we have compared negatively stained juice sac and epicotyl tonoplast vesicles by electron microscopy. Our results suggest that native tonoplast lipids of the juice sacs play important roles not only in reducing proton permeability, but in protecting the V-ATPase from inactivation by inhibitors. However, the ability to generate a steeper pH gradient appears to be an intrinsic property of the juice sac V-ATPase. The nature of the vanadate-sensitive “second H+-ATPase” remains unresolved, but may represent partially disassembled V-ATPase complexes. Lemon seeds (Citrus limon L. var. Schaub Rough Lemon) were generously supplied by Willits & Newcomb, Inc., Arvin, CA. Lemon fruits (var. Eureka) were harvested from trees on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Bafilomycin A1 was from Sigma, BCA protein assay reagents were from Pierce, and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Calbiochem. Escherichia coli polar lipid extract was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids; the NanoOrangeTMprotein quantitation kit and 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy-acridine (ACMA) were from Molecular Probes. All bulk chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Fisher. Tonoplast-enriched membranes from lemon fruit juice sacs and epicotyls were prepared as described previously (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C, and the membranes were maintained on ice. Briefly, juice sacs of three lemons were released into 100 ml of cold fruit homogenization buffer (1.5 m MOPS-KOH, pH 8.5, 2.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 7.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmPMSF). They were ground using a mortar and pestle or, alternatively, homogenized with a Waring blender in a 250-ml flask filled to the top with juice sacs and homogenization buffer, and hermetically sealed to avoid oxidation. Epicotyls (40 g, fresh weight) were harvested with a razor blade and homogenized in 150 ml of cold epicotyl homogenization buffer (0.5 m MOPS-KOH, pH 8.5, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF) using a mortar and pestle. Homogenates were filtered through a 0.28-mm nylon mesh and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) to eliminate cellular debris, nuclei, and plastids. The supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 132,000 × g in a Beckman SW-28 rotor. The microsomal pellet obtained was resuspended in 15 ml of resuspension buffer (RB; 10 mm BTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF) and further purified on a 10%/35% sucrose step gradient made up in 10 mm BTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF. After 60 min of centrifugation at 132,000 × g in a Beckman SW-28.1 rotor, the 10%/35% interface containing tonoplast-enriched membranes was recovered, diluted with RB, and pelleted for 20 min at 174,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The tonoplast-enriched membranes were resuspended in RB at a final concentration of 10 μg of membrane protein/μl. In experiments involving inhibition by NEM, the membranes were resuspended in RB in the absence of DTT. Tonoplast-enriched membranes were made up to 6 mg of protein/ml with RB and solubilized as described previously (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with an equal volume of 4% (w/w)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside or 5% (w/w) octyl-β-glucoside in solubilization buffer (10 mmBTP-Mes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mmMgSO4, 50 mm DTT, 200 μg/mll-α-phosphatidylcholine liposomes, and 0.012% butylated hydroxytoluene). The solubilized membrane proteins were centrifuged for 15 min at 412,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor, and the supernatant was loaded on a 100 × 1-cm Sephacryl S-400 HR (Pharmacia) chromatography column equilibrated in running buffer (10 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.0, 0.3% (w/w) Triton X-100, 100 μg/mll-α-phosphatidylcholine, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 50 μm PMSF). The column was eluted at 4.5 ml/h with running buffer. 1.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for ATPase activity in the presence or absence of vanadate and nitrate. After Sephacryl S-400 HR chromatography, fractions making up the leading half of the V-ATPase activity peak were pooled and further purified by Econo-Q anion exchange (Bio-Rad). The proteins were loaded at 0.5 ml/min on a 5-ml column equilibrated with Q buffer (QB; 5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.0, 50 μg/ml [l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 50 μm PMSF) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m KCl. 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for ATPase activity in the presence or absence of vanadate and nitrate. Both the lemon fruit and epicotyl preparations showed an activity peak eluting at ∼0.1 m KCl. Additionally, the fruit preparation exhibited an equally nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive activity peak eluting at ∼0.065 m KCl. The fractions making up the peak eluting at 0.1 m KCl were diluted three times with QB, loaded again on an Econo-Q column, and subjected to a second gradient elution. For reconstitution experiments, ATPases bound to this second Econo-Q column were eluted with a 0.2m KCl step to concentrate the activity in one fraction. For chromatography elution buffers and ATPase assays, l-α-phosphatidylcholine type IV-S (Sigma) was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in a total volume of 10 ml of diethyl ether, evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, lyophilized, resuspended in 10 ml of water, and sonicated to clarity with a Braun-Sonic U probe sonicator. For reconstitution experiments, 5 ml of a 20 mg/ml E. coli polar lipid extract in chloroform (Avanti Polar Lipids) was evaporated to dryness, resuspended together with 17.6 mg of cholesterol in 2 ml of diethyl ether, evaporated to dryness again, lyophilized, resuspended in 2.35 ml of RB, and sonicated to clarity. The liposomes (final concentration, 50 mg/ml) were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C. Immediately before being used, the liposomes were thawed and sonicated to clarity again. The reconstitution procedure was based on the method of Ward and Sze (3Ward J.M. Sze H. Methods in Plant Cell Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 149-160Google Scholar). 200 μl of 50 mg/ml E. coli/cholesterol liposomes were added to the 0.2 m KCl step eluate of the Econo-Q column containing the partially purified V-ATPase (1-ml fraction, activity 0.08–0.35 μmol·ml−1·min−1). The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed again. 0.4 g of wet Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) prepared according to Holloway (4Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) were added to the mixture, which was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The beads were decanted, and the supernatant was recovered and mixed with another 0.4 g of wet Bio-Beads. The same incubation process was repeated, and the supernatant was again recovered. 100 μl of additional E. coli/cholesterol liposomes were added to the reconstitution mixture, which was again allowed to sit for 30 min on ice. The reconstituted proteoliposomes were then diluted to a final volume of 10 ml with RB, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 20 min at 174,000 × g (Beckman TLA-100.3). The pellet containing the reconstituted vesicles was resuspended in 300 μl of RB containing 150 mm KCl. The sizes of the fruit and epicotyl proteoliposomes were determined to be identical by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (data not shown). Proton pumping by tonoplast vesicles and reconstituted proteoliposomes was monitored by quinacrine or ACMA fluorescence quenching. The reaction mix contained 10 mmBTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 250 mm sorbitol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm azide, 250 nm valinomycin, 2.5 mm ATP, and either quinacrine (10 μm) or ACMA (1.5 μm). For tonoplast-enriched vesicles, 50 μm vanadate was included in the mix. 100 μg of tonoplast-enriched membrane protein or 0.4–1.0 μg of reconstituted proteoliposomes were typically used, and the reaction was started with 4.5 mm MgSO4. Fluorescence quenching (quinacrine: 423 nm excitation, 502 nm emission wave lengths; ACMA: 430 nm excitation, 500 nm emission) was measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Uncoupling or “slip” rates were estimated based on a kinetic model described by Tu et al. (7Tu S.-I. Nagahashi G. Brouillette J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). According to this model, the proton pumping rate at any given time point during the formation of the gradient can be represented by the following equation, dδdt=nR−k1+k2δ(Eq. 1) where dδ/dt and δ represent the proton pumping rate and the net amount of proton transport, respectively;n is the coupling ratio or stoichiometry of the pump;R, the ATP hydrolysis rate, and k 1and k 2 are first order rate constants representing membrane leakage and slip, respectively. The sum ofk 1 and k 2 can be represented by k i. nR is constant, and at steady state, dδ/dt = 0. It follows that kiδs=nR(Eq. 2) where δs is the steady state value of δ. After substituting and integrating ln1−δδs=−kit(Eq. 3) Equation 3 allows one to estimate k i, the combined leakage and slip rate constant, from proton pumping traces. By analogy, the proton leakage rate can be estimated by linearizing the curves obtained after a pH gradient has been generated, and H+-pumping has been inhibited with EDTA. Again, proton leakage is assumed to obey first order kinetics dδdt=−k3δ(Eq. 3) where k 3 represents the leakage rate constant for this portion of the curve. After integration, 1nδδs=−k3t(Eq. 5) The slip rate constant, k 2, is estimated by subtracting k 3 fromk i. ATP hydrolysis measurements were carried out in a reaction mix containing 2.5 mm ATP, 4.5 mmMgSO4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm azide, 1 mm molybdate, 2 μm gramicidin, and 1 mg/ml sonicated l-α-phosphatidylcholine liposomes in 25 mm BTP-Mes buffer, pH 7.0. The total reaction volume was 500 μl, and the reaction was started by adding the enzyme to the mix. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1.25 ml of Fiske and Subbarow (5Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) reagent. After 30 min at room temperature, absorbance of the samples at 660 nm was measured in a Spectronic Genesis 5 spectrophotometer (Milton Roy, Rochester, NY). Boiled membranes were used for background estimates. Where nitrate-sensitive or vanadate-sensitive activity is reported, the results are expressed as the difference in activity in the presence or absence of 400 mm KNO3 or 400 μmNa3VO4, respectively. Protein concentrations were measured routinely by a modified BCA protein assay (6Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.L. Goeke B.J. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) or with the NanoOrangeTM protein quantitation kit after precipitation of the proteins with cold acetone and delipidation with diethyl ether. SDS-PAGE was according to Laemmli (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) in 12 or 13.5% polyacrylamide gels. The samples were made up in sample buffer to a final concentration of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.0125% bromphenol blue. The gels were developed with silver. The electron microscopy experiments were conducted at the laboratory of Prof. Ulrich Lüttge in Darmstadt, Germany. Tonoplast-enriched membranes were pelleted and resuspended at room temperature to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/ml protein in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm ATP. Negative staining was performed with a solution of 2% methylamine tungstate according to the successive droplet method (9Klink R. Lüttge U. Bot. Acta. 1991; 104: 121-131Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 5-μl droplet of membrane suspension was applied to a Formvar-coated 700-mesh/hexagonal grid. After 2 min, the droplet was wicked off with filter paper and replaced with a 5-μl droplet of 2% methylamine tungstate. After 15–20 s the stain was also wicked off, and the grid was allowed to dry. Specimens were examined and photographed with a Zeiss EM902 electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) operated at 80 kV in the electron filter mode. As a first step in the purification, detergent-solubilized tonoplast-enriched membranes from epicotyls and fruits were layered onto a Sephacryl S-400 HR column, and the protein and ATPase activities were monitored. The protein distribution and ATPase activity profiles are shown in Fig. 1. An octyl-β-glucoside solubilization resulted in a single peak of ATPase activity corresponding to a molecular mass of about 4,500 kDa for both fruit and epicotyl membranes (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of the fractions by SDS-PAGE indicated that the peak fractions were enriched in subunits for the V-ATPase (data not shown). The high molecular mass of the complex indicated that the V-ATPase was migrating as an aggregate. The epicotyl peak was inhibited by nitrate only, whereas the fruit peak was sensitive to both nitrate andvanadate. If n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was used to solubilize the membranes, two peaks of ATPase activity were obtained for both fruit and epicotyl membranes, a nitrate-sensitive V-ATPase activity peak, which migrated either as a 4,500-kDa aggregate as in the octy-β-glucoside experiment (Fig. 1 D), or as a lower molecular mass aggregate of about 1,500 kDa (Fig. 1 C), and a second peak with an apparent molecular mass of about 250 kDa (Fig. 1,C and D). The second peak was both nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive. Treatment of the octyl-β-glucoside peak fractions with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside did not induce the appearance of the second peak (data not shown). Hence the second peak is not a degradation product of the first peak, but appears to be specifically solubilized from the membrane byn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The Sephacryl S-400 HR V-ATPase peak fractions from then-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside solubilization were further purified on two successive Econo-Q anion exchange columns. After a first passage over the column, both the fruit and the epicotyl V-ATPases showed an activity peak eluting at 0.1 m KCl. This peak was nitrate-sensitive and vanadate insensitive in the epicotyl preparation, and nitrate-sensitive and partially vanadate-sensitive in the case of the fruit. In addition, the fruit preparation exhibited a second peak of activity at 0.065 mKCl that was inhibited equally by nitrate and vanadate (data not shown). Both the single epicotyl ATPase activity peak and the fruit peak eluting at 0.1 m KCl contained typical V-ATPase subunits when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive fruit ATPase activity peak eluting at 0.065 m KCl appeared to co-purify with selected V-ATPase subunits rather than with any specific polypeptides. However, the presence of a low abundance contaminant with high ATP hydrolytic activity cannot be ruled out. When the fractions making up the more nitrate-sensitive activity peak were pooled and further purified on a second Econo-Q column, further separation of the vanadate-sensitive from the nitrate-sensitive activities was achieved (Fig. 2). The peak of maximum nitrate-sensitive activity was further enriched in the complete set of V-ATPase subunits and was depleted in contaminating bands, mainly a 100 kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2 B, fraction 40). Bands at 97, 66, 55/56, 52, 42/43, 36, 33, 31, 17, 14, and 13 kDa co-migrated with the peak of activity. Most notably, the doublet at 33/34 kDa was present only in the fruit preparation, and only the 33-kDa component of the doublet co-migrated with the more nitrate-sensitive activity peak. In most experiments, a 16-kDa band also co-migrated with the nitrate-sensitive activity peak, although it appears to be shifted to fraction 42 in the gel of Fig. 2 B. The nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity peak eluting at 0.065 m KCl was enriched in the 97- and 36-kDa bands, and in the 55/56-kDa doublet. The 33/34-kDa doublet was present, but only the 34-kDa component of the doublet co-migrated with the peak of nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive activity. The 66-kDa polypeptide (V-ATPase catalytic or A subunit) was also present, although in reduced amounts compared with the 55/56-kDa doublet (V-ATPase “regulatory” or B subunit). The strong doublet at 25/26 kDa, present in all fractions eluting from both Econo-Q columns, did not show a consistent pattern of co-migration with any of the two activities and is therefore thought to represent a contaminant. The specific activities of the purified V-ATPases (average ± S.D. of four purifications) were 9.5 ± 1.5 μmol of Pi·mg−1·min−1 and 6.9 ± 2.2 μmol Pi·mg−1·min−1 for the epicotyl and fruit, respectively. The sensitivities of the two purified V-ATPases to various inhibitors is shown in Fig.3. Both V-ATPases were about equally inhibited by nitrate (Fig. 3 A), bafilomycin (Fig. 3 B), and NEM (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, only the fruit V-ATPase showed partial inhibition by vanadate (Fig. 3 D). Fig. 3 Dalso shows that the fractions making up the V-ATPase peak after S-400 HR chromatography progressively lost their vanadate sensitivity with subsequent Econo-Q column purifications. This indicates either that the vanadate sensitivity is associated with a contaminating ATPase, or that a subpopulation of V-ATPases, perhaps partial V1 complexes, exhibit nitrate- and vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. The latter hypothesis is supported by the Econo-Q activity profiles and gels in which the main vanadate-sensitive peak exhibited a subunit composition compatible with that of a V1 complex partially depleted of its catalytic subunit (Fig. 2). Partially purified fruit and epicotyl V-ATPases from a step elution of the second Econo-Q column (see “Experimental Procedures”) were reconstituted into artificial proteoliposomes, and their proton pumping activities were compared. When the proton gradients had stabilized, the reactions were stopped by adding EDTA, allowing the pH gradients to collapse due to proton leakage. In Fig. 4, the upper panel shows six different comparisons based on five different experiments (an epicotyl trace is shown twice in B and E, and a fruit trace is shown twice in A and B). Panels A and C represent equal protein concentrations. The proteoliposome concentrations in Fig. 4, B and C, were chosen to give equal initial rates of proton pumping. In Fig. 4,D and E, the protein concentrations were normalized to generate equal fluorescence quenching at equilibrium. In Fig. 4 E the proteoliposomes also displayed equal proton leakage rates. Fig. 4 F represents aged proteoliposomes with leaky membranes. When equal protein concentrations of freshly prepared proteoliposomes were used (Fig. 4, A and C) or when the concentrations of reconstituted fruit and epicotyl proteoliposomes were adjusted to yield equal initial rates of proton pumping (Fig. 4,B and C), the reconstituted fruit V-ATPase consistently generated a steeper pH gradient than the reconstituted epicotyl enzyme. When the proteoliposome concentrations were adjusted so as to build up equal pH gradients at equilibrium, the initial rate of pumping by the fruit V-ATPase was lower than that by the epicotyl enzyme (Fig. 4 D). This latter result was obtained even when the proteoliposomes exhibited equal leakage rates (Fig.4 E). Leakage and intrinsic uncoupling or “slip” rates were estimated according to Tu et al. (7Tu S.-I. Nagahashi G. Brouillette J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” For each of the curves shown in Fig. 4, A–F, the rate constants k i, k 3, and k 2 are given in the table in the lower panel. If all five fruit and epicotyl traces are considered, the average leakage rate constants for the fruit and epicotyl proteoliposomes are approximately equal, 0.047 ± 0.029 and 0.045 ± 0.011, respectively. In contrast, the slip rate constants average 0.341 ± 0.121 for the fruit V-ATPase, and 0.687 ± 0.212 for the epicotyl enzyme. The average epicotyl/fruit slip ratio is 2.0 ± 0.3. These values were obtained by considering the initial third of the proton pumping curves and the second half of the leakage curves. If the entire curves were included in the calculations, the epicotyl/fruit slip ratio averaged 2.4 ± 0.4. Note that the slip rate of the reconstituted epicotyl V-ATPase was higher than that of the fruit enzyme under every condition tested. The reconstituted proteoliposomes containing purified fruit and epicotyl V-ATPases exhibited similar polypeptide profiles, as shown in Fig. 5. Both had bands at 66, 55/56, 52, 42, 36, 31, 17, 16, and 13 kDa. In addition, the fruit V-ATPase contained bands at 100 and 78 kDa, as well as a doublet at 33/34 kDa. The 100- and 78-kDa bands by themselves had no ATPase activity as shown by the second Econo-Q profile (Fig. 2). Quantitative differences were also observed. For example, the fruit enzyme was strongly enriched in a 16-kDa polypeptide, it was slightly depleted in the catalytic subunit (66 kDa), compared with the epicotyl, and had a more pronounced doublet at 55/56 kDa. Table I shows the sensitivities of the two reconstituted proton pumps to nitrate, bafilomycin, and NEM. Proton pumping by the reconstituted fruit V-ATPase was slightly less sensitive to nitrate and NEM than the epicotyl V-ATPase, especially at low concentrations, but it was as sensitive as the epicotyl V-ATPase to bafilomycin. The fruit V-ATPase also retained its partial sensitivity to vanadate (Fig.6 A). Because the fruit proteoliposomes were 100% sensitive to low concentrations of bafilomycin, the vanadate sensitivity of the pump cannot be due to a contaminating P-type ATPase (Fig. 6 B). H+-pumping by the reconstituted epicotyl V-ATPase was completely insensitive to vanadate. Furthermore, the fruit V-ATPase, which was insensitive to oxidation in its native membrane (2Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), was now as prone to oxidation as the epicotyl V-ATPase (Fig. 7), and the inhibition could be partially reversed by 50 mm DTT.Table ISensitivity of purified, reconstituted V-ATPases form lemon fruits and epicotyls to various inhibitorsTreatmentActivityTonoplast enriched membranesReconstituted V-ATPaseEpicotylFruitEpicotylFruit%Control100100100100100 mm KNO31 ± 080 ± 10 ± 06 ± 31 nmBafilomycin A127 ± 12103 ± 40 ± 01 ± 1100 μm NEM1 ± 082 ± 03 ± 28 ± 31 mmNaN371 ± 481 ± 189 ± 1399 ± 1Purified V-ATPases, re"

In this study, we investigated if receptor-receptor interactions, in addition to ligand-receptor interactions, contribute to the ligand-induced dimerization of the PDGF receptors. Analysis of two deletion mutants of the PDGF α-receptor indicated a role for Ig-like domain 4 in ligand-receptor or receptor-receptor interactions. When the fourth Ig-like domain of the PDGF α-receptor instead was replaced with the corresponding sequence of the stem cell factor receptor, the binding of PDGF-AA and -BB was not affected, nor was the ability to form homodimeric receptor complexes. This indicates that Ig-like domain 4 does not participate in ligand-receptor interactions. However, the chimeras did not form heterodimers with wild-type PDGF α- or β-receptors. Together, these findings suggest that Ig-like domain 4 mediates specific receptor-receptor interactions. This notion was also supported by the finding that a soluble form of Ig-like domain 4 of the PDGF α-receptor acted as a PDGF α-receptor antagonist.

Since the A-chain binds only α-receptors, whereas the B-chain binds both α- and β-receptors with high affinity, the different isoforms will induce different dimeric receptor complexes. Structurally, the PDGF B-chain consists of a tight cystine knot motif from which two loops (loops 1 and 3) point in one direction and one (loop 2) points in the other direction (8Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The two subunits of the PDGF-BB molecule are arranged in an antiparallel manner so that loops 1 and 3 from one subunit will be close to loop 2 of the other. The receptor-binding epitopes reside mainly in loops 1 and 3, but loop 2 also contributes to some extent (9Östman A. Andersson M. Hellman U. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol.

The dimeric PDGF molecule thus causes dimerization by simultaneously binding two receptor molecules. The ligand-binding region of the PDGF α-receptor has been mapped to Ig-like domains 1–3 (13Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol.

Previously described cDNAs encoding the PDGF α-receptor (5Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and the SCF receptor (19Yarden Y. Kuang W.-J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) were used to generate the mutants used in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Altered SitesTM system (Promega). To generate the deletion mutant αΔ5-R, XhoI sites (CTCGAG) were introduced into the α-receptor cDNA at positions corresponding to those encoding the ends of Ig-like domains 4 (amino acids 418–419) and 5 (amino acids 521–522), and theXhoI fragment was subsequently excised. In a similar manner, αΔ4,5-R was generated by introducing XhoI sites at positions encoding the ends of Ig-like domains 3 (amino acids 315–316) and 5, followed by excision of the XhoI fragment. In both deletion mutants, an NcoI site was also introduced at the position of the stop codon, enabling ligation to a vector encoding three tandem HA epitopes followed by a stop codon (a kind gift of Dr. Y. Xiong). To generate the chimeric receptors, a cDNA fragment encoding SCF receptor Ig-like domain 4 (amino acids 315–416) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using primers introducingXhoI sites at the ends of the polymerase chain reaction product. This fragment was ligated to a PDGF α-receptor cDNA in which an XhoI fragment encoding Ig-like domain 4 had been cut out. To make the truncated forms, a BglII site (AGATCT) was introduced into the sequence encoding the juxtamembrane portion (amino acids 560–561) of the α-receptor and used to ligate to the vector encoding three tandem HA epitopes followed by a stop codon. All constructs were inserted into the pSV7d vector (20Truett M.A. Blacher R. Burke R.L. Caput D. Chu C. Dina D. Hartog K. Kuo C.H. Masiarz F.R. Merryweather J.P. Najarian R. Pachl C. Potter S.J.

Plasmids were transfected into COS cells by the calcium phosphate method and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 3 h. After extraction with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Trasylol) and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, the receptors were immunoprecipitated with rabbit antisera against the C-terminal part (amino acids 1066–1084) of the human PDGF α-receptor (21Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or the HA epitope (a kind gift of Dr. Lars Rönnstrand). After SDS-gel electrophoresis using 7% polyacrylamide gels, the labeled proteins were analyzed using a phosphoimager (FUJIX BAS 2000, Fuji). PDGF-AA and -BB were125I-labeled with the chloramine-T (22Hunter W.M. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar) and Bolton and Hunter (23Bolton A.E.

Binding experiments were performed as described (24Heldin C.-H. Bäckström G. Östman A. Hammacher A. Rönnstrand L. Rubin K. Nistér M. Westermark B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) using transfected COS cells in 12-well dishes. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation after binding of 125I-PDGF-AA in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled PDGF-AA were performed using transfected COS cells in 60-mm dishes. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 90 min on ice with 10 ng/ml 125I-PDGF-AA in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml unlabeled PDGF-AA. After three washes with PBS, ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked by incubation in 1 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation in 70 mm methylammonium chloride for 10 min, cell lysates were prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitations were performed with rabbit antisera against the PDGF α-receptor or the HA epitope. After SDS-gel electrophoresis, the labeled proteins were detected with a phosphoimager. Cross-linking after PDGF-BB binding was performed as described above using unlabeled PDGF-BB (200 ng/ml in PBS/bovine serum albumin). For immunoprecipitations, PDGF β-receptor and HA epitope antisera were used. After SDS-gel electrophoresis using 4–12% gradient gels, electrophoretic transfer was carried out onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Corp.). For immunoblotting, the filter was probed with 10 μg/ml monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody (12CA5, Boehringer Mannheim) or a rabbit PDGF β-receptor antiserum (PR-4, a kind gift from Dr. Sara Courtneidge); precipitated components were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). A polymerase chain reaction-generated BamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding Ig-like domain 4 (amino acids 317–417) of the PDGF α-receptor was cloned into the vector pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Expression of GST-αRIg4 protein was induced by growing transformed JM109 bacteria in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were lysed in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 1% Trasylol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjected to three pulses of sonication. After clearing of the lysate by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, GST-αRIg4 was affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and eluted in 2% SDS and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4. Before using GST-αRIg4 in experiments on cultured cells, SDS was removed by four consecutive dilution and concentration cycles in 0.1% Chaps and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, using a Centriplus spin column (Amersham Corp.). The final concentration of GST-αRIg4 in the stock solution was determined by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue after SDS-gel electrophoresis, using known amounts of marker proteins as standards. For analysis of the effect of GST-αRIg4 on PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, serum-starved PAE cells stably transfected with the PDGF α-receptor (21Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were used. Unstimulated cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin on ice for 60 min with or without 10 μg/ml GST control protein or GST-αRIg4. Identical incubations were also performed in the presence of 3 ng/ml PDGF-AA and on cells that had been pretreated for 10 min at 37 °C with a 50 mmconcentration of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. After incubation on ice, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and PDGF α-receptors were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with rabbit antisera against the human PDGF α-receptor. After SDS-gel electrophoresis, precipitated receptors were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The filters were subsequently stripped and reprobed with the PDGF α-receptor rabbit antisera, and the amount of receptors was determined by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies followed by ECL. Control experiments performed on serum-starved PAE cells stably transfected with the SCF receptor (25Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) were performed in a similar fashion using a rabbit antiserum against the SCF receptor (25Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) for analysis by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The region of the PDGF α-receptor primarily involved in direct PDGF binding has been mapped to Ig-like domains 1–3 (13Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Jensen R.A. Matsui T. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18741-18744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an initial attempt to determine if regions outside the ligand-binding domain are of any importance for high affinity binding of ligand, two deletion mutants were generated in which either Ig-like domain 5 (αΔ5-R) or Ig-like domain 4 and 5 (αΔ4,5-R) were deleted (Fig. 1 A). Analysis by immunoprecipitations of the two deletion mutants after expression in metabolically labeled COS cells revealed precursor and mature forms of the expected sizes (Fig. 1 B). To determine the functional effects of the deletions, COS cells expressing the wild-type PDGF α-receptor or the deletion mutants were subjected to a 125I-PDGF-AA binding assay (Fig.1 C). Whereas deletion of Ig-like domain 5 had only minor effects on PDGF-AA binding, deletion of both Ig-like domains 4 and 5 decreased binding dramatically (Fig. 1 C). When the results from the binding data were subjected to Scatchard analysis (26Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17809) Google Scholar), aK d value of 0.5 nm was obtained for both the wild-type PDGF α-receptor and αΔ5-R. The two deletion mutants were also compared with the wild-type PDGF α-receptor using cross-linking of 125I-PDGF-AA to the receptor by bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, followed by immunoprecipitations with PDGF α-receptor antiserum. As shown in Fig. 1 D, deletion of Ig-like domain 5 affected neither the total amount of recovered ligand-receptor complex nor the ratio of monomeric and dimeric receptor forms, as compared with the wild-type α-receptor. In contrast, deletion of both Ig-like domains 4 and 5 reduced dramatically the formation of both monomeric and dimeric receptor complexes. Together, these experiments suggest that Ig-like domain 4 is required for high affinity binding of PDGF-AA to its receptor, either by mediating ligand-receptor interactions or by mediating receptor-receptor interactions required for high affinity ligand binding. The following experiments were designed to distinguish between these two possibilities. A cDNA encoding a chimeric PDGF α-receptor in which the fourth Ig-like domain of the receptor was replaced with the corresponding sequence of the SCF receptor (α/kit-R) was generated (Fig. 1 A). In addition, cDNAs encoding carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of the chimera (Tα/kit-R) as well as of the wild-type PDGF α-receptor (Tα-R) were generated (Fig.1 A). Both truncated forms contain three tandem HA epitopes at their carboxyl termini for immunodetection. When expressed transiently in COS cells, all four types of receptors were detected as precursor and mature forms of the expected sizes after immunoprecipitations from lysates of metabolically labeled cells (Fig.2 A). The four receptors were expressed in COS cells and analyzed with regard to binding of PDGF-AA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, no major differences were observed between the full-length and truncated receptors on one hand and between the wild-type and chimeric receptors on the other (Fig. 2 B). Scatchard analysis of the results from the binding experiments yielded K d values between 0.3 and 0.5 nm. Furthermore, when analyzed in cross-linking experiments, the full-length chimeric receptor formed cross-linked dimers in a manner indistinguishable from that of the wild-type PDGF α-receptor (Fig. 3, A andB, lanes 1–4). The finding that Ig-like domain 4 of the PDGF α-receptor can be substituted with the corresponding domain of the SCF receptor, which does not bind PDGF, suggests that Ig-like domain 4 is not involved in ligand-receptor interactions. To explore if Ig-like domain 4 is involved in direct and specific receptor-receptor interactions, we designed cross-linking experiments in which the ability of the receptor chimera to form homodimers could be compared with the ability to form heterodimers with wild-type PDGF α-receptors. The full-length α-receptor, either alone or together with the truncated wild-type or truncated chimeric receptor, was transiently expressed in COS cells. After binding of 125I-PDGF-AA, with or without an excess of unlabeled PDGF-AA, ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to analyses by SDS-gel electrophoresis, followed by exposure using a phosphoimager (Fig. 3 A). In the immunoprecipitations with PDGF α-receptor antiserum, dimers of the full-length wild-type α-receptor were recovered (lanes 3, 5, and7). In addition, cross-linked dimers of full-length and truncated wild-type receptors could be demonstrated (lane 5). However, no heterodimers composed of the full-length wild-type PDGF α-receptor and truncated chimeric receptors were detected (lane 7). In the HA tag precipitations, homodimeric forms of both truncated versions were easily identified as broad tailing components at positions that partially overlap with the positions of the heterodimeric complexes (lanes 9–14). In an analogous experiment in which the full-length chimeric receptor was expressed alone or together with either of the two truncated forms, similar findings were obtained; all possible homodimeric receptor forms were identified (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, 5,7, 11, and 13). Also, dimers of full-length and truncated chimeric receptors were detected (lane 7). In contrast, no heterodimers between full-length chimeric and truncated wild-type receptors were observed (lane 5). Thus, in the immunoprecipitations with PDGF α-receptor antiserum, dimers composed of one truncated and one full-length form of the PDGF α-receptor could be demonstrated as well as dimers composed of one truncated and one full-length SCF receptor/PDGF α-receptor chimera. However, no heterodimers between wild-type and chimeric receptors were seen. These experiments thus suggest that PDGF α-receptor dimerization is not exclusively a consequence of ligand-receptor interactions, but also requires specific receptor-receptor interactions. Since the chimera's ability to form homodimers was unaffected, we also conclude that the receptor-receptor interactions occur between complementary epitopes in Ig-like domain 4. PDGF-AA binds exclusively to PDGF α-receptors. In contrast, PDGF-BB binds with equal affinity to α- and β-receptors and will thus, on cells expressing both receptor types, induce the formation of heterodimeric α- and β-receptor complexes in addition to homodimeric complexes. We therefore investigated whether Ig-like domain 4 of the α-receptor also is involved in interactions with the β-receptor. The truncated wild-type and chimeric α-receptors expressed in COS cells showed similar affinities for binding of PDGF-BB (Fig. 4 A). A K d value of 0.7 nm was obtained when binding data were subjected to Scatchard analysis. The PDGF β-receptor was coexpressed with either the truncated wild-type or the truncated chimeric receptor; after ligand binding, cells were incubated with or without cross-linker, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitations with a PDGF β-receptor antiserum and analysis by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody. A dimeric complex between the PDGF β-receptor and the truncated α-receptor complex could be demonstrated, but no heterodimeric complexes between the truncated chimera and the β-receptor (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Control experiments showed that equal amounts of the different receptor forms were expressed (Fig. 4 B, middle and lower panels). The finding that substitution of Ig-like domain 4 altered the ability of the chimera to dimerize with wild-type PDGF β-receptors, without affecting the ability to bind PDGF-BB, extends the role for Ig-like domain 4 in homodimerization of PDGF α-receptors to include also heterodimerization with PDGF β-receptors. We next used a receptor autophosphorylation assay to investigate whether a soluble Ig-like domain 4 could interfere with receptor activation. PDGF α-receptor Ig-like domain 4 was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-αRIg4) in bacteria and purified through glutathione-Sepharose affinity purification. To investigate its ability to interfere with PDGF α-receptor activation, PAE cells stably expressing the PDGF α-receptor were used (Fig. 5). The potential inhibitory effect of GST-αRIg4 on PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed under three different conditions: using unstimulated cells, cells stimulated with 3 ng/ml PDGF-AA, and cells pretreated with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. After cell lysis, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF α-receptors was determined by immunoprecipitations of the PDGF α-receptor followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 A (upper panel), the presence of 10 μg/ml GST-αRIg4 led to a reduction in background as well as ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF α-receptor. No such effect was seen when cells were incubated with GST (Fig. 5 A, upper panel). The total amount of receptors was the same under the different experimental conditions (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). To investigate the specificity of the antagonistic action of GST-αRIg4, PAE cells stably expressing the SCF receptor were subjected to similar experiments. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GST-αRIg4 did not show any effect on ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the SCF receptor, nor was any effect seen on SCF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the SCF receptor (data not shown). The finding that GST-αRIg4 functions as an antagonist to PDGF α-receptor tyrosine phosphorylation supports the notion that Ig-like domain 4 is involved in direct receptor-receptor interactions. In this study, we provide evidence that PDGF receptor dimerization involves, in addition to the interaction between ligand and receptor, a direct interaction between the receptors. Whereas the ligand binds to epitopes in Ig-like domains 1–3 (13Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Jensen R.A. Matsui T. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18741-18744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ig-like domain 4 mediates direct receptor-receptor interactions (Fig. 6). PDGF receptor dimerization can thus occur via two different routes: either the ligand binds first to one receptor and subsequently to another, or alternatively, the ligand binds to and stabilizes preformed transient receptor dimers (Fig. 6). It is noteworthy that in PAE cells stably expressing the PDGF α-receptor, which express receptor levels comparable to those in cells expressing endogenous receptors, the antagonistic effect of GST-αRIg4 was observed not only on ligand-stimulated cells, but also on the background phosphorylation of the receptor in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5, A andB). These findings suggest that the background receptor phosphorylation is due to the formation of transient ligand-independent receptor dimers, rather than to receptor monomers displaying a basal kinase activity. Thus, an equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric receptors appears to exist in the absence of ligand. It follows that the receptor density on the target cell is likely to influence which of the two routes in Fig. 6 are preferentially used. The structurally best characterized example of ligand-receptor interaction is the binding of growth hormone (GH) to the GH receptor (17De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar), for which the crystal structure is known. In this case GH, binds with high affinity to one receptor and, through a different epitope, with lower affinity to another receptor, thus forming a 1:2 complex. The binding of the second receptor is stabilized by direct interactions between the receptors. Thus, the the PDGF ligand-receptor complex and the GH ligand-receptor complex are similar in that they both are stabilized by a combination of ligand-receptor and receptor-receptor interactions, but differ in that the two ligand-receptor interactions in the case of PDGF are of similar strength, but differ in the case of GH. The PDGF receptors are structurally most related to the SCF and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptors (19Yarden Y. Kuang W.-J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J.

Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These receptors also bind dimeric ligands. In the case of the SCF receptor, an involvement of Ig-like domain 4-mediated receptor-receptor interactions in dimerization was recently postulated based on the finding that deletion of Ig-like domain 4 prevented dimerization and, to a lesser extent, ligand binding (18Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor that lead to its ligand-independent activation are localized to Ig-like domain 4 (27Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C. Verma I.A. Ullrich A. Nature. 1986; 320: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is possible that the activating effects of these mutations are mediated by causing increases in the affinity of receptor-receptor interactions. Together with the findings presented in this paper, these observations suggest that direct interactions between receptors may be common in ligand-induced dimeric receptor complexes. PDGF antagonists are highly warranted given the overactivity of PDGF receptors in certain pathological situations, including tumorigenesis and atherosclerosis (28Ferns G.A.A. Raines E.W. Sprugel K.H.

Since these products are potentially highly damaging molecules, we hypothesized that implication of such enzymes in diabetes might contribute to the development of complications (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning, sequencing, and expression of cDNA of amadoriase II from a cDNA library of Aspergillus fumigatus from soil (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fructosyl propylamine was prepared as described previously (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All other materials were analytical grade. Escherichia colistrains XL-1 Blue MRF′ and SOLR (Stratagene) were used. A. fumigatus was isolated from soil and cultivated as described previously (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Batch cultures were grown in nutrient broth containing 1 mg/ml fructosyl propylamine, and incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 3 days aerobically. After anesthetizing, a New Zealand White rabbit was immunized by injection into popliteal lymph nodes of 50 μg of purified amadoriase II protein (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Three weeks later, booster injections were performed subcutaneously with 100 μg of enzyme emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antiserum was obtained 10 days after the booster injection. Nonspecific antibody was reduced by incubating with XL1-Blue MRF′ lysate before use. Total RNA was extracted from A. fumigatus (1 g) according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from total RNA using an oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column. Five μg of poly(A)+ RNA were converted to a double-stranded cDNA and ligated to the Uni-ZAP XR vector using a ZAP cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The resulting DNA was packaged using Gigapack Gold III (Stratagene) and amplified in E. coliXL1-Blue MRF′. A library containing 4.0 × 106 clones was made, of which approximately 99% were recombinants. Screening of the cDNA library was carried out as follows. After transferring plaques onto nitrocellulose filters (Micron Separations Inc.), plaques presenting amadoriase II epitopes by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction were detected by anti-amadoriase II antiserum and goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Positive clones were converted to phagemids carrying cDNA inserts between EcoRI andXhoI sites of pBluescript SK(−) by helper phage superinfection as described in the Uni-ZAP XR manufacturer's manual (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [35S]dATPαS 1The abbreviations used are: dATPαS, deoxyadenosine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and by ALF DNA Sequence with Auto CycleTMsequencing kit (Pharmacia). The plasmid carrying amadoriase II cDNA was transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′. The transformant was precultured in 10 ml of LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and 40 mg/ml tetracycline for 150 min and then for 6 h in the presence of 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). After one freeze-thaw cycle, the cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to enzyme assays and immunoblot analysis. The enzyme activity was monitored by the release of glucosone as measured by a colorimetric reaction with o-phenylenediamine as described previously (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme solution added to the reaction mixture contained 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm o-phenylenediamine, 10 mm fructosyl propylamine in a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the absorbance at 320 nm was measured. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of glucosone/min. Synthesized glucosone was used as a standard. Crude extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and probed using anti-amadoriase II antiserum and goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein analysis by SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with total RNA (10 μg) from A. fumigatuscultured in the presence of various concentrations of fructosyl propylamine. Random primer 32P-labeled amadoriase II cDNA was used as a probe. The blots on the membrane were exposed to Kodak XAR films at −80 °C for 2 days with an intensifying screen. The library constructed in Uni-ZAP XR was screened with antiserum against amadoriase II of A. fumigatus. By screening 5 × 104 plaques, we obtained six positive clones. Sequence analysis of one of these clones is shown in Fig. 1. The amadoriase II coding sequence was considered to have 1314-base pair coding for a novel protein of 438 amino acids (nucleotide positions 174–1487). The open reading frame is preceded by a 173-base pair 5′-noncoding region and followed by a 20-base pair 3′-noncoding region and a poly(A) tail. We assumed the ATG codon at positions 174–177 as the translational initiation codon for the following reasons. First, the sequence of the first 21 deduced amino acid residues was consistent with the NH2-terminal sequence obtained from the purified protein except for the first methionine (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Second, the molecular mass calculated and corrected for loss of one methionine was 48,798 daltons, which is in agreement with values previously estimated by SDS-PAGE (13Takahashi M. Pischetsrieder M. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3437-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Potential ribosome-binding sites (AGGA) were located 8 bases before the start codon. Close inspection revealed that amino acids present at positions 8–37 satisfy all of the 11 consensus sequence requirements for an ADP-binding domain (25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Conserved features include three glycine residues (Glu13, Glu15, and Glu18), which allow for a sharp turn between the first β-strand and the α-helix, a core of six hydrophobic amino acids (Leu9, Leu11, Ala22, Leu25, Val33, and Val35), and the presence of an acidic residue (Asp37) that forms a hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH group of the FAD adenine ribose. These are capable of forming a structural motif βαβ fold to interact with the bottom of the ADP moiety of the FAD cofactor (25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). A search for protein homology using BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) revealed that amadoriase II has no significant similarities with mammalian enzymes reported so far, implying that amadoriase II is an enzyme representing a new family of fructosyl amine:oxygen oxidoreductases. To confirm the identification of the cDNA, pBluescript II containing amadoriase II cDNA was introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′, and the enzyme was expressed as a β-galactosidase fusion protein. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the extract was assayed for amadoriase activity using fructosyl propylamine as a substrate. As shown in Table I, the transformant exhibited significant activity, whereas the control cells showed no activity. Immunoblot analysis was performed to examine whether the amadoriase II protein was indeed present in the transformant (Fig. 2). The transformant cell extracts exhibited a band that was not seen in control cells. This band had a molecular size that is slightly larger than the purified enzyme, and this increase in size was consistent with the fusion of the NH2-terminal region of β-galactosidase to the enzyme. These results confirmed that the cloned cDNA encodes 49-kDa amadoriase II.Table IExpression of amadoriase II cDNA in E. coliDNASpecific activitymicrounits/mgpBluescriptND1-aND, not detected.Amadoriase II cDNA20.3E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells were transfected with amadoriase II cDNA or pBluescript and cultured for 6 h in the presence of 10 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside.

Open table in a new tab E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ cells were transfected with amadoriase II cDNA or pBluescript and cultured for 6 h in the presence of 10 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell extracts were assayed for amadoriase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” using fructosyl propylamine as a substrate. Using amadoriase II cDNA as a hybridization probe, Northern blotting analysis was performed for an A. fumigatus that was cultured in the presence of various concentrations of fructosyl propylamine. As shown in Fig. 3, amadoriase II was induced in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggests the existence of a mechanism for up-regulation of amadoriase II by an Amadori compound. To our knowledge, no other protein has been reported that is inducible by an Amadori compound. However, it is unclear yet whether the Amadori product binds to an intracellular receptor or whether it induces gene expression through indirect pathways, such as oxidative stress. In summary, we have described the primary structure of amadoriase II from A. fumigatus, which was selected by using fructosyl adamantanamine and cultured in the presence of fructosyl propylamine. Although the BLAST search detected no significant homology of amadoriase II with any human protein in the data base, the possible occurrence of amadoriase homologues in human tissue could have considerable implications for the development of diabetic complications. While growing evidence implicates Amadori products in the formation of H2O2, the mechanism and source of H2O2 formation in vivo in relationship to the Maillard reaction remains to be solved. Although metal-catalyzed oxidation of Amadori products can generate glucosone and H2O2 in vivo (6Smith P.R. Thornally P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Kawakishi S. Tsunehiro J. Uchida K. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 211: 167-171Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Baker J.R.

Chem. 1994; 40: 1950-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the existence of an enzyme such as amadoriase suggests a possible role of flavin as an electron acceptor in oxidation of Amadori products. While this publication was in preparation, Yoshida et al. (29Yoshida N. Sakai Y. Isogai A. Fukuya H. Yagi M. Tani Y. Kato N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) published two homologous sequences. Sequence comparison revealed that amadoriase II fromA. fumigatus exhibits 82% identity and 92% similarity with fructosyl amino acid oxidase from Aspergillus terreus(accession number Y09020) and 36% identity and 65% similarity with the same enzyme from Penicillium janthinellum (Y09021), respectively, when calculated without gaps.

In this study, two immortalized GnRH-expressing cell lines (Gn11 and NLT) were characterized. The NLT and Gn11 cells, derived from a same brain tumor in a transgenic mouse, display neuronal morphology and neuron-specific markers. However, NLT cells secrete much higher levels of GnRH than Gn11 cells. To delineate the mechanism underlying this difference, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNase protection assays were performed to examine proGnRH gene expression. While the mature proGnRH mRNA was predominately expressed in NLT cells, Gn11 cells express an abundant short transcript. Sequence analysis revealed that this short transcript contains exons 1, 3, and 4, but not exon 2, which encodes the GnRH decapeptide. RNase protection assays demonstrated that NLT cells express much higher levels of mature proGnRH mRNA than Gn11 cells. The lower level of GnRH secreting capacity in Gn11 cells is due, in part, to decreased expression of mature proGnRH mRNA. When proGnRH gene expression in the mouse brain was examined, the same short splicing variant was observed in the olfactory area and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus. But the prevalent transcript in these regions was the mature proGnRH mRNA. In contrast, only the mature proGnRH mRNA was found in the caudal hypothalamus. These results suggest that alternative splicing may be one of the mechanisms regulating proGnRH gene expression in the animal brain.

These neurons originate from precursor cells in the olfactory placode and migrate to their target sites during embryonic development (1Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2Wray S. Gant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The most prominent axonal projection of GnRH neurons is to the median eminence, where GnRH is released and transported via the hypothalamic hypophyseal portal vessels to the anterior pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (3Silverman A.J. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 1283-1304Google Scholar). The regulation of GnRH neuronal activities has been difficult to study, however, due to their scattered distribution and paucity in cell number (3Silverman A.J. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 1283-1304Google Scholar, 4Wray S. Hoffman G.A. J. Comp.

In our laboratory, targeting the expression of the simian virus 40 T antigen (SV40-Tag) to the GnRH neurons with the human GnRH gene 5′-upstream regulatory sequence resulted in the development of an olfactory tumor in one of the transgenic mice (7Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nichols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler G.B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two GnRH immunoreactive cell lines (Gn11 and NLT) were subsequently derived from this tumor. Characterization of the NLT and Gn11 cells demonstrated that these cells display neuronal morphology and neuron-specific markers, such as microtubule-associated peptide 2 (MAP-2) and Tau protein (8Fischer I. Richter-Landsberg C. Safaei R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 194: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Mavilia C. Couchie D. Mattei M.G. Nivez M.P. Nunez J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Solution hybridization-RNase protection assays and RT-PCR analysis indicated that these cells express proGnRH mRNA and are able to synthesize and secrete GnRH as demonstrated by RIA. Therefore, these cell lines provide a suitablein vitro model for the study of GnRH neuronal activity and its regulation.Although the NLT and Gn11 cells were derived from the same tumor, RIA measurement of GnRH concentrations demonstrated that the NLT cells secrete about 10 times higher levels of GnRH than the Gn11 cells. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis responsible for generating this difference, we characterized the expression of the proGnRH gene in these cell lines by RT-PCR and solution hybridization-RNase protection assays. In addition, the expression of proGnRH gene expression in the mouse olfactory and preoptic area-hypothalamus was also examined. Our results demonstrate that a splicing variant lacking exon 2 of the proGnRH gene was present in Gn11 cells but not in NLT cells. This same splicing variant was also found in the olfactory and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, but not in the caudal hypothalamus of the mouse brain. This is the first demonstration that alternative splicing of the primary proGnRH gene transcript occurs in the immortalized GnRH-expressing neuronal cell lines and in the animal forebrain.DISCUSSIONOur data indicate that the NLT and Gn11 cells are neuronal in phenotype, express proGnRH mRNA, and secrete GnRH into the medium. Since one major difficulty in the study of GnRH neuronal activities is their low abundance and scattered distribution, these cell lines provide a convenient in vitro model for the study of GnRH secretion and regulation of gene expression. Using the Gn11 and NLT cell lines as a model, we found that although both cell lines were derived from a same tumor in a transgenic mice, they display heterogeneity in the secretion of GnRH and expression of proGnRH gene. Our data provide evidence that the lower GnRH secreting capacity found in the Gn11 cells is due, in part, to the prevalence of a splicing variant lacking exon 2 which encodes the GnRH decapeptide. Moreover, we extended this finding to the animal forebrain by demonstrating that this splicing variant is also expressed in the olfactory and preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus, although the prevalent form of transcripts in these areas is the mature proGnRH mRNA. Therefore, these results suggest that alternative splicing of the primary transcript may contribute to the regulation of proGnRH gene expression in the animal forebrain.Various lines of evidence indicate that proGnRH gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific pattern. In various peripheral tissues, including the placenta, mammary gland, testes, and ovary (12Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Nakayama Y. Yamada M. Cutler G.B. Weintraub B.D. Mol.

Moreover, a major transcriptional start site upstream of that used in the hypothalamus is utilized for transcription of the proGnRH gene in these tissues (14Goubau S. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Misra V.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the immature T lymphocyte cell line Nb2, in addition to the mature GnRH mRNA, the alternatively spliced form of transcript is also found, which lacks exon 2 that encodes the GnRH decapeptide (15Wilson T.M. Yu-Lee L. Kelley M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 44-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the splicing process affects the coding capacity of transcripts directly, its efficiency and accuracy are obviously critical for normal functions of GnRH neurons. Our present data demonstrate that even among GnRH neurons located in different regions of the central nervous system, the primary transcript is differentially processed. For GnRH neurons located in the olfactory area where Gn11 and NLT cells were derived, and those in the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, in addition to the prevalent mature mRNA, a short splicing variant lacking exon 2 of proGnRH gene is also produced, whereas only the mature proGnRH mRNA is generated by GnRH neurons located in the caudal hypothalamus. This finding is in agreement with the emerging evidence that the expression of proGnRH gene is differentially regulated in different regions of the central nervous system. For example, in the human brain, in situhybridization studies suggest the presence of three distinct subtypes of GnRH neurons with pronounced differences in morphology, labeling density, and location (18Rance N.E. Young III, W.S. McMullen N.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 339: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The number of GnRH neurons detected byin situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry has also been shown to vary in response to ovariectomy (19King J.C. Rubin B.S. Conn P.M. Crowley Jr., W.F.

Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 36: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and during the estrous cycle (22Lee W.-S. Abbud R. Smith M.S. Hoffman G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3101-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Hiatt E.S. Brunetta P.G. Seiler G.R. Barney S.A. Selles W.D. Wooledge K.H. King J.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1030-1043PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of the rat preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge demonstrate that the number of GnRH-expressing cells fluctuates during the periovulatory period, and peak numbers of GnRH-expressing cells are attained at different time points in the preoptic area versus GnRH neurons in the more rostral regions (24Porkka-Heiskanen T. Urban J.H. Turek F.W. Levine J.E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support the presence of heterogeneous populations of GnRH neurons in the mammalian central nervous system. Our data suggest that alternative splicing may be one of the mechanisms by which heterogeneous populations of GnRH neurons can be generated in the animal brain.Studies of RNA splicing mechanisms suggest that differences in the activities/amounts of general splicing factors or the presence of specialized proteins may participate in the regulation of alternative splicing (25Maniatis T. Science. 1991; 251: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of cis-acting sequences that influence splice site recognition have been identified, which include intron size, exon sequence, alternative branch points, pyrimidine content of 3′ acceptor sites, and secondary structure of the pre-mRNA (26McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 139-181Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The difference in processing the primary proGnRH gene transcript between the Gn11 versus NLT cells and between the GnRH neurons in the caudal hypothalamus versusthose in the olfactory and preoptic areas may reflect the differential capacity of different GnRH neurons to recognize exon 2 in the proGnRH pre-mRNA. In the Gn11 cells and GnRH neurons located in the olfactory area and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, the splicing machinery either recognizes exon 2 in the primary transcript to generate the mature mRNA or ignores it, resulting in the formation of a shorter species of transcript lacking exon 2. Whether the difference in splicing of the primary transcript is due to the presence or absence of specific splicing factors in the Gn11 cellsversus NLT cells or due to the difference in the activities in general splicing factors assembled in the spliceosomes inside the nucleus remains to be determined.Although the shorter transcript found in the Gn11 cells and in GnRH neurons in the forebrain lacks the normal ATG translation initiation codon located in exon 2, examination of exon 3 sequence indicates that another ATG translation initiation codon is present in exon 3. The methionine at position +25 of the proGnRH peptide may act as a translation initiation signal for the remaining 45 amino acids of the GAP. However, the Kozak sequence (16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), which is preserved as a purine (G) located at 3 nucleotides upstream of the ATG in the larger transcript, is not present in the smaller transcript. Whether this splicing variant is translated into a protein in Gn11 cells and the translational efficiency has yet to be determined.Since the NLT cells express higher levels of mature proGnRH mRNA and secrete larger quantities of GnRH, these cells have the advantage over the Gn11 cells for studying the regulation of proGnRH gene expression and GnRH secretion by various factors. Recent studies from this laboratory using the NLT cell line have demonstrated that these cells express type-I receptor for insulin-like growth factor (27Zhen, S., and Radovick, S. (1996) 26th Annual Meeting Neuroscience, November 19, 1996, Washington, D. C., Slide 379.12.Google Scholar) and the receptor for epidermal growth factor (28Zhen S. Su E. Zakaria M. Radovick S. 10th International Congress on Endocrinology, June 12–15, 1996, San Francisco, CA. 1996; (,): 1-346Google Scholar). These findings are interesting since both insulin-like growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor have been shown to regulate GnRH neuronal activitiesin vivo and have been suggested to play an important role in the control of pubertal development (29Hiney J.K. Ojeda S.R. Dees W.L. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 54: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Ma Y.J. Junier M.P. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 657-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, to date, the molecular mechanisms by which these growth factors regulate GnRH neuronal activities remain largely unknown, due to the fact that less than 1500 GnRH neurons are present in the animal brain (4Wray S. Hoffman G.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 252: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Merchanthaler I. Gorcs T. Setalo G. Petrusz P. Flerko B. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 237: 15-29PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the availability of NLT cells should greatly enhance our ability to explore the molecular mechanisms that mediate the regulation of proGnRH gene expression and GnRH secretion. GnRH 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GAP, GnRH-associated peptide; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SV40-Tag, simian virus 40 T antigen; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein-2; RIA, radioimmunoassay; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GAP, GnRH-associated peptide; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SV40-Tag, simian virus 40 T antigen; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein-2; RIA, radioimmunoassay; bp, base pair(s). neurons in the hypothalamus play an essential role in the regulation of mammalian reproduction. These neurons originate from precursor cells in the olfactory placode and migrate to their target sites during embryonic development (1Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 2Wray S. Gant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The most prominent axonal projection of GnRH neurons is to the median eminence, where GnRH is released and transported via the hypothalamic hypophyseal portal vessels to the anterior pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone (3Silverman A.J. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 1283-1304Google Scholar). The regulation of GnRH neuronal activities has been difficult to study, however, due to their scattered distribution and paucity in cell number (3Silverman A.J. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 1283-1304Google Scholar, 4Wray S. Hoffman G.A. J. Comp.

Recently, this laboratory and Mellonet al. (6Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 7Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nichols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler G.B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have generated immortalized GnRH-expressing neuronal cell lines by targeted tumorigenesis. In our laboratory, targeting the expression of the simian virus 40 T antigen (SV40-Tag) to the GnRH neurons with the human GnRH gene 5′-upstream regulatory sequence resulted in the development of an olfactory tumor in one of the transgenic mice (7Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nichols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler G.B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Two GnRH immunoreactive cell lines (Gn11 and NLT) were subsequently derived from this tumor. Characterization of the NLT and Gn11 cells demonstrated that these cells display neuronal morphology and neuron-specific markers, such as microtubule-associated peptide 2 (MAP-2) and Tau protein (8Fischer I. Richter-Landsberg C. Safaei R. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 194: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Mavilia C. Couchie D. Mattei M.G. Nivez M.P. Nunez J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Solution hybridization-RNase protection assays and RT-PCR analysis indicated that these cells express proGnRH mRNA and are able to synthesize and secrete GnRH as demonstrated by RIA. Therefore, these cell lines provide a suitablein vitro model for the study of GnRH neuronal activity and its regulation. Although the NLT and Gn11 cells were derived from the same tumor, RIA measurement of GnRH concentrations demonstrated that the NLT cells secrete about 10 times higher levels of GnRH than the Gn11 cells. In an attempt to understand the molecular basis responsible for generating this difference, we characterized the expression of the proGnRH gene in these cell lines by RT-PCR and solution hybridization-RNase protection assays. In addition, the expression of proGnRH gene expression in the mouse olfactory and preoptic area-hypothalamus was also examined. Our results demonstrate that a splicing variant lacking exon 2 of the proGnRH gene was present in Gn11 cells but not in NLT cells. This same splicing variant was also found in the olfactory and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, but not in the caudal hypothalamus of the mouse brain. This is the first demonstration that alternative splicing of the primary proGnRH gene transcript occurs in the immortalized GnRH-expressing neuronal cell lines and in the animal forebrain. DISCUSSIONOur data indicate that the NLT and Gn11 cells are neuronal in phenotype, express proGnRH mRNA, and secrete GnRH into the medium. Since one major difficulty in the study of GnRH neuronal activities is their low abundance and scattered distribution, these cell lines provide a convenient in vitro model for the study of GnRH secretion and regulation of gene expression. Using the Gn11 and NLT cell lines as a model, we found that although both cell lines were derived from a same tumor in a transgenic mice, they display heterogeneity in the secretion of GnRH and expression of proGnRH gene. Our data provide evidence that the lower GnRH secreting capacity found in the Gn11 cells is due, in part, to the prevalence of a splicing variant lacking exon 2 which encodes the GnRH decapeptide. Moreover, we extended this finding to the animal forebrain by demonstrating that this splicing variant is also expressed in the olfactory and preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus, although the prevalent form of transcripts in these areas is the mature proGnRH mRNA. Therefore, these results suggest that alternative splicing of the primary transcript may contribute to the regulation of proGnRH gene expression in the animal forebrain.Various lines of evidence indicate that proGnRH gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific pattern. In various peripheral tissues, including the placenta, mammary gland, testes, and ovary (12Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Nakayama Y. Yamada M. Cutler G.B. Weintraub B.D. Mol.

Whether the difference in splicing of the primary transcript is due to the presence or absence of specific splicing factors in the Gn11 cellsversus NLT cells or due to the difference in the activities in general splicing factors assembled in the spliceosomes inside the nucleus remains to be determined. Although the shorter transcript found in the Gn11 cells and in GnRH neurons in the forebrain lacks the normal ATG translation initiation codon located in exon 2, examination of exon 3 sequence indicates that another ATG translation initiation codon is present in exon 3. The methionine at position +25 of the proGnRH peptide may act as a translation initiation signal for the remaining 45 amino acids of the GAP. However, the Kozak sequence (16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar), which is preserved as a purine (G) located at 3 nucleotides upstream of the ATG in the larger transcript, is not present in the smaller transcript. Whether this splicing variant is translated into a protein in Gn11 cells and the translational efficiency has yet to be determined. Since the NLT cells express higher levels of mature proGnRH mRNA and secrete larger quantities of GnRH, these cells have the advantage over the Gn11 cells for studying the regulation of proGnRH gene expression and GnRH secretion by various factors. Recent studies from this laboratory using the NLT cell line have demonstrated that these cells express type-I receptor for insulin-like growth factor (27Zhen, S., and Radovick, S. (1996) 26th Annual Meeting Neuroscience, November 19, 1996, Washington, D. C., Slide 379.12.Google Scholar) and the receptor for epidermal growth factor (28Zhen S. Su E. Zakaria M. Radovick S. 10th International Congress on Endocrinology, June 12–15, 1996, San Francisco, CA. 1996; (,): 1-346Google Scholar). These findings are interesting since both insulin-like growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor have been shown to regulate GnRH neuronal activitiesin vivo and have been suggested to play an important role in the control of pubertal development (29Hiney J.K. Ojeda S.R. Dees W.L. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 54: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Ma Y.J. Junier M.P. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 657-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, to date, the molecular mechanisms by which these growth factors regulate GnRH neuronal activities remain largely unknown, due to the fact that less than 1500 GnRH neurons are present in the animal brain (4Wray S. Hoffman G.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1986; 252: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Merchanthaler I. Gorcs T. Setalo G. Petrusz P. Flerko B. Cell Tissue Res. 1984; 237: 15-29PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the availability of NLT cells should greatly enhance our ability to explore the molecular mechanisms that mediate the regulation of proGnRH gene expression and GnRH secretion.

Since polyamines have been shown to enhance protein kinase CK2 activity in vitro, ODC was overexpressed to examine the role of polyamines in CK2 regulationin vivo. Infection of Balb/MK cells with an ODC retrovirus to elevate ODC and polyamine levels increased overall protein phosphorylation as well as CK2 protein levels and enzyme activity in mimosine- or nocodazole- arrested cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and enzyme analyses of subcellular fractions from ODC-overexpressing cells demonstrated translocation of CK2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with no apparent loss of cytoplasmic CK2 activity, suggesting polyamine activation of the remaining cytoplasmic enzyme. Similarly,K6/ODC transgenic mice exhibited higher ODC and CK2 enzyme activities than their normal littermates. ODC-immunostained cells in the transgenic skin also stained intensely for CK2 protein. Primary cultures of K6/ODC keratinocytes also exhibited increased ODC and CK2 enzyme activities compared with those from normal littermates. However, the addition of difluoromethylornithine, a specific ODC inhibitor, to the transgenic keratinocytes reduced both intracellular polyamine levels and CK2 enzyme activity. These results suggest that polyamines regulate the CK2 enzyme by affecting its cellular distribution as well as its enzyme activity and levels.

These results suggest that polyamines regulate the CK2 enzyme by affecting its cellular distribution as well as its enzyme activity and levels. Polyamines are cellular cations essential for growth and differentiation (1Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 2Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). Their depletion results in deleterious biological effects, including growth inhibition and alteration of differentiation (3Metcalf B.W. Bey P. Danz C. Jung M.J. Casara P. Ververt J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 2551-2553Crossref Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 4Coward J.K. Pegg A.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1987; 26: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). While a great deal of evidence indicates that polyamines are involved in the regulation of proliferative events, their precise role(s) in biological processes remain poorly characterized. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; CDAP, N-cyclohexyl-1,3-propanediamine; EMEM, Eagle's minimum essential medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DFMO, difluoromethylornithine; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. is the first and regulatory enzyme in the biosynthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. ODC expression in normal tissue is extremely low, yet highly inducible. In tumors, however, constitutively high levels of ODC enzyme activity, protein, and mRNA are observed (5O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2644-2653PubMed Google Scholar, 6Astrup E.G. Boutwell R.K. Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1982; 3: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Gilmour S.K. Aglow E.

Whereas overexpression of ODC transforms NIH3T3 cells (10Moshier J. Dosescu J. Skunca M. Luk G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2618-2622PubMed Google Scholar, 11Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Anderson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 12Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2313-2316PubMed Google Scholar), ODC overexpression does not transform normal diploid keratinocytes and fibroblasts (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar). However, ODC overexpression cooperates with other genetic lesions such as activated c-Ha-ras to enhance tumor development in keratinocyte cell lines (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms by which cells control metabolic and regulatory activities, especially in response to extracellular signals. Furthermore, it has become apparent that tumor progression involves both genetic and epigenetic disruptions in these pathways (14Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 249-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 15Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). A protein kinase that has been reported to be activated by polyamines in vitro is the highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase CK2 (16Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7011-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A functional relationship between polyamines and CK2 may be inferred since polyamine biosynthesis and CK2 activity are both induced concurrently with stimulation of cell growth and proliferation (19Filhol O. Loue-Mackenbach P. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Feige J.J. Madani C. Chambaz E.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase found in all mammalian tissues, both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (21Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1993; 59 (, and references therein): 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 22Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The enzyme exists as a heterotetramer composed of two and sometimes three subunits,i.e. as α and α′ subunits of 38–44 kDa and a β subunit of 24–28 kDa, which associate to form the native α2β2, α′αβ2, or α′2β2 structures. The α and α′ subunits bear the catalytic site of the enzyme, while the β subunit is thought to be regulatory since it confers optimal activity to the holoenzyme and influences substrate specificity. The identification of a large number of proteins that can be phosphorylated by CK2 supports the suggestion of a role for CK2 in signal transduction (23Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are involved in replication and transcription, and the phosphorylation of several of these has been demonstrated to cause a significant change in their biochemical activity (23Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing CK2α in lymphocytes exhibit increased susceptibility to lymphomas, and coexpression with a c-myctransgene results in neonatal leukemia (24Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in CK2 activity in transformed and proliferating tissues (25Munstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Lu Y.P. Schneider H.R. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the apparent oncogenic activity of CK2α suggest the involvement of CK2 in both normal and unregulated cell proliferation. The regulation of CK2 is still poorly understood. It does not appear to be regulated by any previously described second messengers. Increased kinase activity has been observed following stimulation by growth factors in selected cell types (26Ackerman P. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11958-11965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sommercorn J. Mulligan J.A. Lozeman F.J. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8834-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Additional studies have implicated growth factors in the translocation of CK2 to the nucleus (28Filhol O. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9928-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Ahmed K. Yenice S. Davis A. Goueli S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4426-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and more recently, fibroblast growth factor-2 has been reported to directly interact with CK2 and to stimulate its activity (30Bonnet H. Filhol O. Truchet I. Brethenou P. Cochet C. Amalric F. Bouche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24781-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CK2 involvement in mitogenic signaling is supported by immunofluorescence microscopy studies that have demonstrated its translocation into the nucleus following mitogenic stimulation (31Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and antibodies raised against CK2β into the cytoplasm of cells at the time of mitogenic stimulation resulted in cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 and G1/S transition phases, further demonstrating the requirement for CK2β in proliferation (32Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6986-6991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Pepperkok R. Lorenz P. Jakobi R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vitro, CK2 enzyme activity has been demonstrated to be stimulated by spermidine and, more notably, spermine (17Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent evidence strongly suggests that these polyamines increase CK2 activity through allosteric regulation. For example, it has been reported that purified CK2 adopts a ring-like structure when spermine is added (34Valero E. De Bonis S. Filhol O. Wade R.H. Langowski J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8345-8352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); further studies revealed this structure to be the most active polymeric conformation of CK2. Furthermore, a spermine-binding domain has been identified in the N-terminal region of the regulatory β subunit of CK2 (35Leroy D. Schmid N. Behr J.-P. Filhol O. Pares S. Garin J. Bourgarit J.- J. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17400-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previous reports demonstrated in separate studies that increased levels of polyamines (5O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2644-2653PubMed Google Scholar, 6Astrup E.G. Boutwell R.K. Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1982; 3: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Gilmour S.K. Aglow E. O'Brien T.G.

Megosh L.C. Palmieri M. O'Brien T.G. Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1991; 12: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and CK2 (25Munstermann U. Fritz G. Seitz G. Lu Y.P. Schneider H.R.

Med. 1995; 1: 659-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) occur in solid tumors and in normal cells exhibiting high mitotic activity, although no connection between ODC and CK2 was inferred. While intriguing, studies to date have not addressed whether polyamines affect CK2 activity in vivo. We have taken two approaches to determine if increased intracellular levels of polyamines contribute to tumor development through alteration of CK2 activity. One method utilizes a replication-defective retroviral vector to overexpress murine ODC in mouse keratinocytes (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar). The second approach involves theK6/ODC transgenic mouse, in which ODC expression is targeted to keratinocytes in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle (38Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler A.P. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). These tools have enabled us to increase the intracellular levels of polyamines and thus characterize any differences in CK2 activity and levels. The results of these studies suggest that polyamines regulate CK2 in vivo through enzyme activation as well as by nuclear translocation. Balb/MK cells grown to 40% confluence in flasks (with low calcium EMEM (Whittaker Bioproducts, Inc.) supplemented with 0.05 mmcalcium, 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum, and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF)) were refed and treated 48 h later with varying concentrations of CDAP in conditioned medium for 24 h. The cells were then harvested for CK2 assays. Balb/MK cells were grown to 50% confluence and infected with the control pLXSN virus or the ODC pLOSN virus (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar) for 6 h with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. The cells were then washed with PBS and refed with EMEM containing 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum and 5 ng/ml EGF. Selection with G418 (120 μg/ml) was begun 2 days after infection, and selected cells were maintained in 60 μg/ml G418 thereafter. Cells were washed with PBS and presynchronized at G0 by refeeding with EMEM containing 2% dialyzed serum and no EGF. Seventy-two hours later, cells were refed with EMEM containing 8% Chelex-treated serum, 5 ng/ml EGF, and either 0.2 mm mimosine (39Alexandro M.G. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3928-3932PubMed Google Scholar) or 260 nm nocodazole. The mimosine- and nocodazole-treated cells were harvested for CK2 assays 20 h later. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the population of cells used in these experiments was predominantly in G1for mimosine-arrested cells and at the G2/M border for nocodazole-arrested cells. For metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, cells were equilibrated in low calcium and phosphate-free EMEM containing either 0.2 mm mimosine or 260 nm nocodazole for 30 min. Cells were then incubated in the same medium containing 0.02 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h prior to harvest. Virally infected cells were grown on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 3% paraformaldehyde and PBS, blocked with normal goat serum, and reacted with polyclonal anti-CK2 antibody (1:1000 dilution) overnight. Bound antibodies were detected with a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. For total soluble cell lysates, cells were collected by low speed centrifugation in PBS and lysed in twice the packed cell volume of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the phosphatase inhibitor NaF at 1 mm. The cells were mechanically lysed by 30 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer, and the supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The enzyme activities from these lysates are designated as total soluble CK2 activity. ODC activity and HPLC analyses of polyamine content were performed as described previously (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar, 38Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler A.P. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue extracts were prepared from skins of normal mice and their transgenic littermates by plunging excised skins into 55 °C water for 20 s to allow for separation of the epidermis and dermis, which were then homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Polyamine levels were determined by HPLC analysis of the dansylated products after overnight extraction in 0.2n perchloric acid. Extract preparation for subcellular fractionation was done essentially as described (31Lorenz P. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2733-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1 mm NaF was used in place of sodium orthovanadate. In addition, the nuclear and cytosolic pelleted fractions were homogenized twice and resuspended in their respective buffers and are designated as nuclear pellet and microsomal fractions, respectively. Completeness of cell breakage and purity of isolated nuclei were verified by light-phase microscopy. Kinase reactions were carried out in a total volume of 30 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 1 mm peptide substrate RRRDDDSDDD (Research Genetics; purity > 96%) (40Grankowski N. Boldyreff B. Issinger O.-G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity = 2500 cpm/pmol). The addition of 60 mm β-glycerophosphate to inhibit phosphatase activity (41Chester N. Yu I.J. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7501-7514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) increased phosphate incorporation, but did not change the relative amounts of enzyme activity. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5–1 μg of protein, incubated at 34 °C for 10 min, and stopped by spotting 15 μl of the assay mixture onto Whatman P-81 cation-exchange paper discs. Standard kinetic analyses were performed to ensure that phosphate incorporation was linear under these conditions. The discs were washed five times with 75 mm phosphoric acid and twice with 95% ethanol and air-dried. The incorporated phosphate was quantitated using a Packard 1900 TR liquid scintillation counter. The radioisotope incorporation was corrected for phosphorylation of endogenous proteins by assaying reaction mixtures in the absence of peptide substrate. Assays were carried out in triplicate. Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with PBS three times and lysed in 1 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.25% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, and 1 mm NaF) containing the protease inhibitors at the concentrations listed above. The dishes were then rocked at 4 °C for 10 min, followed by passage of the cell lysate through a 21-gauge needle several times to shear the DNA. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts of cellular protein from the supernatants were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Blots were stained briefly in Ponceau S (Sigma) to verify loading equality, and Western blotting was performed using monoclonal antibody 1AD9 (2 μg/ml) to detect CK2α, monoclonal antibody 6D5 (0.1 μg/ml) to detect CK2β, or polyclonal anti-ODC antibody (1:20,000 dilution). The CK2 monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Olaf-Georg Issinger (Odense Universitet, Odense, Denmark), and the polyclonal ODC antibody was generously provided by Dr. Oili Hietala (University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland). The proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence detection and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Tissues were fixed in Fekete's solution (60% ethanol, 3.2% formaldehyde, and 0.75 m acetic acid) overnight and embedded in paraffin. For immunolocalization of ODC and CK2, skin sections were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal anti-ODC antibody or a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal CK2 antisera (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Dahmus, University of California), and specific staining was detected using the instructions supplied in the Elite ABC Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Primary cultures of epidermal cells were isolated from 2–3-day-old K6/ODC transgenic and normal littermate mice by a trypsin flotation procedure (42Yuspa S.H. Harris C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 86: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 43Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Prior to keratinocyte preparation, newborn mice heterozygous for the K6/ODCtransgene were distinguished from their normal littermates by polymerase chain reaction genotyping of tail DNA using the primers previously described (38Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler A.P. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated epidermal cells were cultured in low calcium EMEM supplemented with 0.05 mm calcium, 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum, and 5 ng/ml EGF either in the presence or absence of the ODC inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (0.2 mm). Cells were harvested 3 days after the last refeeding. It has been previously reported that spermidine and spermine can increase CK2 activity in vitro (17Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To confirm that the activation of CK2 by polyamines does occur in vivo, Balb/MK epidermal cells were incubated in the presence of the spermine synthase inhibitor CDAP to increase the intracellular spermidine content (44Huber M. Poulin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 934-943PubMed Google Scholar). CK2 enzyme assays were performed after the polyamines had returned to basal levels, when the polyamine levels were most different between the treated and control cells. Fig. 1 demonstrates the inverse correlation between CDAP concentration and intracellular spermine levels, with a concomitant increase in spermidine levels, thus confirming what has been found in other cell types (44Huber M. Poulin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 934-943PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CK2 activity parallels spermidine concentration. A 3-fold increase in intracellular spermidine resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in total soluble CK2 activity. We utilized a replication-defective retroviral vector capable of overexpressing a truncated isoform of ODC in epidermal cells (13Clifford A. Morgan D. Yuspa S.H. Soler A.P. Gilmour S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1680-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas full-length ODC protein typically has a half-life of 15–20 min within the cell, the truncated form is considerably more stable while still retaining full enzyme activity (45Ghoda L. van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, high intracellular levels of ODC and polyamines can be achieved without the use of chemical inhibitors, thereby enabling examination of polyamine-mediated CK2 activation as observed in vitro, but using a more physiologically relevant system. Since ODC induction is associated with cellular proliferation, the effects of ODC overexpression were studied in cells blocked at the G1/S and G2/M borders with mimosine and nocodazole, respectively. This was done to prevent any enhanced growth potential acquired by the ODC-infected cells, thus assuring that the cell populations to be compared were identical with respect to cell cycle stage. After synchronizing the cells with either mimosine or nocodazole, they were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for an additional 3 h while still in the presence of the inhibitors. Proteins were extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Fig.2). In general, ODC-overexpressing cells demonstrated increased phosphorylation of many proteins; enhanced phosphorylation was especially evident for proteins with approximate molecular masses of 40, 50, and 70 kDa for the mimosine-arrested cells and 16, 33, and 50 kDa for the nocodazole-arrested cells. Probing with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody failed to show any differences in phosphotyrosine content between the control- and ODC-infected mimosine-arrested cells (data not shown). Therefore, the increase in phosphorylation appeared to be due to predominantly serine/threonine phosphorylations. The immunoblot was then probed with anti-ODC, anti-CK2α, and anti-CK2β antibodies (Fig. 3). Fig. 3(A and B) shows that CK2 α and β subunit proteins are increased in the ODC-infected cells. Quantitation by densitometric scanning revealed a 4-fold increase in both subunits in the mimosine-arrested cells and a 2-fold difference in the nocodazole-arrested cells. Only the ODC-infected cells expressed the truncated ODC protein, while the expression of endogenous ODC was below the level of detection in both control- and ODC-infected cells (Fig.3 C).Figure 3Immunoblot analysis of CK2 in control- and ODC-infected Balb/MK total cell lysates. The blot used for PhosphorImager analysis in Fig. 2 was analyzed for CK2α (A), CK2β (B), and ODC (C) protein levels in mimosine-arrested (G1/S) and nocodazole-arrested (G2/M) cells. pLXSN denotes the control-infected cells, and pLOSN denotes the ODC-overexpressing infected cells. The arrow in A denotes CK2α protein. The protein signal detected at 50 kDa was recognized by both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to CK2α and CK2β in all extracts studied to date. The absence of this band in nocodazole-arrested cells is due to a lower exposure time. No analysis of ODC overexpression was studied in the nocodazole-arrested cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of ODC overexpression on polyamine levels and total soluble CK2 activity in the mimosine-arrested cells is shown in TableI. Putrescine levels in the mimosine-arrested cells increased >150-fold, while spermidine and spermine levels increased only 2.2- and 0.75-fold, respectively. Similar values were obtained for the nocodazole-arrested cells. However, despite a 4-fold increase in immunodetectable CK2α and CK2β from total cell lysate of the mimosine-arrested cells and a 2-fold increase in the nocodazole-arrested cells, only a 1.5-fold increase in total soluble CK2 enzyme activity was observed for both.Table IPolyamine content and CK2 enzyme activity in mimosine- and nocodazole-arrested control- and ODC-infected cellsMimosine-arrested cellsIncreasepLXSN1-apLXSN denotes the control-infected cells.pLOSN1-bpLOSN denotes the ODC-infected cells.-foldPutrescine1-cPolyamines are expressed as pmol/μg of DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1979028465,"Peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) is a gut hormone present in endocrine cells in the lower intestine that can be released by the presence of luminal free fatty acids (FFAs). The biological action of this peptide includes inhibition of gut motility and gastrointestinal and pancreatic secretions. Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) binds FFA and may be involved in their cytosolic trafficking. Quantitative in situ hybridization on heterogeneous populations of small intestinal somatic cell hybrids selected for endogenous I-FABP expression (hBRIE 380i cells) demonstrated a 5-fold increase in I-FABP transcripts in response to PYY (within 6 h) that was confined to clusters of differentiated cells, whereas ribonuclease protection assays performed on heterogeneous populations of these cells showed no significant differences. High affinity PYY receptors, with an IC50 of 5–50 pm, were identified in both differentiated and nondifferentiated cell populations, as determined by competitive binding assays and autoradiography. In situ hybridization of rat ileal tissue also revealed differing patterns of mRNA expression for liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) and I-FABP. Only I-FABP mRNA was detected in the villus tips. This localization correlated with the expression pattern of I-FABP mRNA in the hBRIE 380i cells where changes in transcripts were observed only in differentiated cells that did not incorporate bromodeoxyuridine. The sustained expression of I-FABP transcripts in the villar tips suggests (unlike L-FABP) that older terminally differentiated cell populations of the mucosa can still be PYY responsive. These studies demonstrate that physiological concentrations of PYY can regulate I-FABP and place this peptide in a key position as part of a feedback system that determines the processing of cytosolic FFA in the enterocyte. In addition, these studies suggest a mechanism whereby luminal agents can modulate expression of proteins in terminally differentiated cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa.

PYY has greater than 70% sequence identity with NPY and shares a common structural motif consisting of two antiparallel helices, an amino-terminal polyproline helix, and a long amphipathic α helix connected by a β turn (1MacKerell Jr., A.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1988; 2: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PYY-secreting cells occur mainly in the distal small intestine and the large intestine, locations where dietary fatty acids can act as potent stimulants of PYY release into the circulation. PYY-induced effects on the gastrointestinal tract can be reproduced by infusions of the peptide at concentrations less than postprandial blood concentrations (2Bilchik A.J. Hines O.J. Adrian T.E.

Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 1386-1389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Specific receptors for NPY/PYY have been characterized in distinct gastrointestinal tissue, such as chief cells (4Singh G. Singh L. Raufman J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G756-G762PubMed Google Scholar), and mucosa of the small and large intestine (5Laburthe M. Chenut B. Rouyer-Fessard C. Tatemoto K. Couvineau A. Servin A. Amiranoff B. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Specific PYY receptors have also been reported in brain tissue (6Sheikh S.P. Sheikh M.I. Schwartz T.W. Am. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6648-6654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such locations make it possible for PYY to act both as an endocrine and a paracrine agent. Many of the reported effects of PYY on the gut, such as the inhibition of intestinal secretion, motility, and gastric acid secretion, occur as interdigestive events coordinated with release of PYY after a meal. We and others have demonstrated that luminal oleic acid induces the release of PYY in the dog (11Aponte G.W. Fink A.S. Meyer J.H. Tatemoto K. Taylor I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G745-G750PubMed Google Scholar), rat (12Aponte G.W. Park K. Hess R. Garcia R. Taylor I.L. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1949-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and in isolated primary cultured PYY cells from the canine mucosa (13Aponte G.W. Taylor I.L. Soll A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G829-G836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that NPY acts centrally to initiate feeding (14Stanley B.G. Leibowitz S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3940-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), PYY seems to modify digestive processes to ensure efficient utilization of ingested food. PYY acts to slow gastric emptying and intestinal transit, changes that increase the efficiency of nutrient digestion and absorption. In the central nervous system, PYY may act through specific receptors in the dorsal vagal complex to inhibit vagal tone (15Pappas T.N. Debas H.T. Taylor I.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a result, PYY establishes a negative feedback loop that could act centrally in the brain to inhibit neurally mediated pancreatic exocrine secretion. This negative feedback may serve as part of an “ileal brake” in response to excess dietary triglyceride. For example, triglyceride hydrolysis resulting in FFAs in the distal intestine would induce PYY secretion whenever the rate of triglyceride hydrolysis exceeded the rate of fatty acid absorption. This induction of PYY secretion would then inhibit intestinal motility, causing an increase in FFA absorption and a decrease in luminal FFAs. Therefore PYY, like other gut-regulatory peptides such as cholecystokinin and somatostatin, can act as both a hormone and a neuromodulator. Because PYY secretion can occur in direct response to luminal long-chain FFAs, we chose to examine the possibility that this peptide may act on the expression of an intestinal cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein, the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP). Fatty acid binding-proteins (FABPs) are 14–15-kDa cytosolic proteins that bind fatty acids with affinities in the nanomolar range (16Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11291-11300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An extensive number of cytosolic binding proteins have been grouped into the FABP gene family, including liver fatty acid-binding protein L-FABP (found in the liver and intestine) (17Ockner R.K. Manning J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), I-FABP (found only in the intestine) (17Ockner R.K. Manning J.A. J. Clin.

Ockner R.K. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3356-3363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological role of intestinal FABP is still largely speculative despite extensive knowledge about its binding properties, amino acid sequence, protein structure (26Alpers D.H. Strauss A.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and localization of genetic elements that regulate regional and cell-specific patterns of expression within the gut epithelium (30Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I-FABP is a likely regulator of intracellular fatty acid levels because of its involvement in the trafficking and/or metabolism of FFAs in the intestinal epithelia (31Hsu K.T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). I-FABP gene expression could, therefore, be expected to be regulated by fatty acids and hormonal factors involved in fatty acid assimilation and metabolism. Because PYY is secreted in direct response to FFA PYY regulation of I-FABP gene expression could provide a mechanism of feedback regulation for the synthesis of I-FABP in response to the presence of luminal FFA. From a broader perspective, evidence of such a mechanism would expand the potential of other gut receptosecretory cells as “transducers” or chemical receptors. To investigate how PYY may act to regulate I-FABP expression, we have used the Berkeley Rat Intestinal Epithelial hybrid cells (hBRIE 380i cells) as a model. The generation and characterization of these small intestinally derived cell lines have been described previously (32Aponte G.W. Keddie A. Halldén G. Hess R. Link P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These cells retain many characteristics of the enterocyte in situ such as cell polarity, apical microvilli, tight junctions, and others. Similar to the intestinal mucosa, these cells also exhibit a replicating cell population and a nonreplicating population. The nonreplicating cells can further be divided into nondifferentiated and differentiated phenotypes. The differentiated cells endogenously express I-FABP (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar) and likely contain its entire genome. In the present study, we report that these cells also express PYY receptors. In light of previous observations that oleate is a major ligand for I-FABP and that luminal oleate also directly induces secretion of PYY, we present data to support the hypothesis that PYY may be part of a feedback regulation system for FFA processing in the intestine. Subclones of the rat intestinal hybrid cell line (hBRIE 380 cells) that express I-FABP, hBRIE 380i cells (32Aponte G.W. Keddie A. Halldén G. Hess R. Link P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar), were used in the present study. The hBRIE 380i cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown in multiwell dishes or T25 flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) and kept in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were grown on soft collagen type I gels, prepared from rat tails as described previously (34Richards J. Larson L. Yang J. Guzman R. Tomooka Y. Osborn R. Imagawa W. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1983; 8: 31-36Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or grown directly on tissue culture-treated plastic. Cells were seeded at high densities, 1 × 106cells/T25 and 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes, unless otherwise indicated. Cells grown on tissue culture-treated plastic were harvested by trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C. Cells grown on collagen gels were harvested by treatment with 0.1% collagenase type I (Sigma) at 37 °C. To study the regulation of expression of I-FABP, hBRIE 380i cells were grown on the collagen gels to confluency in the presence of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% BCS. Experimental conditions were initiated on day 7 of confluency (unless otherwise indicated) by replacing the culture medium with limiting medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 0.1% BCS and 4 μg/ml transferrin) with or without the factors to be tested, or with regular 10% BCS medium, as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). During the experimental conditions, one-half of the medium was replaced every day. Test factors added to the cells were insulin (Sigma) at 10 nm, human PYY (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA) at 10 nm to 1 μm, somatostatin-28 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) at 100 nm, and glucagon-29 (Bachem) at 100 nm. Antisera were generated in guinea pigs using full-length recombinant I-FABP corresponding to the previously published amino acid sequence 1–132 (26Alpers D.H. Strauss A.W. Ockner R.K. Bass N.M. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), with an extension of two amino acids (Gly-Ser) at the amino-terminal. A glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was prepared by cloning of the I-FABP cDNA, generated by amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA isolated from rat intestinal epithelial cells, into a pGEX-2T expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The fusion protein was isolated from bacterial lysates by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, eluted, and cleaved by the addition of thrombin (2980 units/mg) (Sigma) according to methods of the manufacturer. Isolated I-FABP was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide (Sigma) according to the procedure described previously (12Aponte G.W. Park K. Hess R. Garcia R. Taylor I.L. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1949-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Three guinea pigs were injected subcutaneously with the protein conjugate, corresponding to 40 μg of protein per injection by methods described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). The response to immunization in each animal was determined by immunoblotting. A cytosolic preparation of rat intestinal epithelial cells was used as a reference for I-FABP immunoreactivity. Soluble fractions of rat liver, glutathione S-transferase-I-FABP, and glutathione S-transferase-expressing Escherichia coli BL 21 were prepared and used for the screening to determine antibody specificity. Animals that responded with high titers were anesthetized and bled from the heart usually three times (5 ml) 10 days apart. Cells were lysed in the culture flasks by the addition of 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in TETN 250 (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5), 1 ml/T25 flask, containing 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 3 min. Total soluble protein was determined according to the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211887) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of cytosolic protein were separated using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), according to standard methods (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205506) Google Scholar,37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). Blotting and incubation with a polyclonal guinea pig antibody against rat I-FABP (gp 5111) antisera were as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). A peroxidase coupled goat-anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA) was used as second antibody and detected by utilizing the enhanced chemiluminescence system (DuPont NEN). For the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction, dilutions of the cytosolic protein fractions were used to determine that the amount of protein applied to the gel was in the linear range of the reaction. Films from the immunoblotting experiments were scanned using a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and quantified as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the cells by a method described previously (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). Antisense and sense RNA probes for rat I-FABP, L-FABP, and β-actin were prepared for RPAs and for in situ hybridization. Plasmids containing rat cDNAs for I-FABP (pCRII-I-FABP, generated from reverse-transcribed mRNA isolated from rat small intestine), L-FABP (pGLF-1) (a gift from Dr. J. I. Gordon, Washington University School of Medicine), and a plasmid containing the cDNA for rat β-actin (a gift from Dr. S. H. Mellon, University of California, San Francisco, CA) were used to synthesize antisense and sense probes for the hybridization reactions. The plasmids were linearized and then transcribed by T7 and SP6 polymerases using the Ambion Maxiscript in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) or [α-33P]UTP (3000i/mmol) (DuPont NEN) as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription mixtures were separated on 5% polyacrylamide/8m urea gels, and the bands corresponding to labeled full-length transcripts were isolated. The size of the labeled RNA transcripts were as follows: I-FABP antisense, 474 nt; I-FABP sense, 448 nt; L-FABP antisense, 368 nt; L-FABP sense 378 nt; and β-actin antisense, 250 nt. After hybridization of the probes to their respective mRNAs followed by RNase treatment, the protected fragments corresponded to 414 nt for I-FABP antisense, 333 nt for L-FABP antisense, and 150 nt for β-actin antisense. In a typical protection assay, the labeled RNA probes for I-FABP and β-actin and total RNA (5–20 μg/sample) were mixed and incubated according to the method described for the Ambion RPA procedure. The protected fragments were separated on 5% polyacrylamide/8m urea gels and detected by autoradiography as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). For quantitative studies, the amount of RNA used in each reaction was predetermined to be in the linear range of the assay by adding increasing amounts of sample RNA to the reaction mixture. Autoradiograms from the RPAs were scanned using a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad) and quantified as described previously (33Halldén G. Holehouse E.L. Dong X. Aponte G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G730-G743PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions and materials were treated with 0.1% (v/v) diethylpyrocarbonate (Sigma) before use in the mRNA distribution studies. Tissue samples from the lower duodenum-upper ileum (50 cm from the pylorus) of the rat small intestine was prepared as described previously (12Aponte G.W. Park K. Hess R. Garcia R. Taylor I.L. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1949-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The intestinal tissue segments (3–6 cm) were placed in fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4) for 3 h at 4 °C. During fixation, the tissue pieces were further cut in 2-mm sections in the horizontal direction (circular sections) to prepare for embedding. After fixation, the tissue sections were rinsed and immediately immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 16–22 h at 4 °C. The sucrose-equilibrated sections were transferred to molds containing the optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT; Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN) and frozen on dry ice. Embedded frozen tissue was sectioned, 10 μm/section, at −20 °C using a cryostat and mounted on RNase-free glass slides, either the Probe On Plus slides (Fisher, Santa Clara, CA) or slides subbed in gelatin (300 Bloom; Sigma) and poly-l-lysine (M r >300,000; Sigma). Slides with mounted sections (3–4 sections/slide) were then stored at −80 °C until used. Culture flasks containing cells grown on soft collagen gels were rinsed with PBS, placed on ice, and fixed for 3 h at 4 °C by the addition of 5 ml fixative per T25 flask. The cell layers (cells fixed to the collagen gel) were removed, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, placed in 30% sucrose in PBS, and equilibrated for 16–22 h at 4 °C. The equilibrated cell layers were cut in 2–3-cm2 pieces that were rolled and transferred to molds containing the OCT compound for frozen embedding. Cryostat sectioning and mounting was as described above for the intestinal sections. In situ hybridization was performed following a procedure according to Hockfield et al. (39Hockfield, S., Evans, C., Carlson, S., Levitt, P., Pintar, J., Silberstein, L., Molecular Probes of the Nervous System. Selected Methods for Antibodies and Nucleic Acid Probes, 1993, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All chemicals were RNase-free (from Sigma unless otherwise stated), and solutions and materials were treated with 0.1% (v/v) diethylpyrocarbonate before use. In brief, slides with frozen sections were placed in fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4) for 5 min and rinsed in PBS two times for 2 min each; a solution of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis. IL), 1 μg/ml, in 50 mm EDTA and 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, was applied to each section (25–50 μl/section) for 5 min at 24 °C. The slides were washed in water for 2 min, in 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 8.0, for 2 min, and placed in 0.1 m triethylamine containing 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride for 10 min, followed by a 2-min wash in 2 × SSC. Sections were dehydrated by 2-min washes with graded concentrations of ethanol in water and air dried. Slides were prehybridized at 45 °C for 2 h in a buffer consisting of 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% (w/v) sheared DNA, 0.5% (w/v) yeast total RNA, and 0.005% (w/v) yeast tRNA (Boehringer Mannheim), prepared by preheating at 85 °C for 5 min and diluted 1:1 with deionized formamide. The probes were denatured at 85 °C for 5 min and diluted in hybridization buffer consisting of 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's reagent, 0.01% (w/v) sheared DNA, 0.05% (w/v) yeast total RNA, 0.005% (w/v) yeast tRNA, and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, diluted 1:1 with deionized formamide. The sections were hybridized with their respective probes (25–50 μl/section) for 16–20 h at 45 °C. Separate sections on each slide were incubated with the I-FABP antisense and sense probes or the L-FABP antisense and sense probes. The rat β-actin antisense probe was hybridized to at least one section on every slide as a control. Slides were washed in 2 × SSC for 2 × 10 min at 24 °C, and a solution of RNase A type IIIA at 100 μg/ml in RNase buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) was applied to each section and incubated at 24 °C for 30 min. The RNase solution was removed, and slides were further incubated in RNase buffer for 30 min in 2 × SSC for 1 h and in 0.2× SSC for 1.5 h at 45 °C. The sections were dehydrated by washing 2 min each in graded concentrations of ethanol and xylenes. Slides were dipped in nuclear emulsion NTB2 (Kodak, Rochester, NY) diluted 1:1 at 45 °C and developed after different exposure times (2–3 weeks later). For quantitative purposes, various concentrations of probes were hybridized to the sections, and slides that were in the linear range of the hybridization reaction were analyzed. Human PYY (American Peptide Co.) was iodinated using the chloramine-T method as described previously (13Aponte G.W. Taylor I.L. Soll A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G829-G836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iodination mixture was separated on a Sephadex G-10 column (0.8 × 8 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the PYY-containing peak was further purified on a Sephadex G-50 column (0.9 × 110 cm) (Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were grown either on the soft collagen gels or on tissue culture-treated plastic, harvested by collagenase treatment (see section above) or by scraping the flasks, respectively. A crude cell membrane fraction was prepared by hypotonic lysis in 5 mmHEPES (Sigma), pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by homogenization using a loose-fitting glass pestle. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and pellets were washed with PBS and stored at −80 °C until used. The radioreceptor assay was performed using methods described previously (40Williams J.A. Gryson K.A. McChesney D.J. Peptides. 1986; 7: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with some m"
https://openalex.org/W2059614661,"Hydroxy fatty acids from plant cutin were shown previously to induce the expression of the cutinase gene via a palindromic sequence located at −159 base pairs of the cutinase gene in Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi (Nectria hematococca mating type VI). Of the two overlapping palindromes in this sequence, palindrome 2 was found to be essential for the inducibility of cutinase by hydroxy fatty acids. Screening of a phage expression library with the concatenated palindrome 2 as probe detected a distinct cDNA clone encoding a polypeptide designated cutinase transcription factor 1α (CTF1α) with a calculated molecular weight of 101,109. This protein contains a Cys6Zn2binuclear cluster motif sharing homology to the Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domains of transcription factors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,S. carlsbergensis, Kluyveromyces lactis,Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans, and A. flavus. CTF1α, expressed in Escherichia coli,showed specific binding to the palindrome 2 DNA fragment but not to palindrome 1 or mutant palindrome 2 DNA fragments, suggesting specific binding of CTF1α to palindrome 2. When CTF1α was expressed as a fusion protein with the nuclear localization sequence of SV40 in yeast, it transactivated the native cutinase promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene. Mutation of palindrome 2 but not palindrome 1 abolished this transactivation. Thus, CTF1α positively acts in vivo by binding selectively to palindrome 2 of the cutinase gene promoter.

Extracellular cutinases can help fungi to penetrate through the outermost cuticular barrier of the host plant and, thus, play a role in pathogenesis (1Kolattukudy P.E. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1985; 23: 223-250Crossref Google Scholar). When conidia of highly virulent fungal strains that carry low levels of cutinase (2Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contact the host cuticular surface, small amounts of cutin hydrolysate would be produced, and the monomers thus released are known to trigger expression of the cutinase gene in the germinating conidia, leading to targeted secretion of cutinase at the contact site (2Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that 10,16-dihydroxy C16fatty acid and 9,10,18-trihydroxy C18 fatty acid, the unique monomers of cutin, are the best inducers of cutinase (3Podila G.K. Dickman M.B. Kolattukudy P.E. Science. 1988; 242: 922-925Crossref Google Scholar). Thecis-elements responsible for this inducible expression of the cutinase gene were identified previously using Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi transformants containing segments of the 5′-flanking regions of the cutinase gene and their mutants fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The element essential for the inducible expression of cutinase gene was found to be located at −159 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); CTF, cutinase transcription factor; PBP, palindrome-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TRX, thioredoxin. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); CTF, cutinase transcription factor; PBP, palindrome-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TRX, thioredoxin. (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two overlapping palindromes in this region, palindrome 2 was the element necessary for the inducible expression of the cutinase gene. Gel retardation studies showed that glucose-depleted cultures contained a protein factor that specifically bound palindrome 2, and this factor was designated cutinase transcription factor 1 (CTF1) (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our efforts to identify transacting factors involved in the regulation of cutinase gene transcription led to the isolation of a zinc finger protein that specifically bound to the overlapping palindromic sequence designated palindrome-binding protein (PBP) (5Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11753-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we report that further examination of the specificity of this binding by PBP revealed that this protein bound only to palindrome 1 but not to palindrome 2. We, therefore, further examined expression libraries for a transacting factor that would specifically bind palindrome 2 and report here the isolation of a clone that encodes a distinct protein that specifically binds to palindrome 2 but not to palindrome 1. This protein, designated CTF1α, shows a low degree of sequence identity to GenBank sequences, but it contains a Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster motif similar to those found in positively acting transcription factors in other fungi. That CTF1α is a transcriptional activator in vivo for palindrome 2 of the cutinase gene promoter was further demonstrated by its ability to transactivate the cutinase promoter fused to the cat gene in yeast and by the observation that this transactivation was abolished by mutation of palindrome 2 but not palindrome 1.RESULTSPreviously, we isolated a zinc finger protein, PBP, that specifically bound to the palindromic fragment (5Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11753-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) containing both of the overlapping palindromes present in the cutinase gene promoter. Because palindrome 2 is the one essential for induction of cutinase by hydroxy fatty acids, we tested to determine its binding specificity of PBP to the individual palindromes by gel retardation assay. PBP bound only to the palindrome 1 DNA fragment but not to palindrome 2 DNA fragment (data not shown). Therefore, additional protein factors that specifically bind to this palindrome 2 were sought. We screened λgt11 expression library again to search for clones encoding CTF1 that specifically binds palindrome 2 (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the phage clones encoding PBP were isolated using the fragment containing both palindromes, the phage clones obtained during that screening may also contain clones that would encode CTF1. During the tertiary screening for PBP clones, 27 discrete clones were obtained. Polymerase chain reaction tests indicated that 10 of the phage clones belonged to those encoding PBP (data not shown). The remaining 17 clones showed five distinctly different restriction patterns, and the representative clones from each group were designated as λctf1-8, λctf1-11, λctf1-15, λctf1-22, and λctf1-26. When tested by Southwestern hybridization (7Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), all five clones showed binding to the concatenated palindrome 2 fragment (data not shown). DNA inserts from these phage clones were subcloned into pBS KS− to generate pCTF1-8, pCTF1-11, pCTF1-15, pCTF1-22, and pCTF1-26. Initial sequencing of these clones indicated that pCTF1-8 was a partial clone of pCTF1-15, pCTF1-22 was a partial clone of pCTF1-26, and pCTF1-11 was a distinct clone.The inserts in pCTF1-15, pCTF1-11, and PCTF1-26 were completely sequenced, and the deduced polypeptides revealed the presence of Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster DNA-binding motifs. We chose to characterize λctf1-15 here because it produced the strongest signal in the Southwestern hybridization (7Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The polypeptide encoded by the DNA insert in pCTF1-15 was designated CTF1α (Fig. 1). The lack of in-frame stop codon for the DNA insert indicated that this clone represented a partial open reading frame. Further screening of λgt11 libraries identified four additional overlapping clones for CTF1α (Fig. 1). The complete sequencing of the five overlapping clones for CTF1α revealed a contiguous cDNA sequence of 3271 bp containing a complete open reading frame (Fig. 1).The 3271-bp contiguous sequence for CTF1α contained a single open reading frame of 2727 bp that would encode a protein of 909 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 101,109 (Fig. 1). CTF1α contains 11 potential consensus sequences for phosphorylation by casein kinase II (12Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercon J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 potential sites for phosphorylation by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (13Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 63-81Google Scholar), and 6 potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (14Woodgett J.R. Gould K.L. Hunter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Two consensus sites, PQTP and PATP, for potential phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase were also present (15Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Six potential asparagine-glycosylation sites (16Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) were observed. Three plausible nuclear localization signals with the residue patterns of KRKK, KRHRK, and PKRK(17) were identified in CTF1α, with a certainty of 0.7 (on a scale of 1) of it being localized in the nucleus as predicted by PSORT. Homology searches identified only a Cys6Zn2binuclear cluster domain located at the N terminus from amino acid residues 59 to 92 of CTF1α (Fig. 2).Figure 2Homologies of the Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster motif of CTF1α ofF. solani f. sp. pisi; GAL4, ARGRII, PPR1, PDR1, PUT3, HAP1, and UGA3 of S. cerevisiae; LAC9 ofK. lactis; MAL63 of S. carlsbergensis; NIT4 ofN. crassa; NIRA, UAY, QUTA, and AMDR of A. nidulans; and AFLR of A. flavus.

When the glutathione S-transferase fusion vector was used to express the first 526 amino acids of CTF1α, no protein was detected (data not shown). When thioredoxin (TRX) fusion vector was used to express the Cys6Zn2binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain of CTF1α, fusion protein of TRX-CTF1α(DBD) was detected (data not shown). Even though the expressed TRX-CTF1α(DBD) fusion protein was insoluble, solubilization with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, partial purification, and renaturation yielded a soluble protein preparation. DNA-binding assays by gel retardation were performed with this renatured protein. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a single retarded band of palindrome fragment-CTF1α complex was observed. That the binding of CTF1α to the palindrome was specific was indicated by the observation that unlabeled palindromic fragment but not an unrelated DNA fragment competed for the binding by the labeled palindromic fragment. In addition, CTF1α showed binding only to palindrome 2 but not to palindrome 1 (Fig. 3 B). Mutations in the first half of palindrome 2 that overlaps with palindrome 1 drastically reduced CTF1α binding (Fig. 3 C). Mutations in the second half of palindrome 2 abolished CTF1α binding. Substitution of the G-nucleotides previously found to be at the binding site for the naturally occurring palindrome 2 (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also abolished binding of palindrome 2 to the recombinant CTF1α (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate the sequence specificity of palindrome 2 involved in binding CTF1α.Figure 3Binding of expressed CTF1α to palindrome 2 fragment. In A, partially purified and renatured TRX-CTF1α(DBD) (0.5 μg) was incubated with 32P-labeled palindromic fragment in the presence of molar excesses of either nonspecific competitor DNA fragments or specific unlabeled palindromic DNA fragments. In B, TRX-CTF1α(DBD) (0.5 μg) was incubated with 32P-labeled DNA fragments (pal 1,palindrome 1; pal 2, palindrome 2; pal (1+2), the palindromic fragment). In C, TRX-CTF1α(DBD) (0.5 μg) was incubated with 32P-labeled mutant pal 2 fragments or the wild-type pal 2 fragment: pal2M1/2, aat tGC CTC CGA GGC TCG; pal2M1, aat tCG AGC CGA TAT GGC;pal2M2, aat tCA AAT TAAAAT TTG; and wild-type pal2, aat tCG AGC CGA GGC TCG.

Plasmid constructs were made to express a hybrid fusion protein in which CTF1α was fused to the nuclear localization sequence of SV40. The CTF1α hybrid protein was tested for activation of transcription of the cat gene fused to the cutinase promoter. Its transactivating capability was indicated by the production of high levels of CAT activity when the full-length cDNA clone for CTF1α was introduced into yeast cells carrying the wild-type cutinase gene promoter/cat gene fusion cassette (Fig. 4B, lanes WT and pLEU/CTF1α). Mutations in the first half of palindrome 1 did not change the CAT activity appreciably (Fig. 4B, lane Δpal 1), whereas mutations in the second half of palindrome 2 resulted in a drastic decrease of CAT activity (Fig. 4B, lane Δpal 2). That the C-terminal segment of CTF1α was essential for the transactivation was shown by the observation that expression of the hybrid protein containing the N-terminal 526 amino acids of CTF1α fused to the nuclear localization sequence of SV40 failed to activate the cutinase gene promoter/cat gene (Fig. 4B, lane WT andpTRP/CTF1α(1–526)).Figure 4Activation of the cutinase gene promoter/cat gene fusion cassette by CTF1α in vivo in yeast.

Therefore, we sought a transcription factor specific for palindrome 2 by screening phage clones originally obtained during the screening of the λgt11 expression library for PBP clones (5Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11753-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This screening identified three protein factors, and one of them was designated CTF1α.Mutations in the first half of palindrome 2 that overlaps with palindrome 1 reduced the inducibility of the promoter by over 60-fold, and mutations in the second half of palindrome 2 abolished any inducibility of the promoter in vivo (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific binding of the expressed CTF1α to palindrome 2 indicated by the gel shift assays suggest that the cloned protein is one of the factors involved in the regulation of cutinase gene expression in vivo. In further support of this conclusion is the finding that substitution of the G residues in palindrome 2, previously found to be involved in the binding of the naturally occurring cutinase transcription factor, abolished the binding of the expressed CTF1α.CTF1α was demonstrated to be capable of functioning in vivo as a positively acting transcription factor of the cutinase gene promoter in yeast. CTF1α fused to the nuclear localization sequence was able to activate transcription of the cat gene (Fig. 4 B). That this transactivation involved specific binding to palindrome 2 was strongly suggested by the observation that mutation of palindrome 2, but not palindrome 1, abolished the transactivation (Fig. 4 B). The notion that the Cys6Zn2 DNA-binding domain in the cutinase transcription factor is in the N terminus and the activation domain would be expected to be in the C terminus is consistent with the finding that expression of the hybrid protein containing the N-terminal 526 amino acids of CTF1α fused to the nuclear localization sequence of SV40 failed to activate the cutinase gene promoter/catgene (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that CTF1α functions as a transcriptional activator for palindrome 2 of the cutinase gene promoter in vivo. Mutations in palindrome 1 elevated inducibility of the cutinase gene promoter by 2-fold inF. solani f. sp. pisi in vivo (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PBP may function as a repressor by competing for binding the overlapping palindromes.The presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggested that CTF1α may be a nuclear protein. The N-terminal Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster motifs found in CTF1α is probably involved in the binding to the palindrome. Such DNA-binding motif is characteristic of other regulatory proteins such as GAL4 (18Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2408-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CTF1α does not share homology to any other regions of those factors. Functionally, GAL4 is a positive activator that regulates the transcription of the galactose-inducible genes GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, GAL10, and MEL1 (18Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PPR1 positively regulates transcription of the genes URA1, URA3, and URA4involved in controlling pyrimidine levels (20Kammerer B. Guyonvarch A. Hubert J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some of these protein factors recognize a DNA sequence with two inverted repeats of CGG elements separated by a spacing characteristic of the specific protein factor (33Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For example, PPR1 recognizes 5′-CGG(n6)CCG with a spacer of 6 nucleotides, whereas the spacing for GAL4, PUT3, PPR1, and LEU3 is 11, 10, 6, and 4 nucleotides, respectively (34Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HAP1, on the other hand, binds a direct repeat of CGG triplet with a spacer of six nucleotides (33Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CTF1α binds to a palindrome with an oppositely oriented 5′-GCC(n2)GGC (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The presence of nuclear localization signals, sequence-specific binding to the region of the cutinase gene that is involved in the induction of cutinase gene by hydroxy fatty acid, and the demonstrated capability of the cloned factor to function as a transcription factor suggests that CTF1α is a DNA-binding transcriptional activator involved in mediating the inducibility of the cutinase gene promoter by plant cutin.Phosphorylation of DNA-binding protein factors play an important role in nuclear localization (35Jans D.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), DNA binding, and transactivation (36Latchman D.S. Eucaryotic Transcription Factors. Academic Press, New York1995: 292-307Google Scholar,37Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Previously, it was shown that cutin monomers caused phosphorylation of nuclear proteins (38Bajar A. Podila G.K. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 8208-8212Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and when nuclear extracts from cutin monomer-induced culture were treated with immobilized phosphatase binding to the cutinase gene promoter was abolished (38Bajar A. Podila G.K. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 8208-8212Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, protein phosphorylation was detected only in the presence of cutin monomers. Furthermore, transcription of the cutinase gene induced by hydroxy fatty acids in a nuclear preparation from F. solanif. sp. pisi showed a 30-min lag period during which phosphorylation of a 50-kDa protein occurred and inhibition of phosphorylation by protein kinase inhibitors strongly inhibited cutinase gene transcription induced by the hydroxy fatty acids (38Bajar A. Podila G.K. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 88: 8208-8212Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the basis of such results, it was suggested that protein phosphorylation may be involved in the activation of cutinase gene transcription by hydroxy fatty acids. In fact, CTF1α contains numerous putative consensus sites for phosphorylation by CKII, protein kinase C, and two possible consensus sites for mitogen-activated protein kinase. Whether any of these consensus sites are phosphorylatedin vivo remains to be elucidated.Activation of the cutinase gene transcription by hydroxy fatty acids occurs only when glucose in the culture medium is depleted (39Lin T.S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 942-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This catabolite repression could involve cyclic AMP; experimental evidence had suggested that the involvement of cyclic AMP in cyclic AMP levels in the fungus was elevated almost 3-fold upon glucose depletion, and exogenous cyclic AMP could derepress the glucose effects.2CTF1α contains several potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A, although it is not known whether they are actually involved in cutinase gene activation. Extracellular cutinases can help fungi to penetrate through the outermost cuticular barrier of the host plant and, thus, play a role in pathogenesis (1Kolattukudy P.E. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1985; 23: 223-250Crossref Google Scholar). When conidia of highly virulent fungal strains that carry low levels of cutinase (2Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contact the host cuticular surface, small amounts of cutin hydrolysate would be produced, and the monomers thus released are known to trigger expression of the cutinase gene in the germinating conidia, leading to targeted secretion of cutinase at the contact site (2Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that 10,16-dihydroxy C16fatty acid and 9,10,18-trihydroxy C18 fatty acid, the unique monomers of cutin, are the best inducers of cutinase (3Podila G.K. Dickman M.B. Kolattukudy P.E. Science. 1988; 242: 922-925Crossref Google Scholar). Thecis-elements responsible for this inducible expression of the cutinase gene were identified previously using Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi transformants containing segments of the 5′-flanking regions of the cutinase gene and their mutants fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The element essential for the inducible expression of cutinase gene was found to be located at −159 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); CTF, cutinase transcription factor; PBP, palindrome-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TRX, thioredoxin. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); CTF, cutinase transcription factor; PBP, palindrome-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TRX, thioredoxin. (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the two overlapping palindromes in this region, palindrome 2 was the element necessary for the inducible expression of the cutinase gene. Gel retardation studies showed that glucose-depleted cultures contained a protein factor that specifically bound palindrome 2, and this factor was designated cutinase transcription factor 1 (CTF1) (4Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our efforts to identify transacting factors involved in the regulation of cutinase gene transcription led to the isolation of a zinc finger protein that specifically bound to the overlapping palindromic sequence designated palindrome-binding protein (PBP) (5Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11753-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we report that further examination of the specificity of this binding by PBP revealed that this protein bound only to palindrome 1 but not to palindrome 2. We, therefore, further exa"

We have also examined whether modulation of the phenotype of EA.hy 926 cells by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is associated with specific changes in the synthesis of these PGs. We demonstrate that EA.hy 926 cells, when they form monolayer cultures typical of macrovascular endothelial cells, express and synthesize detectable amounts of biglycan and PG-100, but not decorin. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis both PGs behave like proteins of the relative molecular weight of ∼250,000. TNF-α that changed the morphology of the cells from a polygonal shape into a spindle shape and that also stimulated the detachment of the cells from culture dish, markedly decreased the net synthesis of biglycan, whereas the net synthesis of PG-100 was increased. These changes were parallel with those observed at the mRNA level of the corresponding PGs. The proportions of the different sulfated CS/DS disaccharide units of PGs were not affected by TNF-α. Several other growth factors/cytokines, such as interferon-γ, fibroblast growth factors-2 (FGF-2) and -7 (FGF-7), interleukin-1β, and transforming growth factor-β, unlike TNF-α, modulated neither the morphology nor the biglycan expression of EA.hy 926 cells under the conditions used in the experiments. However, PG-100 expression was increased also in response to FGF-2 and -7 and transforming growth factor-β. None of the above cytokines, including TNF-α, was able to induce decorin expression in the cells.

Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Nearly 30 individual PGs with various functions residing in the extracellular matrix, on the cell surface, or inside the cells, have been identified (1Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 2Elenius K. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2975-2982PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gressner A.M. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin.

Among the PGs of the extracellular matrix, four small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) PG species, biglycan (5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decorin (6Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and epiphycan (4Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 8Shinomura T.

Biol. 1984; 103: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are currently known. Two of these PGs, biglycan and decorin, are highly homologous with each other in terms of their core protein structure (5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and together with epiphycan, fibromodulin, and lumican they both belong to the small leucine-rich PG gene family (4Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). With some exceptions biglycan and decorin differ in the number of GAG chains attached to their core proteins. Biglycan is usually substituted with two GAG chains, whereas decorin typically has only one GAG chain (10Choi H.U. Johnson T.L. Pal S. Tang L.-H. Rosenberg L. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2876-2884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol.

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) biglycan has variously been shown to migrate at positions of protein molecular weight markers of ∼200,000 or more, while decorin migrates at positions of protein molecular weight markers of 87,000–180,000 (13Rosenberg L.C.

The third small extracellular CS/DS PG species, originally isolated from the culture medium of human osteosarcoma cells and tentatively named PG-100 (7Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has recently been demonstrated to be identical with the macrophage colony-stimulating factor CSF-1 (18Partenheimer A. Schwarz K. Wrocklage C. Kölsch E. Kresse H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5557-5565PubMed Google Scholar). PG-100 is therefore a PG form of this cytokine (19Suzu S. Ohtsuki T. Makishima M. Yanai N. Kawashima T. Nagata N. Motoyoshi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16812-16815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Price L.K.H. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2190-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it can be called a “part-time” PG to be differentiated from biglycan, decorin, and other PGs that usually exist only in the GAG containing form (21Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth small CS/DS PG, epiphycan, has been shown to be closely related to osteoinductive factor (22Madisen L. Neubauer M. Plowman G. Rosen D. Segarini P. Dasch J. Thompson A. Ziman J. Bentz H. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the expression of this PG seems to be cartilage specific (8Shinomura T. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1265-1270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact functions of the small CS/DS PGs are still somewhat controversial. Decorin, the most thoroughly investigated molecule in this group, has been shown to bind to collagen fibrils and to regulate fibril formation (23Scott J.E. Orford C.R. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 24Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 25Scott J.E.

Decorin has also been found to interact with the cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (27Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Yamaguchi Y. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 29Santra M.

The role of biglycan in these processes is obscure, although it has been shown to bind to these same molecules (30Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegård D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A.

Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggest that biglycan is likely to interfere with cell adhesion (34Bidanset D.J. LeBaron R. Rosenberg L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). There is also recent evidence to suggest that biglycan is associated with cell migration (35Kinsella M.G. Tsoi C.K. Järveläinen H.T. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 318-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CSF-1 is known to control the growth and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes (36Clark S.C. Kamen R.

Ruszczak Z. Orfanos C.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, PG-100 exhibits less than 1% of the biological activity of mature CSF-1 (18Partenheimer A. Schwarz K. Wrocklage C. Kölsch E. Kresse H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5557-5565PubMed Google Scholar) and should perhaps be considered an extracellular storage form of this cytokine (19Suzu S. Ohtsuki T. Makishima M. Yanai N. Kawashima T. Nagata N.

We have earlier shown that the principal small extracellular CS/DS PG species synthesized by bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells in monolayer cultures is biglycan (16Järveläinen H.T.

We have also shown that BAE cell monolayer cultures do not express detectable amounts of either decorin or type I collagen (16Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when BAE cells change their phenotype and form so called sprouting cultures, the synthesis of both decorin and type I collagen is initiated (38Iruela-Arispe M.L. Hasselaar P. Sage E.H. Lab.

In this study we have examined the expression of the small extracellular CS/DS PGs in the permanent human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 (40Edgell C-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Previously this cell line has been shown to possess several characteristics typical of endothelial cells (40Edgell C-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, we have examined whether modulation of the phenotype of EA.hy 926 cells is associated with specific changes in the synthesis of the small extracellular CS/DS PGs. We demonstrate that EA.hy 926 cells express biglycan, but not decorin. We also demonstrate that these cells synthesize PG-100, the M r of which (∼250,000) is similar to that of biglycan synthesized by these same cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on biglycan expression and its stimulatory effect on PG-100 expression by EA.hy 926 cells, associated with the altered morphology and adhesion of the cells, are shown. Cells of the permanent human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926 (40Edgell C-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) were grown on plastic dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37 °C in 95% air + 5% CO2 in bicarbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, United Kingdom) containing 100 IU/ml of penicillin (Oriola, Finland) and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Oriola), and supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland), and 1 × HAT (100 μm hypoxanthine, 0.4 μm aminopterin, 16 μm thymidine; Life Technologies, Inc.). For subcultures, the cells were detached with 0.01% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma). Human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) that were used as control cells were derived from a skin biopsy of a healthy person, and these cells were subcultured as described previously (47Näntö-Salonen K. Penttinen R. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1982; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The culture medium used for HSFs was the same as described above for EA.hy 926 cells with the exception that HAT was omitted. For identification of sulfated PGs in the culture media, confluent cell cultures were labeled for 24 h with 50 μCi/ml Na2[35S]O4 (Amersham, United Kingdom) in sulfate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, whereafter the media were collected and the detached cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (2000 rpm) for 5 min. The incorporation of [35S]sulfate into newly synthesized PGs was evaluated by the cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) precipitation assay (48Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before further analyses of the culture media (see below). In the experiments examining the effect of TNF-α on the synthesis of the small extracellular CS/DS PGs, the cells were grown to confluence in the serum containing culture medium. Next, the cells were kept in the serum-free culture medium for 4 h, whereafter the cells were labeled as described above in serum-free culture medium containing TNF-α at various concentrations. After removing the detached cells from the culture media by low speed centrifugation (see above), the amount of [35S]sulfate-labeled PGs in the samples was determined by the CPC precipitation assay (48Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before further analyses. Cell number calculations were performed with a hemocytometer. Before the calculations, the cells were fixed with a formaldehyde containing buffer solution (10%, v/v, of 37% formaldehyde in 0.085 m NaCl and 0.1 mNa2 SO4). Two aliquots of each cell suspension were taken for the cell counting. The viability of the cells in the control and TNF-α treated cultures was measured using the trypan blue exclusion test as described (49Järveläinen H.T. Pelliniemi T.T. Rönnemaa T. Scand. J. Clin Lab. Invest. 1985; 45: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the identification of CS/DS and heparan sulfate (HS) PGs in the culture media, equal volumes of [35S]sulfate-labeled media were ethanol-precipitated, dried, dissolved into appropriate buffers, and digested with 0.1 IU/ml of chondroitin ABC lyase from Proteus vulgaris(Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) or 6 milliunits/ml of heparitinase from Flavobacterium heparinum (Seikagaku Co.), respectively (50Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 105: 3087-3096Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 51Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Endo E. Koda J. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11046-11052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of biglycan and PG-100 from the culture media with polyclonal antisera against these two PGs (see below) was performed as described previously (52Santala P. Larjava H. Nissinen L. Riikonen T. Määttä A. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of [35S]sulfate-labeled media corresponding to 500,000 cpm as determined by the CPC precipitation assay (48Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were taken for the analysis. The immunoprecipitants were run on a gradient SDS-PAGE as described (see below). Partial purification of PGs by ion exchange chromatography was performed by applying equal aliquots of [35S]sulfate-labeled media to a DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl in the buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.0 murea, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0m NaCl in the same buffer as above. The amount of radioactivity in sulfated PGs in each fraction was determined by the CPC precipitation assay (48Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All fractions that contained [35S]sulfate-labeled PGs were pooled before further analyses. SDS-PAGE of the samples was carried out essentially as described by Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar) on a 4–12% linear gradient gel with a 3% stacking gel (16Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The positions of the radioactive bands were visualized by fluorography of dried gels previously treated with 2,5-diphenyloxazole (Fisons, UK).14C-Methylated protein molecular weight standards (Amersham) were used to estimate the average sizes of [35S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules. [35S]Sulfate-labeled medium samples or partially purified PGs from similar medium samples were lyophilized, whereafter they were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase and heparitinase to remove all GAG chains (see above). Next, SDS-PAGE was carried out (see above) under reducing conditions using a 12.5% gel, whereafter the proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Specific bands were detected by immunostaining (18Partenheimer A. Schwarz K. Wrocklage C. Kölsch E. Kresse H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5557-5565PubMed Google Scholar, 54Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antisera against biglycan and PG-100 (see below). Biglycan antiserum was a polyclonal antiserum made in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide of human biglycan (amino acids 11–24) that was conjugated to bovine serum albumin before injections (5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antiserum, called LF-51, was kindly provided by Dr. L. Fisher (National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD). PG-100 antiserum was a polyclonal antiserum that was raised in a rabbit against PG-100 core protein as described (7Schwarz K. Breuer B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22023-22028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. H. Kresse (University of Münster, Münster, Germany). [35S]Sulfate-labeled medium samples from control and TNF-α stimulated EA.hy 926 cell cultures were digested with 0.1 IU/ml of chondroitin ABC lyase in a buffer containing 200 mm Tris, 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and 5 μg of chondroitin sulfate A (Seikagaku Co.) as a carrier. The digestions were performed for 6 h at 37 °C. After ethanol precipitation overnight at 4 °C the supernatants and the wash solutions (70% ethanol) were combined, ethanol was removed by evaporation, and the sulfated disaccharides released by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment were separated by ion exchange chromatography (55Midura R.J. Salustri A. Calabro A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The average length of the GAG chains was estimated using a Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia) gel filtration (56Lammi M. Tammi M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 57Lammi M.J. Tammi M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1991; 22: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from the cultures using the single-step method (58Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62893) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses using GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN) were performed essentially as described previously (16Järveläinen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23274-23281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Random priming (Multiprime DNA Labeling System, Amersham, UK) was used for labeling of the cDNAs with 5′-[α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) to a high specific activity. For the quantitation of the hybridization signals, the membranes were probed with a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (59Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). The following cDNA probes were used: a biglycan cDNA (5Fisher L.W. Termine J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for pro-α1(I) collagen. These cDNA probes were kindly provided by Drs. Fisher (National Institute of Dental Research), Kresse (University of Münster, Münster, Germany), Krusius (The Finnish Red Cross, Helsinki, Finland), Iozzo (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), and Vuorio (University of Turku, Turku, Finland), respectively. The following cytokines were used: TNF-α and fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7), purchased from PeproTech; fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), purchased from PeproTech or Boehringer Mannheim; interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and TGF-β, all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. TNF-α was used at concentrations of 5, 25, and 50 ng/ml. FGF-7, FGF-2, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TGF-β were used at concentrations of 50 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 5 IU/ml, 1000 IU/ml, and 20 ng/ml, respectively. Student's unpaired t test was used to describe the significance of the differences between the results of the control and cytokine-treated EA.hy 926 cell cultures. SDS-PAGE of [35S]sulfate-labeled medium sample from a confluent monolayer culture of EA.hy 926 cells demonstrated that these cells synthesize and secrete into the medium two size classes of [35S]sulfate-labeled macromolecules, one that remains on the top of the separating gel (Fig.1, lane 1, band III), and another one with the M r of ∼250,000 (Fig. 1, lane 1, band II). Chondroitin ABC lyase and heparitinase digestions of [35S]sulfate-labeled medium samples prior to SDS-PAGE indicated that the macromolecules of band II are CS/DS PGs, while those of band III represent HS containing PGs (Fig. 1, lanes 2–4), e.g. perlecan (60Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since these cells express abundant mRNA for this PG (data not shown). The composition of sulfated PGs in the culture medium of EA.hy 926 endothelial cell monolayers differed from that of sulfated PGs present in the culture medium of HSFs used as control cells. Besides containing PGs migrating in band II and band III (Fig. 1, lane 5), the culture medium of HSFs contained two additional size classes of sulfated PGs, one with the M r of ∼120,000 (Fig. 1, lane 5, band I) and another one that does not enter the separating gel (Fig. 1,lane 5, band IV). Both of these additional PG size classes were sensitive to chondroitin ABC lyase digestion (Fig. 1, lane 6) indicating that they represent CS/DS PGs. Based on the results of previous studies, the band I PGs (M r of ∼120,000) most probably represent decorin, while the PGs of band IV mainly represent versican (6Krusius T. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl.

This is especially true for nitric-oxide synthases (NOS), heme/flavoenzymes that produce ⋅NO and citrulline from l-arginine (Arg) and are inhibited by CO in vitro. The kinetics of CO ligation with both neuronal NOS and its heme domain module were determined in the presence and absence of tetrahydrobiopterin and Arg to allow comparison with other hemeproteins. Geminate recombination in the nanosecond time domain is followed by bimolecular association in the millisecond time domain. Complex association kinetics imply considerable heterogeneity but can be approximated with two forms, one fast (2–3 × 106m−1 s−1) and another slow (2–4 × 104m−1s−1). The relative proportions of the two forms vary with conditions. For the heme domain, fast forms dominate except in the presence of both tetrahydrobiopterin and Arg. In the holoenzyme, slow forms dominate except when both reagents are absent. Geminate recombination is substantial, ∼50%, only when fast forms predominate. Stopped-flow mixing found dissociation constants near 0.3 s−1. These data imply an equilibrium constant such that very little CO should bind at physiological conditions unless large CO concentrations are present locally.

Nitric-oxide synthase is a hemoprotein that catalyzes conversion of the amino acid l-arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (1Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 2Knowles R.G. Palacios M. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The NO produced activates another heme enzyme, guanylate cyclase (see Reaction FR1), that catalyzes formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, a second messenger that mediates numerous biochemical events including vascular smooth muscle relaxation, platelet disaggregation, photoreceptor cell signaling, ion transport in gastrointestinal cells, and myeloid cell differentiation. At least three isoforms of NOS 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; P450, cytochrome(s) P450; S/N, signal-to-noise ratio. have been purified and characterized. In each, a heme prosthetic group, iron protoporphyrin IX, is attached to the protein by a proximal cysteine.

Enzyme inhibition in vitro required large concentrations of either CO or NO. If those reagents play a role in vivo, the mechanism must involve locally enhanced concentrations. For NO, fast turnover and slow diffusion away from the site of production in unstirred cytoplasm might possibly lead to large concentrations locally and, consequently, to autoregulation of NO production. Recent evidence suggests a role for CO produced by heme oxygenase as a messenger molecule in the same cell types as nNOS (13Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5147-5150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Christodoulides N. Durante W. Kroll M.H. Shafer A.I.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Could the activity of heme oxygenase produce high concentrations? The CO concentration needed depends upon the equilibrium constant for CO binding. Unfortunately, equilibrium constants for binding CO and NO are not known for NOS. Matsuoka et al. (16Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported CO combination rate constants for neuronal NOS but not CO dissociation data, which could have been combined with the combination rate constant to calculate an equilibrium constant. In hemeproteins, CO dissociation rate constants vary from 6.5 s−1 in P450 to 7.2 × 10−5s−1 in horseradish peroxidase. Therefore, knowledge of CO association and dissociation is important for determining NOS reactivity relative to myoglobin, guanylate cyclase, and other heme proteins, which potentially could compete with NOS for reactive ligands. In addition to the interest generated by its physiology, this sensitivity of CO dissociation rate constants to protein structure makes it an excellent parameter for providing qualitative information about the local heme environment. A review of CO dissociation constants reveals two trends. 1) CO off rates are markedly affected by the nature of any base proximal to the heme–CO bond, whereas for a given base, any weakening of the base–heme bond, or its total rupture, dramatically increases the CO dissociation rate. 2) Steric hindrance on the distal side reduces both association and dissociation rates for CO in all cases known (17Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar). These same issues arise for carboxy guanylate cyclase activation.In vitro activity is significantly affected by 1 atm of CO, but equilibrium constants indicate that in vivo, little, if any, guanylate cyclase activation by CO should be expected. Nevertheless, several biological phenomena seem to be affected by small amounts of CO (15Ingi T. Cheng J. Ronnett G.V. Neuron. 1996; 16: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have no explanation, but the example points out the difficulty in extrapolating from in vitroto in vivo conditions. Nevertheless, a knowledge of equilibrium and rate parameters is the essential starting point of all discussion. The studies reported here determined the kinetics of ligation of CO with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase stably expressed in human kidney 293 cells (4McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) expressed in Escherichia coli. Flash photolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry were used to determine association and dissociation rate constants. We investigated the effects of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and l-arginine (Arg). For the latter, advantage was taken of the ability in E. coli to express nitric-oxide synthases in the absence of BH4 and with diminished Arg concentrations (18Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P.

In addition to bimolecular association, we also investigated geminate recombination of CO-iron pairs confined within the protein. These studies allowed us to estimate the equilibrium binding constant of CO with NOS and provided insights into the nature of the heme pocket in the enzyme. Carbon monoxide (99.8%), nitric oxide (99.9%), high purity argon, and premixed CO in argon were all from Matheson. NO was further purified by passage through a column of fresh KOH. Buffers were prepared (20 mm Tris-HCl, usually pH 7.8, 100 μm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) in a gas-tight syringe and deoxygenated by bubbling with argon for >40 min. When indicated, buffers also contained 250 μm BH4 and/or 0.5 or 10 mm Arg. Microperoxidase solutions were prepared as described elsewhere (21Sharma V.S. Schmidt M.R. Ranney H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4267-4272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat nNOS holoenzyme was expressed in two different systems. Unless otherwise indicated, it was in E. coli, purified and reconstituted as described previously (18Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide formation, measured in E. coli-expressed nNOS after Arg and BH4 repletion using a hemoglobin capture assay described previously (22Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to be 250 nmol min−1mg−1 (25 °C) or 540 nmol min−1mg−1 (25 °C). Expression of rat nNOS in human embryonic kidney cell was performed as reported previously (4McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar); nitric oxide formation was measured using anl-[3H]citrulline assay (23Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar) and found to be 420 nmol min−1 mg−1 (25 °C). The amino-terminal heme-binding domain (residues 1–714) of rat nNOS was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (19McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). All proteins were >90% homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein solutions were degassed and then reduced using degassed 1% sodium dithionite solution. Finally, CO was added in a premixed ratio with argon by gentle gas flow over the liquid using a large surface-to-volume ratio. Spectra for reduced holoenzyme and heme domain were consistent with previously published data as were the spectra of liganded preparations (7Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectra were taken before and after flash photolysis measurements to detect any possible degradation. Flash photolysis used an improved version of an instrument described previously (24Walda K.N. Liu X.Y. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2198-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Photolysis laser pulses were 4 ns in duration at 545 nm with up to 4 mJ of energy over an area of 0.1 cm2. The probe had an 8-nm bandwidth selected from a stable tungsten lamp, except that measurements of geminate recombination required a pulsed xenon flash. The photomultiplier was wired with both a large standing current and large interdynode capacitors to optimize linearity. The digitizer had been upgraded to a Lecroy Model 9361 digitizing oscilloscope. A quantitative treatment of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is essential whenever there is a question of complicated kinetics. Heme concentrations were near 1 μm with 1-cm optical path length using a volume of 0.5 cm3 in a 1-cm square cell. (This gave a large surface area for gas exchange after we learned that even mild stirring caused degradation.) Initial absorbance changes ΔA (t = 0) were typically about 0.03–0.04. By accumulating 80–200 recordings, the root mean square uncertainty at each time point was reduced below 0.00008. As a result, we achieved S/N ≈ 500 or better. Nanosecond geminate recombination had to be measured with a wider electronic bandwidth, resulting in about a 5-fold loss in S/N despite the brighter, pulsed lamp. Good S/N for random scatter exposes a measurement to systematic distortions in the data. These have been reduced through several generations of the instrument. The most convincing short argument that systematic distortion is not responsible for any major feature described below is that, by coincidence, while these measurements were being made we were also measuring kinetics of recombination in HbA2. The latter system gave beautiful single exponential decay curves. Stopped-flow measurements were carried out at 20 °C using a Durrum instrument following protocols described earlier (25Sharma V.S. Isaacson R.A. John M.E. Waterman M.R. Chevion M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3897-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The CO dissociation rates were determined both by the microperoxidase method (21Sharma V.S. Schmidt M.R. Ranney H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4267-4272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by replacing CO with NO (26Olson J.S. Antonini E. Rossi-Bernardi L. Chiancone E. Hemoglobins: Methods in Enzymology. 76. Academic Press, New York1981: 631-651Google Scholar). For the microperoxidase method, after mixing, the sample was 0.5 μm protein, 200 μm sodium dithionite, and 5 μm CO. The microperoxidase concentrations varied between 3 and 10 μm. For the NO substitution method, the sample was 0.5 μm protein, 25 μm sodium dithionite, and 150 μm CO. The NO concentrations varied between 175 and 275 μm. Spectra before and after reactions were as expected (27Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For both methods, absorption changes were monitored at 443 nm. Measurements were done in duplicate and were proved to be independent of concentration of either microperoxidase or NO. The kinetics of the reaction of CO with both the complete nNOS holoenzyme and the heme domain fraction of nNOS were characterized, and the rates in the presence and absence of Arg and BH4 were measured. Thus, there are eight cases to distinguish. The effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on rates of CO binding has been previously shown to be negligible (16Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flash photolysis measurements were made at 23 ± 0.5 °C. They were carried out at both pH 7.0 and pH 7.8, with identical results. There was also no discernible difference between nNOS from kidney cells and that from E. coli. There was no irreversible photochemistry. Transient recovery was >99.5% after each flash, and spectra did not change during a series of flashes. Association rates were determined by monitoring recombination after photodissociation in the presence of excess CO. Kinetics were quite complex. In general, we observed three phases on different time scales. There was a very fast process with a half-life on the order of 100 ns that was unaffected by changing CO concentration and was assigned as geminate recombination of protein-caged heme-ligand pairs. All slower processes varied systematically with [CO]. Solutions were equilibrated with premixed gas mixtures at 1 atm (105pascals) total pressure. We used CO in argon at molar ratios of 5, 10, 20, and 50% as well as 100% CO. Molar concentrations were calculated assuming that the solubility of CO in aqueous solution at 25 °C is 930 μm atm−1. We must distinguish a kinetic “phase,” as the term was used above, from an exponential component of a fit. The two words are frequently used as synonyms. Here, however, a phase may be composed of two or even three exponentials that are quite close in characteristic time constant. The group as a whole differs from other rates by at least a factor of 10, and the components behave similarly as CO concentration is changed. Best fits to the data were calculated using our own implementation of the classic Marquardt algorithm for a nonlinear least squares fit to a sum of exponentials, ΔA(t)=s∑aie−kitEquation 1 where s is an overall scale factor,a i are amplitudes, which sum to unity, andk i is the rate constant. The nanosecond geminate phase involved only a single exponential, characterized bya gem and k gem. The bimolecular association required as many as four additional components, but they could be grouped into fast and slow phases characterized byk f or k s, each defined as a sum over one, two, or, occasionally, three exponentials as follows. kf−1=∑ajkj−1/∑ajEquation 2 Fig. 1 displays a typical transient absorption measurement with a multiexponential fit. The definition of the mean rate as the mean of reciprocal rates (see Ref. 2Knowles R.G. Palacios M. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) mimics what a single exponential fit to the same data yields. To determine the bimolecular association constantsk a,f or k a,s, measurements were carried out for several [CO] to prove the linear dependence on [CO]. The phases were distinguished according to Equations 1 and 2, and the rates k a,f and k a,s were plotted versus [CO]. The association rate constants are the slopes of those graphs. There are three reasons for simplifying to two bimolecular phases. First, it permits easier comparison with other experiments that do not have the S/N to resolve all components. Second, fitting exponentials with similar rates is a difficult statistical problem. Parameters are highly correlated, and even though heterogeneity is clear, little significance should be attached to a particular expression of that heterogeneity. It is probable that there is a continuous distribution of rates. Third, since so little is known at present about NOS, it is preferable to simplify the discussion for the present while documenting whatever detail is measured for its potential future significance. To confirm that the complex kinetics were not an instrumental artifact, we carried out a number of control experiments. 1) We investigated pulse energies from 0.4 to 4 mJ to confirm that there was no effect on the measured decay curves. 2) In preliminary measurements, we recorded kinetic traces at 5-nm intervals from 380 to 450 nm and obtained a transient spectrum very similar to that reported previously (16Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, we confirmed the extremes of the difference spectrum, the location of the isosbestic point, and the near equality of the magnitude of peak transient absorption and bleach. 3) We confirmed that we had a well defined isosbestic point at 430–432 nm (slightly shifted between the heme domain and the holoenzyme), which persisted throughout the entire time range. Subsequently, in each measurement traces were collected both at the maximum transient bleach, 445 nm, and the maximum transient absorption, 405 nm. Kinetics reported are averages of the two. The heme domain decay curves were often indistinguishable at the two wavelengths. There may be a small difference in some cases for the holoprotein, presumably due to very small, time-dependent shifts in the transient spectrum related to conformational relaxation of the holoprotein. Principal data for all measurements are collected in TableI, but the following sections add information about certain details, mainly the multiple exponentials included in certain phases.Table IKinetic rate constants for binding CO to nNOS heme domain and nNOS holoenzymeSystem1-aDom, domain; Holo, holoenzyme.a gem/ΔA(0)k gema f/(a f+a s)k a,fk a,sk ds−1M−1s−1M−1s−1s−1Dom0.35 ± 0.102.0 ± 0.5 × 1070.95 ± 0.032.1 ± 0.2 × 1063.5 ± 0.5 × 1040.15Dom + Arg0.40 ± 0.101.6 ± 0.5 × 1070.90 ± 0.043.5 ± 0.2 × 1062.2 ± 1.5 × 1040.32Dom + BH40.55 ± 0.101.8 ± 0.3 × 1070.95 ± 0.023.0 ± 0.4 × 1063.0 ± 0.3 × 1040.16Dom + Arg + BH40.08 ± 0.031.8 ± 0.5 × 1070.30 ± 0.051.5 ± 0.1 × 1062.1 ± 0.1 × 1040.34Holo0.45 ± 0.051.3 ± 0.5 × 1070.94 ± 0.022.8 ± 0.2 × 1064.2 ± 0.5 × 104Holo + Arg0.09 ± 0.031.2 ± 0.4 × 1070.10 ± 0.032.0 ± 0.2 × 1061.8 ± 0.2 × 104Holo + BH40.10 ± 0.031.8 ± 0.5 × 1070.14 ± 0.031.9 ± 0.2 × 1062.2 ± 0.2 × 1040.16 and 15Holo + Arg + BH4<0.030.03 ± 0.01∼2–3 × 1062.0 ± 0.1 × 1040.33Rates listed here do not always represent single exponential decays.1-a Dom, domain; Holo, holoenzyme. Open table in a new tab Rates listed here do not always represent single exponential decays. The fast phase could be fit fairly well using two exponentials of equal amplitude with rates differing by a factor of 3, but at very high S/N it became clear that two exponentials were not completely adequate. The steady-state absorption spectrum showed a small amount of extra absorption near 420 nm, consistent with that reported and explained by Wang et al. (28Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We also noticed additional complexity in the transient spectra, particularly around the usual isosbestic point. This could be pursued, if one were interested in the so-called P420 form of NOS, but for our present purpose we believe that by choosing wavelengths characteristic of the P450-like spectrum, we can include this case in the comparison study, with minimal contamination by the P420 form. The fast phase required at least two exponentials with rates differing by about a factor of 3. The fast phase required two exponentials differing by a factor of 4–5, slightly more than in the cases above. Adding both reagents had a striking effect, not observed with either alone. Geminate recombination was greatly reduced so that the slow phase dominated bimolecular association. The slow phase could be well fit using two exponentials differing in rate by a factor of 3, but instead of the amplitudes being approximately equal, the slower contributed 90% to the phase. The bimolecular combination could be described very well using three exponentials, of which two could be grouped into a fast phase. The fastest is 5–6 times faster than the middle rate, which is about 15 times the slowest. The fastest also provides most of the amplitude, being about 10 times larger than the middle rate, which is somewhat larger than the slowest. The primary data were obtained using a preparation that had been prepared entirely in the absence of Arg or BH4. This was possible by expressing nNOS holoenzyme in E. coli in which BH4 is not biosynthesized (18Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for a sample originally prepared with BH4 and Arg but then dialyzed 48 h against buffer lacking both. That, however, is rather harsh treatment, required because BH4 is strongly bound. The slow phase was well fit using two exponentials differing by a factor of only 2, with the slower carrying the majority of the amplitude. The slow phase required two exponentials differing in rate by a factor of about 3, with the slower carrying most (about 70%) of the weight. Protein with 0.25 mm BH4and either 0.5 or 10 mm Arg showed no detectable geminate recombination (<3%), and the bimolecular association was almost exclusively (>95%) a slow phase. That phase, however, was not at all a single exponential (see Fig. 1). It required at least two and often three exponentials, distributed in rate over a range of 5–10. The small, fast phase was at least as fast as the fast phase observed in the absence of Arg. Although a small fast phase at the beginning of a decay can be quite apparent, it is difficult to characterize since it is affected by the random noise in the much larger slow phase. Plots of association rates versus[CO] were linear and could be extrapolated to the yintercept, but the plots were not very useful for estimating dissociation constants. Only upper limits could be assigned, typically <20 s−1 for the fast phase and <2 s−1 for the slow phase. Consequently, we resorted to stopped-flow methods carried out at 20 °C. With one exception, all stopped-flow measurements were well fit by single exponentials over the time scale that could be monitored. A typical trace is shown in Fig.2. The absorbance change of 0.07 is what was expected for the change from reactants to products, so that any additional component cannot be very large. Results are included in Table I. The holoenzyme lacking Arg showed about 15–20% faster phase with rate constant 15 ± 2. Perhaps surprisingly, the heme domain did not show any fast process under any conditions. Bimolecular association required three or four exponentials to fit, but the exponentials tend to group into two distinct time regimes. Fig. 1 displays a large amplitude slow phase requiring three exponentials varying in rate by only a factor of 4 between the extreme values together, with a minority fast phase that is 150 times faster. We attribute the different rates to different protein conformations, each reacting with its own rate constant. This is based on two considerations. 1) Protein expression should produce proteins with a common sequence identity. 2) Lack of spectral evidence for intermediates appears to rule out sequential mechanisms. (Additional spectral features can be detected under certain circumstances but not the conditions discussed here.) We postulate a quasi-continuous distribution of conformations, which is bimodal, clustering about the two most common forms. The effect of cofactors, substrates, and other reagents is to bias the probability distribution in ways that can be described approximately (but not completely) as shifting the protein between fast reacting forms and slow reacting forms. The one previous report of combination kinetics in NOS distinguished the two major phases, but did not recognize additional complexity (16Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tentatively assuming that kinetic heterogeneity is due to multiple conformational states, the question remains as to how much is intrinsic and how much may be an artifact of in vitro preparations. The much-studied myoglobins exhibit no such heterogeneity. The hemoglobins do have distinct R and T quaternary conformations with different kinetics (29Sawicki C.A. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1533-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The known mammalian kinin receptors are classified as two subtypes, <i>i.e.</i> the B1 receptor triggered by [des-Arg<sup>9</sup>]bradykinin and inhibited by [des-Arg<sup>9</sup>,Leu<sup>8</sup>]bradykinin, and the B2 receptor stimulated by bradykinin and antagonized by HOE140. Here we report the cloning of a non-mammalian kinin receptor gene amplified from genomic chicken DNA. The protein predicted from the open reading frame shows 31 and 49% sequence identity to the human B1 and B2 receptors, respectively, suggesting that it represents a G protein-coupled receptor of the kinin receptor family. The recombinantly expressed chicken receptor had IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.7 nm for the authentic ligand, ornithokinin ([Thr<sup>6</sup>,Leu<sup>8</sup>]bradykinin), 3.8 nmfor HOE140, and ≥10 μm for bradykinin, [des-Arg<sup>9</sup>]bradykinin, and [des-Arg<sup>9</sup>,Leu<sup>8</sup>]bradykinin. Ornithokinin and HOE140 at nanomolar concentrations stimulated intracellular inositol phosphate accumulation and induced a significant transient rise in intracelluar free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, whereas bradykinin was ineffective even at 100 nm. Hence the principal B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 is a potent agonist of the chicken kinin receptor. This unique pharmacological profile classifies the ornithokinin receptor as a novel subtype among kinin receptors and will facilitate further molecular studies on ligand binding and receptor activation."

In addition, a stable non-inhibitory form with substrate properties has been identified (7Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Urano T. Strandberg L. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Eur. J.

PAI-1 is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily (10Pannekoek H. Veerman H. Lambers H. Diergaarde P. Verweij C.L. Van Zonneveld A.J. Van Mourik J.A.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The serpins comprise more than 40 single-chain proteins, each containing 370–390 residues with an overall amino acid homology of approximately 35% (14Carrell R.W. Boswell D.R. Barret A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam1986: 403-425Google Scholar, 15Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). All serpins have the same highly ordered tertiary structure consisting of three beta sheets, A, B, and C, nine α-helices, and a reactive site loop containing residues P16 to P10′, which are highly variable (16Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 49-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reactive site loop is situated 30–40 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal end and provides a “bait” peptide bond (P1-P1′) that mimics the normal substrate of the target proteinase (17Laskowski M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). In PAI-1, the Arg346-Met347 bond has been identified as the P1-P1′ bond (18Lindahl T.L. Ohlsson P.I. Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In latent PAI-1, the amino-terminal part of the reactive site loop (P16-P1) is inserted into beta sheet A forming s4A and rendering P1-P1′ inaccessible to the target proteinase. The substrate form of PAI-1 reacts with its target proteinases, e.g. t-PA or u-PA, resulting in a cleavage of the P1-P1′ bond but, in contrast to the active form, without formation of a covalent complex and without inhibition of the proteinase. The target specificity of serpins is mainly determined by the nature of the residues at the P1 and P1′ position (19Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also been reported to influence the target specificity of serpins. The alternative behavior of PAI-1 as an inhibitor, a non-inhibitory substrate or a non-reactive latent form, has been shown to be mainly dependent on the initial conformation of this serpin (7Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in general, the functional behavior of serpins (i.e. inhibitionversus substrate) is often explained by the occurrence of one reactive conformation resulting in the generation of common intermediates until the branching point between substrate and inhibitory pathways (32Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Beechem J. Shapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the product distribution (i.e. complex formation or cleaved serpin) depends on the reaction conditions influencing this branching (32Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Beechem J. Shapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Cooperman B.S. Stavridi E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. J. Biol.

In the current study, the characterization of PAI-1 variants carrying proline mutations at positions P6, P10, or P18 reveals (a) a t-PA target specifity for PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) and a u-PA target specificity for PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro), (b) an unexpected transition of the active form of PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) into a substrate form, and (c) the existence of two distinct substrate populations in PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro). These observations have allowed us to draw an alternative reaction scheme for the interactions between serpins and their target proteinases. The chromogenic substrate S-2403 was obtained from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). t-PA (predominantly single chain) was a kind gift from Boehringer Ingelheim (Brussels, Belgium); low molecular weight two-chain u-PA (tcu-PA) was prepared from single-chain u-PA (scu-PA) kindly provided by Dr. Lijnen (University of Leuven, Belgium). Alternatively, u-PA (consisting of high and low molecar weight tcu-PA in a 75:25 ratio) kindly provided by Bournonville Pharma (Braine l'Alleud, Belgium) was used. PAI-1-P6 (Val → Pro at P6) and PAI-1-P10 (Ser → Pro at P10) were constructed as described before (36Audenaert A.-M. Knockaert I. Collen D. Declerck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1-P18 (Asn → Pro at P18) was constructed in a similar way using the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CACCGTGCCACTCTCCGGGACCTCGATCTT-3′ to obtain the desired mutation. Expression and purification of wtPAI-1 and variants was performed in Escherichia coli as described earlier (37Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PAI-1 activity was determined using the method described by Verheijen (38Verheijen J.H. Chang G.T.G. Kluft C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) by adding a fixed amount of t-PA or u-PA to the PAI-1 containing samples. t-PA was calibratedversus the international reference preparation for t-PA (NIBSC 86/670). All PAI-1 activity data are expressed as percentage of the theoretical maximal activity, i.e. ∼745,000 units/mg (t-PA inhibitory units) and 120,000 units/mg (u-PA inhibitory units) calculated on the basis of a specific activity for t-PA of 500,000 units/mg and for u-PA of 100,000 units/mg and molecular masses of 67, 54, and 45 kDa for t-PA, u-PA, and PAI-1, respectively. Samples of wtPAI-1 and PAI-1 mutants were incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA or u-PA. PAI-1 samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) to a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. T-PA and u-PA were diluted with PBS to a concentration of 0.7 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Equal volumes of t-PA (or u-PA) and PAI-1 were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration of 1%) and heating during 30 s at 100 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequent densitometric scanning with the ImagemasterTM (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The rate of inhibition of t-PA (predominantly single chain) and u-PA (consisting of high and low molecar weight tcu-PA in a 75:25 ratio) by PAI-1 and PAI-1 variants was determined as follows. u-PA and t-PA were used at concentrations of 0.2 nm, and PAI-1 and PAI-1 variants were used at concentrations of 0.8, 1.2, or 1.6 nm (pseudo first-order conditions). Residual u-PA and t-PA activity was quantified (38Verheijen J.H. Chang G.T.G. Kluft C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) after blocking the reaction by addition of a 200-fold molar excess of the monoclonal antibodies MA-8H9D4 (for u-PA reaction) and MA-56A7C10 (for t-PA reaction). Both antibodies inhibit PAI-1 activity very rapidly and completely, without interference on the u-PA or the t-PA activity assay. PAI-1 samples (except PAI-1-P18) were inactivated by diluting the samples to a final concentration of 150–190 μg/ml using the appropiate diluent (containing Tween 80 and Na2HPO4) to obtain a buffered solution with 45 mm phosphate, 70 mmNaCl, and 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Under these conditions, PAI-1-P18 exhibited extensive precipitation. Inactivation of PAI-1-P18 was, therefore, carried out at a concentration of 125 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 80 and 2 mm glutathione and incubation at 4 °C for 60 h. The half-lives for inactivation were calculated with the program GraphPad PrismTM using “one-phase exponential decay” according to the equation Y = Span*e−K*X + Plateau. The half-life of the decay is then equal to 0.693/K. The statistical significance of differences was evaluated using Student's t-test;p values >0.05 were considered non-significant. wtPAI-1 revealed similar activities toward t-PA (68 ± 10% (mean ± S.D., n = 6)) as toward u-PA (68 ± 6.0%) (Fig. 1). PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) was significantly less active (p < 0.0001) toward u-PA (3.9 ± 2.2%) than toward t-PA (45 ± 10%) (n = 6). In contrast, PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) were significantly less active (p < 0.01) toward t-PA (5.9 ± 0.33 and 0.20 ± 0.04%, respectively) than toward u-PA (19 ± 4.9 and 41 ± 10%, respectively, n = 3). Incubation of wtPAI-1 at 37 °C with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA revealed the formation of t-PA·PAI-1 complexes (49 ± 6%, mean ± S.D.,n = 4), small amounts of cleaved derivative (13 ± 1%), and residual non-reactive material (38 ± 5%) (Fig.2A and Table I). Under these conditions, the amount of complexes formed with PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro), PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro), and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) were compatible with their respective activity data. In addition, for all these mutants, a decreased inhibitory activity was associated with an increased (3–10-fold,p < 0.0001 versus wtPAI-1) substrate behavior. Surprisingly, in contrast to wtPAI-1, PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro), and PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro), virtually no latency was observed for PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro), demonstrating that the absence of any inhibitory activity of this mutant toward t-PA was totally attributed to substrate behavior.

Open table in a new tab Mean ± SD, n ≥ 3; expressed as percentage of PAI-1 protein. The amount of complexes formed after incubation of PAI-1-P10 with a 2-fold molar excess of u-PA (Fig. 2B, Table I) was compatible with the u-PA inhibitory activity data. Comparison of the amount of complexes formed in the presence of either t-PA or u-PA further confirmed the proteinase specificity (i.e. 4-fold higher activity toward u-PA than toward t-PA). In agreement with the activity data, no detectable complexes were formed between PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) and t-PA, whereas up to 40% complex formation could be observed in the presence of u-PA. Complex formation of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) with t-PA was 10–15-fold higher compared with complex formation with u-PA. Importantly, from the data in Table I and Fig. 2, it can be deduced that, for each mutant, the differences in proteinase specificity (with respect to inhibitory activity) were mainly attributed to a concomitant inversed difference in substrate behavior. In all cases, no proteinase-dependent differences in non-reactive material could be observed. As expected, inactivation of wtPAI-1 occurred with a half-life of 60 ± 20 min (mean ± S.D., n = 6) and was associated with a concomitant increase in latent PAI-1. The amount of substrate remained unchanged.

Open table in a new tab Mean ± SD, n ≥ 2; expressed as percentage of PAI-1 protein. Inactivation of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) occurred with a similar half-life (64 ± 18 min) and a conversion of the active form to the latent form. In contrast to what was observed for wtPAI-1, the decrease in inhibitory activity was partly associated with a decrease in substrate behavior. However, as observed for wtPAI-1, a significant amount (∼15%) remained as stable substrate. From the time-dependent changes in inhibitory and substrate forms of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro), it could be calculated that the conversion of this unstable substrate form of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) to latent PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) occurred with a different half-life than the conversion of inhibitory PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) to latent PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) (t1/2 = 118 ± 34 min versus 64 ± 18 min, p < 0.05). In contrast to wtPAI-1 and PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro), loss of inhibitory activity of PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) or PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) was almost exclusively associated with an increase in substrate behavior (Fig. 3and Table II). The second-order rate constants of inhibition of t-PA and u-PA by PAI-1 and PAI-1 variants are shown in TableIII. The t-PA specific mutant PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) as well as the u-PA specific mutant PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) inhibit t-PA and u-PA with similar rate constants of ∼107m−1 s−1, showing that the kinetics of inhibition are not related with the target specificity of the PAI-1 variants.Table IIISecond-order rate constants of inhibition of t-PA and u-PA by wtPAI-1 and PAI-1 variantsInhibition of t-PAInhibition of u-PAwtPAI-10.8 ± 0.2 1071.5 ± 0.1 107PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro)1.1 ± 0.1 1073.2 ± 0.4 107PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro)1.4 ± 0.3 1073.8 ± 0.3 107PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro)NA4.3 ± 0.8 107Mean ± S.D., n = 3–7.

Serpins form a large group of proteins with important regulatory properties toward a wide variety of serine proteinases. Naturally occurring deficiencies and/or mutants with aberrant functional properties often give rise to severe pathologies. Even though from a structural point of view serpins are very similar, functionally they can be divided into two groups: (a) inhibitory serpins forming stable covalent complexes with their target proteinases, and (b) non-inhibitory serpins that are susceptible to cleavage upon reaction with their putative target proteinase. Today, a wide variety of mutants has been characterized (39Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Shapira M. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the aim to delineate domains that are important for the structure-function relationship in serpins. The reactive site loop (P16 to P10′) is considered as one of the most important domains regarding the interaction between the serpin and its target proteinase. The importance of the P3 to P1′ region for target specificity of serpins has been reported extensively before (19Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While a basic residue at the P1 position of PAI-1 is required for inhibition of u-PA (25Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of neutral or hydrophobic amino acids at this position does not affect t-PA inhibition properties (27Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Verhamme I.M. Paielli D. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9301-9306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inhibition of u-PA by PAI-1 still occurs when P1′ is substituted with any amino acid except proline (25Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alteration of the residues at postion P2 and P3 of PAI-1 revealed the possibility for target specific inhibition, with t-PA being more tolerant than u-PA for structural diversity at the P2 and P3 positions (30York J.D. Li P. Gardell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8495-8500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study describes the functional effects of PAI-1 proline mutations that are remote of the P3-P1′ region. The current study reveals that substitution of the residue at position P6 by a proline (PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro)) results in a t-PA target specificity, whereas substitution by a proline at position P10 or P18 yields an increased u-PA target specificity (PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro)) or even a PAI-1 variant with exclusively u-PA inhibitory properties (PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro)). The target-specific mutants inhibit t-PA and u-PA with similar rate constants of ∼107m−1s−1, illustrating that the kinetics of inhibition do not contribute to this target specificity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of modulation of the proteinase specificity of serpins by mutations remote of the P3-P1′ region. Analysis of the reaction products formed between the mutants studied and t-PA or u-PA also revealed significant changes in the inhibitor versussubstrate ratio compared with wtPAI-1. The behavior of a serpin as an inhibitor or as a substrate has been reported to be influenced (in part) by external reaction conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, presence of cofactors, etc. (32Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Beechem J. Shapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Cooperman B.S. Stavridi E. Nickbarg E. Rescorla E. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. J.

These effects are generally explained through the existence of a branched pathway as shown in Fig. 4. It should be realized that in those studies, even though large conformational changes could be excluded, minor conformational changes in the reactive site loop could have influenced this reaction behavior. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that decreased kinetics of insertion (through mutations at position P14) (42Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Shapira M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with an increased substrate behavior. This might also explain the substrate-type properties of various serpin mutants in which bulky or charged residues have been introduced in the reactive site loop. (36Audenaert A.-M. Knockaert I.

Biol. 1995; 2: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, for the serpin PAI-1, it had also been shown that, in the wild-type molecule, different initial conformations exist, which predetermine the reaction pathway (7Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants described in the current study further substantiate these findings and provide evidence for the existence of two different substrate conformations. Indeed, inactivation of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) results in a disappearance of part of the substrate-reacting population with a different half-life compared with the active form. Based on the branched pathway mechanism, conversion of the one (and only) reactive form would have resulted in a perfectly parallel decrease of substrate and inhibitor reaction. Importantly, even though the substrate behavior of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) decreases during incubation at 37 °C, a significant portion appears to be stable (as observed previously with wtPAI-1), clearly demonstrating the existence of both a labile and a stable substrate conformation of PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro). The existence of an initial conformation pathway responsible for the formation of cleaved serpin (PAI-1), independent of the possible phenomenon of “branching,” is further proven by the observation that inactivation of PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) results in an increased substrate behavior demonstrating that the active, inhibitory form is converted to a distinct, substrate form. The proposed conformational transitions are further substantiated by the observation of changes in tryptophan fluorescence characteristics upon inactivation of these mutants (data not shown). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, in contrast to what is generally accepted, more conformations and conformational changes do occur. We propose an alternative reaction scheme of the reaction between PAI-1 and its target proteinase (Fig.5). It should be emphasized that this scheme might be extrapolated to other serpin/proteinase interactions whereby cofactors, changes in pH, etc. induce subtle conformational changes in the serpin, resulting in a conversion between an active (Ia) and a substrate (Is) form. PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) revealed the existence of both a labile and a stable substrate form (Is), which can be cleaved (Ic) by target proteinases, and an active form (Ia), which can form an inactive complex (EIa) with the target proteinase or that converts spontaneously into the latent form (Il). In contrast, the active form (Ia) of PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro) converts spontaneously to the substrate form (Is). It has to be emphasized that, in our current study, all reactions carried out before and after pretreatment were performed under identical conditions and, consequently, exclude the possibility that any observed “shift” in formed reaction products (i.e. changes in active versus substrate ratio;cf. Tables I and II) would have arisen from changes in thek4/k3 ratio in the branched reaction pathway. On the other hand, it should also be realized that our data obviously do not allow us to exclude the possible existence of a branched pathway under certain conditions with certain serpins. Therefore, this possibility is still included in our alternative reaction scheme. However, in this respect, it is important to note that the hypothesis of a branched pathway responsible for the formation of two possible reaction products (complexed or cleaved), first proposed in 1991 (32Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Beechem J. Shapira M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8876-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and applied in later studies, was based on indirect evidence. In conclusion, our study reveals (a) three target specific PAI-1 variants in which in each variant only one residue, located outside the P3 to P1′ region, is replaced by a proline; (b) the existence of two different substrate populations in the PAI-1-P6(Val → Pro) mutant; and (c) a conformational transition from the active form into a substrate form for PAI-1-P10(Ser → Pro) and PAI-1-P18(Asn → Pro). These observations lead to the conclusion that the reaction pathway between PAI-1 and its target proteinase is much more complex than originally anticipated based on the previously proposed branched pathway for serpins."

The dinucleotide is extended to a tetranucleotide primer at the sites 5′-(G/T)GGTC-3′ and 5′-GTGTC-3′. In the presence of T7 primase, T7 DNA polymerase extends the synthetic ribotetranucleotide pACCA (1 μm), but not pCACA, on M13 DNA templates. The reaction is specific for T7 DNA polymerase and depends on dTTP and translocation of the gene 4 protein. T7 primase extends the dinucleotide AC and trinucleotide ACC to ACCC in the presence of CTP and an appropriate template, whereas other dinucleotides are extended less efficiently; the deoxyribodinucleotide dAC is not extended. The Cys4 zinc motif of the primase is essential for extension of the dinucleotides. The 5′-cryptic cytidine of the recognition sequence is essential for extension of the dinucleotide AC to tri- and tetranucleotides. At a preformed replication fork, the dinucleotide AC provides for primer synthesis on the lagging strand. The synthesis of all Okazaki fragments is initiated by primers arising from the recognition sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′; none arise at an adjacent 5′-GGGTT-3′ sequence.

DNA primases catalyze the template-directed synthesis of oligonucleotides for use as primers by the lagging strand DNA polymerase. The primases of T7, T4, and Escherichia coli all initiate oligonucleotide synthesis on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s). at basic trinucleotide recognition sites unique to each system (1Cha T.-A.

The 3′-nucleotide of the recognition sequence, in each case, is cryptic in that it is essential for recognition, but is not copied into the product oligonucleotide. Although the basic recognition sequence is a trinucleotide, with the potential to generate a dinucleotide, the oligonucleotides that actually function as primers for the T7, T4, and E. coliprimases are tetra-, penta-, and 10–12-mers, respectively (6Fujiyama A.

The stringency for these subsequent nucleotide additions is less than that observed for the first two nucleotides polymerized at the basic trinucleotide sequence (1Cha T.-A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which prokaryotic DNA primases recognize a trinucleotide sequence on ssDNA is not known. However, the T7, T4, andE. coli primases have a potential metal-binding site, as do all known DNA primases (12Ilyina T.V. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the T7 and E. coli primases have been shown to be zinc metalloproteins (13Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Stamford P.N. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of the T7 primase, the Cys4 zinc motif is located at the amino terminus of the protein; the substitution of a serine for any one of the four cysteines destroys its ability to catalyze the synthesis of oligonucleotides in a sequence-specific manner (13Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, altered T7 primases containing these single amino acid changes or even lacking the entire zinc motif still catalyze the DNA-independent formation of random dinucleotides, albeit at a greatly reduced rate, demonstrating that the site for phosphodiester bond formation is located in another domain of the protein (13Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zinc motif, however, is not the sole determinant of primase site recognition since we have shown that substituting the zinc motifs of the T4 and E. coli primases for that of the T7 primase does not lead to the creation of a chimeric primase that now uses the T4 or E. coli recognition sequence, but rather to one that recognizes an entirely new trinucleotide sequence (17Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19563-19570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the T7 primase shares many properties with the primases of phage T4 and E. coli, it has a number of distinguishing properties. A unique feature of the T7 DNA primase is the presence of a helicase domain, which allows the 63-kDa gene 4 protein, a protein composed of a single polypeptide chain, to catalyze both helicase and primase activities. (15Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the T4 and E. coli systems, helicase and primase activities reside within separate polypeptides (8Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu C.-C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2813-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arai K. Kornberg A.

Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physical association of primases with a helicase in a functional complex is important because the translocation activity of the helicase provides a mechanism for the primase to reach its recognition sites on ssDNA (2Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Liu C.-C. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5698-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5260-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

The presence of both helicase and primase activities in the same T7 protein arises from the presence of two co-linear gene 4 proteins, a 56- and a 63-kDa protein, in phage-infected cells (24Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The two proteins are expressed from two in-frame translation initiation sites 189 bases apart on the gene 4 transcript. The 56-kDa gene 4 protein lacks the 63 N-terminal amino acid residues of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein, and it is this domain that contains the zinc motif essential for primase activity. Thus, the 56-kDa gene 4 protein has only helicase activity, whereas the 63-kDa gene 4 protein has both helicase and primase activities (16Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we refer to the 63-kDa gene 4 protein as DNA primase even though it has helicase activity. A second distinguishing property of the T7 primase involves the selectivity in the particular nucleotides incorporated into the primers after the invariant dinucleotide is synthesized at the basic primase recognition site. T7 primase greatly prefers AMP and CMP in the third and fourth positions of the primer, whereas the T4 and E. coli enzymes are less restrictive in the nucleotides incorporated (25Scherzinger S. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10483-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this specificity is, at least in part, due to the inherent translocation activity of the T7 primase, which does not allow the enzyme to pause for sufficient time to incorporate unfavorable nucleotides (11Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A third distinguishing property, and the subject of this study, is the ability of the T7 primase to synthesize relatively large amounts of the dinucleotide pppAC together with the functional primer species, a tetranucleotide. The actual RNA primers found at the 5′-termini of Okazaki fragments synthesized in cells infected with phage T7 (6Fujiyama A. Kohara Y. Okazaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or in reactions containing the T7 primase and T7 DNA polymerase are tetranucleotides, predominantly pppACCC, pppACCA, and pppACAC (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,26Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10483-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These tetranucleotides arise from the general recognition sites 5′-GGGTC-3′, 5′-TGGTC-3′, and 5′-GTGTC-3′, respectively, all containing the core recognition sequence for the T7 primase, 5′-GTC-3′ (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On naturally occurring ssDNA templates such as phage M13 DNA or on synthetic oligonucleotides containing one of the general recognition sites, the T7 primase, in the presence or absence of coupled DNA synthesis, catalyzes the synthesis of di- and trinucleotides as well as the functional tetranucleotide primers (18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, on templates containing only the core trinucleotide sequence 5′-GTC-3′, the enzyme catalyzes exclusively the synthesis of the dinucleotide pppAC (18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although small amounts of dinucleotide have been observed with the T4 and E. coli primases under some conditions, their abundance is far less than that seen with T7 primase (2Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Swart J.R. Griep M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16097-16106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ability of the T7 primase to catalyze the exclusive synthesis of dinucleotides at core recognition sites (5′-GTC-3′) not contained within a general recognition site is intriguing and raises the possibility that dinucleotides may serve some functional role in the priming reaction. One possibility is that, although the dinucleotides cannot be extended at these sites, they may remain associated with the primase during its translocation to a general recognition site, where extension to a functional primer could occur. In early studies on the gene 4 protein, Scherzinger et al. (28Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Morelli G. Seiffert D. Yuki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that certain tri- and tetranucleotides could stimulate DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase on ssDNA templates in a reaction dependent on the presence of the T7 gene 4 protein. Interestingly, of the tetranucleotides tested, ACCA was the most effective, and priming appeared to be initiated at specific sites on φX174 DNA; in this study, dinucleotides were without effect. Subsequent studies revealed that the 63-kDa gene 4 protein alone could stimulate T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of a tetranucleotide (15Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the ribodinucleotide AC can be extended to a tetranucleotide by the 63-kDa gene 4 protein and that the reaction occurs only at a general primase recognition site, 5′-NNGTC-3′, containing the essential but cryptic cytidine residue. In addition, we examined the use of dinucleotides in the priming reaction at a replication fork, where leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis is carried out by T7 DNA polymerase, the 63-kDa gene 4 helicase/primase, and the gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein. M13mp18 ssDNA was purified as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed.

T4 DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and other enzymes were purchased from Amersham Corp. The ability of tetranucleotides to stimulate T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of T7 primase was measured using an M13 ssDNA template. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.3 mm dATP, 0.3 mm dCTP, 0.3 mmdGTP, 0.3 mm [α-32P]dTTP, 10 nmT7 primase (hexamer), 20 nm T7 or T4 DNA polymerase, 10 nm M13 ssDNA, and the indicated amount of pACCA or pCACA tetranucleotides. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.2 mEDTA (pH 8.0). The reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman DE81 filters, and the filters were washed four times for 10 min with 0.3m ammonium formate (pH 8.0) followed by 98% ethanol. After drying, the amount of [α-32P]dTMP incorporated into DNA was measured as the radioactivity remaining on the filters by scintillation spectrometry. Oligonucleotide synthesis assays using synthetic oligonucleotide templates or M13 ssDNA were performed as described (18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reactions (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.5 mm dTTP, 0.1 mm [α-32P]CTP, 10 nm T7 primase (hexamer), 10 nm M13 ssDNA or 100 nm oligonucleotides, and either 0.1 mm ATP or 0.1 mm di- or trinucleotide. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of sequencing dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixtures were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the labeled products were separated by electrophoresis through 25% polyacrylamide gels containing 8.3 m urea. Formation of a minimal replication fork was performed as described (11Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The minimal replication fork consists of a 71-nt TK-03 circular DNA to which a 71-nt TK-01 linear DNA molecule has been annealed through a 36-nt region complementary to TK-03. The nucleotide sequences of the TK-01 and TK-03 oligonucleotides used for construction of the replication fork are presented above. DNA synthesis reactions (20 μl) using the minimal replication fork contained 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.7 mm dTTP, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dCTP, 0.1 mm [α-32P]CTP, 50 nm T7 DNA polymerase, 500 nm gene 2.5 protein, and 5 nmT7 primase (hexamer). Either 0.1 mm ATP or ApC ribodinucleotide was present to measure de novo primer synthesis or the extension of ApC to primers, respectively. The reactions were started by the addition of 50 nm replication fork and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA. 5 μl of the reaction was mixed with 15 μl of sequencing dye and applied directly to a 25% urea gel to measure ribotetranucleotide synthesis. The remainder of the reaction (20 μl) was deproteinized, and the DNA was digested with BamHI and loaded onto 4% urea gels. After electrophoresis, the DNA fragments bearing ribonucleotide primers were visualized by autoradiography. As discussed in the Introduction, earlier studies had indicated that ribotetranucleotides could stimulate DNA synthesis on ssDNA templates catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase, provided that the T7 primase was present (15Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Scherzinger S. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G.

Biochem. 1977; 72: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In these preliminary studies, the concentration of tetranucleotides, 100–1000 μm, far exceeded the concentration of NTPs normally used in the primase reaction. As a result, it was difficult to evaluate the effect of nucleotide sequence on the efficiency with which the oligonucleotides were extended. In the experiment presented in TableI, we examined the ability of two ribotetranucleotides, pACCA and pCACA, to prime DNA synthesis catalyzed by either phage T7 or T4 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA; ATP and CTP, the precursors for primer synthesis, were omitted from the reaction. The tetranucleotide pACCA is similar to the pppACCA primers synthesized by T7 primase at the recognition site 5′-TGGTC-3′; five such sites are present on M13mp18 ssDNA (33Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). The tetranucleotide pCACA is not synthesized by T7 primase (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the complementary sequence 5′-TGTG-3′ is present on M13mp18 ssDNA at 12 loci. At the lowest concentration, 1 μm, pACCA was ∼25-fold more efficient in promoting DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of T7 primase than was pCACA. At this concentration of tetranucleotide, no stimulation of DNA synthesis was detected in the absence of T7 primase. At a 10-fold higher concentration of tetranucleotide, there was a 9-fold increase in the stimulation by pCACA as compared with the lower concentration, whereas the higher concentration of pACCA resulted in only a 1.6-fold enhancement. The less dramatic stimulation by the higher concentration of pACCA is in part due to the extent of DNA synthesis. The 298 pmol of dTMP incorporated represents nearly complete replication of the 0.2 pmol of M13 ssDNA template (351 pmol of dTMP incorporation sites) present in the reaction.Table IEffect of the T7 gene 4 protein on priming of DNA synthesis by ribotetranucleotidesdTMP incorporationaDNA synthesis catalyzed by either T7 or T4 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA in the presence of ribotetranucleotides and in the presence or absence of the T7 63-kDa gene 4 protein was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Gene 4 proteinT7 DNA polymeraseT4 DNA polymeraseRibonucleotidesConc+−+−(μM)pmolNone<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1pACCA1181<0.11.0<0.1102989.20.8<0.1pCACA17.2<0.10.6<0.11067<0.11.6<0.1a DNA synthesis catalyzed by either T7 or T4 DNA polymerase on M13 ssDNA in the presence of ribotetranucleotides and in the presence or absence of the T7 63-kDa gene 4 protein was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The T7 primase-dependent stimulation by the tetranucleotide is specific for T7 DNA polymerase; no significant stimulation of T4 DNA polymerase was observed. It should be noted that the use of the primer pCACA by T7 DNA polymerase is dependent on the presence of T7 primase, although this tetranucleotide is not synthesized by the enzyme in the normal priming reaction. Oligonucleotides synthesized by T7 primase contain a 5′-terminal ATP since ATP is the first nucleotide incorporated (11Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the studies presented in this report, we used oligonucleotides lacking a 5′-terminal triphosphate. Consequently, we examined the ability of the T7 primase to incorporate adenosine, AMP, and ADP into the dinucleotide precursor and to extend them to tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotides (Fig. 1). In the presence of ATP and CTP, the T7 primase catalyzes the synthesis of pppAC, pppACC, pppACCA, and pppACCAA on a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the known recognition site 5′-TTGGTC-3′. Both AMP and ADP are about equally effective in supporting oligonucleotide synthesis, but the trinucleotide cannot be extended beyond ppACC or pACC since ATP is not available in the reaction. Although incorporation of adenosine was greatly reduced compared with AMP and ADP, there was detectable synthesis of AC (Fig. 1). No oligonucleotide synthesis was observed with dAMP, dADP, or dATP. To study the use of oligonucleotides by T7 primase uncoupled from DNA synthesis, we examined the extension of synthetic ribodinucleotides by the enzyme. In the experiment presented in Fig. 2 A, we examined the extension of the dinucleotide AC to ACC and ACCC on a synthetic template containing the recognition sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′ by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]CMP. It is clear that the dinucleotide is efficiently extended to ACC and ACCC (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The extent of synthesis is approximately the same as that observed with ATP and [α-32P]CTP (lane 1), and reactions containing both ATP and AC synthesize approximately equal amounts of pppACCC and ACCC (lane 3). Therefore, the T7 primase appears to have the same affinity for ATP and AC. Not all dinucleotides can be extended by T7 primase. As shown in Fig.2 B, the ribodinucleotide AC is extended far more efficiently than is AA, CC, or CA on either M13 ssDNA or synthetic oligonucleotide templates, each containing the complementary sequence to the dinucleotide sequence. Each of the sequences complementary to the extended dinucleotide is followed by a 5′-guanosine residue for labeling with [α-32P]CMP, and each contains the 3′-cryptic cytidine required by the primase for recognition: 5′-GGGTC-3′ for AC, ACC, and dAC; 5′-GTTC-3′ for AA; 5′-GGGC-3′ for CC; and 5′-GTGC-3′ for CA. The dinucleotide AA is not extended, whereas CC and CA are extended to CCC, CCCC, CAC, and CACC, albeit at reduced efficiency. The trinucleotide ACC is extended to the tetranucleotide ACCC on either template. The reaction is specific for ribodinucleotides as evidenced by the fact that dAC is not extended on either template. In general, DNA primases rely upon DNA helicases for translocation to primase recognition sites (34Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 275-306Google Scholar). The T7 63-kDa gene 4 primase has an inherent helicase activity (15Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and hence does not have to interact physically with a separate helicase. The 5′ to 3′ translocation activity of T7 primase is dependent on the hydrolysis of dTTP to dTDP and Pi (35Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in TableII, omission of dTTP from the di- or trinucleotide extension reaction reduces the extension of AC on M13 ssDNA to <1% of that observed in its presence. On the synthetic oligonucleotide T7-01 containing a primase recognition site, extension is reduced to ∼5% in the absence of dTTP. The greater amount of extension on the short oligonucleotide is in keeping with earlier evidence that random diffusion to primase sites accounts for a significant amount of primer synthesis on short oligonucleotides (37Mendelman L.V. Kuimelis R.G. McLaughlin L.W. Richardson C.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Sc"

Among the cell surface receptors for fibronectin, integrins are the best characterized, particularly the prototype α5β1 integrin. Using [125I]iodine cell surface labeling or metabolic radiolabeling with sodium [35S]sulfate, we identified α5β1 integrin as the only sulfated integrin among β1 integrin heterodimers expressed by the human melanoma cell line Mel-85. This facultative sulfation was confirmed not only by immunoprecipitation reactions using specific monoclonal antibodies but also by fibronectin affinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and chemical reduction. The covalent nature of α5β1 integrin sulfation was evidenced by its resistance to treatments with high ionic, chaotrophic, and denaturing agents such as 4 m NaCl, 4 mMgCl2, 8 m urea, and 6 m guanidine HCl. Based on deglycosylation procedures as chemical β-elimination, proteinase K digestion, and susceptibility to glycosaminoglycan lyases (chondroitinase ABC and heparitinases I and II), it was demonstrated that the α5β1 heterodimer and α5 and β1 integrin subunits were proteoglycans. The importance of α5β1sulfation was strengthened by the finding that this molecule is also sulfated in MG-63 (human osteosarcoma) and HCT-8 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells.

Proteoglycans are complex molecules formed by a core protein to which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan chains; RGD, peptide Arg-Gly-Asp; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ECM, extracellular matrix. chains are linked. This basic definition, although true, hides the molecular complexity shown by these molecules. They encompass an exceptionally large range of structures involving different core proteins, different classes of GAGs, and different numbers and lengths of individual GAG chains. Other post-translation modifications such asN- and O-glycosylation increase the complexity of these molecules (for review see Refs. 1Jackson R.L. Bush S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol.

The biological functions of proteoglycans are numerous. They have been involved in several biological effects (1Jackson R.L. Bush S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol.

Veiga S.S. Gremski W. Brentani R.R. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1996; 29: 1247-1249PubMed Google Scholar); and a cell surface phosphatidyl inositol-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan mediates melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin (19Drake S. Klein D.J. Mickelson D.J. Oegema T.R. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Strong corroboration for these proteoglycan-ECM interactions comes from the presence of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that co-localizes with β1 integrins as a widespread component of focal adhesion (20Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Among the several ECM molecules that bind proteoglycans, the role of fibronectin should be emphasized not only because of its GAG binding domains but also because of the adhesive properties conferred to this molecule by these domains together with the RGD cell-binding fragment (21McCarthy J.B. Chelberg M.K. Mickelson D.J. Furcht L.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

Cells devoid of proteoglycans or bearing proteoglycans with altered GAG chains have a reduced capacity of adhesion to fibronectin and have a defective focal adhesion plaque formation in response to this molecule (24LeBaron R.G. Esko J.D. Woods A. Johanson S. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Couchman J.R. Austria R. Woods A. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Physiol. 1988; 136: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The best studied receptors for fibronectin that bear adhesiveness and focal adhesion plaque formation are integrins that are α/β heterodimers widely expressed by almost all animal cells (26Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar). Integrins represent good examples of how post-translational modifications can alter the structure of a molecule, thus modulating its biological activity. Integrin glycosylations represent a kind of regulation by which a wide variety of these receptors have their specificity and affinity modulated in several cell lines (28Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zheng M. Fang H. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

However, the versatility of cells to modulate the binding properties of integrins is not restricted to glycosylation. Integrin functions can be modulated by acylation of membrane lipid (31Conforti G.L. Zanetti A. Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Quaglino D. Neyroz P. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4011-4019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by divalent metal binding (32Grzesiak J.J. Davis G.E. Kirchhofer D. Pierschbacher M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and, for the cytoplasmic domain, by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is the best understood example of this type of biological modification, especially in leukocytes and platelets (27Hynes R.O.

In the present study, we characterize α5β1integrin as a part-time proteoglycan containing both heparan and chondroitin sulfate, which per se could affect cell adhesion to both fibronectin RGD and GAG binding domains.

All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Cultilab, Campinas, Brazil) and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in humidified conditions. Cells were harvested using divalent cation-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA.

Mel-85 extract (at the same mass of protein, 1 mg) was incubated respectively with antibodies against different integrin subunits (as shown above), and for B-5G10 (an IgG1 molecule), rabbit IgG was preincubated against mouse IgG followed by protein A-Sepharose. Affinity beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min with Laemmli buffer. [35S]Sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using the same mono- or polyclonal antibodies as above. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) followed by electrotransference onto nitrocellulose membranes (41Towbin H. Staehilin T. Gorden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar) and exposure to x-ray films (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The same procedure was used to study HCT-8 and MG-63 cell extracts with an anti-α5integrin antibody. The [35S]sulfate-labeled immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-α5 integrin monoclonal antibody were incubated with 4 m NaCl, 4m MgCl2, 6 m guanidine HCl, and 8m urea for 2 h at 37 °C. Mixtures were then boiled for 5 min, and α5β1 integrin was separated from Sepharose beads by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 ×g. Supernatants were dialyzed against water, concentrated in a speed vaccum concentrator, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were then exposed to x-ray films at room temperature for 10 days. Fibronectin-affinity chromatography of [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell extract was performed using purified human plasma fibronectin coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as detailed elsewhere (30Veiga S.S. Chammas R. Cella N. Brentani R.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SDS gel electrophoresis was performed as described (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Samples under reducing or nonreducing conditions were analyzed on 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose filters as described (41Towbin H. Staehilin T. Gorden G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers (myosin, 205 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; and phosphorylase b, 98 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa) were purchased from Sigma. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, samples were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing (42O' Farrel P.Z. Goodman P. O'Farrel P.H. Cell. 1977; 12: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar) using an ampholyte gradient (pH 4.0–6.5, six parts and pH 3.0–10.0, four parts, Pharmacia) followed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE in nonreducing conditions. Glycosaminoglycan analysis was performed using agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane acetate buffer pH 9.0 (Aldrich). After the electrophoretic run, compounds were precipitated in the gel using 0.1% Cetavlon for 2 h at room temperature (43Dietrich C.P. Dietrich S.M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). After drying, the gel was stained with toluidine blue and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat, Kodak) for 10 days at room temperature. GAG standards used were heparan sulfate from bovine pancreas (44Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Straus A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), dermatan sulfate from pig skin, and chondroitin sulfate from shark cartilage (Seikagaku, Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). To study the specific pattern of glycosylation of α5 and β1 integrin subunits, [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the α5 integrin subunit as already described, and the precipitate was submitted to a preparative 7.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions using prestained β-galactosidase (116 kDa) that comigrates with the β1 integrin subunit as a standard. Autoradiography of separated α5 and β1 subunits was done in identical conditions as above and used as a guide. Gel pieces were then cut off in the positions of separated α5 and β1 subunits, and proteins were excised and eluted from the gel by incubation in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. The mixtures were then filtered through 0.45-μm filters (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) to remove polyacrylamide, and the solutions containing extracted proteins were dialyzed against water and concentrated 20-fold. Purified α5 and β1 integrin subunits were then submitted to β-elimination reaction to release free GAG chains, which were incubated with chondroitinase ABC, heparitinases I and II, or a mixture of these enzymes (see below), and the digests were analyzed by agarose gels. Immunoblotting reactions using Rb3847 (a rabbit polyclonal antibody that only reacts with the β1 integrin subunit but not with the denatured α5 integrin subunit) and a monoclonal antibody against chondroitin sulfate chains (CS-56) were performed as described previously (30Veiga S.S. Chammas R. Cella N. Brentani R.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GAG chains from [35S]sulfate-labeled α5β1 integrin, purified by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody against the α5 integrin subunit, were liberated by digestion of the protein core using excess proteinase-K (50 μg; Sigma) at 58 °C overnight or by a β-elimination reaction (treatment overnight at 37 °C with 0.1 m NaOH in the presence of 2 m NaBH4; Sigma). The products obtained were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. β-Eliminated materials were submitted to digestion with chondroitinase ABC from Proteous vulgaris(Seikagaku, Kogyo Co, Tokyo, Japan), heparitinases fromFlavobacterium heparinum (45Nader H.B. Porcionatto M.A. Moraes C.T. Dietrich C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6807-6813Google Scholar), or all enzymes and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Because integrins are substrates for several different post-translational modifications, we decided to determine whether they could function as substrates for sulfation. We decided to address this question using [35S]sulfate labeling of the cells, immunoprecipitation, and blotting experiments. As shownin Fig. 1, Mel-85 cells in culture efficiently incorporate [35S]sulfate. The cell lysate was submitted to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody against the β1 integrin subunit, and a [35S]sulfated αβ1 integrin molecule dimer was detected. This suggests that β1 integrin is a substrate for post-translational sulfation. After the demonstration that αβ1dimer integrin is a sulfated molecule, our next experimental procedure was to identify the α subunit complementing the β1subunit in this particular integrin heterodimer. To investigate this, Mel-85 cells were surface radiolabeled with [125I]iodine by the lactoperoxidase method or metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate. Both cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against different integrin subunits. We can see in the [125I]iodine-labeled immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A) the presence of β1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α7, and probably α1 subunit, a 200-kDa signal (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) that could be precipitated with the β1 subunit. Neither cell flow cytometry nor immunoprecipitation showed detectable levels of the α6 integrin subunit in Mel-85 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, Fig. 2 B shows that only α5 and the corresponding β1 subunit are sulfated. These findings suggested that α5β1 integrin is a facultative sulfated β1 integrin molecule because none of the other β1 integrin molecules incorporated [35S]sulfate. It is known that after reduction of the disulfide bonds by β-mercaptoethanol (chemical reduction), the α5 integrin subunit comigrates with the β1 subunit (36Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates obtained using monoclonal antibodies to β1 and α5 integrin subunits or a polyclonal antibody against the α5β1 integrin dimer from a [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell lysate were then subject to chemical reduction. As shown in Fig. 2 C, after chemical reduction the immunoprecipitates reveal just one band in the gel, confirming that α5β1 integrin is a sulfated molecule. It is also known that the α5β1 integrin has fibronectin as the only ECM ligand (27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar, 46Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 D shows that after elution from a fibronectin affinity chromatography α5β1integrin is detected as a sulfated molecule. Data in the literature describe proteoglycans as α5β1 integrin-associated molecules that complement the requirements involved in cell adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, in melanoma cells a heparan sulfate proteoglycan of 150/175 kDa has been described to bind fibronectin (19Drake S. Klein D.J. Mickelson D.J. Oegema T.R. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 227-290Google Scholar, 48Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). We cannot therefore discard the possibility of a physical association between a third molecule that comigrates with αβ integrin subunits, masking the sulfated signals in the autoradiograms. To rule out this possibility the same [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell extract was again immunoprecipitated by specific monoclonal antibodies to α5 and β1 integrin subunits and now submitted to a two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 3,A and B). We can observe that the immunoprecipitation reactions using either anti-β1antibody or anti-α5 antibody show only a sulfated signal of α5β1 dimer. To corroborate the findings described above and demonstrate that the sulfate groups in α5β1 integrin are covalently linked and not adsorbed to this molecule or to the beads during immunoprecipitation, this integrin was immunoprecipitated from a [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the beads were submitted to different conditions of elution such as high ionic strength (4 mNaCl) and chaotrophic agents (6 m guanidine HCl, 4m MgCl2, 8 m urea). After boiling, the precipitates were dialyzed against water, submitted to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, which were then exposed to an x-ray film (Fig. 3 C). These results show that the α5β1 integrin bears covalently linked sulfate groups. Proteoglycans represent the best characterized sulfated molecules containing serine-linked sulfated GAG chains as a result of post-translational modifications of the protein core (2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 7Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To determine the site of sulfate substitution in the α5β1 integrin dimer, [35S]sulfate-labeled Mel-85 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using antibody against the α5 subunit and subjected to β-elimination. This procedure cleaves GAG chains from the protein core. As shown in Fig. 4 A(lane 2), α5β1 integrin after β-elimination showed two sulfated bands that comigrate electrophoretically with chondroitin and heparan sulfate standards. An identical result was obtained when [35S]sulfated α5β1 integrin was submitted to proteinase-K digestion (a serine protease of broad specificity) (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). These experiments suggest that α5β1 integrin is a hybrid chondroitin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan. This was further investigated by degradation of the β-eliminated material from α5β1 integrin with specific enzymes that degrade chondroitin sulfate (chondroitinase ABC) and heparan sulfate (heparitinases type I and II). We can see that under these conditions, both sulfated bands were completely degraded by the specific enzymes (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that α5β1 integrin is in fact a hybrid chondroitin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Because in Mel-85 cells α5 and β1 subunits of integrin contain sulfate, our next goal was to determine the specific pattern of glycosylation, that is, to which subunit chondroitin and heparan sulfates are linked. Two complementary approaches based on immunologic specificities were used. Fist, α5β1integrin was immunoprecipitated from a 35S-labeled Mel-85 cell extract as described above. After separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the immunoprecipitate was exposed to an x-ray film, blotted, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific for chondroitin sulfate chains (Fig. 5 A). We can see that both integrin subunits bear chondroitin sulfate chains. Also, Mel-85 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with a anti-chondroitin sulfate monoclonal antibody and blotted with a polyclonal antiserum against the β1 integrin subunit (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, we can see that only the 116-kDa β1integrin subunit, which corresponds to the completely glycosylated form, has chondroitin sulfate chains. In contrast, the pre-β1 integrin chain (100 kDa), which corresponds to a high mannose structure, has no chondroitin sulfate chains. Pre-β1 integrin shows the glycosylation profile of a protein that has not crossed the Golgi. Because synthesis of GAG occurs in the Golgi, the absence of chondroitin sulfate in the pre-β1 integrin should be expected (49Lohmander L.S. Hascall V.C. Yanagishita M. Kuettner K.E. Kimura J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding was also substantiated by results shown in Fig. 1 in which the pre-β1 integrin subunit, although coprecipitated, is not sulfated. These results demonstrate that the integrin dimer α5β1 is a proteoglycan and that in Mel-85 cells both integrin subunits have covalently linked chondrotin sulfate chains. As a second approach we have used successive immunoprecipitation reactions to isolate α5β1 integrin from a35S-labeled Mel-85 cell lysate. The purified α5β1 integrin was submitted to preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using an autoradiogram of the gel and prestained molecular mass standards as guides, separated α5 and β1 subunits were removed from the gel and subjected to β-elimination to obtain GAG free chains. These chains were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis before and after treatment with chondroitinase ABC, heparitinases, and a mixture of these enzymes (Fig. 5 C). The result obtained from this last set of experiments support the concept that α5β1 integrin is a proteoglycan. It shows that both subunits contain chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, thereby demonstrating that α5β1 integrin is a hybrid chondroitin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Because all experiments described so far were performed using the human melanoma cell line Mel-85, which has a neuro-ectodermic origin, we decided to investigate whether this α5β1 integrin post-translational modification was also present in cell lines of endodermic (HCT-8 cells) and mesodermic (MG-63 cells) origin. Cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies against the α5 integrin subunit and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose. A polyclonal antibody against the β1 integrin subunit (Fig.6 A) was used to detect the integrin. We can see that both cells display the [35S]sulfate incorporation into the α5 integrin subunit. The results indicate that GAG substitution of α5β1integrin has been conserved, suggesting its biological significance. However, in the case of the MG-63 cells, only the α5subunit was labeled; the β1 subunit found in MG-63 cells did not contain sulfate. To corroborate the results described in Fig.6 A and provide more evidence that the glycosylation of integrin α5β1 integrin as a proteoglycan is maintained in different tissues, we submitted [35S]sulfate-labeled α5β1integrin obtained from HCT-8 and MG-63 cell extracts to a β-elimination reaction. Products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6 B, we can see that heparan and chondroitin sulfates are present in α5β1 integrins of endodermic and mesodermic origins, as observed for neuro-ectodermic cells. The results not only confirm the conservative proteoglycan nature of α5β1 integrin from different origins but also indicate a similar glycosylation pattern. Working with the human melanoma cell line Mel-85, we have described α5β1 integrin as a hybrid chondroitin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Based on immunoprecipitation reactions from cell lysates that were cell surface labeled with [125I]iodine or metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, we were able to detect α5β1 integrin as the only sulfated integrin compared with other α(s)β1 heterodimers present in Mel-85 cells. Sulfation of α5β1integrin was confirmed not only by immunological methods but also by fibronectin affinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and reduction of disulfide bonds of the α5β1 heterodimer leading to comigration of both α5 and β1 integrin subunits, characteristic of this integrin as described (36Hemler M.E. Huang C. Takada Y. Schwarz L. Strominger J.L. Clabby M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11478-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on different procedures such as chemical deglycosylation by β-elimination, proteinase-K digestion, immunological methods, and susceptibility to chondroitinase ABC and heparitinases, we were able to confirm this integrin as a proteoglycan. These results raise the important question of which mechanisms determine α5β1 as the only sulfated integrin. Why are β1 subunits not sulfated in other αβ1 heterodimers? The existence of alternative splicing for the β1 integrin subunit as described (50Altruda F. Cervella P. Tarone G. Botta C. Balzac F. Stefanuto G. Silengo L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 95: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar) could explain in part such differences. However, because glycosylation of cell surface proteoglycans is restricted to extracellular domains (2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) and the β1 integrin subunit has only alternatively spliced cytoplasmic domains (27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar) this mechanism does not explain our findings. Oligomerization of αβ integrin heterodimers is an event that occurs during transit through the endoplasmic reticulum (28Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and precedes glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, which occurs during transit through the Golgi (2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best explanation for the part-time proteoglycan nature of α5β1 integrin is that the conformation of the heterodimer exposes the serine residues that are acceptors for the GAG chains, which does not happen with other αβ1heterodimers. This conformational hypothesis is consistent with the lack of a consensus sequence for proteoglycan biosynthesis initiation (1Jackson R.L. Bush S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 2: 481-485Crossref Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 2Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) and by the experiments performed with decorin, a proteoglycan in which the primary structure of the protein core surrounding the sugar acceptor serine residue can be changed without appreciable modification in the glycosaminoglycan (51Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the findings described above, it is possible to assume that the same conformational folding of α5β1 that makes this integrin capable of recognizing the RGD peptide only in fibronectin among several other ECM molecules (52Hautanen A. Gailit J. Mann D.M. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1437-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also responsible for a specific GAG synthesis that complements the molecular requirements involved in the interaction of this integrin with fibronectin. The possibility that other integrins can also be sulfated is not ruled out by the present study because we could not detect α6β1 integrin in Mel-85 cells. This is an integrin that binds laminin, a molecule with a GAG binding domain spatially close to the E8 domain corresponding to the α6β1 integrin binding site (53Mercurio A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structural relationship of the α5 chain with αIIb and αv (reviewed in Ref. 27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9011) Google Scholar) could suggest other αβ integrin heterodimers as putative acceptors for GAG addition. Interestingly, Hayashi, Madri, and Yurchenco (54Hayashi K. Madri J.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have shown that endothelial cell interaction with the basement membrane proteoglycan (perlecan) occurs between the core protein of perlecan and β1 and β3 integrins, an interaction partially RGD-independent and modulated by GAGs. The β1integrin heterodimer involved in this adhesion resembles the α5β1 molecule and the β3integrin, the αvβ3 vitronectin receptor (54Hayashi K. Madri J.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The present study suggests for the first time that integrins such as α5β1 may have two extracellular binding sites that play a role in fibronectin binding. Previous studies have implicated a specific involvement of the heparin binding site of fibronectin with cell adhesion. These data were based on the fact that the purified fibronectin fragment containing only the heparin binding domain without the RGD peptide can promote adhesion in several different cell models (21McCarthy J.B. Chelberg M.K. Mickelson D.J. Furcht L.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Haugen D.K. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. Letournean P.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 106: 1365-1373Google Scholar). Because our work describes α5β1 integrin as a part-time proteoglycan compared with other αβ1 dimers, we can postulate that the fibronectin-α5β1 integrin interaction, which occurs primarily through the RGD peptide in fibronectin, is complemented and stabilized by the secondary interactions of α5β1 chondroitin or heparan sulfate chains with the fibronectin heparin binding domains. The possibility that α5β1 integrin, an integrin that binds only fibronectin, has chondroitin and heparan sulfate chains interacting with the fibronectin heparin binding domains is suggested by the facts that during ECM assembly the fibronectin heparin binding domain can also bind chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (10Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and that soluble proteoglycans can inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin (reviewed in Ref. 22Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the existence of nonintegrin fibronectin receptors like CD44 (a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) and a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (19Drake S. Klein D.J. Mickelson D.J. Oegema T.R. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 48Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) as well as by the recent finding that monoclonal antibodies raised against the fibronectin heparin binding domain (Hep II/IIICS) inhibit cell adhesion and also partially inhibit integrin binding to fibronectin (55Whittard J.D. Mould A.P. Craig S.E. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (abstr.): 47Google Scholar). A model is postulated in which the RGD and heparin binding sites in fibronectin, although linearly separated, are spatially close due to fibronectin folding. It is thus possible to assume that cell surface proteoglycans and integrin cooperativity during cell adhesion can really be achieved in the case of α5β1 integrin by two binding sites in the integrin molecule that bind RGD peptide and GAG binding domains in fibronectin.

Besides RXR and RAR, the hormone nuclear receptor superfamily also includes the steroid receptor, thyroid hormone receptors (TR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor as well as a number of orphan receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 5Giguère V.

These proteins modulate transcription via their association with specific nucleotide sequences, termed response elements (REs), that are located in the promoter region of target genes. Recognition sequences for thyroid and retinoid receptors consist of everted, inverted, or direct repeats of the consensus motif RG(G/T)TCA (9Näär A.M. Boutin J-M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M.

The association of some receptors with cognate DNA and activation of their target genes requires the presence of only a single, albeit extended, half-site of a RE. However, DNA binding by most hormone nuclear receptors relies on formation of receptor dimers and requires the presence of two repeats of the consensus core motif with a variable spacing between them (12Wilson T.E.

However, heterodimerization of these receptors with RXR usually increases the affinity and specificity of their association of with DNA (22Yu V. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V.

This suggests that RXR can function as a general binding partner that communicates between converging signaling pathways (27Bugge T.H. Pohl J. Lonnoy O. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 28Marks M.S. Hallenbeck P.H. Nagata T. Segars J.H. Appella E. Nikodem V.M. Ozato K.

Indeed, it has been recently shown that RXR is a transcriptionally active partner in RXR·RAR heterodimers and can contribute to gene activation in vivo resulting in cell differentiation and apoptosis (30Chen J-Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starret J. Tortolani D. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 1996; 382: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is well documented that ligands are important for transcriptional regulation by retinoid receptors, but only recently have the exact functions of ligand binding for the activities of the receptors begun to become clear. It has been demonstrated that ligand binding by RAR and TR results in the release of factors that associate with the unliganded receptor and act as co-repressors (31Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

The association of these co-repressors with RXR is much weaker and is not affected by ligand, suggesting that ligand-dependent regulation of the activity of RXR relies on a different mechanism (32Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 34Chen J.D.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Several co-activators, transcriptional intermediary factors, and general transcription factors have been recently shown to associate with RXR in a ligand-dependent or ligand-enhanced fashion (36Le Douarin B.

Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). It was suggested that ligand binding induces nuclear receptors to undergo transconformations that generate surfaces for binding of the accessory factors (43Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 44Renaud J-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Another important clue regarding the mechanism by which the activity of RXR may be regulated by its ligand emerged from our recent findings that RXR forms tetramers in solution with a high affinity and that the oligomeric state of this receptor is modulated by its ligand (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A regulatory role for this phenomenon was suggested by the observations that ligand binding by RXR tetramers displays a pronounced positive cooperativity and leads to a rapid and massive dissociation of receptor tetramers to dimers and monomers (48Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 49Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14263-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was thus proposed that ligand-induced dissociation of RXR tetramers is an essential step in transcription activation mediated by this receptor. In the present work we set out to investigate the consequences of the self-association of RXR for the DNA binding pattern by the receptor. Recombinant RXRα lacking the N-terminal A/B domain (RXRαΔAB) was obtained by overexpression in E. coli and isolated as described previously (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 50Chen Z-P. Shemshedini L. Durand B. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated protein was found to possess 0.65–0.85 mol of ligand binding sites/mol of protein. The receptor showed the expected ligand selectivity as it tightly bound 9cRA and several RXR-selective ligands but not all-trans-retinoic acid (51Kersten S. Dawson M.I. Lewis B.A. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1996; 34: 3816-3824Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The receptor also displayed the expected specificity for consensus response elements; it bound with a significantly stronger affinity to a DR-1 RE as compared with a DR-5 or TREpal REs. Purified protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol, and was stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Bacterial extracts containing full-length hRXRα were prepared as described by Lupisella et al. (52Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Mezler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides containing the following response elements were used: DR-1, a response element containing two direct repeats spaced by a single nucleotide (5′-TCGAGGGTAGGGGTCAGAGGTCACTCGTCGA-3′); DR-5, a response element composed of two direct repeats spaced by 5 nucleotides (5′-AGCTTGGCGCCGGGTCACCGAAAGGTCAGAATT-3′); TREpal(5′-AGCTTGGCGCCTCAGGTCATGACCTGAGAATT-3′); half-site, 5′-AGCTTGGCGCCAGGGGTCAGGTCAGAATT-3′; DR-1ext(5′-TCGACGGCAACAGCGGACATTTAAGTCGGTTAAGGGCTAGGGGTCAGAGGTCACTCCATA ATTGTCACACCGGATAAGGAGATTTGTGCTCGA-3′). The oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified at the Cornell DNA synthesis facility. Single-stranded DNA was annealed (53Kadonaga J.T. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and double-stranded DNA isolated on Centrex centrifugal filter units. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by filling in with Klenow fragments, and free nucleotides were removed with the Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. 1 μl of labeled oligonucleotide (50–200 nm; final concentration, 2.5–10 nm) and 1 μl of 2.4 mg/ml dI-dC were mixed with the indicated amounts of RXRαΔAB in 18 μl of 10 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mmdithiothreitol; 100 mm KCl, and 15% glycerol. Ligands were added from a concentrated solution in ethanol or Me2SO to a final concentration of 1 μm, and mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels (0.5 × TBE, 2–3 h prerun at 100 V, 2 h run at 25 mA/gel), the gel was dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. During electrophoresis, the gel was cooled with circulating water at 12 °C. Binding of RXR to DR-1 RE was analyzed by EMSAs using polyacrylamide gels with various acrylamide concentrations. The mobilities of receptor-DNA complexes were analyzed by the method of Ferguson as described by Bollag and Edelstein (54Bollag M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 143-160Google Scholar). The retardation factors (R f values) of individual bands in gels of differing acrylamide concentrations were plotted versusthe acrylamide concentration, and the resulting slopes were compared with those of protein standards with known molecular masses. These standards were ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa; monomer, dimer, and trimer), transferrin (76 kDa), transthyretin (55 kDa), and chymotrypsin (26 kDa). RXRαΔAB (10 μmin buffer A) was complexed with 9cRA at a ligand:protein molar ratio of 5:1. A small aliquot was removed and kept in the dark at 4 °C. The remainder of holo-RXR was photobleached using a hand-held UV lamp (4 watts, 366 nm). The lamp was placed about 1 inch above a quartz cuvette on ice containing the holo-RXR solution for a total of 6 min. We previously showed that RXR exists in solution as a monomer, dimer, and tetramer and that tetramers become the predominant species of the receptors at concentrations on the order of 50–100 nm (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As DNA binding by RXR is essential for its activity, it was of interest to explore which of the receptor oligomers can bind to cognate DNA. The DNA binding pattern of RXR was analyzed by EMSAs in the presence of a DR-1 RE (Fig. 1,lane 1), a DR-5 RE (lane 3), or a TREpal RE (lane 2). As previously reported (11Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DR-5 and TREpal displayed a lower affinity for RXR as compared with DR-1 and required higher protein concentrations for visualization of RXR·DNA complexes. Nevertheless, two distinct RXR·DNA complexes, with the slower moving band being the more pronounced complex, could be observed with all three REs. Thus, RXR appears to have two modes of association with DNA containing two half-sites of its recognition sequence. The presence of two RXR·DR-1 complexes in EMSAs carried out with receptor obtained by expression inEscherichia coli COS-1 cells and insect Sf9 cells was previously noted (11Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Chen Z-P. Shemshedini L. Durand B. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their compositions were not explored. To examine whether the faster moving band might represent monomeric DNA binding by RXR, EMSA was performed using an oligonucleotide containing a single half-site (Fig. 1, lane 4). No specific complex between RXR and oligonucleotides containing a half-site could be observed even at very high RXR concentrations ([RXR] = 10 μm). These data are in agreement with the reported cooperativity of DNA binding by this receptor (55Mader S. Chen J-Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and indicate that RXR monomers have a very low affinity for the response element. Thus, the faster moving band apparent in Fig. 1 reflects a receptor-DNA complex of a higher order than monomer. The compositions of the two DNA·RXR complexes were determined by analyzing EMSAs using the method of Ferguson, a procedure that allows for determining the molecular weight of species resolved by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (54Bollag M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 143-160Google Scholar). RXR/DNA mixtures were resolved on polyacrylamide gels of varying acrylamide concentrations. The R f values of the two RXR/DNA bands in gels of differing acrylamide concentrations were plottedversus the acrylamide concentration, and the resulting slopes were compared with those of protein standards with known molecular masses. Fig. 2 shows the Ferguson analysis relating the negative value of the slopes to the molecular weights of the standards. The mobilities of the two RXR·DNA complexes (arrows in Fig. 2) corresponded to molecular masses of 110 ± 14 and 181 ± 5 kDa (mean ± S.E.M., n= 3). As the molecular masses of RXRαΔAB and the DR-1 oligonucleotide are 40,270 and 18,200 Da, respectively, the molecular masses of the species represented by the faster moving band is most consistent with a complex comprised of a DNA-bound RXR dimer, while the slower moving band most likely represents a DNA-bound tetramer. Hence, these data demonstrate that RXR can bind to DNA containing a single response element either as a dimer or as a tetramer. The data in Fig. 2identified the oligomeric state of the two DNA·RXR complexes observed in EMSAs. However, these data are not precise enough to ascertain whether DNA-bound RXR tetramers are associated with 1 or with 2 oligonucleotides/tetramer, i.e. whether each dimer within the tetramer can separately interact with a response element or whether only two of the tetramer subunits are involved in DNA-receptor interactions. To distinguish between these two possibilities, EMSAs were carried out using a mixture of a short (31-base pair) and an extended (93-base pair) oligonucleotide containing a DR-1 response element. It was reasoned that if RXR tetramers associate with two DR-1 REs simultaneously, a complex in which a tetramer is bound to one short and one extended oligonucleotide will form when both oligonucleotides are present. Such a complex is expected to display a mobility that is intermediate between tetramer-DNA complexes observed in the presence of each of the DR-1 REs separately. In the presence of the extended DR-1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2), a predominant band with a low mobility and a minor band of higher mobility were observed. The addition of 9cRA to mixtures of RXR with the extended oligonucleotide led to a significant decrease in the concentration of the slower moving band with a concomitant enhancement of the population of the faster moving band (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 4). We previously reported that ligand binding by RXR tetramers in solution leads to rapid dissociation of receptor tetramers to dimers and monomers (48Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 49Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14263-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The observations in lanes 3and 4 thus indicate that, similar to the interactions of RXR with the short DR-1 (Fig. 1), RXR binds to the extended DR-1 as a dimer and as a tetramer, reflected by the faster and the slower moving bands, respectively. The data further imply that ligand binding by DNA-bound RXR tetramers, similar to the behavior of tetramers in solution, leads to their rapid dissociation to smaller species (see below). RXR tetramers and dimers complexed with the short oligonucleotide displayed a higher mobility than the corresponding species bound to the extended oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lane 9). In the presence of both oligonucleotides, a band with an intermediate mobility between the bands of RXR tetramers bound to the short versus the extended oligonucleotide became visible (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). This intermediate band most likely reflects the presence of a complex of RXR tetramers associated with one short and one extended DR-1 oligonucleotide, i.e. a complex that is composed of RXR tetramers associated with two oligonucleotides. No additional bands that might correspond to tetramers bound to a single DR-1 were apparent. The data thus suggest that the association of tetramers with a single oligonucleotide is weak and that binding of a second oligonucleotide significantly stabilizes the complex. Thus, binding of DR-1 oligonucleotides to RXR tetramers proceeds in a cooperative fashion. In addition, as free dimers efficiently associate with DR-1 REs, the low binding affinity toward the RE of each of the individual dimers within a RXR tetramer suggest that these dimers adopt a somewhat different conformation as compared with free dimers. To investigate the relative affinity of RXR tetramers versusdimers for a DR-1 RE, EMSAs of RXR with DR-1 were carried out at increasing protein concentrations under conditions of excess protein or excess cognate DNA (Fig. 4). Under conditions of limiting DNA (Fig. 4 A) and at a low protein concentration, the predominant band corresponded to a tetrameric RXR·DNA complex (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). As the protein concentration was incrementally raised, the tetrameric complex was enhanced until it reached a peak at a protein concentration of about 50 nm(lane 3) and then gradually diminished (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4–6). Concomitantly with the diminishment of the tetrameric complex, the dimeric complex gradually became the prominent species. In contrast, in the presence of excess DR-1, both the dimeric and the tetrameric RXR·DNA complexes intensified monotonously as the protein concentration was raised (Fig. 4 B). The origin of the apparent concentration dependence of DNA binding by RXR under conditions of a limiting DNA concentration is not completely clear to us at the present time. This behavior is especially puzzling if the concentration dependence of the oligomeric state of RXR in solution is taken into account; at low protein concentrations, where the concentrations of tetramers are low (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the tetrameric species seems to be the predominant DNA-bound RXR. On the other hand, at high protein concentrations, where tetramers are the predominant species in solution (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), RXR·DNA complexes appear to be mainly dimeric. Thus, the apparent concentration dependence of protein-DNA complexes in Fig.4 A cannot be explained based on the thermodynamic properties of the system, suggesting that under some conditions EMSAs do not properly report on the equilibrium situation. It is possible that kinetic effects, such as differential instabilities of complexes during electrophoresis, play a role in bringing about the observed profiles. In support of this explanation, an examination of the bottom region of the gel shows that, in contrast to what could be expected, the amount of free DNA and the region across which free DNA diffuses increased continuously as the protein concentration was raised. This behavior is indicative of gradual dissociation of complexes during electrophoresis, which became more pronounced at higher protein concentrations. The origin of the instability of protein-DNA complexes at high protein concentration is not clear. Nevertheless, these observations demonstrate that under different conditions EMSAs can result in the appearance of either the tetrameric or the dimeric complex or in the appearance of both RXR·DNA complexes. Hence, unless a range of conditions is explored, the presence of more than one species might be overlooked. The dissociation of protein-DNA complexes during electrophoresis in Fig. 4 A, lane 1, appears to be minimal. The relative distribution of tetrameric and dimeric RXR·DNA complexes in this lane may thus be used to assess the relative binding affinities of receptor dimers and tetramer for DR-1 RE. The concentration of RXR used in lane 1 was 12.5 nm, a concentration in which the fraction of RXR tetramers in solution is significantly lower than the fractions of either monomers or dimers (47Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the tetrameric RXR·DNA complex predominated, indicating that the binding energy driving the formation of the tetrameric RXR-DR-1 complex is significantly stronger as compared with that of the dimeric RXR-DR-1 complex. Overall, the observations in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that both RXR tetramers and dimers can bind to oligonucleotides containing two half-sites of their RE and that formation of a stable RXR tetramer-DNA complex requires the association of each dimer within the tetramers with a separate RE. The data also show that the affinity of REs for tetramers is higher than the affinity toward dimers. It was previously demonstrated that RXR tetramers, the predominant species of the unliganded receptor in solution, dissociat"

To investigate the general role of GPIs inT. cruzi, we generated GPI-deficient parasites by heterologous expression of T. bruceiGPI-phospholipase C. Putative protein-GPI intermediates were depleted, causing the biochemical equivalent of a dominant-negative loss of function mutation in the GPI pathway. Cell surface expression of major GPI-anchored proteins was diminished in GPI-deficient T. cruzi. Four proteins that are normally GPI-anchored in T. cruzi exhibited different fates during the GPI shortage; Ssp-4 and p75 were secreted prematurely, while protease gp50/55 and p60 were degraded intracellularly. These observations demonstrate that secretion and intracellular degradation of GPI-anchored proteins may occur in the same genetic background during a GPI deficiency. We postulate that the interaction between a protein-GPI transamidase and the COOH-terminal GPI signal sequence plays a pivotal role in determining the fate of these proteins.At a nonpermissive GPI deficiency, T. cruzi amastigotes inside mammalian cells replicated their single kinetoplast but failed at mitosis. Hence, in these protozoans, GPIs appear to be essential for nuclear division, but not for mitochondrial duplication.

J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), although the biological function of the majority of GPI-anchored proteins and protein-free GPIs (i.e. unattached to protein or carbohydrate) is unknown. Addressing the physiological functions of GPIs requires the construction of mutants categorically deficient in the GPI pathway; in most biological systems, such cells are not available. In murine T lymphomas, however, several viable mutants exist (3Tartakoff A.M. Singh N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), some of whose GPI-negative phenotype has been reversed with cloned genes (4Kinoshita T. Takeda J. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, some temperature-sensitive GPI mutants are nonviable (5Hamburger D. Egerton M. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Leidich S.D. Kostova Z. Latek R.R. Costello L.C. Drapp D.A. Gray W. Fassler J.S. Orlean P. J. Biol.

Protozoan parasites, which as a group cause about 5 million human deaths a year worldwide, have developmental stages in which proteins on their plasma membrane are overwhelmingly GPI-anchored. Examples include variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei, gp63 of Leishmania spp., circumsporozoite protein ofPlasmodium spp., and Ssp-4 of Trypanosoma cruzi(1Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses accounting for the overproduction of GPI-anchored proteins in these parasites have been advanced but none tested (7Ferguson M.A.J. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 48-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence that GPI anchors might be critical for the success of these protozoans as parasites lies in the fact that viable mutants in the “conserved core” of protein-GPIs (EtN-phospho-Man3-GlcN-PI) are unknown. Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which afflicts an estimated 18 million people in south and central America. Metacyclic trypomastigotes transmitted to humans byReduviid bugs enter mammalian cells where they differentiate into and replicate as amastigotes. Proliferation of amastigotes is critical to propagation of an infection because trypomastigotes cannot replicate. We sought to delineate possible functions of GPIs in T. cruzi. Since genes for targeted mutagenesis of the GPI pathway in these parasites are not available, we engineered a phenotypic GPI mutant of T. cruzi by heterologous expression of a GPI-phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from the related kinetoplastid T. brucei (8Hereld D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8914-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Carrington M. Bülow R. Reinke H. Overath P. Mol. Biochem.

GPI-PLC cleaves GPI anchor intermediates in vivo, causing the biochemical equivalent of a dominant-negative loss of function mutation in the GPI pathway (11Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins in GPI-deficientT. cruzi was reduced as compared with wild-type cells. With increased GPI-PLC expression by the parasite, amastigotes inside mammalian cells replicated their single mitochondrion but could not sustain mitosis. These studies establish a role for GPIs in intracellular replication of a protozoan parasite of humans. Since GPI-deficient mammalian cells are viable, drugs targeted at the GPI biosynthetic pathway of trypanosomes are likely to be of chemotherapeutic value. Epimastigotes of T. cruzi (Brazil strain) were cultured at 26 °C in liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Infective metacyclic trypomastigotes were obtained from 4-week-old stationary phase cultures of epimastigotes (12Castellani O. Ribeiro L.V. Fernandes J.F. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Amastigotes were converted extracellularly in LIT medium from Vero (ATCC-CRL-1586)-derived trypomastigotes (13Andrews N.W. Hong K.S. Robbins E.S. Nussenzweig V. Exp. Parasitol. 1987; 64: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An EcoRI fragment of T. brucei GPI-PLC cDNA from plasmid pDH4 (8Hereld D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8914-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of a T. cruzi episomal expression vector pTEX (14Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes were transfected (15Otsu K. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with 25 μg of pTEX.GPI-PLC. Following 48 h of incubation at 28 °C, G418 was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for selection of stable transformants, which were eventually subcultured in medium containing 200–800 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant cells were studied 3 months after drug selection. A pellet of 108 cells was lysed on ice in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 13.7 mmNaCl, 8 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (11Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The membranous pellet was washed with PBS (10 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and extracted with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (1 × AB). The detergent extract (1 × AB extract) was assayed for GPI-PLC activity using [3H]myristate-labeled variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of T. brucei as substrate (16Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Amastigotes were washed thrice with PBS and once with methionine-free RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Parasites (5 × 108) were resuspended in 5 ml of methionine-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS (dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (1322 Ci/mmol; Amersham) for 2 h, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 μg/ml nonradioactive methionine (chase medium) at 37 °C, 10% CO2. Resuspended cells (1 ml) were withdrawn at 0, 6, and 20 h into the “chase,” and harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The medium and cell pellet were stored separately at −20 °C until use. For ethanolamine labeling, washed amastigotes were resuspended in labeling medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 n NaOH, 20 mml-glutamine, and 1 × nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.) and labeled with 100 μCi/ml [1-3H]ethanolamine hydrochloride (50 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) for 16 h at 37 °C (11Mensa-Wilmot K.

Cells were harvested and stored as described above. [35S]Methionine or [1-3H]ethanolamine-labeled cells (5 × 107) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold immunoadsorption buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated as described (17Firestone G.L. Winguth D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled protein was eluted from the protein A-Sepharose-antibody-antigen complex by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 50 μl of 2.5 × SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE/fluorography with preflashed X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). [14C]Methylated proteins (Sigma) were used as molecular weight standards. Quantitation of the fluorograms was performed on an IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech. Corp.). [35S]Methionine-labeled wild-type T. cruzi amastigotes (5 × 107 cells) were lysed at 4 °C by incubation for 30 min in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 2% precondensed Triton X-114 (18Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protease inhibitor mixture (11Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Before lysis, parasites, when indicated, were treated with PI-PLC as described above. The lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature to separate the aqueous (detergent-depleted) and detergent-enriched phases. Triton X-114 (12%) was added to the aqueous phase, while Tris-buffered saline was added to detergent phase to finally have 2% Triton X-114 concentration in both phases. The phase separation was repeated. Aqueous and detergent-enriched phases were pooled separately, and proteins therein precipitated (19Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. [3H]Ethanolamine-labeled amastigotes (2 × 109 cells) were delipidated and extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (CMW, 10:10:3; Ref. 11Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Glycolipids (2 × 107 cell eq) were resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 in CMW, and detected by fluorography. To isolate GPIs, [3H]EtN-labeled glycolipids were resolved by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) in CMW on Silica Gel 60 plates. TcAmLP-3 (2 × 109 cell eq) was scraped from the TLC plate and extracted thrice each time with 1 ml of CMW. The eluates were pooled, dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 100 μl of n-butanol. Samples were stored at −20 °C until use. [3H]Man1–3GlcN-PI fromT. brucei (ILTat at 1.3) bloodstream form were generated in a cell-free system in presence of 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). [3H]EtN-labeled T. cruziglycolipids (2 × 107 cell eq), TLC-purified [3H]TcAmLP-3 (10,000 cpm), or standard [3H]Man1–3 GlcN-PI (10,000 cpm) were digested in a final volume of 100 μl as follows. To cleave with recombinant GPI-PLC (16Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the sample was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × AB and digested with 100 units (∼13 ng) of enzyme at 37 °C for 5 h. For digestion with Bacillus cereusPI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim), substrate was resuspended in 25 mm EtN-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.002% sodium azide containing 1 × 10−2 units of PI-PLC (17 ng), and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C (21Hernandez Munain C. Fernandez M.A. Alcina A. Fresno M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2, 24 units, from bee venom (Apis melifera), Sigma) was incubated with substrate in 1 × PLA2 buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2) for 5 h at room temperature. For mild base treatment, dried TcAmLP-3 or Man1–3GlcN-PI resuspended in 100 μl of 40% propan-1-ol, 13 m ammonia (1:1) was incubated at 37 °C overnight and then dried under a nitrogen stream at 40 °C. The dried product was resuspended in 15 μl of n-butanol for TLC analysis. TcAmLP-3 or Man1–3GlcN-PI were treated with 2 units of jack bean α-mannosidase (Oxford Glycosystems, Rosedale, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions at 37 °C overnight, in 200 μl of sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 2 mm zinc acetate containing 0.3% sodium taurodeoxycholate (22Kamitani T. Menon A.K. Hallaq Y. Warren C.D. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24611-24619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Products of cleavage were extracted with 300 μl of water-saturatedn-butanol, followed by two back extractions of the butanol phase with 300 μl of water. Butanol-soluble products were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 10 μl of n-butanol. Products from various digestions were resolved by TLC on Silica Gel 60 in CMW (10:10:3) or CHCl3:MeOH:0.25% KCl (11:9:2) as indicated in figure legends and detected by fluorography. [3H]EtN-labeled GPIs (from 1–3 × 109 parasites) were scraped after HPTLC in CMW from Silica Gel 60 plates (EM Separations, Gibbstown, NJ). Following dephosphorylation with hydrofluoric acid, the resulting neutral glycan was deaminated with nitrous acid and radiolabeled with sodium [3H]borohydride (DuPont NEN) (23Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The [3H]glycans were separated from impurities present in the sodium [3H]borohydride by HPTLC in propanol:acetone:water (PAW, 9:6:5) and elution of the appropriate carbohydrates with PAW. The eluates were dried down, resuspended in 100 μl of 40% propanol, and stored at −20 °C until use. Along with the TcAmLP-3, GPI-glycans Man3-GlcN and Man4-GlcN were isolated fromT. brucei (24Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Leishmania mexicana (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), respectively, for use as standards. The reduced neutral [3H]glycan (∼20,000 cpm) was resuspended in 100 μl of 100 mm trifluoroacetic acid and heated at 100 °C for 4 h. When needed, complete hydrolysis was carried out in 300 mm trifluoroacetic acid for 8 h. Additionally, the sealed reaction tube was monitored so that liquid which evaporated on to the cap was recovered repeatedly by microcentrifugation. After drying in a SpeedVac, the products were analyzed by HPTLC/fluorography. Reduced neutral [3H]glycans were digested with jack bean α-mannosidase (JBAM; 2.5 units/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) in 100 μl of 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, 1.5 mmZnSO4 for 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated and analyzed as described previously (23Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Dried, deaminated, reduced [3H]glycans were subjected to acetolysis and processed for HPTLC as described (23Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycans were resolved on aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates, which were developed sequentially in (i) 1-propanol/acetone/water (9:6:5, v/v/v), (ii) 1-propanol/acetone/water (5:4:1, v/v/v), and (iii) 1-propanol/acetone/water (9:6:5, v/v/v) (23Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). T. cruzi cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.1% sodium azide (PAB). For each assay, 1 × 106 parasites were resuspended in 50 μl of PAB containing purified antibody (100 μg/ml) at either 1:1000 dilution or in undiluted hybridoma supernatants and kept for 30 min at 4 °C. The parasites were washed with 1 ml of PAB and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark in 50 μl of PAB containing a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled affinity-purified goat F(Ab′)2 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (IgG+IgM) antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Parasites were washed, resuspended in 1 ml of PAB, and analyzed by flow cytometry on an EPICS 753 Elite cytofluorimeter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). In some experiments, before staining, parasites (2 × 107) were washed with PBS and then treated with 2 × 10−2 units of B. cereus PI-PLC. CSWAE1A cells (a neomycin-resistant mouse fibroblast cell line transfected with E1A gene of adenovirus) were irradiated with 7500 Rad to stop their division, and allowed to attach to coverslips in 24-well flat-bottomed culture plates for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI, 5% FBS containing 400 μg/ml G418. The fibroblasts were infected with metacyclic trypomastigotes (20:1, parasites:CSWAE1A cells) of pTEX/T. cruzi or pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi previously cultured in 400 μg/ml G418. Infected cells were stained with 1 mm SYTO 11 nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 10 min and visualized with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, MRC-600). Epimastigotes (extracellular insect stage form) of T. cruzi were transfected with pTEX.GPI-PLC (see “Experimental Procedures”) and selected in G418 to obtain stable transfectants, which were then converted to the different life cycle stages. Epimastigotes harboring pTEX.GPI-PLC and adapted to grow in 200 μg/ml G418 expressed approximately 370 units of GPI-PLC activity/108 cells. Adapting the cells to grow in higher concentrations of G418 (400 or 800 μg/ml) raised the level of GPI-PLC expression to 560 and 750 units (per 108 cells), respectively. The background level of VSG cleavage activity in control pTEX/T. cruzi epimastigotes was approximately 1.1 units/108 cells, representing 336–682-fold less activity than that present in pTEX.GPI-PLC transfectants. GPI anchors of proteins contain EtN in a conserved core composed of EtN-phospho-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6myo-inositol. To investigate the effect of GPI-PLC expression on free GPIs in vivo, we analyzed [3H]EtN-labeled glycolipids from wild-type and pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi amastigotes. GPI-PLC expressing amastigotes were deficient in an [3H]EtN-labeled glycolipid, termed TcAmLP-3 (Fig.1). As compared with the amount detected in wild-type cells (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and2), TcAmLP-3 was reduced 5-fold in pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi (Fig. 1, A and B). A less polar [3H]EtN-labeled glycolipid TcAmLP-4 was decreased 3-fold in pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi (Fig. 1, A andB). In vitro treatment of glycolipids from wild-type T. cruzi with purified recombinant GPI-PLC resulted in the cleavage of TcAmLP-3 and TcAmLP-4 (Fig. 1 C) as well as the molecules labeled as TcAmLP-1 and TcAmLP-2. These results suggested that TcAmLP-1 through TcAmLP-4 are GPIs. The possibility that decreased TcAmLP-3 and TcAmLP-4 in pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi is the result of a generalized reduction in cellular metabolism can be ruled out, because (i) the lipids migrating close to the solvent front (marked withasterisks) are present in approximately equal quantities in both wild-type and in pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2); (ii) no differences were observed between the wild-type and GPI-PLC transfectants in their [3H]EtN-labeled neutral lipids extracted with chloroform/methanol (Fig. 1 A,lanes 3 and 4); and (iii) approximately equal quantities of TcAmLP-5, TcAmLP-6, and TcAmLP-7, none of which was cleaved in vitro by GPI-PLC (data not shown), were detected in wild-typeT. cruzi and pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi (Fig. 1). TcAmLP-7 is not identical to TcAmLP-3, because the former molecule is not cleaved by GPI-PLC in vitro under conditions when the latter is cleaved (data not presented). These observations suggest that pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi and pTEX/T. cruzi are equally competent in general utilization of [3H]EtN. (We note that on occasion EtN labeling of TcAmLP-1 and TcAmLP-2 was greater than observed for TcAmLP-3 and TcAmLP-4 (see profiles in Fig.1 A and 1C). The data presented in Fig.1 A are more typical, and the occasional variability in the pattern of EtN-labeling does not alter our conclusions.) Information on the structure of TcAmLP-3 (Fig. 1) was obtained by a combination of enzymatic and chemical cleavages. [3H]EtN-labeled TcAmLP-3 was cleavedin vitro with purified PI-PLC from B. cereus andT. brucei GPI-PLC (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1and 5, respectively). TcAmLP-3 is resistant to JBAM digestion (Fig. 1 D, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that the terminal mannosyl (see next sections) was blocked: Under identical conditions, the mannosyl residues of the control GPIs (Man1–3GlcN-PI) were cleaved by JBAM (Fig. 1 D,lane 12). Treatment with phospholipase A2 did not affect the mobility of TcAmLP-3 (Fig. 1 D, lane 4). As a positive control, [3H]mannose-labeled Man1–3GlcN-PI from T. brucei was digested with PLA2 resulting in the loss of label (Fig. 1 D,lane 10). The lyso species of Man1–3GlcN-PI was detected in the aqueous phase of the butanol extraction (data not shown). TcAmLP-3, as well as Man1–3GlcN-PI, was sensitive to base treatment (Fig.1 D, lanes 6 and 11, respectively). Thus, the inability of PLA2 to cleave TcAmLP-3 suggests it contains a fatty acid only in the sn-1 position of a glycerolipid, or that the alkyl group is derived from ceramide. The latter possibility is excluded by the mild base sensitivity of TcAmLP-3. We infer from these properties that TcAmLP-3 is a GPI containing a phosphoglycerol backbone, which is acylated at thesn-1 position. The neutral glycan present in TcAmLP-3 (NG-TcAmLP-3) was characterized. GPI-glycan standards Man3-anhydromannitol (Man3-AHM) and Man4-AHM from T. brucei (26Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and L. mexicana (2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), respectively, were used as standards. The HPTLC mobility of NG-TcAmLP-3 indicated that it was smaller than Man3-AHM (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3). By partial acid hydrolysis, a ladder of glycans containing Man1-AHM, Man2-AHM, and Man3-AHM were generated from Man3-AHM and Man4-AHM (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 5, respectively). Comparing the mobility of these glycans with NG-TcAmLP-3 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 6 and 7) showed that Man1-AHM was the major component of TcAmLP-3. NG-TcAmLP-3 was subjected to acetolysis and JBAM treatment (Fig.2 C, lanes 7–9). After acetolysis, no change in the mobility of NG-TcAmLP-3 occurred, indicating the absence of an α1–6 glycosidic bond. Control Man3-AHM and Man4-AHM were both cleaved with production of Man1-AHM, as expected (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 5). Digestion of the NG-TcAmLP-3 with JBAM resulted in cleavage only of a minor species, which comigrated with Man3-AHM; AHM was not released from the T. cruziMan1-AHM species (Fig. 2 C, lane 9). (AHM was produced from the Man3-AHM and Man4-AHM standards (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 6).) Nevertheless, TcAmLP-3 can be metabolically labeled with [3H]mannose (data not presented) and with [3H]EtN (Fig. 1). In addition, trifluoroacetic acid released [3H]AHM from the neutral [3H]glycan of TcAmLP-3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 8), denoting the existence of glycosidic bonds in that molecule. The JBAM resistance suggests that the Man residue is most likely not in an α2, α3, or α6 linkage, since the enzyme's specificity for the terminal mannoses is α2Man, α6Man > α3Man. An α4Man linkage in NG-TcAmLP-3 (see below) might exhibit some relative resistance to JBAM. In summary, TcAmLP-3 consists predominantly of EtN-phospho-Man1-GlcN-Ins-phospho-sn-1-glycerolipid. Although we did not specifically determine the location of the EtN, we presume that it is found on the single mannosyl substituent, since it is the only component of GPI-glycans known to accept the phospho-EtN (reviewed in Ref. 2McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The effect of a GPI deficiency (see Fig.1 A) on the expression of cell surface proteins was assessed by staining three developmental stages (epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes) of T. cruzi with antibodies raised against GPI-anchored proteins. Flow cytometric analysis showed that in all three stages, the cell surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins was decreased in the GPI-deficient strain (pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi) relative to control wild-type or pTEX/T. cruziparasites (Fig. 3). In GPI-deficient epimastigotes stained with anti-gp50/55 (Fig. 3 A) and in amastigotes stained with anti-Ssp-4 or anti-gp50/55 (Fig. 3, C andD, respectively), the decrease in expression of these GPI-anchored proteins was similar to that obtained when wild-type parasites were treated with an excess of extracellularly added phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) fromBacillus cereus. Trypomastigotes of pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi also showed less cell surface expression of a trans-sialidase (evident by anti-SAPA (shed acute phase antigen) staining (Fig. 3 B)). The general decrease in cell surface expression of proteins in pTEX.GPI-PLC/T. cruzi was specific for GPI-anchored molecules, as shown by staining with the anti-amastigote antibody IC10B 2M. A. M.

We report here that RA also increases AP-1 activity in these cells. Transient transfection of B16 cells with luciferase reporter gene constructs indicated that RA induced a concentration-dependent increase in AP-1 activity. Acute treatment (2 h) of B16 cells with phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) increased AP-1 activity by 10-fold. RA treatment did not change the expression of Jun family members; however, it decreased the expression of c-Fos. In contrast acute PDB treatment induced c-Fos expression, while having little effect on c-Jun. Five DNA-protein complexes were formed with nuclear extracts from B16 cells and an oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 consensus sequence. Several complexes were decreased in cells treated with RA. Conversely, certain complexes were increased in cells acutely treated with PDB. The slowest migrating complexes were shown to contain Fos family members. Down-regulation of PKC inhibited both the acute PDB-induced and the RA-induced increase in AP-1 activity. The selective PKC enzyme inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide, reduced PDB-stimulated AP-1 activity, but enhanced RA-induced AP-1 activity. These results together with our previous studies suggest the intriguing possibility that PKC protein, but not enzyme activity, may be required for RA-induced AP-1 activity.

Several groups, including our own, have shown that the RA-induced differentiation of certain tumor cells is accompanied by an increase in PKC expression (5Makowske M. Ballester R. Cayre Y. Rosen O.M.

In B16 mouse melanoma cells RA induces a 5–8-fold increase in PKCα protein (9Murray A.W. Fournier A. Hardy S.J. Trands Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 53-54Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Niles R. Loewy B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4483-4487PubMed Google Scholar), which is accompanied by a selective enrichment of nuclear-associated PKCα (13Gruber J.R. Desai S. Blusztajn J.K. Niles R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCα in these cells results in a more differentiated phenotype (14Gruber J.R. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13356-13360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein plays an important role in RA-induced differentiation. PKC is thought to regulate gene expression by altering the activity of the AP-1 transcription complex (15Bohmann D. Bos R.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tijian R. Science. 1987; 238: 138601392Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). This complex is usually composed of Jun family homodimers or Jun/Fos family heterodimers (15Bohmann D. Bos R.J. Admon A.

Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). There is an interaction between retinoic acid receptors and the AP-1 transcription complex (19Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This ligand (RA)-dependent interaction results in a mutual loss of DNA binding activity to their respective response elements (20Yang Y.H.-F. Zhang X.-K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfhal M. New Biol. 1993; 3: 1206-1219Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this interaction is the mechanism by which RA inhibits cell proliferation (21Pfahl M. Skin Pharmacol. 1993; 6: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in RA-induced F9 teratocarcinoma differentiation, which is accompanied by growth arrest, AP-1 activity/DNA binding is increased (22Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R. Karin M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 351-361PubMed Google Scholar). F9 cell differentiation is also correlated with an increase in PKCα protein. Overexpression of PKCα induces some of the differentiation-dependent biochemical changes including induction of c-jun expression (23Kindregan H. Rosenbaum S.E. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27756-27761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the RA-induced increase in PKCα protein in B16 cells, we determined whether there was any change in AP-1 activity. We report here that RA treatment induces a 4-fold increase in AP-1 activity in these cells. However, the mechanism appears to be quite different from the increased AP-1 activity due to acute activation of PKC enzyme activity. B16 mouse melanoma cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 7% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. This medium contained 1 g/liter glucose and was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum (Sterile Systems, Logan, UT), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All-trans-RA was obtained from Fluka Chemical Co. (New York). All experiments involving the use of RA were conducted in subdued light to prevent photo-oxidation of the retinoid. A concentrated stock solution of RA (10 mm) was prepared in ethanol. This stock solution was diluted to the desired final concentration in tissue culture medium and was sterile filtered before adding to the cells. RNA was isolated by a single-step method as described previously (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). The RNA was then fractionated on 1% agarose containing formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) by downward alkaline blotting (25Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The transferred RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV light. The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h in 6 × SSC and 2% SDS.32P-Labeled cDNA probes (1 × 106dpm/ml) were then incubated with the membranes in fresh hybridization solution for 20 h. Blots were washed three times for 15 min each in 1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS, 0.5 × SSC + 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 × SSC + 0.1% SDS, respectively. The blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film in cassettes at −70 °C for 2–5 days. All the cDNA probes were labeled using the “prime-a-gene” labeling system from Promega (Madison, WI) + 0.25 mCi of [α-32P]dCTP. The relative amount of the different RNA species was quantitated by imaging the autoradiogram with a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer, making sure that the signals were within the linear range of the instrument. The data are expressed as the ratio of the specific mRNA to the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The following cDNA clones were used as probes in Northern blot analyses: pGEM-4 c-jun (rat) contains the complete 1.8-kb c-jun cDNA (26Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1989; 2: 1687-1699Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Clone pSP65 c-fos (rat) contains the full-length 2.2-kb c-fos cDNA (27Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogenes. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Clone pHcGAP (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was purchased from the ATCC. Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105/100-mm tissue culture dish. The following day cells were refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 10 μm RA. Cells were harvested at 24 and 48 h of incubation, by aspirating the growth medium, washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then preparing nuclear extracts by the method of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. Proteins (50 μg) were fractionated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% separating and 5% stacking gels. Proteins were then transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Corp.) by using a semidry transfer cell. The membrane was incubated in blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, TBST) overnight. Blots were then incubated with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-c-Jun antibody (Ab-2, Oncogene Science, Mineola, NY), or with 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-c-Fos antibody (Oncogene Science) for 1 h. They were then washed three times in TBST and incubated with 1:3000 dilution of secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Corp.) for 1 h. The membranes were washed three to five times in TBST, and signals were visualized by use of the ECL kit from Amersham Corp. The RNA PCR core kit provided by Perkin-Elmer was used for these assays. 1 μg of RNA from control or RA-treated B16 cells was converted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) (1.5 mm) as primers. The 30-μl reaction contained 1 × PCR buffer III, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmeach of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 30 units of RNasin. RNA was denatured at 70 °C for 3 min and cooled on ice before adding the above reagents. Samples were incubated for 45 min at 42 °C and then 10 min at 80 °C. PCR amplification of the cDNAs was performed using 50-μl reactions containing 1 × PCR buffer II, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, plus 2.0 units of Taq polymerase, 1.0 mmof each primer, and 10% of the cDNA synthesized in the RT reaction. Primer sequences for c-jun were (5′-ACCCAGTTCTTGTGCCCCAA-3′), junB(5′-AAACCCACCTTGGCGCTCAA-3′), and junD(5′-CCGGATCTTGGGCTCCTCAA-3′) (sequence information kindly provided by Dr. Steven Estus, Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky). All reactions were covered with a drop of mineral oil and subjected to 17–25 PCR cycles. The typical reaction conditions were 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The amplified cDNA products were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV light. c-jun, junB, and junDcDNAs were used as positive controls. Primers specific for β-actin were used to normalize the RNA in each RT reaction. An oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP-1 sequence (5′-CGCATGAGTCAGACA-3′) was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Nuclear extracts from control and treated cells (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 30,000 dpm of probe in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 12% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Where indicated, 1–2 μg of anti c-Jun or c-Fos antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated at room temperature for an additional 45 min. Samples were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels B16 cells were transfected with 4 μg of pGL-2-AP-1 DNA or the pGL-2 vector alone + 1 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase DNA to correct for transfection efficiency using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1630-1636Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation, the transfection medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with the various compounds as indicated under “Results.” Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using kits from Promega. All transfections were performed in triplicate dishes, and the experiments were repeated three to five times. Cells were lysed on ice in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% Trition X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Complete cell disruption was further ensured by three consecutive 10-s sonications with a Tekmar sonic disrupter at power setting 60. The total cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose anion exchange column (Cellex-D, Bio-Rad), previously equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The column was washed with 5 volumes of column buffer. The PKC fraction was eluted with 2.5 column volumes of buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and concentrated with a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations of samples were determined by the Pierce BCA reagent. Samples were diluted to equal protein concentrations (20 μg) and assayed with a commercially available PKC assay system (Amersham Corp.) + 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP in the presence and absence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and phosphatidylserine. The system utilizes synthetic, PKC-specific, substrate peptides, which become phosphorylated with the radiolabeled phosphate group from ATP. At the end of the reaction, the radiolabeled peptide was separated from the unincorporated 32P by the use of affinity paper for the peptide. The degree of phosphorylation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was calculated from counts/min taking into account the specific activity of the radioisotope and reaction time. Specific enzyme activity was obtained by subtracting the counts/min obtained in the absence of the lipid mixture from that obtained in the presence of the lipid mixture. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. The data in most figures are from a representative experiment, which was qualitatively similar in the repeat experiments. Data from all transfection experiments are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the mean of triplicate dishes of transfected cells for each treatment group. Since transfection experiments can have a higher degree of variability, these experiments were repeated a minimum of four to five times with similar qualitative results. Phorbol ester-activated PKC stimulates AP-1 activity (15Bohmann D. Bos R.J. Admon A. Nishimura T. Vogt P.K. Tijian R. Science. 1987; 238: 138601392Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In light of the 6–8-fold increase of PKCα protein in RA-treated B16 melanoma cells (10Niles R. Loewy B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4483-4487PubMed Google Scholar) and a selective enrichment of nuclear-associated PKCα (13Gruber J.R. Desai S. Blusztajn J.K. Niles R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we determined whether RA also increased AP-1 activity. B16 melanoma cells were transiently transfected with a pGL-2 plasmid containing four tandem AP-1 consensus sequences inserted 5′ to an SV-40 promoter driving the expression of luciferase. Transfected cells were treated for 24 h with or without various concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid. As a positive control, one group of transfected cells was treated with 1 μm PDB for the last 2 h of incubation. At the end of the incubation period (48 h from the start of transfection), all cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. These experiments (Fig. 1) revealed that B16 cells have endogenous AP-1 activity (pGL-2 without AP-1 sequences gave only background levels of luciferase activity) and that this activity is stimulated 9-fold by PDB. RA increased AP-1 activity 2-fold at the lowest concentration (10 nm), and the stimulation increased to 4-fold at the highest RA concentration (10 μm). The AP-1 transcription complex is most commonly composed of c-Jun homodimers or c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers. We examined the possibility that the RA and/or PDB-induced increase in AP-1 activity could be due to an increase in the expression of one of these transcription factors. The amount of c-jun and c-fos mRNA in control, PDB-treated, or RA-treated B16 cells was examined by Northern blotting. Two messages (3.2 and 2.6 kb) for c-jun were found in B16 cells (Fig.2 A). The 2.6-kb mRNA was the predominant form in these cells. c-jun mRNA was not consistently altered by RA treatment. The small increases depicted in this blot were not always seen in replicate experiments. In contrast, a 1-h treatment with PDB increased the amount of c-jun mRNA by 2-fold. B16 cells also express a 2.1-kb c-fos mRNA (Fig.2 B). Treatment of the cells with RA led to a consistent decrease in this c-fos message, while a 1-h treatment with PDB induced a 5-fold increase in the amount of c-fosmRNA. We were not able to detect junB or junDmRNA by Northern blotting. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was employed to examine the expression of thesejun family members. We found that these genes were expressed in B16 cells, but after ensuring a linear signal (by varying the number of PCR cycles and correcting by β-actin levels), we found no change in junB or junD mRNA levels (data not shown). To determine if the changes in mRNA were reflected in the amount of c-Jun or c-Fos protein, we treated B16 cells for different times with RA and measured the amount of the appropriate protein by Western blotting. B16 cells express a 39-kDa immunoreactive c-Jun protein (Fig.3 A). There was no consistent increase in the amount of this protein in RA-treated cells compared with untreated cells. The antibody used to detect c-Fos protein also recognizes Fos B as well as fra-1 and fra-2 (Fig. 3 B, NIH 3T3 cell extract used as a control). In control cells no signal was detected at 6 h, but these cells had increasing amounts of c-Fos protein at 24 and 48 h of incubation. The expression of other Fos family members was barely detectable in nuclear extracts from B16 cells. Treatment of these cells for 48 h with RA markedly decreased (60% of control) the amount of c-Fos protein compared with control cells at the same time point (Fig. 3 B). Since PDB induced a large increase in c-fos mRNA, we examined the time course for this induction at both the RNA and protein level. A 1-h PDB treatment increased c-fos mRNA by 4-fold (Fig. 4 A). This increase was transient and returned to unstimulated levels by 12 h despite the continued presence of PDB. PDB also increased the level of c-Fos protein within 2 h of treatment (Fig. 4 B). Similar to the increase in c-fos mRNA, the increase in protein was also transient and returned to unstimulated levels by 12 h. Fos B and fra-1 proteins were also increased by PDB, but the rate of increase was slower than for c-Fos (Fig. 4 B). Since RA did not increase the amount of any of the AP-1 family members, we determined whether an increase in binding activity might account for the RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled 15-base pair oligonucleotide containing one AP-1 consensus site, five protein-DNA complexes were observed (Fig. 5 A). Complex 5 was absent when nuclear extracts from 24- or 48-h RA-treated cells were analyzed. Nuclear extracts from 48-h RA-treated cells were also missing complex 1, while the binding activity of complexes 2 and 4 were reduced compared with control cells (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, nuclear extracts from B16 cells treated for 2 h with PDB had markedly increased binding activity of complex 2. As the time of PDB treatment was increased, binding activity of complexes 1 and 2 decreased, but the activity of complexes 4 and 5 increased dramatically. Incubation of nuclear extracts with antibodies to c-Jun did not change the intensity of any bands, nor were any bands supershifted. In contrast, incubation of the nuclear extracts with c-Fos antiserum decreased the binding activity of complexes 1 and 2 and also induced the formation of a supershifted complex. Competition experiments with nonradioactive wild type and mutant AP-1 oligonucleotides indicated the following sensitivity: complex 1 > complex 4 > complex 2 = complex 3 > complex 5. All five complexes were still present at a 50-fold excess of the mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B). RA-induced differentiation of B16 cells is accompanied by a 6–8-fold increase in PKCα mRNA and protein. PDB, via its activation of PKC, is known to increase AP-1 activity. Therefore we investigated whether PKC was required for the RA-induced increase in AP-1 activity in B16 melanoma cells. We down-regulated PKC protein in cells transfected with the AP-1-luciferase reporter gene by chronic PDB treatment and measured their ability to respond to RA. We also treated the transfected cells with the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide and measured the ability of RA or PDB to increase AP-1 activity. Fig.6 A shows that down-regulation of PKC inhibited both the acute PDB-induced (lane 2 versus 5) and the RA-induced (lane 3 versus 6) increase in AP-1 activity. Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 B) shows that RA induced PKCα, while chronic PDB treatment depleted the cells of PKCα. RA + PDB-treated cells have PKCα levels slightly lower than control cells, but higher than cells treated with PDB for 24 h. In separate experiments we tested the effect of inhibition of PKC enzyme activity on the PDB and RA-induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity. We found that PKC enzyme activity from B16 cells was reduced by 90% at 0.1 μm bisindolylmaleimide and was not detectable at 1.0 μm concentration of this inhibitor (Fig.7 A). When this inhibitor was added to the transfected cells, it reduced the PDB-induced AP-1 activity from 11-fold down to 4-fold. In contrast, the inhibitor enhanced RA-induced AP-1 activity from 5-fold to 8-fold. To determine if changes in the level of PKCα might explain these unanticipated results, Western blot analysis was performed on cells treated/untreated with 10 μm RA, 2 μm bisindolylmaleimide, or a combination of these two compounds. We found an increase in PKCα protein in inhibitor-treated cells compared with the controls. PKCα protein was also increased in RA + inhibitor-treated cells compared with RA-treated cells (Fig. 7 C).Figure 7The effect of inhibition of PKC enzyme activity on RA- and PDB-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity. A, cells were harvested, and PKC-enriched fractions were obtained by ion-exchange chromatography. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” plus or minus different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1 μm) of bisindolylmaleimide. PKC-specific activity is expressed as picomoles of32P transferred to peptide substrate/min/μg of protein.B, B16 cells were transfected with the 4 × AP-1 reporter plasmid and the β-galactosidase plasmid as described previously. Following transfection, cells were treated with 1 μm PDB (2 h), 10 μm RA (24 h), 2.5 μm bisindolylmaleimide (24 h), bisindolylmaleimide + RA (24 h), or bisindolylmaleimide + PDB (24 h and 2 h, respectively). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. This experiment was performed in triplicate, and the entire experiment was repeated four times. The data presented are the mean ± S.E. of the mean (error bars) of triplicate dishes for each treatment group from a representative experiment. C, cells were treated with 10 μm RA, 2.5 μmbisindolylmaleimide, or a combination of these two agents for 24 h. Total cell extracts (75 μg) were then analyzed for the amount of PKCα by Western blotting using an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have demonstrated that RA increases AP-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. This is in marked contrast to several studies in which RA inhibited AP-1 transcriptional activity (19Schule R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 20Yang Y.H.-F. Zhang X.-K. Graupner G. Tzukerman M. Sakamoto B. Karin M. Pfhal M. New Biol. 1993; 3: 1206-1219Google Scholar). RA-induced F9 teratocarcinoma differentiation, however, is also accompanied by an increase in c-junexpression and enhanced AP-1 binding activity (22Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R. Karin M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 351-361PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-jun leads to differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells in the absence of RA (23Kindregan H. Rosenbaum S.E. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27756-27761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for c-Jun in RA-induced differentiation. We examined the possibility that, similar to F9 teratocarcinoma cells, RA increases the expression of one of the members of the AP-1 transcription complex. RA did not increase the expression of anyfos or jun family member, but instead decreased the expression of c-fos mRNA and c-Fos, Fos B, and fra-1 proteins. Busam et al. (30Busam K.J. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19971-19977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that RA decreased mitogen-induction of c-fos mRNA. They also found that the induction of c-jun mRNA was suppressed, but required higher concentrations of RA and a longer period of incubation. We found that the mitogen, PDB, transiently increased c-Fos family member protein expression in B16 cells. Interestingly, Fos B and fra-1 increased more slowly than c-Fos. Delayed expression of fra-1 and fra-2 with serum stimulation has previously been reported (31Cohen D.R. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2063-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A possible explanation may lie in the observation that c-Fos can transactivate the fra-1 and fra-2 genes (32Yoshida T. Sato H. Iba H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity may not involve a c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer. Since an increase in members of the AP-1 transcription complex could not explain the RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity, we examined the possibility that RA altered AP-1 DNA binding activity. Using a consensus oligonucleotide from the AP-1 site in the collagenase gene and nuclear proteins from untreated B16 cells, we observed five protein-DNA complexes. Instead of enhancing binding, RA inhibited the appearance of complex 5 and with longer times of incubation (48 h) also inhibited the appearance of complex 1. Also, the intensity of complexes 2 and 4 was reduced by a 48-h treatment of the B16 cells with RA. Short term (2 h) treatment of cells with PDB increased the intensity of complex 2, but with longer times of treatment this change was reversed, and the intensity of complexes 4 and 5 dramatically increased. Since a Fos antiserum diminished the intensity of complexes 1 and 2 and caused a “supershifted” complex, we conclude that these complexes contain members of the Fos family. A variety of Jun antisera failed to diminish the appearance or to “supershift” any complex. Some of these same antisera successfully recognized c-Jun on Western blots. Since the electrophoretic mobility shift assay is conducted under nondenaturing conditions, one explanation for these results is that the epitope recognized by the antibodies is unavailable under the electrophoretic mobility shift assay conditions. Alternatively, c-Jun may not be involved in AP-1 complexes using our assay conditions (B16 melanoma nuclear extracts, specific AP-1 oligonucleotide). The acute PDB-induced increase in complex 2 and its decrease in RA-treated cells probably reflects the opposite effect of these agents on the expression of c-Fos. Since we have shown that chronic treatment with PDB depletes B16 cells of PKCα, the major isotype expressed by these cells (33Niles R.M. Mahalingam H. Vaughn J. Novotny J. Gruber J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the decrease in complex 2 and the increase in complexes 4 and 5 may reflect a change in the expression of AP-1-associated transcription factors regulated through the PKC pathway. Overall, these results suggest that the RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity cannot be explained by an increase in binding activity. Finally, we examined the role of PKC in the RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity. We found that down-regulation of PKC, through chronic PDB treatment, inhibited both acute PDB and RA-induced increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity. However, the PKC-specific enzyme inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide, enhanced RA-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity, while inhibiting acute PDB stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity by 60%. These data lead to a tentative conclusion that PKC protein, but not PKC enzyme activity, is required for the RA induction of AP-1 activity. It has been reported that PKC stimulates phospholipase D activity through a nonenzymatic mechanism (34Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Also PKC binds to proteins other than substrates (35Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKC enzyme activity also increased the amount of PKCα protein (Fig. 7 C). A likely explanation for this result is the enhanced proteolysis of activated PKC (37Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would be diminished in bisindolylmaleimide-treated cells. The finding that inhibition of PKC enzyme activity enhanced RA-stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activity correlates with other data presented in this study. It reinforces the conclusion that activation of PKC enzyme activity (via PDB) increases AP-1 activity by a different pathway than that induced by RA. Our data also suggest that the two pathways are antagonistic to each other. This might provide a molecular explanation for the antagonistic action of phorbol esters and RA on B16 melanoma growth and differentiation (10Niles R. Loewy B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4483-4487PubMed Google Scholar, 33Niles R.M. Mahalingam H. Vaughn J. Novotny J. Gruber J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, while both agents increase AP-1 transcriptional activity, the effect of PDB is transient, while RA has a prolonged effect (elevated through at least 36 h of treatment; data not shown). Sustained elevation of AP-1 activity might be required for activation of pathways leading to differentiation in these melanoma cells. Current investigation is focused on the mechanism by which RA increases AP-1 transcriptional activity and the consequence of this activity for RA-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2015198580,"The regulation of protein synthesis was studied in KRC-7 cells (rat hepatoma) grown in complete medium, during serum starvation, and mitogen activation. Upon serum starvation, the cells lost almost completely p67 mRNA, p67 protein, and protein synthesis activity. After phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate addition, the same serum-starved cells regained p67 mRNA, p67 protein, and protein synthesis activity. Also, the extracts from the serum-starved cells phosphorylated the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) α-subunit. This eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation was not observed when the extracts from either the cells grown in complete medium or mitogen-activated cells were used (Gupta, S., Wu, S., Chatterjee, N., Ilan, J., Ilan, J., Osterman, J. C., and Gupta, N. K. (1995) Gene Expr. 5, 113–122). We now report the following. 1) The eIF-2 kinase activity was the same in the cells grown in complete medium, after serum starvation, and subsequent mitogen stimulation. However, the eIF-2 kinase in the cells grown in complete medium and also after mitogen activation of the serum-starved cells cannot phosphorylate eIF-2 α-subunit as these cells contain p67. After removal of endogenous p67 by p67 antibodies, the extracts from all these cells similarly phosphorylated exogenously added eIF-2. 2) None of the cell extracts showed p67 deglycosylase activity. 3) The p67 mRNA was synthesized in serum-starved cells by expression of a p67 cDNA. The appearance of p67 mRNA in the serum-starved cells was accompanied by the appearance of p67 protein. Also, the rates of protein synthesis in the serum-starved cells were restored nearly to the level observed in the confluent cells. The expression of p67 cDNA also significantly increased protein synthesis rates in the cells grown in complete medium and in mitogen-activated cells. These results show that the loss of protein synthesis activity in serum-starved cells was due to loss of p67 mRNA. The expressed p67 mRNA was stable in serum-starved cells. These results, therefore, suggest that the loss of p67 mRNA in serum-starved cells is due to loss of p67 transcription. The p67 transcription regulates translation.

An important regulatory mechanism in animal cells involves phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the eIF-2 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; p67, eIF-2-associated 67-kDa glycoprotein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; p67, eIF-2-associated 67-kDa glycoprotein; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. by eIF-2 kinases, heme-regulated protein synthesis inhibitor, and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. This inactivates eIF-2 activity and inhibits protein synthesis (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have indicated that the animal cells widely use this phosphorylation mechanism to regulate protein synthesis under different physiological conditions include serum starvation (2Duncan R.

We have previously reported that a 67-kDa glycoprotein (p67) protects the eIF-2 α-subunit from inhibitory phosphorylation by eIF-2 kinase(s). This promotes protein synthesis in the presence of active eIF-2 kinase(s) in the cells (8Datta B. Chakrabarti D. Roy A.L. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3324-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The p67 contains multipleO-linked GlcNac residues (9Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar O-linked GlcNac residues are also present on numerous regulatory proteins including transcriptional activators (11Hart G.W. Haltwinger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). An important characteristic of p67 is that this protein is rapidly degraded and is induced under certain physiological conditions (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Also, the level of this protein correlates directly with the protein synthesis activity of the cells. These observations suggest that p67 plays a critical role in regulation of protein synthesis. Our previous reports have indicated that p67 levels in cells are regulated by two independent mechanisms. One of them is protein deglycosylation. During heme deficiency, in reticulocyte lysate (12Chakraborty A. Saha D. Bose A. Chatterjee M. Gupta N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and also during vaccinia viral infection of animal cells (13Bose A. Gupta S. Saha D. Chatterjee N. Chakraborty A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB48, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD1996: 1-6Google Scholar, 14Bose A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB49, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD.1996: 1-6Google Scholar) a latent p67 deglycosylase is activated. The activated deglycosylase deglycosylates p67 and inactivates it. The second one is variations of p67 mRNA levels. Using a Northern blot procedure, we provided evidence (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar) that p67 mRNA is present in the KRC-7 cells grown in complete medium. This mRNA disappears almost completely from serum-starved cells. However, when PMA was added to the serum-starved cells, p67 mRNA appeared in increasing quantities. The level of p67 mRNA in the cells correlated directly with the p67 protein level and also with the protein synthesis activity of the cells. We have now studied the detailed mechanism of regulation of p67 mRNA, p67 protein, and protein synthesis activity in KRC-7 cells during serum starvation and subsequent mitogen activation. Several questions remain unanswered. The mechanism of disappearance of p67 mRNA and protein in serum-starved cells remains unanswered. This disappearance could be due to shut-off of p67 transcription and subsequent slow decay of the p67 transcript. Alternatively, nuclease activation in serum-starved cells may rapidly degrade p67 mRNA. In the absence of new p67 mRNA synthesis, p67 protein may slowly decay. Alternatively, a latent p67 deglycosylase may be activated in the serum-starved cells. This activated deglycosylase may rapidly deglycosylate newly synthesized p67. The deglycosylated p67 will then degrade. The requirement of p67 mRNA and p67 protein in protein synthesis is another aspect that needs to be investigated. Upon serum starvation, both p67 mRNA and p67 protein disappear. This accompanies loss of protein synthesis activity of the cells. These results, however, do not provide a conclusive evidence for the single requirement of p67 mRNA or p67 protein in overall protein synthesis in the cells. Other protein factors, besides p67, may also be lost after serum deprivation. These factor(s) may also be essential for protein synthesis. In the present work, we have expressed p67 cDNA in transformed KRC-7 cells grown in complete medium, during serum starvation, and subsequent mitogen activation. We have studied the effects of expression of this p67 cDNA on p67 mRNA and p67 protein synthesis. The cloned cell line KRC-7, derived from Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cells, was kindly provided by John Koontz (University of Tennessee, Knoxville). The cells were grown as described previously (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). The serum-starved cells were prepared by washing cell monolayers with Hank's balanced solution followed by culturing in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for an additional 3 days. A part of these cells were then activated by addition of 1.5 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) for 2 h. For analysis, 6 × 105 cells were seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes containing 10 ml of the medium. The pOPRSVI-CAT vector (Stratagene) is an episomal mammalian expression vector. It was used to express the p67 cDNA. It has also a neomycin resistance gene as a selection marker. For preparation of pOPRSVI-p67, the p67 gene was excised from pGEM-p67 (16Wu S. Gupta S. Chatterjee N. Hileman R.E. Kinzy T.G. Denslow N.D. Merrick W.C. Chakrabarti D. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10796-10801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using NotI. The CAT gene was similarly removed from pOPRSVI CAT by NotI digestion. The 5467-bp linearized pOPRSVI and the 1.9-kb p67 cDNA were gel-purified using GeneClean® II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The fragments were then ligated using standard protocol to make the pOPRSVI-p67 construct. The pOPRSVI-p67 construct was then amplified by cell transformation into Epicurian Coli® XL1-Blue MR competent cells (Stratagene). The positive colonies were checked by standard miniprep method and NotI digestion to ensure the presence of the intact insert. To ensure proper orientation, the plasmid was digested withHindIII. Three DNA fragments (5.6, 1.5, and 0.267 kb) were produced as expected (data not shown). The correct orientation was also confirmed through sequencing (data not shown). The positive colonies were then amplified and pOPRSVI-p67 was purified. The existence of pOPRSVI-p67 DNA in KRC-7 cells was confirmed by Southern blot ofSacI-digested episomal DNA (purified by Hirt extraction protocol) (17Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). The probe used was random primer labeled 300-bp fragment from p67 cDNA (positions 400–700 bp). A single fragment at the position 7.4-kb confirmed the presence of pOPRSVI-p67 plasmid (data not shown). This result indicates that POPRSVI-p67 vector DNA was maintained as an episome inside the cells. In each case, the plasmids were isolated from 2 × 107 cells. The plasmids wereSacI-digested and then quantitated by using the random primer-labeled probe containing the p67 cDNA sequence (300 bp (400–700 bp from p67 cDNA)). Based on a molecular mass of 4662 kDa of pOPRSVI-p67 construct, it was calculated that there were approximately 300 copy numbers/cell. The pOPRSVI-p67 constructs with p67 cDNA (pOPRSVI-p67) and without p67 cDNA (pOPRSVI-0) were used to transfect the rat hepatoma cell line KRC-7 using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). 50 μl of Lipofectin reagent and 10 μg of the construct were used. The cells were then selected in geneticin (800 μg/ml). The selection procedure took approximately 3 weeks. The Northern blot technique was the same as described (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown under different growth conditions (the cells grown in complete medium (50–70%), serum-starved, and PMA-induced) and were then harvested. The total RNA was isolated using guanidium isothiocyanate method (18Chomczynnski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar) and was analyzed (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoblot analysis was used to measure p67protein levels in the cell extract (6 × 105 cells) at different physiological condition (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The wild type cells and also the KRC-7 cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 vectors with p67 cDNA were grown to 50–70% confluency in complete medium. The cells were then starved in serum-free medium for 3 days. The starved cells were then incubated with PMA (1.5 μm) for 2 h. The cell extracts were prepared as described (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The equal concentrations of proteins (100 μg) from each cell extract were used. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and were then transferred to Biotrace NT membranes. The proteins were immunoblotted using p67 mono- or p67 polyclonal antibodies (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As reported (19Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Gupta N.K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 25: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar), the p67 monoclonal antibodies recognize specifically the glycosyl residues of p67. These antibodies were routinely used for studies of p67 deglycosylation. The reaction conditions for eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation by eIF-2 kinases using cell-free extracts were the same as described (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The radioactively labeled eIF-2 α(P) formed during incubation was immunoprecipitated using eIF-2 α-polyclonal antibodies and Protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to 50–70% confluency. A part of these cells were then starved in serum-free medium for 3 days. After 3 days of serum starvation, the cells were treated with PMA for 2 h. All these cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were incubated in short term labeling medium (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) lacking methionine) at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in an incubator for 15 min. The cells (1 × 106) were then washed and incubated in short term labeling medium for 10, 20, and 30 min in the presence of 0.1 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine. The cells were then harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins (10 μg) in the cell extracts were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and were detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film. The extracts from the cells grown in complete medium, serum-starved, and PMA-induced KRC-7 cells were analyzed for eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation. Excess exogenous eIF-2 was added. The eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation was measured both before and after removal of endogenous p67 by treatment of the cell extracts with p67 polyclonal antibodies. Without p67 antibody treatment, the extent of eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation should be the result of the combined action of both endogenous p67 and eIF-2 kinase(s). If the p67 level is high, p67 will protect eIF-2 α-subunit from eIF-2 kinase(s). After p67 antibody treatment, the endogenous eIF-2 kinase(s) will phosphorylate eIF-2 α-subunit. The extent of this phosphorylation should be a measure of the eIF-2 kinase activity of the cells. Our previous report has indicated that p67 antibody treatment increased eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in hemin-supplemented reticulocyte lysate presumably because these antibodies inactivated endogenous p67 (10Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadhyay A. Meza-Keuthen S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Saha D. Bose A. Chatterjee M. Gupta N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We used two different protein concentrations in the cell extracts (100 and 200 μg). The results without p67 antibody treatment are shown in Fig. 1, panel A. The extracts from the cells grown in complete medium (lanes 1 and 2) and the mitogen (PMA)-activated (lanes 5 and 6) cells did not show detectable phosphorylation. However, the extracts from the serum-starved cells significantly phosphorylated eIF-2 (lane 3), and the extent of this phosphorylation increased with increasing concentration of the proteins used in the experiments (lane 4). The experiment described in panel B was carried out under similar conditions as described in panel Aexcept that these cell extracts were preincubated with excess p67 antibodies. The extent of eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in all the cell extracts significantly increased and were nearly the same at equal protein concentration in each cell extract. The eIF-2 α-subunit intensities of the phosphorylation bands in panel B were determined. They were as follows: lane 1, 1.0; lane 2, 1.8; lane 3, 0.98; lane 4, 1.6;lane 5, 1.0; and lane 6, 1.9. As mentioned, the above experiments were performed with exogenously added eIF-2 (Fig. 2). Similar experiments were also performed without exogenous eIF-2 (data not shown). These results were the same (also see Fig. 5). These results indicate that the eIF-2 kinase and not eIF-2 is limiting in the cell extracts. These results also indicate that an eIF-2 kinase remains in active form and at the same level under different growth conditions. The p67 level in the cells varies under different growth conditions. This p67 level correlates with the ability of the cell extracts to phosphorylate eIF-2 α-subunit.Figure 5Analysis of eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in transformed KRC-7 cells. The experimental conditions were the same as described in Fig. 1 except that the extracts from the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 (the cells grown in complete medium, serum-starved, and mitogen-activated) were used. The experiments described in panel B were done after preincubation of the cell extracts with excess p67 antibodies. Panels A andB, the protein concentrations used were as follows:lane 1, 100 μg from the cells grown in complete medium cells; lane 2, 200 μg from the cells grown in complete medium cells; lane 3, 100 μg from serum-starved cells;lane 4, 200 μg from serum-starved cells; lane 5, 100 μg from serum-starved and PMA-activated cells; lane 6, 200 μg from serum-starved and PMA-activated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p67 deglycosylase activity in KRC-7 cells was assayed under different growth conditions (Fig. 2). As reported (13Bose A. Gupta S. Saha D. Chatterjee N. Chakraborty A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB48, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD1996: 1-6Google Scholar, 14Bose A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB49, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD.1996: 1-6Google Scholar), the KRC-7 cells contain a latent p67 deglycosylase. This p67 deglycosylase is activated immediately after vaccinia viral infection. In our experiments, we have used as a control an extract from the vaccinia viral infected KRC-7 cells. The p67 deglycosylation of the exogenously added p67 was measured by immunoblotting using p67 monoclonal (panels A–C, lanes 1–4) and polyclonal (panels A–C, lanes 5–8) antibodies. As expected, the p67 monoclonal antibody-reactive materials rapidly disappeared in the extracts form the vaccinia viral infected cells (panel A, lanes 1–4), and the polyclonal reactive materials remained relatively stable (panel A, lanes 5–8). Under similar experimental conditions, both the p67 mono- and polyclonal reactive materials remained essentially unchanged in the extracts from the cells grown in complete medium (panel B, lanes 1–4, p67 monoclonal antibodies; lanes 5–8, p67 polyclonal antibodies) and the serum-starved cells (panel C, lanes 1–4, p67 monoclonal antibodies; lanes 5–8, p67 polyclonal antibodies). These results show that although KRC-7 cells contain a latent p67 deglycosylase, this p67 deglycosylase is not activated in serum-starved cells and is not responsible for p67 disappearance in these cells. The p67 mRNA was determined in wild type and in pOPRSVI-p67 transformed KRC-7 cells under different growth conditions (Fig. 3). The standard Northern blotting procedure was used (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). An equal amount of RNA (15 μg) in each experiment was used. This RNA showed similar 28 S rRNA bands when analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by staining using ethidium bromide (data not shown). As shown (Fig. 3, panel A), the p67 mRNA was present in the cells grown in complete medium (lane 1), and the level of this mRNA increased slightly when PMA was added to the cells grown in complete medium (lane 2). Also, the p67 mRNA level in the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 increased significantly (lane 3). This level remained unchanged upon PMA addition (lane 4). Upon serum starvation for 3 days, the p67 mRNA almost completely disappeared from the wild type KRC-7 cells (lane 5). This level appeared in increased quantities after 2 h of PMA addition (lane 6). By expression of p67 cDNA in the serum-starved transformed cells, the p67 mRNA was restored to nearly the same level as in the the cells grown in complete medium (lane 7). Upon addition of PMA in these cells, the p67 mRNA appeared in increased quantities after 2 h in the transformed serum-starved cells (lane 8). The size of the p67 mRNA (1.9 kb) synthesized in the presence of p67 cDNA was similar to the endogenous p67 mRNA (2 kb, (16Wu S. Gupta S. Chatterjee N. Hileman R.E. Kinzy T.G. Denslow N.D. Merrick W.C. Chakrabarti D. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10796-10801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The levels of a controlled RNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA remained essentially unchanged during different growth conditions (Fig.4, panel B). As control, we also used KRC-7 cells transformed with pOPRSVI-0. The p67 mRNA remained essentially the same as in the wild type KRC-7 cells (data not shown). These results provide evidence that p67 cDNA in the construct synthesizes p67 mRNA in the serum-starved cells. Using the Image Quant software, the relative intensities of the Northern blot bands in panel A were determined. They were as follows: lane 1, 1.0;lane 2, 1.4; lane 3, 4.4; lane 4, 4.2;lane 5, 0.3; lane 6, 9.7; lane 7, 1.0, and lane 8, 12.78. The p67 protein levels in the wild type and in the transformed cells were determined using standard immunoblot procedures (Fig. 4). The p67 protein is present in the KRC-7 cells grown in complete medium (lane 1). This protein level remained the same when these cells were treated with PMA (lane 2). The p67 protein level also remained essentially the same in the KRC-7 cells transformed with pORSVI-p67 without (lane 3) and with PMA (lane 4) addition. The p67 protein disappeared from the serum-starved KRC-7 cells (lane 5). However, this protein was present in the serum-starved cells transformed with pORSVI-p67 at a level comparable to that observed in the cells grown in complete medium (lane 7). Upon PMA addition, the p67 protein appeared in both wild type (lane 6) and the serum-starved cells transformed with pORSVI-p67 (lane 8). The level in both cases was essentially the same. These results provide evidence that p67 cDNA synthesized p67 mRNA in serum-starved cells. This p67 mRNA synthesized p67 protein. The cell extracts from the KRC-7 cells transformed with pORSVI-p67 under different growth conditions were analyzed for eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation (Fig. 5). The same experimental conditions as described in Fig. 1 were used except that exogenous eIF-2 was not added. As before, the eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation was measured using two different protein concentrations (100 and 200 μg). As shown in panel A, upon expression of p67 cDNA in the transformed cells, none of the cell extracts (the cells grown in complete medium, lanes 1 and 2; serum-starved,lanes 3 and 4; and mitogen-activated, lanes 5 and 6) showed any detectable eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation. The experiments described in panel B were carried out under similar conditions as described in panel Aexcept that these cell extracts were preincubated with excess p67 antibodies to remove endogenous p67. The extent of eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in all the cell extracts significantly increased and were nearly the same at equal protein concentrations from each cell extract. The eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in each case increased similarly with increasing protein concentrations in each cell extract (compare lanes 1, 3, 5 with 2, 4, 6). These results show that the p67 protein synthesized in the serum-starved cells by expression of p67 cDNA protected eIF-2 α-subunit from eIF-2 kinase(s)-catalyzed phosphorylation. We determined the rates of protein synthesis in the wild type and in the transformed cells under different growth conditions by in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine (Fig. 6) for different intervals as follows: 10 min (panel A), 20 min (panel B), and 30 min (panel C). The radioactively labeled proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In all cases, the rate of protein synthesis increased with increasing times. The rates were nearly the same in the wild type cells (all panels, lane 1) and in the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-0 (all panels, lane 2). This rate increased significantly with pOPRSVI-p67 (all panels, lane 3) grown in complete media. Upon serum starvation the rates of protein synthesis of wild type cells (all panels, lane 4) and the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-0 (all panels, lane 5) were drastically reduced. Upon expression of p67 cDNA in the serum-starved cells, this rate was restored (all panels, lane 6) to the level observed in the confluent cells (all panels, lane 1). Most of the proteins synthesized in the wild type cells grown in complete medium (all panels, lane 1) were now synthesized (all panels, lane 6). Upon PMA addition to the serum-starved KRC-7 cells, the protein synthesis rate was similarly restored in the wild type cells (all panels, lane 7) and in the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-0 (all panels, lane 8). This rate was significantly more increased in the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 (all panels, lane 9). Using Image Quant software, the relative intensities of a 38-kDA band in panel C were determined. They were as follows: lane 1, 1.0; lane 2, 0.93;lane 3, 1.24; lane 4, 0.05; lane 5, 0.04; lane 6, 0.95; lane 7, 1.46; lane 8, 1.3; and lane 9, 1.8. Nutritional deprivation leads to a loss in protein synthesis activity of the cells. Previous reports (2Duncan R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5493-5497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Murtha-Riel P. Davies M.V. Scherer B.J. Choi S.-Y. Hershey J.W.B. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12946-12951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated an increased eIF-2 α-subunit phosphorylation in cells grown in nutritionally deprived medium. We now provide evidence that an eIF-2 kinase remains in active form and essentially at the same level in the cells grown in complete medium and in the serum-starved and mitogen-activated cells. In the cells grown in complete medium and mitogen-activated cells, this eIF-2 kinase does not phosphorylate eIF-2 as these cells contain p67. When the extracts were pretreated with p67 antibodies to remove endogenous p67, all the cell extracts similarly phosphorylated eIF-2 α-subunit (Fig. 1). Our results thus suggest that the changing p67 levels in the cells are responsible for variable phosphorylations observed with different cell extracts. The serum-starved cells are mostly devoid of p67. Therefore, the extracts from these cells efficiently phosphorylated eIF-2. We investigated the mechanism of changes in p67 protein level. During heme deficiency in reticulocyte lysate (12Chakraborty A. Saha D. Bose A. Chatterjee M. Gupta N.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and during vaccinia viral infection of animal cells (13Bose A. Gupta S. Saha D. Chatterjee N. Chakraborty A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB48, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD1996: 1-6Google Scholar, 14Bose A. Gupta N.K. American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Abstr. LB49, ASBMB, Bethesda, MD.1996: 1-6Google Scholar), the changes in p67 level involves activation of a latent p67 deglycosylase. The activated p67 deglycosylase deglycosylates p67 and inactivates it. In this paper, we provide evidence that although the p67 deglycosylase remains in latent form in KRC-7 cells, this p67 deglycosylase is not activated during serum starvation and is not responsible for p67 disappearance (Fig.2). We have previously reported (15Gupta S. Wu S. Chatterjee N. Ilan J. Ilan J. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar) that both p67 mRNA and p67 protein almost completely disappear from the serum-starved cells. We now provide evidence that the disappearance of p67 mRNA is responsible for the loss in p67 protein and accompanying loss in protein synthesis activity in the serum-starved cells. By expressing a p67 cDNA, we synthesized p67 mRNA in the serum-starved cells (Fig. 3). The appearance of p67 mRNA restored p67 protein level in the serum-starved transformed cells (Fig. 4). Also, the protein synthesis rates of the serum-starved cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 was significantly restored. Several proteins almost completely disappeared from the serum-starved wild type cells (Fig. 6, lane 4). By expressing p67 cDNA in the same serum-starved cells, the synthesis of almost all of these proteins was restored (Fig. 6, lane 6). These results suggest that the loss in p67 mRNA in the serum-starved cells may be the main cause for the loss in protein synthesis activity. Transfection with pOPRSVI-p67 significantly increased protein synthesis rates in the confluent (Fig. 6, all panels, lane 3) and also in the PMA-activated serum-starved cells (Fig. 6, all panels, lane 9). We provide evidence that this increased rate is due to expression of p67 cDNA and was not observed when the cells were transfected with pOPRSVI-0. Two possible mechanisms for the loss of p67 mRNA in the serum-starved cells can be envisioned. 1) Shut-off of p67 transcription and 2) activation of a nuclease. In our experiments, we synthesized p67 mRNA in the presence of p67 cDNA in the the cells grown in complete medium and then grew the cells in the serum-starved media. The p67 mRNA in the cells transformed with pOPRSVI-p67 increased significantly in the cells grown in complete medium and at different intervals after serum deprivation (data not shown). If serum starvation led to activation of a nuclease, it is expected that this nuclease would also have degraded p67 mRNA synthesized in the presence of p67 cDNA in the serum-starved cells. These results, therefore, suggest that the disappearance of p67 mRNA is due to shut-off of p67 transcription. The p67 transcription regulates the translation. The regulation of p67 transcription is the topic of the accompanying article (20Chatterjee N. Zou C. Osterman J.C. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12692-12698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We thank Prof. John W. B.

https://openalex.org/W2161716810,"Recent studies have shown that glucagon is processed by cardiac cells into its COOH-terminal (19–29) fragment, mini-glucagon, and that this metabolite is an essential component of the contractile positive inotropic effect of glucagon (Sauvadet, A., Rohn, T., Pecker, F. and Pavoine, C. (1996) Circ. Res. 78, 102–109). We now show that mini-glucagon triggers arachidonic acid (AA) release from [3H]AA-loaded embryonic chick ventricular myocytes via the activation of a phospholipase A2 sensitive to submicromolar Ca2+concentrations. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor, AACOCF3, prevented mini-glucagon-induced [45Ca2+] accumulation into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but inhibitors of lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase, or epoxygenase pathways were ineffective. AA applied exogenously, at 0.3 μm, reproduced the effects of mini-glucagon on Ca2+ homeostasis and contraction. Thus AA: (i) caused [45Ca2+] accumulation into a sarcoplasmic reticulum compartment sensitive to caffeine; 2) potentiated caffeine-induced Ca2+ mobilization from cells loaded with Fura-2; 3) acted synergistically with glucagon or cAMP to increase both the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and contraction of electrically stimulated cells. AA action was dose-dependent and specific since it was mimicked by its non-hydrolyzable analog 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid but not reproduced by other lipids such as, arachidic acid, linolenic acid,cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid,cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid, or arachidonyl-CoA, even in the micromolar range. We conclude that AA drives mini-glucagon action in the heart and that the positive inotropic effect of glucagon on heart contraction relies on both second messengers, cAMP and AA. Recent studies have shown that glucagon is processed by cardiac cells into its COOH-terminal (19–29) fragment, mini-glucagon, and that this metabolite is an essential component of the contractile positive inotropic effect of glucagon (Sauvadet, A., Rohn, T., Pecker, F. and Pavoine, C.

We conclude that AA drives mini-glucagon action in the heart and that the positive inotropic effect of glucagon on heart contraction relies on both second messengers, cAMP and AA.

We have shown that both peptides act synergistically on Ca2+ cycling in heart cells (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mini-glucagon and glucagon actions can be summarized as the ability of the former to accumulate Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum stores (SR stores) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; AA, arachidonic acid (cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid); [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+concentration; [Ca2+]e, extracellular free Ca2+ concentration; PLA2, phospholipase A2; ETYA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; PLD, phospholipase D; PLC, phospholipase C; NDGA, nordihydroguaiaretic acid; OAG, 1-oleolyl-2acetyl-sn-glycerol. 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; AA, arachidonic acid (cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid); [Ca2+]i, intracellular free Ca2+concentration; [Ca2+]e, extracellular free Ca2+ concentration; PLA2, phospholipase A2; ETYA, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; PLD, phospholipase D; PLC, phospholipase C; NDGA, nordihydroguaiaretic acid; OAG, 1-oleolyl-2acetyl-sn-glycerol. and that of the latter to induce Ca2+-induced-Ca2+-release from the same stores (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Glucagon action is mediated by cAMP produced from either stimulation of adenylyl cyclase or inhibition of the cyclic GMP-inhibited phosphodiesterase (CGI-PDE or PDE III), depending on the species (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Méry P.F. Brechler V. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Fischmeister R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15496-15501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the action of mini-glucagon does not rely on classical transduction pathways. In fact, mini-glucagon does not evoke any detectable change in either cAMP or cGMP or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and its second messenger remained to be identified (5Pavoine C. Brechler V. Kervran A. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Laurent S. Bataille D. Pecker F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C993-C999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, considerable evidence has accumulated to suggest a role for arachidonic acid (AA) and/or its oxidized metabolites in signal transduction processes (9Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AA release in response to cell receptor activation is considered as a key step in the positive inotropic response of angiotensin II, bradykinin, and endothelin (10Damron D.S. Van Wagoner D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lokuta A.J. Cooper C. Gaa S.T. Wang H.E. Rogers T.B. J. Biol.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is stored in esterified form in cell membrane phospholipids, from which it can be liberated through multiple enzymatic pathways (for review, see Ref. 14Piomelli D. Bloom F.E. Kupfer D.J. Psychopharmacology: the Fourth Generation of Progress. Raven Press, New York1995: 595-607Google Scholar). PLA2catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the sn-2 position. Therefore, this enzyme can release arachidonate in a single step reaction. By contrast, PLC and PLD do not release free arachidonic acid directly, but generate lipid products containing arachidonate (diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid, respectively), which can be released subsequently by diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol lipases. Once released, free arachidonate may diffuse out of the cell, be reincorporated into phospholipids, or metabolized. In addition, several reports have focused on a signaling role for AA in heart cells. One of the most thoroughly characterized targets of AA is protein kinase C (15Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. Cell Signalling. 1995; 7: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and AA has also been reported to modulate sarcolemmal ion channels, including K+ channels (10Damron D.S. Van Wagoner D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kim D. Clapham D.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1174-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 17Honoré H. Barhanin J. Attali B. Lesage F. Ladzunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1937-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)), and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (18Huang J.M.C. Xian H. Bacaner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6452-6456Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), as well as to increase Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in heart (19Damron D.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 376-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several hormones which exert positive inotropic responses evoke release of AA. Thus, in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, angiotensin II stimulates AA release via both PLC and PLA2 activation through AT1 and AT2 receptors, respectively (11Lokuta A.J. Cooper C. Gaa S.T. Wang H.E. Rogers T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4832-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated hearts, bradykinin and endothelin, which also activate PLC, stimulate release of AA (12Hsueh W. Isakson P. Needleman P. Prostaglandins. 1977; 13: 1073-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Prasad M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to representing an important signaling molecule under pathological circumstances, such as ischemia (20Van Bilsen M. Van der Vusse G.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 518-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AA, in the normal physiological setting may modulate important steps in excitation-contraction coupling. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of AA in mediating the actions of mini-glucagon on Ca2+ homeostasis and cell contraction in embryonic chick heart cells. The main findings are that mini-glucagon triggers a Ca2+-dependent release of AA and that AA added exogenously, at a submicromolar concentration (0.3 μm), mimics mini-glucagon actions. Our data suggest that free AA, and not products of AA metabolism, is the primary mediator of mini-glucagon action in ventricular myocytes. Mini-glucagon was obtained from ICN (Orsay, France), and glucagon from Novo Nordisk Laboratories (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic solution, trypsin, nucleotides, bovine serum albumin, arachidonic acid,cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid, andcis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid were purchased from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). AACOCF3 and ETYA were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fura-2, Fura-2/AM were from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Fetal calf serum was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). Phosphate-buffered saline 2040 and M199 media were obtained from Eurobio (Les Ulis, France). Digitonin from Merck has been recrystallized and stored as a 8 mg/ml solution in Me2SO. [45Ca2+] (10–40 mCi/mmol) was from ICN (Orsay, France). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (180–240 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN (Les Ulis, France). Antibodies from rabbit anti-mouse IgG-conjugated peroxidase were purchased from BIOSYS (Compiègne, France). Mouse Monoclonal antibodies against human cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 were from Santa Cruz. Fecundated eggs were obtained from the Haas farm (Kaltenhouse, France). Primary monolayer cultured heart cells were prepared from 13-day-old chick embryo ventricles as described previously (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were dissociated by repeated cycles of trypsinization. The resulting cell suspension (5–7 × 105 cells/ml) was bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% air, at 4 °C, and kept in buffer A (M199 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) NaHCO3, 0.01% (w/v) l-glutamine, 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic solution) until used, up to 5 days. Ventricular myocytes were enzymatically dispersed from adult male Wistar rat (250–300 g) as described previously (7Méry P.F. Brechler V. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Fischmeister R. Nature. 1990; 345: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Myocytes (5 × 105cells/ml), suspended in buffer A and supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, were plated on glass coverslips in multiwell plates and kept at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air for 24 h, as described by Sauvadet et al. (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed in 2 × 1 ml of saline buffer B (10 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes buffered at pH 7.4 with Tris base, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2). At time 0 of the experiment, the cells were immersed in 1 ml of saline buffer B, containing 2 mm [45Ca] (5 μCi/ml) in the presence or absence of various peptides and with or without enzymatic inhibitors. After various periods of incubation, the cells were washed two times for 10 s in 10 ml of Ca2+-free saline buffer B at 25 °C. As described previously in Ref. 6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, to determine [45Ca] accumulation into intracellular stores, cells were then subjected to digitonin lysis, which selectively disrupts the sarcolemmal membranes. This procedure, previously described by Altschuld (22Altschuld R.A. Wenger W.C. Lamka K.G. Kindig O.R. Capen C.C. Mizuhira V. Vander Heide R.S. Brierley G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14325-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consisted of an incubation for 45 s at 25 °C in Ca-free saline buffer B, supplemented with: 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 5 μm ruthenium red and digitonin (16 μg/mg of protein). Mg-ATP was added to protect against hypercontracture and ruthenium red to block Ca2+ efflux from the SR. Intracellular Ca2+ accumulation was estimated from [45Ca] recovered in digitonin-resistant structures attached to coverslips after the addition of 0.2 m NaOH for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were diluted in 10 ml of Beckman Ready Safe and counted in a scintillation counter. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To determine significant differences from control values, results were analyzed by employing the Student's ttest. Cells were plated on plastic dishes, the bottom of which was replaced by a glass coverslip coated with laminin (1 μg/ml), and were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air for 17–24 h. Cells, attached to laminin, were bathed in 2 ml of saline buffer B and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with 1.5 μm Fura-2/AM (3 μl of 1 mm Fura-2/AM in Me2SO), in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to improve Fura-2 dispersion and facilitate cell loading. Cells were then washed with saline buffer B (2 × 2 ml) and allowed to incubate in the same buffer for 15 min at 25 °C to facilitate hydrolysis of intracellular Fura-2/AM. The concentration of Fura-2 in myocytes was estimated as described previously (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), according to the procedure of Donnadieu et al. (23Donnadieu E. Bismuth G. Trautmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25864-25872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under usual loading conditions, the average intracellular concentration of Fura-2 was 15 μm. Ca2+ imaging, developed by A. Trautmann in collaboration with the IMSTAR CO (Paris, France), was essentially as described by Sauvadetet al. (6Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Sauvadet A. Pecker F. Pavoine C. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All tracings of fluorescence ratio are representative of at least 10 cells, and were performed on at least two different cell isolations. Imaging studies were performed on cells in which no spontaneous rise in [Ca2+]i was observed prior to experimental manipulation. Field electrical stimulation (square waves, 10-ms duration, amplitude 20% above threshold, 0.5 Hz) was supplied through a pair of platinum electrodes connected to the output of a HAMEG stimulator (Paris, France). Cells were perifused with saline buffer B containing 1.27 mm CaCl2 and stimulated until a steady-state level of the Ca2+ transients was achieved, before each protocol, as described previously by Bassani (24Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W.M. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To evaluate the caffeine-releasable [Ca2+] pool, drugs and peptides were added to the perfusion medium a few seconds after interruption of electrical stimulation. In a second series of experiments, performed to measure variations in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients, electrical stimulation of the cells was maintained throughout the experiment. Drugs and peptides were added to the perfusion medium at time 0. To evaluate the effect of glucagon, mini-glucagon, 8-Br-cAMP, and/or arachidonic acid quantitatively, we used two parameters: the percentage increase in diastolic Fura-2 ratio (360:380) and the percentage increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transient. Experiments were performed in conditions similar to Ca2+ imaging, but cells were illuminated with visible light and images transmitted through a solid-state camera (CCD, black and white, 0.847 cm high sensitivity) connected to the sideport of the microscope. Contractions of single stimulated (0.5 Hz) myocytes were displayed on a video monitor and the corresponding images (pixel × pixel) were recorded at a frequency of 9/s. Contractility measurements were determined by assessing changes in cell length using the Morphostar II software, developed by the IMSTAR CO (Paris, France). All tracings of cell length are representative of at least 5 cells and performed on at least two different cell isolations. Embryonic chick ventricular myocytes (5 × 105 cells/ml), suspended in buffer A, were plated in multiwell plates and incubated with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA (6.75 nm) in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air, at 37 °C. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice in saline buffer B containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and resuspended in saline buffer B. At time 0 of the experiment, [3H]AA-labeled cells were exposed to various peptides and/or enzymatic inhibitors, and incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold EGTA (2 mm final), and the media were immediately transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifugation at 17,600 × gfor 20 min in a Sigma centrifuge (model 2K15) at 4 °C was performed to pellet any cells or debris inadvertently collected with the extracellular medium. The amount of radioactivity in the supernatant was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Analysis of the lipids released in the incubation medium was performed as described in Ref. 25Matzuoka I. Nakanishi H. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 185-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. At the end of the incubation period, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3.0 with HCl and the products were extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The dried extracts were dissolved in ethanol/chloroform (1:2, v/v) and chromatographed on silica gel thin layer plate (Whatman LK5) in ethyl acetate/isooctane/water/acetic acid (11:5:10:2, v/v) as the solvent system. Standard concentrations of AA, prostaglandin Es, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were co-chromatographed and visualized by exposing the plates to ultraviolet light. The area corresponding to each visualized spot was carefully extracted and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]AA-labeled cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 nm mini-glucagon or vehicle. Cells were next subjected to digitonin lysis for 45 s at 25 °C, in Ca2+-free saline buffer B, supplemented with 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 5 μm ruthenium red and digitonin (16 μg/mg of protein). At time 0 of the experiment, the cells were exposed to 0.1 nm mini-glucagon or vehicle and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in saline buffer B containing 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 5 μm ruthenium red and various concentrations of EGTA, ranging from 3.307 to 2.131 mm. These corresponded to [Ca2+]i ranging from 113 to 1193 nm, as calculated by using the EQUIV program (Thierry Capiod, INSERM Unité 274), and further determined in parallel experiments using cells permeabilized with digitonin and loaded with Fura-2. Incubation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold EGTA (2 mm final) and the media were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Centrifugation at 17,600 × g for 20 min in a Sigma centrifuge (model 2K15) at 4 °C was performed to pellet any cells or debris inadvertently collected with the extracellular medium. The amount of radioactivity in the supernatant was quantitated by standard liquid scintillation procedures. Embryonic chick ventricular cells or rat ventricular myocytes were disrupted by sonication in buffer C (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m saccharose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mmsodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). After dilution (v/v) with sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins (25 μg/lane) were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25 mA/gel). The proteins were transferred to Hybond C super nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham), by electroblot using Tris glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. The transfer was performed at 90 mA for 60 min. Protein transfer was evaluated by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. The nitrocellulose blots were agitated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.15% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies against cPLA2 (1:500 dilution in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk) for 180 min. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) for 90 min at room temperature in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and the peroxidase activity was determined using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL (Amersham Corp.)). The action of mini-glucagon on AA release was assessed on embryonic chick ventricular myocytes labeled for 24 h with [3H]AA before the addition of mini-glucagon, to allow steady state labeling of the cellular AA pool. As shown in Fig. 1A, 0.1 nm mini-glucagon evoked a sustained release of AA from cells over the 30-min period examined. Under similar experimental conditions, the level of AA release in the absence of mini-glucagon remained constant (Fig.1 A). The action of mini-glucagon was dose-dependent, with a maximal (164 ± 7%) increase of [3H]AA released after 30 min observed at 0.1 nm mini-glucagon and a half-maximal response occurring at 0.01 nm mini-glucagon (Fig. 1 B). Under the same experimental conditions, angiotensin II, at 0.3 μm, evoked a similar increase (173 ± 14%) in [3H]AA release (Fig. 2). The action of mini-glucagon was specific since glucagon itself did not affect [3H]AA release significantly, even at micromolar concentrations (Fig.1 B, inset).Figure 2Mini-glucagon-induced [3H] AA release relies on PLA2 activation. Embryonic chick ventricular cells were labeled for 24 h with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Radiolabeled cells were washed twice in saline buffer containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of various peptides (mini-glucagon, angiotensin, or endothelin) and with or without a PLA2 inhibitor, quinacrine or AACOCF3. The amount of [3H]AA released was expressed as percentage of control value (zero time: 148 ± 7 disintegrations/min/μg of protein). Values are means ± S.E. of two different experiments done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was important to determine if the 3H-labeled material that was released was authentic AA. Accordingly, cell supernatants were analyzed by extraction and resolution on thin layer chromatography (TLC). As shown in Table I, the 3H-labeled material in the supernatants of control and mini-glucagon-treated cells was mainly identified as [3H]AA (67 and 54%, respectively) but also consisted of [3H]lipoxygenase products (11 and 24%, respectively). No significant conversion of AA into cyclooxygenase or unidentified products could be detected in addition to the nonenzymatic degradation or contaminants of standard [3H]AA (Table I).Table IIdentification of 3H-metabolites in supernatants of cells prelabeled with [3H]AAMetabolitesBasal conditionsInhibitors of AA metabolismMigration of standard [3H]AAControlMini-glucagonControlMini-glucagondpm(%)dpm (%)%Arachidonic acid2,950 (67)4,754 (54)8,879 (84)20,388 (81)81Lipoxygenase products (HETE5; HETE13; HETE15)484 (11)2,113 (24)423 (4)1258 (5)7Cyclooxygenase products (PGE1; PGE2)352 (8)440 (5)211 (2)252 (1)5Nonidentified products176 (4)1,497 (17)1,057 (10)3,272 (9)7Embryonic chick heart cells were labeled with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After two washings in saline buffer containing 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, [3H]AA-labeled cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of 0.1 nm mini-glucagon, and with or without a mixture of inhibitors of AA metabolism including: 30 μm NDGA, 1 μm indomethacin, and 100 μm SKF 250A.

https://openalex.org/W2155671613,"To further understand the functional interactions between CD45 and p56lck in T-cells, we stably reconstituted their expression in a nonlymphoid system. The results of our analyses demonstrated that CD45 could dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 of p56lck in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. As is the case for T-cells, removal of the unique domain of p56lck interfered with dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 in fibroblasts, further stressing the importance of this region in the interactions between CD45 and p56lck. The ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 in NIH 3T3 cells was also greatly influenced by the catalytic activity of p56lck. Indeed, whereas CD45 provoked dephosphorylation of kinase-defective Lck molecules in this system, it failed to stably dephosphorylate kinase-active p56lck polypeptides. Finally, our studies showed that CD45 was also able to inhibit the oncogenic potential of a constitutively activated version of p56lck in NIH 3T3 cells. This effect did not require the Lck unique domain and apparently resulted from selective dephosphorylation of substrates of activated p56lck in fibroblasts. In addition to providing insights into the nature and regulation of the interactions between CD45 and p56lck in T-cells, these results indicated that CD45 clearly has the capacity to both positively and negatively regulate p56lck-mediated functions in vivo. To further understand the functional interactions between CD45 and p56lck in T-cells, we stably reconstituted their expression in a nonlymphoid system. The results of our analyses demonstrated that CD45 could dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 of p56lck in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.

Like the other members of the Src family, it bears several independent structural domains that include, from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus: (i) sites of myristylation (glycine 2) and palmitylation (cysteines 3 and/or 5), involved in targetting to cellular membranes (Ref. 6Shenoy-Scaria A.M.

Veillette A. Curr. Topics in Microb. Immunol. 1996; 205: 63-87PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at tyrosine 394 activates the catalytic function of p56lck, by provoking a conformational change in the kinase domain (14Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Conversely, phosphorylation at tyrosine 505 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Lck (15Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), presumably by allowing an intramolecular interaction between the carboxyl-terminal end and the SH2 domain of the enzyme. Accumulating data indicate that tyrosine 505 phosphorylation is mediated by p50csk, a tyrosine-protein kinase expressed in all cell types (17–19; reviewed in Ref. 20Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine 505 can also be a site of autophosphorylation. This possibility is suggested by the findings that p56lck could undergo phosphorylation at tyrosine 505 in bacteria (which lack endogenous tyrosine-protein kinases) or during in vitrokinase reactions (21Jullien P. Bougeret C. Camoin L. Bodeus M. Durand H. Disanto J.P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Casnellie J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9858-9864Google Scholar). Nonetheless, autophosphorylation may not be a prominent component of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation in mammalian cells, because a kinase-defective version of p56lck (lysine 273 to arginine 273 (Arg273) Lck) was still extensively phosphorylated at this site in transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (19Gervais F.G. Chow L.M.L. Lee J.M. Branton P.E. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7112-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Contrary to Lck polypeptides expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, those isolated from T-lymphocytes are poorly phosphorylated at tyrosine 505 (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This difference is seemingly consequent to the action of CD45, a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase selectively expressed in nucleated hemopoietic cells (for a review, see Ref. 24Trowbridge I.S. Ostergaard H.L. Johnson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the observation that Lck polypeptides immunoprecipitated from CD45-deficient T-cells exhibited a marked (8–10-fold) increase in tyrosine 505 occupancy, when compared with p56lck molecules recovered from their CD45-positive counterparts (25Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 26Hurley T.R. Hyman R.

Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of CD45 had little or no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of two other Src family kinases, p59fynT and p60c-src (26Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The lack of constitutive dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 in CD45-negative T-cells is thought to explain the inability of these cells to become activated upon stimulation with antigen or anti-T-cell receptor antibodies (30Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 31Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A.

Med. 1992; 176: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Over the past few years, significant efforts have been directed toward understanding the mechanism(s) by which CD45 causes selective dephosphorylation of p56lck in T-cells. Because a small fraction of Lck molecules can be co-immunoprecipitated with CD45 in mild detergent lysates of T-cells (34Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M. Ross S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that these two molecules are in close proximity in the cell. Interestingly, we demonstrated that deletion of the unique domain of p56lck or its replacement by the equivalent sequence from another Src family kinase (p59fynT) significantly reduced dephosphorylation at tyrosine 505 in a CD45-positive T-cell line (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This finding implied that the unique domain contains elements that favor the functional interactions between CD45 and p56lck. Because the unique domain of p56lck can associate with the cytoplasmic portion of CD45in vitro (36Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1295-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that Lck directly associates with CD45 in vivo via these sequences. However, it is also plausible that other molecules participate in this interaction. One proposed candidate is the CD45-associated protein, a hemopoietic cell-specific polypeptide having the capacity to bind both CD45 and p56lck (37Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G.

The results of our experiments showed that expression of the R0 isoform of CD45 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts caused a ∼5-fold decrease in the extent of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation of kinase-defective (Arg273) p56lck molecules. This effect was most likely due to the phosphatase activity of CD45, because treatment with pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, restored phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Lck in CD45-positive NIH 3T3 cells. As demonstrated for BI-141 T-cells (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the unique region of p56lck was also found to play an important role in the CD45-induced dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, dephosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine of p56lck by CD45 can occur in a nonlymphoid cellular system by a mechanism similar to that taking place in T-cells.These findings implied that no other lymphoid-specific components are absolutely necessary for the CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of p56lck. Specifically, they also demonstrated that CD45-associated protein, a protein that can associate with both CD45 and p56lck (37Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R.

Nature (London). 1971; 230: 52-54Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and is not expressed in NIH 3T3 cells,2 is not critical for the action of CD45 on p56lck. This idea was further supported by our finding that enforced expression of CD45-associated protein in NIH 3T3 cells did not modify the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate wild-type, Arg273, or Phe505 Lck molecules.2Nevertheless, it is likely that additional features or processes enhance the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 in T-cells. Indeed, although CD45 provoked dephosphorylation of kinase-inactive Lck molecules in fibroblasts, it failed to stably dephosphorylate wild-type Lck polypeptides. In contrast, the two forms of Lck were equally well dephosphorylated in T-cells (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The higher amounts of CD45 typically present in T-cells may explain this difference. Possibly, greater amounts of CD45 are needed for stable dephosphorylation of kinase-active Lck polypeptides in vivo. Alternatively, the presence of other yet unidentified molecules interacting with CD45, Lck or both, may contribute to more efficient dephosphorylation of Lck in T-cells.These findings provided clear evidence that the catalytic activity of p56lck can influence the ability of CD45 to stably dephosphorylate tyrosine 505. It is conceivable that the enzymatic function of p56lck antagonizes the effect of CD45 by allowing autophosphorylation at tyrosine 505 (21Jullien P. Bougeret C. Camoin L. Bodeus M. Durand H. Disanto J.P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Casnellie J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9858-9864Google Scholar). Alternatively, the enzymatic activity of Lck may facilitate the recruitment of p50csk, the tyrosine-protein kinase normally responsible for phosphorylating tyrosine 505 (Refs. 17Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature (London). 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Gervais F.G. Chow L.M.L. Lee J.M. Branton P.E. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7112-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, it is possible that active Lck molecules can modify the function of CD45 and reduce its ability to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505. Regardless of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, these observations raised the interesting possibility that activation of p56lck may diminish the capacity of CD45 to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 in T-cells, thereby providing a potential negative feedback mechanism. This concept may explain the earlier finding that CD4-mediated activation of p56lck in T-cells led to a paradoxical augmentation of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation, in addition to the expected increase in tyrosine 394 phosphorylation (50Veillette A. Bolen J.B. Bookman M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4441-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 51Luo K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5305-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).The impact of CD45 on an activated version of p56lck(Phe505 Lck) was also evaluated. Contrary to cells containing Phe505 p56lck alone, cells harboring Phe505 p56lck and CD45 exhibited a less transformed morphology, formed smaller foci in monolayer cultures, and were unable to grow in soft agar. These biological effects were accompanied by a noticeable reduction in the extent of tyrosine protein phosphorylation induced by Phe505 p56lck. Several findings indicated that the impact of CD45 in this context was primarily caused by dephosphorylation of downstream signaling targets rather than dephosphorylation of Phe505 p56lck. First, the phosphotyrosine content of Phe505 p56lck was only minimally reduced (less than ∼2-fold) in CD45-positive NIH 3T3 cells. Second, CD45 did not cause a global reduction of tyrosine protein phosphorylation in Phe505 Lck-expressing cells. Instead, it seemed to regulate a specific set of tyrosine phosphorylation substrates. These included annexin II, as well as polypeptides of 140 and 120 kDa of yet undetermined identity. In contrast, CD45 had no or little effect on substrates such as cortactin and GAP, as well as the GAP-associated p190 and p62. Third, removal of the Lck unique domain had no consequence on the ability of CD45 to inhibit transformation by Phe505 Lck. Because the unique region was crucial for CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of Lck in other systems (this report and Ref. 23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we feel that this observation provided a most compelling indication that CD45 reduced transformation by Phe505 Lck by acting on downstream signaling events.These results suggested that CD45 may also have the ability to negatively regulate Lck-mediated signals in T-cells. This notion is consistent with the observation that antibody-mediated co-aggregation of CD45 and the T-cell antigen receptor prevented T-cell receptor-induced intracellular tyrosine protein phosphorylation and T-cell activation (52Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Uckun F.M. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1577-1583PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it supports the finding that some CD45-negative T-cell lines (such as YAC-N1) contained elevated levels of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins prior to T-cell receptor stimulation (29Burns C.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53D'Oro U. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4996-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hence, CD45 may provide inhibitory signals in T-cells, in addition to its aforementioned positive regulatory role in unstimulated T-cells. Obviously, if these two opposite effects were to occur physiologically, it is expected that they would be differentially regulated at the various stages of T-cell activation.In summary, we have shown that the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate the inhibitory tyrosine of p56lck can be reconstituted in a nonlymphoid system, implying that this functional interaction does not require the participation of any other lymphoid-specific component. Unexpectedly, we also found that the catalytic activity of Lck can influence the dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 by CD45. This observation suggested that physiological changes in the enzymatic activity of p56lck in T-cells may modify its regulation by CD45. Finally, evidence was adduced that CD45 has the capacity to inhibit the impact of Lck activation in vivo, most probably by dephosphorylating downstream signaling targets. In addition to clarifying the basis for the interactions between CD45 and p56lck in T-cells, our experiments permitted us to uncover previously unappreciated mechanisms involved in regulating these interactions. p56lck is a lymphocyte-specific member of the Src family of tyrosine-protein kinases (Refs. 1Marth J.D.

Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Conversely, phosphorylation at tyrosine 505 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Lck (15Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Marth J.D. Cooper J.A. King C.S. Ziegler S.F. Tinker D.A. Overell R.W. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), presumably by allowing an intramolecular interaction between the carboxyl-terminal end and the SH2 domain of the enzyme. Accumulating data indicate that tyrosine 505 phosphorylation is mediated by p50csk, a tyrosine-protein kinase expressed in all cell types (17–19; reviewed in Ref. 20Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, tyrosine 505 can also be a site of autophosphorylation. This possibility is suggested by the findings that p56lck could undergo phosphorylation at tyrosine 505 in bacteria (which lack endogenous tyrosine-protein kinases) or during in vitrokinase reactions (21Jullien P. Bougeret C. Camoin L. Bodeus M. Durand H. Disanto J.P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Casnellie J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9858-9864Google Scholar). Nonetheless, autophosphorylation may not be a prominent component of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation in mammalian cells, because a kinase-defective version of p56lck (lysine 273 to arginine 273 (Arg273) Lck) was still extensively phosphorylated at this site in transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (19Gervais F.G. Chow L.M.L. Lee J.M. Branton P.E. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7112-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to Lck polypeptides expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, those isolated from T-lymphocytes are poorly phosphorylated at tyrosine 505 (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This difference is seemingly consequent to the action of CD45, a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase selectively expressed in nucleated hemopoietic cells (for a review, see Ref. 24Trowbridge I.S. Ostergaard H.L. Johnson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by the observation that Lck polypeptides immunoprecipitated from CD45-deficient T-cells exhibited a marked (8–10-fold) increase in tyrosine 505 occupancy, when compared with p56lck molecules recovered from their CD45-positive counterparts (25Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 26Hurley T.R. Hyman R.

Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of CD45 had little or no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of two other Src family kinases, p59fynT and p60c-src (26Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The lack of constitutive dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 in CD45-negative T-cells is thought to explain the inability of these cells to become activated upon stimulation with antigen or anti-T-cell receptor antibodies (30Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 31Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature (London). 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 32Weaver C.T. Pingel J.T. Nelson J.O. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1992; 176: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Over the past few years, significant efforts have been directed toward understanding the mechanism(s) by which CD45 causes selective dephosphorylation of p56lck in T-cells. Because a small fraction of Lck molecules can be co-immunoprecipitated with CD45 in mild detergent lysates of T-cells (34Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M. Ross S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that these two molecules are in close proximity in the cell. Interestingly, we demonstrated that deletion of the unique domain of p56lck or its replacement by the equivalent sequence from another Src family kinase (p59fynT) significantly reduced dephosphorylation at tyrosine 505 in a CD45-positive T-cell line (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This finding implied that the unique domain contains elements that favor the functional interactions between CD45 and p56lck. Because the unique domain of p56lck can associate with the cytoplasmic portion of CD45in vitro (36Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1295-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that Lck directly associates with CD45 in vivo via these sequences. However, it is also plausible that other molecules participate in this interaction. One proposed candidate is the CD45-associated protein, a hemopoietic cell-specific polypeptide having the capacity to bind both CD45 and p56lck (37Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G.

DISCUSSIONHerein, we report the first successful attempt at reconstituting the CD45-mediated regulation of p56lck in a nonlymphoid system. The results of our experiments showed that expression of the R0 isoform of CD45 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts caused a ∼5-fold decrease in the extent of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation of kinase-defective (Arg273) p56lck molecules. This effect was most likely due to the phosphatase activity of CD45, because treatment with pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, restored phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Lck in CD45-positive NIH 3T3 cells. As demonstrated for BI-141 T-cells (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the unique region of p56lck was also found to play an important role in the CD45-induced dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, dephosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine of p56lck by CD45 can occur in a nonlymphoid cellular system by a mechanism similar to that taking place in T-cells.These findings implied that no other lymphoid-specific components are absolutely necessary for the CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of p56lck. Specifically, they also demonstrated that CD45-associated protein, a protein that can associate with both CD45 and p56lck (37Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R.

Nature (London). 1971; 230: 52-54Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and is not expressed in NIH 3T3 cells,2 is not critical for the action of CD45 on p56lck. This idea was further supported by our finding that enforced expression of CD45-associated protein in NIH 3T3 cells did not modify the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate wild-type, Arg273, or Phe505 Lck molecules.2Nevertheless, it is likely that additional features or processes enhance the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 in T-cells. Indeed, although CD45 provoked dephosphorylation of kinase-inactive Lck molecules in fibroblasts, it failed to stably dephosphorylate wild-type Lck polypeptides. In contrast, the two forms of Lck were equally well dephosphorylated in T-cells (23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The higher amounts of CD45 typically present in T-cells may explain this difference. Possibly, greater amounts of CD45 are needed for stable dephosphorylation of kinase-active Lck polypeptides in vivo. Alternatively, the presence of other yet unidentified molecules interacting with CD45, Lck or both, may contribute to more efficient dephosphorylation of Lck in T-cells.These findings provided clear evidence that the catalytic activity of p56lck can influence the ability of CD45 to stably dephosphorylate tyrosine 505. It is conceivable that the enzymatic function of p56lck antagonizes the effect of CD45 by allowing autophosphorylation at tyrosine 505 (21Jullien P. Bougeret C. Camoin L. Bodeus M. Durand H. Disanto J.P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Casnellie J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9858-9864Google Scholar). Alternatively, the enzymatic activity of Lck may facilitate the recruitment of p50csk, the tyrosine-protein kinase normally responsible for phosphorylating tyrosine 505 (Refs. 17Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Chow L.M.L. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature (London). 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 19Gervais F.G. Chow L.M.L. Lee J.M. Branton P.E. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7112-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, it is possible that active Lck molecules can modify the function of CD45 and reduce its ability to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505. Regardless of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, these observations raised the interesting possibility that activation of p56lck may diminish the capacity of CD45 to dephosphorylate tyrosine 505 in T-cells, thereby providing a potential negative feedback mechanism. This concept may explain the earlier finding that CD4-mediated activation of p56lck in T-cells led to a paradoxical augmentation of tyrosine 505 phosphorylation, in addition to the expected increase in tyrosine 394 phosphorylation (50Veillette A. Bolen J.B. Bookman M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4441-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 51Luo K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5305-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).The impact of CD45 on an activated version of p56lck(Phe505 Lck) was also evaluated. Contrary to cells containing Phe505 p56lck alone, cells harboring Phe505 p56lck and CD45 exhibited a less transformed morphology, formed smaller foci in monolayer cultures, and were unable to grow in soft agar. These biological effects were accompanied by a noticeable reduction in the extent of tyrosine protein phosphorylation induced by Phe505 p56lck. Several findings indicated that the impact of CD45 in this context was primarily caused by dephosphorylation of downstream signaling targets rather than dephosphorylation of Phe505 p56lck. First, the phosphotyrosine content of Phe505 p56lck was only minimally reduced (less than ∼2-fold) in CD45-positive NIH 3T3 cells. Second, CD45 did not cause a global reduction of tyrosine protein phosphorylation in Phe505 Lck-expressing cells. Instead, it seemed to regulate a specific set of tyrosine phosphorylation substrates. These included annexin II, as well as polypeptides of 140 and 120 kDa of yet undetermined identity. In contrast, CD45 had no or little effect on substrates such as cortactin and GAP, as well as the GAP-associated p190 and p62. Third, removal of the Lck unique domain had no consequence on the ability of CD45 to inhibit transformation by Phe505 Lck. Because the unique region was crucial for CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of Lck in other systems (this report and Ref. 23Gervais F.G. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2393-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we feel that this observation provided a most compelling indication that CD45 reduced transformation by Phe505 Lck by acting on downstream signaling events.These results suggested that CD45 may also have the ability to negatively regulate Lck-mediated signals in T-cells. This notion is consistent with the observation that antibody-mediated co-aggregation of CD45 and the T-cell antigen receptor prevented T-cell receptor-induced intracellular tyrosine protein phosphorylation and T-cell activation (52Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Uckun F.M. Imboden J.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1577-1583PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it supports the finding that some CD45-negative T-cell lines (such as YAC-N1) contained elevated levels of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins prior to T-cell receptor stimulation (29Burns C.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53D'Oro U. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4996-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hence, CD45 may provide inhibitory signals in T-cells, in addition to its aforementioned positive regulatory role in unstimulated T-cells. Obviously, if these two opposite effects were to occur physiologically, it is expected that they would be differentially regulated at the various stages of T-cell activation.In summary, we have shown that the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate the inhibitory tyrosine of p56lck can be reconstituted in a nonlymphoid system, implying that this functional interaction does not require the participation of any other lymphoid-specific component. Unexpectedly, we also found that the catalytic activity of Lck can influence the dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505 by CD45. This observation suggested that physiological changes in the enzymatic activity of p56lck in T-cells may modify its regulation by CD45. Finally, evidence was adduced that CD45 has the capacity to inhibit the impact of Lck activation in vivo, most probably by dephosphorylating downstream signaling targets. In addition to clarifying the basis for the interactions between CD45 and p56lck in T-cells, our experiments permitted us to uncover previously unappreciated mechanisms involved in regulating these interactions.

The majority of these clones express 2Apro to control levels, suggesting that their ability to divide is not due to the loss of 2Aprogene inducibility. The sequences of the 2Apro genes isolated from 22 clones were determined. Most of the 2Aprosequences from these colonies contain point mutations in the poliovirus protease. The different variant protease sequences were transferred to an infectious poliovirus cDNA clone. Translation of genomic RNA obtained from these poliovirus mutants in cell-free systems revealed that some of them had defects in their ability to cleave P1-2A incis. In addition, several of these variants cleaved the translation initiation factor eIF-4G inefficiently. Transfection of the RNA generated from the full-length poliovirus genomes mutated in 2Apro yielded five viable polioviruses with a small plaque phenotype. These five polioviruses efficiently cleaved p220 but showed defects in viral protein synthesis, transactivation of a leader-luciferase mRNA, and 3CD cleavage to 3C′ and 3D′. All 2Apro mutant sequences, including those that did not yield viable viruses, were cloned in pTM1 vector under a T7 promoter. Only the 2Apro variants that have activity to cleave 3CD produced viable poliovirus. Our findings indicate that S. cerevisiae represents a useful system for obtaining poliovirus 2Apro variants that may provide further insight into the role of this protease during the poliovirus replication cycle.

Poliovirus gene expression relies on the synthesis of a large polypeptide precursor that is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature viral proteins. Polyprotein processing is accomplished by two virus-encoded proteases: 2Apro 1The abbreviations used are: 2Apro, poliovirus protease 2A; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; WT, wild type; hpi, hours postinfection; ts, temperature-sensitive. 1The abbreviations used are: 2Apro, poliovirus protease 2A; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; WT, wild type; hpi, hours postinfection; ts, temperature-sensitive.and 3Cpro (1Palmenberg A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Racaniello V.R. Current Topics in Microbiology 161 and Immunology, Picornaviruses. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 49-89Google Scholar). The poliovirus endopeptidase 2Apro is a polypeptide of 149 amino acid residues in which the catalytic triad is formed by His20, Asp38, and Cys109 (3Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Hellen C.U.T. Fäcke M. Kräusslich H. Lee C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4226-4231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that cysteine instead of serine forms part of the active site of 2Apro has been taken as evidence that this protease is an evolutionary intermediate between serine and cysteine proteases (5Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Koonin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, sequence similarities between 2Apro and trypsin-like serine proteases have conclusively classified 2Apro as belonging to the serine protease group (6Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 7Skern T. Liebig H.-D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Both proteases 2Apro and 3Cpro cleave substrates in cis and trans (1Palmenberg A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Racaniello V.R. Current Topics in Microbiology 161 and Immunology, Picornaviruses. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 49-89Google Scholar).cis cleavage by 2Apro occurs once the protease has been synthesized as a precursor on the nascent polypeptide chain still bound to ribosomes (8Toyoda H. Nicklin M.J. Murray M.G. Anderson C.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Wimmer E. Cell. 1986; 45: 761-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, 2Apro activity cleaves the Tyr-Gly peptide bond between P1 and 2A, releasing P1, the precursor of the capsid proteins, from the rest of the nascent polyprotein (1Palmenberg A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 603-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The second proteolytic cleavage effected by 2Apro on a viral protein precursor lies in 3CD, where a Tyr-Gly dipeptide is hydrolyzed, giving rise to 3C′ and 3D′, two products of unknown function (9Blair W.S. Li X. Semler B.L. Carrasco L. Sonenberg N. Wimmer E. Regulation of Gene Expression in Animal Viruses. Plenum Press, New York1993: 225-244Crossref Google Scholar). Apparently, the generation of 3C′ and 3D′ is not necessary for poliovirus growth in culture cells, since a poliovirus mutant unable to produce 3C′ and 3D′ grows as well as wild type poliovirus does (10Lee C.-K. Wimmer E. Virology. 1988; 166: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to the two cleavages performed by 2Apro on poliovirus protein precursors, this protease also cleaves cellular proteins (2Lawson M.A. Semler B.L. Racaniello V.R. Current Topics in Microbiology 161 and Immunology, Picornaviruses. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 49-89Google Scholar). A number of cellular polypeptides are degraded after poliovirus infection, although the proteases responsible for these cleavages have not yet been identified (11Urzáinqui A. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4729-4735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best documented cleavage of a cellular protein by 2Apro is that of eIF-4G (also known as p220), a component of the translation initiation factor eIF-4F (12Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been formally proven that poliovirus 2A directly cleaves p220, but the fact that coxsackievirus 2A and rhinovirus 2A directly degrade p220 (13Sommergruber W. Ahorn H. Zöphel A. Maurer-Fogy I. Fessl F. Schnorrenberg G. Liebig H.-D. Blaas D. Kuechler E. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) makes it unlikely that a cellular protease activated by 2Apro is responsible for p220 cleavage (16Wyckoff E.E. Hershey J.W.B. Ehrenfeld E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9529-9533Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Wyckoff E.E. Lloyd R.E. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2943-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic cleavage of the dipeptide present in the initiation factor eIF-4G generates the N-terminal eIF-4G moiety involved in eIF-4E interaction, whereas the C-terminal eIF-4G moiety, which binds eIF-4A, participates in the translation of picornavirus RNA (18Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Translation of newly synthesized mRNAs is halted by p220 cleavage (19Davies M.V. Pelletier J. Meerovitch K. Sonenberg N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14714-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but protein synthesis on mRNAs already engaged in the protein-synthesizing machinery continues (20Irurzun A. Sánchez-Palomino S. Novoa I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7453-7460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Novoa I. Cotten M. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3319-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, uncapped picornavirus RNA does not require the cap binding factor eIF-4E but does depend on the C-terminal eIF-4G moiety and eIF-4A to become engaged in translation (18Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar).Poliovirus 2Apro is a multifunctional enzyme. Apart from proteolytic cleavage of viral protein precursors and eIF-4G, 2Apro can also enhance the translation of poliovirus RNA (22Hambidge S.J. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10272-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The activation of protein synthesis by 2Apro requires only the poliovirus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequences, since translation of reporter genes placed under the IRES is stimulated by this protease (22Hambidge S.J. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10272-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Ziegler E. Borman A.M. Deliat F.G. Liebig H.D. Jugovic D. Kean K.M. Skern T. Kuechler E. Virology. 1995; 213: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact molecular basis by which 2Apro stimulates translation remains unknown, but the simple generation of eIF-4G cleavage products is not sufficient for this enhancement to take place (24Ventoso I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6280-6288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that poliovirus mutants in the IRES region compensate for this defect with mutations in the 2Apro sequence (25Macadam A.J. Ferguson G. Fleming T. Stone D.M. Almond J.W. Minor P.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 924-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggested an interaction between 2Apro and the IRES, but direct evidence for such an interaction is still lacking. 2Apro not only enhances poliovirus RNA translation but also participates in viral RNA replication by a still unknown mechanism (26Yu S.F. Benton P. Bovee M. Sessions J. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 247-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lu H.H. Li X.Y. Cuconati A. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7445-7452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike aphtoviruses and hepatitis A virus, in which the L and 2Apro genes, respectively, are not necessary for viral infectivity (28Piccone M.E. Rieder E. Mason P.W. Grubman M.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5376-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Harmon S.A. Emerson S.U. Huang Y.K. Summers D.F. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5576-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the poliovirus 2Apro is required for virus RNA replication and viability (30Molla A. Paul A.V. Schmid M. Jang S.K. Wimmer E. Virology. 1993; 196: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Wimmer E. Hellen C.U.T. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Certainly, the generation and analysis of additional poliovirus 2Apro variants should provide more insights into the different activities of this multifunctional protease that regulates viral and cellular gene expression.Inducible expression of poliovirus nonstructural proteins in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae showed that two of them, namely 2Apro and 2BC, inhibited yeast growth (32Barco A. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Barco A. Carrasco L. Gene. 1995; 156: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 34Barco A. Carrasco L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3349-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar effect was found for rhinovirus 2Apro (35Klump H. Auer H. Liebig H.D. Kuechler E. Skern T. Virology. 1996; 220: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This finding allows the use of yeast cells as a genetic system in which to select 2Apro variants that permit S. cerevisiaegrowth. We now report the generation and characterization of several 2Apro variants selected by this method. In principle, this approach can be applied to analyze the structure-function relationship of any other viral or nonviral protein that interferes with yeast cell division.

https://openalex.org/W2129345256,"A rat genomic library constructed in λ-EMBL3 (SP6/T7) vector (CLONTECH) was screened using32P-labeled rat p67 cDNA. A clone containing a segment of 5′-upstream region of p67 genomic DNA was obtained. The DNA (about 1.7 kilobase pairs) was isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of this DNA fragment showed that the 898 base pairs at the 5′-end of the upstream region was identical to several long interspersed nucleotide sequences. One hundred forty-eight base pairs at the 3′-end contained the beginning of the first exon including the ATG initiator codon. The remaining 652 base pairs in between contained two AT-rich regions and several regulatory sequences. The mRNA initiation site was identified at 89 base pairs upstream from the translation start codon. The DNA fragment was also analyzed by transient transfection. When linked to a firefly luciferase reporter gene, this fragment enhanced transcription in a rat hepatoma cell line (KRC-7). Using a series of deletions in the DNA, the minimum essential promoter region (from −177 to −60) was identified. The promoter activity was also enhanced by treatment with phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). This enhancement required an AP-1 sequence (−298 to −292; 5′-TGACTCA-3′) and a similar sequence (−97 to −88; 5′-ATGACATCAT-3′). Deletion of either of these sequences significantly reduced PMA enhancement. Deletion of both of these sequences almost completely eliminated PMA enhancement. A rat genomic library constructed in λ-EMBL3 (SP6/T7) vector (CLONTECH) was screened using32P-labeled rat p67 cDNA. A clone containing a segment of 5′-upstream region of p67 genomic DNA was obtained. The DNA (about 1.7 kilobase pairs) was isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of this DNA fragment showed that the 898 base pairs at the 5′-end of the upstream region was identical to several long interspersed nucleotide sequences. One hundred forty-eight base pairs at the 3′-end contained the beginning of the first exon including the ATG initiator codon. The remaining 652 base pairs in between contained two AT-rich regions and several regulatory sequences. The mRNA initiation site was identified at 89 base pairs upstream from the translation start codon. The DNA fragment was also analyzed by transient transfection. When linked to a firefly luciferase reporter gene, this fragment enhanced transcription in a rat hepatoma cell line (KRC-7). Using a series of deletions in the DNA, the minimum essential promoter region (from −177 to −60) was identified. The promoter activity was also enhanced by treatment with phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA). This enhancement required an AP-1 sequence (−298 to −292; 5′-TGACTCA-3′) and a similar sequence (−97 to −88; 5′-ATGACATCAT-3′). Deletion of either of these sequences significantly reduced PMA enhancement. Deletion of both of these sequences almost completely eliminated PMA enhancement. Protein synthesis in animal cells is regulated by phosphorylation of a key peptide chain initiation factor, eIF-2. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; p67, eIF-2 associated 67 kDa glycoprotein; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; bp, base pair(s); kb, +kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AP-1, activated protein 1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; LINE, long interspersed nucleotide sequence. 1The abbreviations used are: eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; p67, eIF-2 associated 67 kDa glycoprotein; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; bp, base pair(s); kb, +kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AP-1, activated protein 1; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; LINE, long interspersed nucleotide sequence. Animal cells contain eIF-2 kinases such as heme-regulated inhibitor and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. Under certain physiological conditions, these eIF-2 kinases phosphorylate specifically the α-subunit of eIF-2. This inactivates eIF-2 activity and inhibits protein synthesis (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Gupta N.K. Datta B. Ray M.K. Roy A.L. Ilan J. Translational Regulation in Gene Expression.

This promotes protein synthesis in the presence of active eIF-2 kinase(s) present in animal cells.An important characteristic of p67 is that the level of this protein varies widely under different physiological conditions, and this level correlates directly with the protein synthesis activity of the cells (6Ray M.K.

The same serum-starved cell line regains p67 transcription after addition of a mitogen phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA).To identify the regulatory sequences in p67 transcription, we have now cloned a segment of the 5′-upstream region of p67 genomic DNA. In the present paper, we describe the characterization of this DNA fragment and identification of the essential promoter region and the PMA-responsive sequences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimersThe primers used in different experiments are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of 32P-Labeled Rat p67 cDNAA 290-bp p67 cDNA fragment was prepared using PCR. The pGEM-p67 cDNA was used as template along with two primers, A and B (Table I). The amplified DNA fragment was then purified and random-labeled using [α-32P]dATP following standard experimental procedures.Isolation and Sequencing of the 5′-Upstream Region of the p67 Genomic CloneA rat genomic library constructed in λ EMBL3 (SP6/T7) vector (CLONTECH) was screened using the 290-bp32P-labeled rat p67 cDNA. A plaque was identified and later amplified. The phage DNA was isolated from the clone and was digested with BamHI. The digested fragments were analyzed in a Southern blot experiment using a synthetic 70-mer oligonucleotide probe corresponding to +72 to +142 base pairs of p67 cDNA. One 1.7-kb fragment was detected after autoradiography. The DNA fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEM 7Zf(+) vector (Promega) and was sequenced following Sanger's dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52338) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence was analyzed using the Genetic Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software. This sequence is shown in Fig. 1.Primer Extension AnalysisThe transcription start site of the rat p67 gene was analyzed by primer extension. Total RNA from KRC-7 cells was isolated using the guanidium isothiocyanate method (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62970) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of RNA was used as a template. The primer was an 18-base oligonucleotide (primer C, Table I) corresponding to the inverse complement of +75 to +92 nucleotides of the sequence reported in this paper. The primer (10 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The primer extension reaction was carried out with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and Primer Extension System (Promega) following standard procedures. The extended product was analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel and compared with the DNA sequence ladder and ΦX-174 HinfI DNA marker.Cell CultureThe cloned cell-line KRC-7 (a rat hepatoma cell-line; a gift from Dr. J. Koontz, University of Tennessee, Knoxville) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 5% (v/v) calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mmsodium pyruvate at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Preparation of Different Deleted p67 5′-Upstream Region ConstructsDifferent deleted p67 5′-upstream regions were prepared using PCR and in some cases followed by nested deletions. The DNA sequences were purified and subsequently subcloned into the XhoI andHindIII sites located upstream of the promoterless luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to generate the pGL3-deleted p67 5′-upstream region constructs. Table IIdescribes different DNA templates and primer combinations used. Fig. 3describes the deleted constructs.

Initial PCR products were obtained by using two primers as mentioned in parentheses. Initial PCR products were fused together and amplified with primers X and H. All the final PCR products were gel-purified and cleaved with XhoI and HindIII. The resulting products were again purified and subcloned intoXhoI/HindIII-digested pGL3 basic vector. Proper deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the constructs. Open table in a new tab Figure 3Preparation of different p67 5′-upstream region constructs.

These two primers and the pGEM7–1.7-kb 5′-upstream region template were used to amplify the fragment using Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR-amplified product was purified by Wizard PCR Prep (Promega) and was digested withXhoI and HindIII. The digested fragment was purified and subsequently subcloned into the XhoI andHindIII sites located upstream of the promoterless luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to generate the pGL3−1531/+24 construct. The DNA sequence was confirmed by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52338) Google Scholar) using Sequencing II kit (USB).The experimental procedures for the preparation of pGL3−652/+24, pGL3−454/+24 and pGL3−366/+24 were the same as described above. The primers used were pGL3−652/+24, primer X + primer H; pGL3−454/+24, primer L + primer H and pGL3−366/+24, primer F + primer H.(ii) PCR followed by nested deletion, pGL3−271/+24, pGL3−177/+24 and pGL3−60/+24. pGL3−652/+24 was prepared as described as above (i). This DNA construct was subjected to nested deletion by using the Erase-A-Base system (Promega) and standard procedures.Promoter in Reverse OrientationpGL3 reverse −652/+24. Reverse orientation of the promoter in the expression vector was obtained by creating a HindIII site at the 5′-end andXhoI site at the 3′-end by PCR using primer S and primer T (Table II). During ligation, the promoter was inserted in the reverse orientation of the pGL3 basic vector.3′-DeletionpGL3−652/−156. The 3′-deleted construct was generated by PCR. The primers X and G were used (Table II). The amplified fragment was digested, purified, and subcloned.Internal DeletionspGL3Δ−180/−60, pGL3Δ−327/−179 and pGL3Δ−477/−326. The PCR overlap-extension technique of Pease and co-workers (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar) was utilized to create the specific internal deletions (Fig. 3, panel D). Initially, two different PCR products were synthesized. For preparation of pGL3Δ−180/−60, the primers used were as follows: reaction 1, primer X and primer I (deletion at −60 to −180 nucleotides in reverse orientation, TableI); reaction 2, primer J (deletion at −180 to −60 nucleotides in the forward orientation, Table I) and primer H. The two PCR products were mixed and fused together. The fused products were amplified with primer X and primer H. Details are given in Table II. The amplified DNA was subcloned into pGL3 basic vector.The procedures for preparation of pGL3Δ−327/−179 and pGL3Δ−477/−326 were the same as described above. Details are given in Table II. In both cases, the fused products were amplified with primer X and primer H. The amplified DNA was subcloned into pGL3 basic vector.Sequence-specific DeletionspGL3ΔAP-1 (−298 to −292), pGL3ΔAP-1-like (−97 to −88), and pGL3ΔAP-1 (−298 to −292)/ΔAP-1-like (−97 to −88).Selective deletion(s) of the two putative PMA-responsive sequences were also performed using the overlapping PCR technique as mentioned above. The specific primers (Table I) were designed to eliminate the AP-1 sequence at −298 to −292 or the AP-1-like sequence at −97 to −88 or both (Table II) (Fig. 3, panel E).Transient TransfectionApproximately, 3 × 106 KRC-7 cells were transiently transfected with different promoter construct by lipopolyamide-mediated transfection (LipofectAMINETM, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to standard procedure. The constitutive expression vector (5 μg of pSV-β galactosidase from Promega) for β-galactosidase was included in the DNA mixture as a marker for transfection efficiency (14deWet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities.Treatment of Cells for PMA InductionThe cells were transiently transfected with different deletion mutants and were serum-starved by replacing the transfection medium with serum-free medium after 8 h post-transfection. The transfected cells were then treated with 1.5 μm PMA for 2 h before harvesting them.Luciferase and β-Galactosidase AssaysThe luciferase activity was measured by the luciferase assay kit (Promega) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested after 48 h post-transfection and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Cell extracts from untransfected cells and from cells transfected with the pGL3 basic vector alone without the −652/+24 inserted sequence were used as negative controls. Luciferase activities were determined by mixing lysates with luciferase assay buffer containing luciferin, Mg2+, and ATP at room temperature and were analyzed immediately by a scintillation counter (15deWet J.R. Wood K.V. Helinski D.R. DeLuca M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 133: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Wampler S.L. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21223-21231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity was analyzed using a commercial enzyme assay system (Promega) at 420 nm. The luciferase activity was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity. The relative luciferase values are the average of three independent experiments. The mean of the luciferase activities relative to pGL3 basic activity ± S.D. are presented in all the figures.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of Rat p67 Genomic CloneA total of 2 × 105 plaques from a genomic DNA library were screened using a 290-bp 32P-labeled rat p67 cDNA probe. One positive plaque was isolated after three rounds of rescreening. The phage was amplified in Escherichia colifollowing the standard procedure. The phage DNA was isolated. The DNA was digested with BamHI and analyzed by Southern blotting. A 1.7-kb fragment from the 5′-end of the gene was identified. This fragment was later subcloned into pGEM 7Zf(+) and amplified.Sequence Analysis of the 5′-Upstream RegionThe sequence of the 1.7-kb DNA fragment was determined following the Sanger's dideoxy method (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52338) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The 5′-end of the upstream region containing 898 base pairs was identical to several LINE sequences (17D'Ambrosio E. Waitzkin S.D. Witney F.R. Salemme A. Furano A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Frischauf A.M. Lehrack H. Poustka A. Murray N. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 19Fanning T.G. Singer M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 910: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and 148 base pairs of the 3′-end contained the beginning of the first exon including the ATG initiation codon. In between these two regions is the proximal promoter of the p67 genome (652 base pairs).The promoter region contains two potential TATA-like sequences between −40 and −20 and several regulatory sequences (underlinedin Fig. 1).Determination of Transcriptional Initiation Site by Primer ExtensionThe results of a primer extension experiment using total RNA from KRC-7 cells and a 18-base oligonucleotide primer (primer C, TableI) are shown in Fig. 2. A DNA fragment was detected corresponding to a position 89 bases upstream to the ATG codon (Fig. 2, lane 2). No extended signal was observed with yeast tRNA (Fig. 2, lane 1). From the sequence analysis, it was determined that the transcription start site was located about 25 bases downstream from the proximal TATA-like element (Fig. 1).Figure 2Identification of the transcription initiation site of the rat p67 gene using primer extension analysis. The end-labeled 18-nucleotide primer C (Table I) was hybridized at 65 °C to 10 μg of yeast tRNA (lane 1) or total RNA from KRC-7 cells (lane 2) and then extended using reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 60 min. The primer extended product was run on an 8% sequencing gel alongside a dideoxy sequencing reaction of the p67 genomic clone. As the sequencing primer was the same as that of the primer extension reaction, the antisense strand is shown. Exposure time was 18 h with intensifying screens.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Promoter Activity of the 5′-Upstream Region of the p67 GeneTo determine the promoter region responsible for transcriptional regulation, KRC-7 cells were transiently transfected with the p67 5′-upstream promoter sequence (−1531 to +24 bp) and also different deleted promoter constructs fused upstream to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3). The promoter activities were then determined by analysis of luciferase expression in the transfected cell extracts. The luciferase activity was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity in the same cell extracts. The normalized luciferase expressions in cells transfected with different pGL3 constructs (+ promoter) and pGL3 basic (− promoter) were compared. The fold increase (× fold) with pGL3 constructs (+ promoter) over the pGL3 basic (− promoter) is presented in different figures.Identification of the Promoter RegionTransfection of pGL3−1531/+24 construct into KRC-7 cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in luciferase expression, and pGL3−652/+24 resulted in an 11-fold increase in luciferase expression over the promoterless pGL3 basic construct. When the promoter region was put in reverse orientation (pGL3 reverse −652/+24), no luciferase activity was observed indicating the directionality of the promoter (Fig.4, panel A). These results suggest that the promoter region lies between −652 and +24.Figure 4Transient transfection assay for p67 promoter. The details have been described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, 1st bar, KRC-7 cells alone. Otherbars in panels A–C indicate KRC-7 cells transfected with different constructs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Functional Analysis of the p67 Promoter Using Sequential DeletionsTo locate the region essential for transcription activation, a series of deletion constructs of the promoter region were prepared and were used to transfect KRC-7 cells. The results are shown in Fig. 4, panel B. The lysates of the cells transfected with pGL3−454/+24 (panel B, 1st bar) showed a slight but significant decrease in luciferase expression compared with pGL3−652/+24 (panel A, 4th bar). Further deletions to −366, −277, and −177 caused decrease in luciferase expression. However, 80% maximum luciferase expression (pGL3−652/+24) was retained even when deletion was extended to −177 (panel B, 4th bar). Further decrease to −60 (pGL3−60/+24, panel D, 5th bar) led to drastic reduction (8-fold) in luciferase expression. These results suggest that the nucleotide sequence between −177 to −60 is essential for basal transcription. Consistent with the above suggestion, it was observed that the 3′-deleted construct pGL3−652/−156 (Fig. 3, panel C) did not promote luciferase expression (panel B, 5th bar).Functional Analysis of the p67 Promoter Using Internal DeletionsTo further define the cis regulatory regions, internal deletions were performed (Fig. 3, panel D). The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4,panel C. The luciferase expression from cell lysates transfected with pGL3Δ−180/−60 suggests that the essential promoter region of the p67 gene lies between −180 and −60 (panel C). This result also correlates with the previous result inpanel B. The luciferase expression was drastically reduced when transfected with pGL3Δ−180/−60. These results, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 4 (panel B, 4th and 5th bars), suggest that the essential promoter region lies between −180 and −60.As shown in panel C, the luciferase expression was not significantly reduced when transfected with pGL3Δ−377/−179 and was increased when transfected with pGL3Δ−477/−326. The results suggest that this region (−477 to −326) may not be necessary for p67 transcription. The reason for an increase in pGL3Δ−477/−326 is not clear and may indicate the presence of a negative regulatory element.PMA Induction of the p67 PromoterThe effects of PMA addition on p67 promoter were studied using both confluent (Fig. 5, panel A) and serum-starved (Fig. 5, panel B) KRC-7 cells. PMA did not significantly enhance the promoter activity in confluent cells (panel A, 5th and 6th bars). The promoter activity was significantly reduced upon serum starvation (panel B, 5th bar). However, addition of PMA to these serum-starved cells significantly enhanced (∼50-fold) p67 promoter activity (panel B, 5th and 6th bars).Figure 5Effect of PMA on the p67 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1992162790,"A nuclear genome delivery system was developed to deduce the modes of inheritance of the clinical phenotypes observed in patients with mitochondrial diseases by transfer of pure nuclei from normal cells to fibroblasts from the patients. The problem of possible contamination of the nuclei with a small amount of mtDNA was overcome by using mtDNA-less (ρ0) human cells as nuclear donors. In this study, intercellular transfer of pure nuclei was carried out by simple fusion of ρ0 HeLa cells with 533 fibroblasts from a patient with a fatal mitochondrial disease, which were deficient in cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities. The results showed that the cytochromec oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities were restored by the introduction of pure HeLa nuclei, suggesting that the observed phenotypes of mitochondrial dysfunction were not due to mtDNA mutations but to nuclear, recessive mutations. Thus, our nuclear transfer system is effective for determining whether a mitochondrial or nuclear genome of a patient is responsible for a disease and whether deficiency of mitochondrial enzymes, including enzymes exclusively encoded by nuclear genomes, is transmitted in a nuclear recessive or nuclear dominant way, providing the parents of the patients with valuable information for genetic counseling on the risk of mitochondrial diseases in their next babies.

Numerous disorders, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, cardiomyopathies, and aging, have been reported to be associated with defects of mitochondrial respiratory function, which is under the control of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (1DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Zeviani M. Nakagawa M. DeVivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 2Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 151-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). For example, nuclear DNA encodes most mitochondrial proteins including factors necessary for replication and expression of the mitochondrial genome. On the other hand, mtDNA encodes 13 polypeptides, which are subunits of respiratory chain complexes and oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase, and two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs necessary for their translation in mitochondria. Therefore, mutations in both genomes could contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and to the pathogenesis of these mitochondrial disorders. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (1DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Zeviani M. Nakagawa M. DeVivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) were shown to be closely associated with heteroplasmy of wild-type mtDNA and mutant mtDNA with large scale mtDNA deletions including several tRNA genes (5Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Nature. 1988; 331: 717-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), with point mutations of the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene (6Goto Y. Nonaka I. Horai S. Nature. 1990; 348: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), and with point mutations of the mitochondrial tRNALys gene (7Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Lezza A.M.S. Seibel P. Ballinger S.W. Wallace D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 931-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), respectively. The intercellular co-transfer of the mutant mtDNA and mitochondrial dysfunction into human cell lines lacking mtDNA (ρ0 cell lines) provided unambiguous evidence that accumulation of these mutant mtDNA molecules alone without defects in the nuclear genome was sufficient to produce the pathogeneses leading to the diseases (8Hayashi J.-I.

S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In most mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, however, the candidate mutations of mtDNA have not been identified. In these cases, even if a patient's mtDNA and mitochondrial dysfunction are not co-transferred to ρ0 cells, mtDNA mutations could be responsible for the pathogeneses for the following reasons. First, during selection to remove ρ0 cells using medium without pyruvate and uridine, mtDNA-repopulating cells (cytoplasmic hybrids; cybrids) expressing mitochondrial dysfunction due to pathogenic mtDNA mutations might also be preferentially excluded together with ρ0cells, so that the isolated cybrid clones would be limited to those with normal mitochondrial respiratory function. Furthermore, the possibility that the amount of mtDNA with unidentified pathogenic mutations is not sufficient to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in the cybrids cannot be excluded. Therefore, intercellular transfer of mtDNA from a patient to ρ0 cells is not appropriate for determining the involvement of mtDNA mutations in the pathogenesis, particularly when candidate pathogenic mutations of mtDNA in the patient have not been identified. On the contrary, intercellular transfer of pure nuclei from normal cells to cells from patients should be an effective system for determining which genome, mitochondrial or nuclear, is responsible for pathogenesis. Moreover, with this system it is possible to determine whether a defect is inherited in a nuclear dominant or nuclear recessive way. For example, if mitochondrial dysfunction in cells from a patient is restored by introduction of normal nuclei, the defect can be attributed to nuclear recessive mutations, whereas if it is not, the defect should be due to mtDNA mutations or nuclear dominant mutations. However, the problem with this system is the preparation of pure nuclei completely free from mtDNA, since even a small amount of wild-type mtDNA is known to compensate for the influence of a predominant pathogenic mutant mtDNA and help in maintaining normal mitochondrial translation activity (8Hayashi J.-I.

This problem can be overcome by using ρ0 cells as nuclear donors; simple fusion of cells from a patient with ρ0 cells results in intercellular transfer of pure normal nuclei uncontaminated by any mtDNA from the nuclear donor cells. In this study, HeLa nuclei completely free from mtDNA were introduced into 553 fibroblasts from a patient with a fatal mitochondrial disease by fusion of the fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells (14Hayashi J.-I. Yonekawa H. Watanabe S. Nonaka I. Momoi M.Y. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Prog. Neuropathol. 1991; 7: 93-102Google Scholar) without using any selective pressure upon mitochondrial respiratory function to remove ρ0 HeLa cells. The 533 fibroblasts showed very low COX 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochromec oxidase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; Oua, ouabain; HAT, hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine. 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochromec oxidase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; Oua, ouabain; HAT, hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine. and SDH activities, and intercellular transfer of nuclei from ρ0 HeLa cells to the 533 fibroblasts restored their reduced COX and SDH activities, suggesting that these clinical phenotypes were not due to mtDNA mutations but to nuclear recessive mutations. The human skin fibroblast line 553 was isolated from a 3-month-old patient with a fatal mitochondrial disease causing congenital COX and SDH deficiencies. 2S. Miyabayashi, H. Hanamizu, K.

The ρ0 HeLa cells are resistant to 20 μm6-thioguanine and 2 mm ouabain (Oua) (8Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The fibroblast lines and ρ0 HeLa cells were grown in normal medium (RPMI 1640 + pyruvate (0.1 mg/ml) + uridine (50 μg/ml) + 10% fetal bovine serum). Intercellular transfer of HeLa nuclei to TIG3S or 553 fibroblasts was achieved by fusion of the fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (13Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. Tada K. Fukushima H. Inui K. Okada S. Goto Y. Nonaka I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19060-19066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells in the fusion mixtures were cultivated in selective medium (RPMI 1640 + pyruvate (0.1 mg/ml) + uridine (50 μg/ml) + 10% fetal bovine serum + hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT; Sigma) + 2 mm Oua). On day 10 after fusion, colonies grown in the selection medium were cloned by the cylinder method, and the nuclear hybrid clones were then cultivated in the normal medium. Total DNA (1 μg) extracted from 2 × 105 cells was digested with a single cut restriction enzyme, BamHI, and the restriction fragments were separated by 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis. After blotting onto a NYTRAN membrane, the DNA fragments were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled HeLa mtDNA. The radioactivity of the fragments was measured with a bioimaging analyzer, Fujix BAS 2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Total cellular RNA was extracted with an ISOGEN RNA isolation kit (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Total denatured RNA (10 μg) was electrophoresed in 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to a NYTRAN membrane. The membrane was hybridized with the [α-32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotide probes COI (nucleotide positions 5847–7746), ATP6 (8704–9020), and 16 S rRNA (1740–3130) and with [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probes of mtTFA and ATPase F1a. The radioactivities of the bands were measured a bioimaging analyzer, Fujix BAS 2000. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine as described (16Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka A. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, semiconfluent cells in a dish were incubated in methionine-free medium containing 10% bovine serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Then the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h in the presence of emetine (0.15 mg/ml). The mitochondrial fraction (50 μg/lane) was separated by SDS-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 6 h, and the labeled polypeptides were located with a bioimaging analyzer, Fujix BAS 2000. The activities of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes COX (complex IV), oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase (complex V), and SDH were measured as described in Refs. 17Miyabayashi S.

The chromosome compositions of cybrid clones were analyzed immediately after cloning using air-dried chromosome preparations as described previously (20Hayashi J.-I. Tagashira Y. Watanabe T. Yoshida M.C. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3957-3960PubMed Google Scholar). The human skin fibroblast line 553 was isolated from a 3-month-old patient with a fatal mitochondrial disease. Since the patient showed progressive COX and SDH deficiencies in skeletal muscles, we examined whether 553 fibroblasts from the patient also expressed these clinical phenotypes. Biochemical studies showed that COX and SDH activities of 553 fibroblasts were about 22 and 10%, respectively, of those of normal skin TIG3S fibroblasts from a fetal subject (Fig.1 , a–b). The observed COX deficiency in 553 fibroblasts could be due to reduction of the amount of mtDNA or to down-regulation of transcriptional or translational activity in mitochondria, because the three COX subunits COI, COII, and COIII are encoded by mtDNA. To examine these possibilities, we first compared the total amounts of mtDNA in 553 and TIG3S fibroblasts by Southern blot analysis after digestion of total DNA samples with a single-cut restriction enzyme,XhoI. Results showed that the amounts of mtDNA in these two fibroblast lines were similar (Fig. 2 a). On the contrary, Northern blot analysis revealed very different transcription profiles of 553 fibroblasts from those of normal TIG3S fibroblasts. Fig. 2 b shows that the processings of mitochondrial rRNA and mRNA in 553 fibroblasts were not sufficient, resulting in the productions of increased amounts of unprocessed mitochondrial transcripts and reduced amounts of mature 16 S rRNA (68.5%) and COI mRNA (28.2%), whereas the amounts of mRNAs of nuclear genome-encoded subunits of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase and mtTFA were essentially normal. Next we examined mitochondrial translation activity using [35S]methionine incorporation in the presence of emetine to determine whether the observed abnormality in processing of mitochondrial transcripts in 553 fibroblasts affected the amounts of newly synthesized polypeptides encoded by mtDNA. Fig. 3shows that the incorporations of [35S]methionine into most mtDNA-encoded polypeptides, including COI, COII, and COIII, in 553 fibroblasts were about 30% of those in TIG3S fibroblasts. Therefore, the reduced COX activity in 553 fibroblasts might be due at least partly to incomplete processing of mitochondrial transcripts, resulting in reduced translation activity in the mitochondria. The profile of mitochondrial translation in 553 fibroblasts also showed another unexpected abnormality, namely the amounts of [35S]methionine incorporation into ATP6 and ATP8 polypeptides were slightly increased over those in control TIG3S fibroblasts (Fig. 3). Moreover, the amounts of their mature mRNAs were also increased correspondingly (Fig. 2 b). These observations predicted slight increase of oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity in 553 fibroblasts, and the results of biochemical analysis shown in Fig. 1 c confirmed this prediction. Since subunits of COX and oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and since mitochondrial protein synthesis is under the control of both genomes, it was necessary to determine which genome was responsible for the reduced COX activity and the elevated ATPase activity in the patient's fibroblasts. Furthermore, although the subunits of SDH are all encoded by the nuclear genome, it was necessary to determine whether the pathogenic mutations causing low SDH activity were recessive or dominant. For these purposes, pure HeLa cell nuclei were introduced into the 553 fibroblasts and the control TIG3S cells, respectively. As ρ0 HeLa cells were shown to have no mtDNA (8Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and to be resistant to both 6-thioguanine and Oua, HeLa nuclei free from mtDNA were introduced into 553 fibroblasts simply by fusion of 553 fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells, and then the cells were cultivated in selective medium with Oua + HAT (Table I;cf. “Materials and Methods”) to exclude unfused parental ρ0 HeLa cells and parental fibroblasts by HAT and Oua, respectively, with selective survival of nuclear hybrids (Table I). The possibility that the nuclear hybrid clones we isolated were hybrids between the fibroblasts and contaminating presumptive revertant ρ0 HeLa cells with recovered HeLa mtDNA was excluded by the fact that no HeLa mtDNA was present in these nuclear hybrid clones. This was shown by HhaI digestion of the PCR products (data not shown), a procedure that can distinguish HeLa mtDNA from other human mtDNAs, as described previously (21Hayashi J.-I. Werbin H. Shay J.W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4001-4006PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the nuclear genome of the nuclear hybrids was derived from both parental ρ0 HeLa cells and fibroblasts, while the mitochondrial genome was exclusively from fibroblasts. Thus, pure HeLa nuclei were transferred to 553 fibroblasts from the patient and control TIG3S fibroblasts, respectively (Table I).Table ISomatic cell genetic characteristics and chromosome complement of parent cells and their nuclear hybrid clonesCell lineDrug resistancea, -resistant.SelectionmtDNAbThe absence of HeLa mtDNA in nuclear hybrid clones was confirmed by HhaI digestion of the polymerase chain reaction products.Chromosome numbercModal chromosome number was obtained from 25 metaphases.Parent cell linesTIG3S (normal)+46553 (patient)+46ρ0HeLa(nuclear donor)6-Thioguaniner, Ouar−48Nuclear hybrid clonesHTIG-1 (ρ0 HeLa × TIG3S)Oua + HAT+78HTIG-2 (ρ0 HeLa × TIG3S)Oua + HAT+77H553–1 (ρ0 HeLa × 553)Oua + HAT+80H553–2 (ρ0 HeLa × 553)Oua + HAT+72H553–3 (ρ0 HeLa × 553)Oua + HAT+75a , -resistant.b The absence of HeLa mtDNA in nuclear hybrid clones was confirmed by HhaI digestion of the polymerase chain reaction products.c Modal chromosome number was obtained from 25 metaphases. Open table in a new tab Then we compared the activities of COX, SDH, and oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase, and the profiles of mitochondrial protein synthesis in nuclear hybrid clones of ρ0 HeLa cells × 553 fibroblasts and ρ0 HeLa cells × TIG3S fibroblasts. Results showed that all the abnormal clinical phenotypes were reversed in nuclear hybrid clones of ρ0 HeLa cells × 553 fibroblasts to levels comparable to those in control nuclear hybrid clones of ρ0 HeLa cells × TIG3S fibroblasts (Figs. 4 and 5). Moreover, the slight overexpressions of ATP6 and ATP8 polypeptides in 553 fibroblasts (Fig. 3) were no longer observed in their nuclear hybrid clones (Fig. 5). Since ρ0 HeLa cells have no mtDNA, restoration of the normal clinical phenotypes must have been due to cooperation between the imported HeLa nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome of the patient.Figure 5Recovery of normal mitochondrial translation profile in 553 fibroblasts by introduction of pure HeLa nuclei. Lanes 1–5 are the profiles of the nuclear hybrid clones HTIG-1, HTIG-2, H553–1, H553–2, and H553–3, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Therefore, mtDNA in the patient was not responsible for the pathogenesis, and all the clinical phenotypes related to mitochondrial dysfunction observed in 553 fibroblasts, i.e. reduced COX and SDH activities, enhanced oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity, reduced translations of COX subunits (COI, COII, and COIII), and enhanced translations of ATP6 and ATP8 subunits, should be due to nuclear recessive mutations. In this study, we developed a system for delivery of a normal nuclear genome from ρ0 HeLa cells to fibroblasts from a patient to determine whether a mitochondrial or nuclear genome of the patient was responsible for expression of the clinical phenotypes of mitochondrial dysfunction. Intercellular transfer of pure nuclei from ρ0 HeLa cells to 553 fibroblasts from the patient was achieved by simple fusion of ρ0 HeLa cells with the 553 fibroblasts followed by HAT and Oua selection. In these nuclear hybrid clones, the nuclear genome was derived from both parental 553 fibroblasts and ρ0 HeLa cells, whereas the mitochondrial genome was exclusively from the 553 fibroblasts. Therefore, if mitochondrial dysfunction was restored by the introduction of pure ρ0 HeLa nuclei, it should be attributed to nuclear recessive mutations, and if not, it should be due to mtDNA mutations or nuclear dominant mutations. The 553 fibroblasts showed apparently diverse abnormalities of mitochondrial respiratory function; reduced COX and SDH activities slightly enhanced oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase activity, incomplete processing of mitochondrial transcripts, and abnormal mitochondrial translation profiles. Transfer of the pure nuclear genome showed that all the mitochondrial disorders of 553 fibroblasts were reversed completely by the introduction of pure HeLa nuclei, suggesting that the clinical phenotypes were diagnosed to be due to nuclear recessive mutations and not to mtDNA mutations in the 553 fibroblasts. Accordingly, abnormalities of at least two nuclear encoded factors are involved in the expressions of the clinical phenotypes in the patient. One is a factor necessary for the processing of mitochondrial transcripts. Mutation of this factor could be responsible for insufficient processing of mitochondrial transcripts resulting in the productions of abnormal amounts of mitochondrial translation products followed by abnormal COX and ATPase activities. The other is a factor necessary for the expression of SDH activity. Recently, a point mutation in the nuclear encoded flavoprotein subunit gene of SDH, which might be responsible for the pathogenesis, was reported in two SDH-deficient siblings with Leigh's syndrome by Bougeron et al. (22Bougeron T. Rustin P. Chretien D. Birch-Machin M. Bourgeois M. Viegas-Pequignot E. Munnich A. Rotig A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), but it was not present in the patient reported here (data not shown). We are now investigating the regulation of expression of SDH subunits in 553 fibroblasts using Northern blot and Western blot analyses. In our nuclear genome delivery system, the fate of ρ0HeLa cell-derived mitochondria in the nuclear hybrids requires consideration, since ρ0 HeLa cells still have these organelles that have no mtDNA or respiratory enzyme activities (14Hayashi J.-I. Yonekawa H. Watanabe S. Nonaka I. Momoi M.Y. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Prog. Neuropathol. 1991; 7: 93-102Google Scholar,23Hayashi J.-I. Takemitsu M. Nonaka I. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We recently showed that when HeLa or fibroblast mitochondria were introduced into ρ0 HeLa cells by their fusion with cytoplasts of HeLa cells or fibroblasts, mtDNA from the imported mitochondria rapidly spreads to all the ρ0 HeLa mitochondria (24Hayashi J.-I. Takemitsu M. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our nuclear hybrids, all ρ0 HeLa cell-derived mitochondria come to possess mtDNA, probably by intermitochondrial fusion with the imported mitochondria containing mtDNA (25Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y.-I. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previously, similar experiments using somatic hybrids isolated by the fusion of HeLa cells with fibroblasts from a patient with Leigh's syndrome were reported by Miranda et al. (26Miranda A.F. Ishii S. DiMauro S. Shay J.W. Neurology. 1989; 39: 697-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their results showed that COX deficiency observed in fibroblasts from a patient was due to nuclear DNA-encoded mutations. To eliminate HeLa cell-derived mtDNA from the hybrids, they used a specific characteristic of HeLa mtDNA, a characteristic which we reported previously, that HeLa mtDNA preferentially segregates from both hybrids and cybrids during prolonged cultivation (27Hayashi J.-I. Yonekawa H. Murakami J. Tagashira Y. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, since they did not use ρ0 HeLa cells as nuclear donors, they could not exclude the possible contribution of a slight amount of remaining HeLa mtDNA (about 5%) in maintaining COX activity in the hybrids. In fact, it has been generally thought that a very small amount of wild-type mtDNA (less than 5%) can compensate for the influence of predominant pathogenic mutant mtDNA with tRNALeu(UUR) 3243 (10King M.P.

On the other hand, replacement of mtDNA of fibroblasts from a patient by mtDNA from normal cells did not restore the reduced COX activity. For accomplishment of these experimental processes, however, an SV40-transformed, neomycin-resistant (Neor), and ρ0 fibroblast line must be isolated from the patient's fibroblasts by their SV40-Neor transfection to isolate transformed Neor fibroblast lines followed by long term ethidium bromide treatment to remove their own mtDNA completely. Therefore, this mtDNA transfer system requires complicated experimental processes, and it is possible that SV40-induced transformation and ethidium bromide treatment of fibroblasts from the patient may have side effects on some factors necessary to ensure normal COX activity. Moreover, for isolation of mtDNA-repopulating cells (cybrids), selective medium without uridine and pyruvate must be used for the exclusion of parental ρ0 cells, a medium in which cybrids with deficient COX activity might also be preferentially eliminated together with the ρ0 cells, as reported previously (8Hayashi J.-I.

In the present study, HeLa nuclei completely free from mtDNA were introduced into fibroblasts from a patient simply by fusion of the fibroblasts with ρ0 HeLa cells followed by HAT selection without using any selective pressure upon mitochondrial respiratory function to remove ρ0 HeLa cells. Therefore, this nuclear genome delivery system using ρ0 HeLa cells can be used to determine the localizations of pathogenic mutations and the modes of inheritance of clinical phenotypes, although possibilities on the loss of a chromosome with dominant allele or increased competition of dominant allele with recessive alleles (1 versus 4 or higher) must be considered carefully before conclusion. This can provide the parents of the patients with valuable information for genetic counseling on the risk of mitochondrial disorders in their next babies. We are grateful to Dr. S.
