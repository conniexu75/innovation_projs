https://openalex.org/W2277351499,"Diversity reigns in antibody responses During the course of an immune response, B cells specific for an invading pathogen divide. The antibodies they produce increase in affinity via somatic mutation in specialized lymph node structures called germinal centers. Tas et al. used multiphoton microscopy and sequencing to determine how different B cell clones compete with one another within mouse germinal centers. Multiple B cell clones can seed individual germinal centers, and germinal centers lose diversity at disparate rates. Such heterogeneity suggests that manipulating minor clonal populations to gain an advantage during vaccination may one day be possible. Science , this issue p. 1048"

Such metabolic “rewiring” may also work against the cancer cells, however, by creating new vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. A variety of human tumors show changes in methionine metabolism caused by loss of the gene coding for 5-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). Mavrakis et al. and Kryukov et al. found that the loss of MTAP renders cancer cell lines sensitive to growth inhibition by compounds that suppress the activity of a specific arginine methyltransferase called PRMT5.

https://openalex.org/W2280104906,"In recent years, millisecond duration radio signals originating from distant galaxies appear to have been discovered in the so-called Fast Radio Bursts. These signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this dispersion is a key observable quantity which, in tandem with a redshift measurement, can be used for fundamental physical investigations. While every fast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a redshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial coordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the identification of a fading radio transient lasting $\sim 6$ days after the event, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's redshift to be $z=0.492\pm0.008$. The dispersion measure and redshift, in combination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionised baryons in the intergalactic medium of $\Omega_{\mathrm{IGM}}=4.9 \pm 1.3\%$, in agreement with the expectation from WMAP, and including all of the so-called ""missing baryons"". The $\sim6$-day transient is largely consistent with a short gamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support progenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This contrasts with the interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio burst, suggesting there are at least two classes of bursts."

Enzymes from microbial communities found within ruminants and hindgut fermenters, however, show considerable promise to break down plant material into simple sugars efficiently. Solomon et al. used 'omics-level and biochemical assays to reveal a suite of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes from early-diverging anaerobic fungi isolated from the guts of horses, goats, and sheep. This approach not only reveals the regulation of these pathways but also represents a method to identify enzymes with no known homologs that would be unidentifiable using conventional screening methods.

https://openalex.org/W2284330471,"Background Poor central nervous system penetration of cytotoxic drugs due to the blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major limiting factor in the treatment of brain tumors. Most recurrent glioblastomas (GBM) occur within the peritumoral region. In this study, we describe a hyperthemic method to induce temporary disruption of the peritumoral BBB that can potentially be used to enhance drug delivery. Methods Twenty patients with probable recurrent GBM were enrolled in this study. Fourteen patients were evaluable. MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy was applied to achieve both tumor cytoreduction and disruption of the peritumoral BBB. To determine the degree and timing of peritumoral BBB disruption, dynamic contrast-enhancement brain MRI was used to calculate the vascular transfer constant (Ktrans) in the peritumoral region as direct measures of BBB permeability before and after laser ablation. Serum levels of brain-specific enolase, also known as neuron-specific enolase, were also measured and used as an independent quantification of BBB disruption. Results In all 14 evaluable patients, Ktrans levels peaked immediately post laser ablation, followed by a gradual decline over the following 4 weeks. Serum BSE concentrations increased shortly after laser ablation and peaked in 1–3 weeks before decreasing to baseline by 6 weeks. Conclusions The data from our pilot research support that disruption of the peritumoral BBB was induced by hyperthemia with the peak of high permeability occurring within 1–2 weeks after laser ablation and resolving by 4–6 weeks. This provides a therapeutic window of opportunity during which delivery of BBB-impermeant therapeutic agents may be enhanced. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01851733"

https://openalex.org/W2282420552,"The variation in molar tooth size in humans and our closest relatives (hominins) has strongly influenced our view of human evolution. The reduction in overall size and disproportionate decrease in third molar size have been noted for over a century, and have been attributed to reduced selection for large dentitions owing to changes in diet or the acquisition of cooking. The systematic pattern of size variation along the tooth row has been described as a 'morphogenetic gradient' in mammal, and more specifically hominin, teeth since Butler and Dahlberg. However, the underlying controls of tooth size have not been well understood, with hypotheses ranging from morphogenetic fields to the clone theory. In this study we address the following question: are there rules that govern how hominin tooth size evolves? Here we propose that the inhibitory cascade, an activator-inhibitor mechanism that affects relative tooth size in mammals, produces the default pattern of tooth sizes for all lower primary postcanine teeth (deciduous premolars and permanent molars) in hominins. This configuration is also equivalent to a morphogenetic gradient, finally pointing to a mechanism that can generate this gradient. The pattern of tooth size remains constant with absolute size in australopiths (including Ardipithecus, Australopithecus and Paranthropus). However, in species of Homo, including modern humans, there is a tight link between tooth proportions and absolute size such that a single developmental parameter can explain both the relative and absolute sizes of primary postcanine teeth. On the basis of the relationship of inhibitory cascade patterning with size, we can use the size at one tooth position to predict the sizes of the remaining four primary postcanine teeth in the row for hominins. Our study provides a development-based expectation to examine the evolution of the unique proportions of human teeth."
https://openalex.org/W2286345832,"Background As Sierra Leone celebrates the end of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak, we can begin to fully grasp its impact on already weak health systems. The EVD outbreak in West Africa forced many hospitals to close down or reduce their activity, either to prevent nosocomial transmission or because of staff shortages. The aim of this study is to assess the potential impact of EVD on nationwide access to obstetric care in Sierra Leone. Methods and Findings Community health officers collected weekly data between January 2014—May 2015 on in-hospital deliveries and caesarean sections (C-sections) from all open facilities (public, private for-profit and private non-profit sectors) offering emergency obstetrics in Sierra Leone. This was compared to official data of EVD cases per district. Logistic and Poisson regression analyses were used to compute risk and rate estimates. Nationwide, the number of in-hospital deliveries and C-sections decreased by over 20% during the EVD outbreak. The decline occurred early on in the EVD outbreak and was mainly attributable to the closing of private not-for-profit hospitals rather than government facilities. Due to difficulties in collecting data in the midst of an epidemic, limitations of this study include some missing data points. Conclusions Both the number of in-hospital deliveries and C-sections substantially declined shortly after the onset of the EVD outbreak. Since access to emergency obstetric care, like C-sections, is associated with decreased maternal mortality, many women are likely to have died due to the reduced access to appropriate care during childbirth. Future research on indirect health effects of health system breakdown should ideally be nationwide and continue also into the recovery phase. It is also important to understand the mechanisms behind the deterioration so that important health services can be reestablished."
https://openalex.org/W2286797259,"Predator-prey relationships are integral to ecosystem stability and functioning. These relationships are, however, difficult to maintain in protected areas where large predators are increasingly being reintroduced and confined. Where predators make kills has a profound influence on their role in ecosystems, but the relative importance of environmental variables in determining kill sites, and how these might vary across ecosystems is poorly known. We investigated kill sites for lions in South Africa's thicket biome, testing the importance of vegetation structure for kill site locations compared to other environmental variables. Kill sites were located over four years using GPS telemetry and compared to non-kill sites that had been occupied by lions, as well as to random sites within lion ranges. Measurements of 3D vegetation structure obtained from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) were used to calculate the visible area (viewshed) around each site and, along with wind and moonlight data, used to compare kill sites between lion sexes, prey species and prey sexes. Viewshed area was the most important predictor of kill sites (sites in dense vegetation were twice as likely to be kill sites compared to open areas), followed by wind speed and, less so, moonlight. Kill sites for different prey species varied with vegetation structure, and male prey were killed when wind speeds were higher compared to female prey of the same species. Our results demonstrate that vegetation structure is an important component of predator-prey interactions, with varying effects across ecosystems. Such differences require consideration in terms of the ecological roles performed by predators, and in predator and prey conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2278123063,"The hetero-tetrameric voltage-gated potassium channel Kv7.2/Kv7.3, which is encoded by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, plays an important role in limiting network excitability in the neonatal brain. Kv7.2/Kv7.3 dysfunction resulting from KCNQ2 mutations predominantly causes self-limited or benign epilepsy in neonates, but also causes early onset epileptic encephalopathy. Retigabine (RTG), a Kv7.2/ Kv7.3-channel opener, seems to be a rational antiepileptic drug for epilepsies caused by KCNQ2 mutations. We therefore evaluated the effects of RTG on seizures in two strains of knock-in mice harboring different Kcnq2 mutations, in comparison to the effects of phenobarbital (PB), which is the first-line antiepileptic drug for seizures in neonates. The subjects were heterozygous knock-in mice (Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+) bearing the Y284C or A306T Kcnq2 mutation, respectively, and their wild-type (WT) littermates, at 63–100 days of age. Seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA, 12mg/kg) were recorded using a video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring system. Effects of RTG on KA-induced seizures of both strains of knock-in mice were assessed using seizure scores from a modified Racine’s scale and compared with those of PB. The number and total duration of spike bursts on EEG and behaviors monitored by video recording were also used to evaluate the effects of RTG and PB. Both Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+ mice showed significantly more KA-induced seizures than WT mice. RTG significantly attenuated KA-induced seizure activities in both Kcnq2Y284C/+ and Kcnq2A306T/+ mice, and more markedly than PB. This is the first reported evidence of RTG ameliorating KA-induced seizures in knock-in mice bearing mutations of Kcnq2, with more marked effects than those observed with PB. RTG or other Kv7.2-channel openers may be considered as first-line antiepileptic treatments for epilepsies resulting from KCNQ2 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2275752360,"The present study examined how support providers’ empathic dispositions (dispositional perspective taking, empathic concern, and personal distress) as well as their situational empathic reactions (interaction-based perspective taking, empathic concern, and personal distress) relate to the provision of spousal support during observed support interactions. Forty-five committed couples provided questionnaire data and participated in two ten-minute social support interactions designed to assess behaviors when partners are offering and soliciting social support. A video-review task was used to assess situational forms of perspective taking (e.g., empathic accuracy), empathic concern and personal distress. Data were analyzed by means of the multi-level Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Results revealed that providers scoring higher on affective empathy (i.e., dispositional empathic concern), provided lower levels of negative support. In addition, for male partners, scoring higher on cognitive empathy (i.e., situational perspective taking) was related to lower levels of negative support provision. For both partners, higher scores on cognitive empathy (i.e., situational perspective taking) correlated with more instrumental support provision. Male providers scoring higher on affective empathy (i.e., situational personal distress) provided higher levels of instrumental support. Dispositional perspective taking was related to higher scores on emotional support provision for male providers. The current study furthers our insight into the empathy-support link, by revealing differential effects (a) for men and women, (b) of both cognitive and affective empathy, and (c) of dispositional as well as situational empathy, on different types of support provision."

In this study, we aimed to establish whether SIRT3 regulated the SDH activity, succinate, and GPR91 expression in HSCs and an animal model of NAFLD. Our goal was also to determine whether succinate released from hepatocytes regulated HSC activation. Inhibiting SIRT3 using SIRT3 siRNA exacerbated HSC activation via the SDH-succinate-GPR91 pathway, and SIRT3 overexpression or honokiol treatment attenuated HSC activation in vitro. In isolated liver and HSCs from methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NAFLD, the expression of SIRT3 and SDH activity was decreased, and the succinate concentrations and GPR91 expression were increased. Moreover, we found that GPR91 knockdown or resveratrol treatment improved the steatosis in MCD diet-fed mice.

SDH catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate, thereby decreasing SDH activity, resulting in increased succinate levels (25.Ariza A.C. Deen P.M. Robben J.H.

The succinate receptor GPR91 in neurons has a major role in retinal angiogenesis.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Locally increased succinate levels and GPR91 activation have recently emerged as novel signaling molecules in local stress situations (25.Ariza A.C. Deen P.M. Robben J.H. The succinate receptor as a novel therapeutic target for oxidative and metabolic stress-related conditions.Front. Endocrinol. 2012; 3: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that decreased SDH activity led to increased cellular succinate levels and succinate receptor (GPR91) overexpression with increased α-SMA production in the isolated HSCs of MCD diet-induced NASH mice (32.Li Y.H. Woo S.H. Choi D.H. Cho E.H. Succinate causes alpha-SMA production through GPR91 activation in hepatic stellate cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 463: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These observations led us to question whether SIRT3 expression could modulate HSC activation through SIRT3-SDH-GPR91 signaling in NASH. To the best of our knowledge, the role of SIRT3 in the regulation of HSC activation has not been fully characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SIRT3 on GPR91 regulation through SDH to mitigate the progression of NASH in HSCs and an animal model, and we determined whether succinate secreted from hepatocytes regulated HSC activation. Overexpression of α-SMA, a hallmark of myofibroblastic trans differentiation, was used as a marker for HSC activation (33.Friedman S.L.

DMEM completely deficient in methionine and choline (MCD medium) and a methionine and choline supplement (MCS medium, control medium) were purchased from Welgene (Kyeongsan, Korea). Palmitate was purchased from Sigma. AAV-GPR91 shRNA (Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA) or AAV6-GFP shRNA (Vector Biolabs) was used for viral production. LX2 cells are immortalized human stellate cells and were provided by Prof. Ja June Jang (Seoul National University). The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution. AML12 cells were cultured in DMEM F12 medium (Welgene) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Whole cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) on ice. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on SDS/PAGE and then electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Levels of proteins were determined by incubation with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions. Primary antibodies included those specific to GPR91 (sc-50466, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ERK1/ERK2 (MAB1576, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), phospho-ERK1/ERK2 (AF1018, R&D Systems), SIRT3 (2627, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), α-SMA (GTX112861, GeneTex), and GAPDH (GTX627408, GeneTex). The bound antibodies were further incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP, detected with the Westsave Star detection reagent system (AbFrontier, Seoul, Korea). LX2 cells grown in the exponential phase were seeded in a 6-well plate and then transfected with 100 nm SIRT3-targeted siRNA (sc-61555, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nontargeting RNA for 6 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Adenovirus transfection was performed when human LX2 cells reached 30–40% confluence in a 6-well plate. Before transfection, LX2 cells were changed using either control or MCD medium and then infected with the human SIRT3 adenovirus (Ad-SIRT3, 1499, Vector Biolabs) or a control adenovirus expressing LacZ (Ad-CMV-β-gal, 1080, Vector Biolabs) at an MOI of 30. 24 h post-infection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blotting. Some LX2 cells were infected with human Ad-SIRT3 or control adenovirus expressing LacZ (Ad-LacZ) at an MOI of 30. 8 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with palmitate for 20 h, after which total proteins were extracted. Male C57BJ6 mice, 6–8 weeks old and weighing 18–20 g, were purchased from Central Animal Laboratory. All mice were housed at ambient temperature (22 ± 1 °C) with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and food. The mice were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCD diet group) as an animal model of NAFLD or control chow diet (control group) for 4 weeks. All mice were fed their assigned MCD diet for 4 weeks, and the AAV6-GFP shRNA (4 × 1011 pfu, n = 4) or AAV-GPR91 shRNA (4 × 1011 pfu, n = 8) were injected via the tail vein on the first day of MCD diet feeding. In another group, mice received 100 mg/kg/day of resveratrol daily with the MCD diet for 4 weeks (n = 8), and C57BL/6 mice on a regular chow diet were used as the control group (WT control, n = 4). Primary mouse HSCs and hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of mice (10–12 weeks old) by in situ Pronase E and collagenase B perfusion, followed by density gradient centrifugation. Primary cells were >95% pure. Cells were grown in standard tissue culture plastic dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Primary cells were incubated at 37 °C and used 3 days after plating. The SDH assay was performed using the ab109908-Complex II enzyme activity microplate assay kit (Biovision, Milpitas, CA). Cell lysate (5 μl) was added to a mixture containing SDH assay buffer, SDH substrate mix, and SDH probe. Absorbance readings at 600 nm were taken every 20 s for a total of 60 min. The data are expressed as mean optical density (mOD)·min−1. The level of cellular succinate was determined with a succinate colorimetric assay kit (BioVision). Succinate levels were read at 450 nm, with each measurement performed in triplicate. SDH subunit A (SDHA) was immunoprecipitated from the total cell lysate with SDHA (sc-166909, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Then Western blots were probed with anti-acetylated lysine antibody (9441S, Cell Signaling Technology). Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Primers were designed as follows: SIRT3, 5-CGT CAC TCA CTA CTT TCT CC-3 and (5-ACC ACA TGC AGC AAG AAC CT-3; GPR91, 5-GCA TGT GTC TAA CAC TGT TG-3 and 5-CTT CTG TCC CAA CTA CTG TG-3; α-SMA, 5-CCA CCG CAA ATG CTT CTA AGT-3 and 5-GGC AGG AAT GAT TTG GAA AGG-3; TGF-β1, 5-TCG ACA TGG AGC TGG TGA AA-3 and 5-GAG CCT TAG TTT GGA AGA TCT G-3; collagen a1, 5-GAA CGC GTG TCA TCC CTT GT-3 and 5-GAA CGA GGT AGT CTT TCA GCA ACA-3; and GAPDH, 5-GGC ATG GAC TGT GGT CAT GAG-3 and 5-TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA GC-3. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with the PrimeScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and amplified by PCR with Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (2×) (Thermo) using standard protocols. All amplified products were assessed with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed using ultraviolet illumination. Triglyceride contents in the liver were determined using the triglyceride reagent kit (T2449, Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. Samples of mouse liver were fixed in 10% (w/v) phosphate-buffered formalin for 18–20 h. After dehydration through a graded series of ethanol solutions, the tissues were embedded in paraffin wax. Serial frontal sections were cut at 5-μm intervals and stained with H&E and Masson trichrome. The obtained 5-μm sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series into water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in 3% H2O2. The slides were subsequently placed on a Dako Autostainer immunostaining system for use in immunohistochemistry analyses using polyclonal antibodies against GPR91(1:100, sc-50466, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SIRT3 (1:200, 2627, Cell Signaling Technology), and α-SMA (1:500, GTX112861, GeneTex) and incubated for 5 h. In the next step, the slides were blocked for endogenous biotin with an avidin-biotin blocking system (Dako, X0590). Labeled streptavidin-biotin complex plus (Dako, K0675) served as the detection system, and hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. To locate the mitochondria, heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) was used to co-label the samples. For double staining of SIRT3 and HSP 60, sections were stained with primary antibodies (both 1:200, sc-49744 and sc-13966, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then with goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, 31635, Invitrogen) and donkey anti-goat Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, ab6949, Abcam, Cambridge MA) for 1 h. Hoechst 33342 staining for 10 min was used to evaluate chromosomes. After three washes, liver samples were mounted in anti-fade medium (Vectashield, Burlingame, CA) and examined under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments, and GAPDH was used as a loading control. Data analyses for the two groups were performed using a t test, with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. To investigate the role of succinate in HSC activation, we treated HSCs with succinate and demonstrated that succinate itself increased the expression of GPR91, ERK phosphorylation, and α-SMA production in HSCs (Fig. 1A). However, pretreatment with 10 μm U0126 (ERK inhibitor) significantly blocked the succinate-induced up-regulation of GPR91 and α-SMA expression in LX2 cells. These findings suggest that the ERK pathway is downstream of the succinate pathway. Treatment with malonate, a known SDH inhibitor, showed increased expression of GPR91 and α-SMA production in HSCs (Fig. 1B) and decreased SDH activity and increased succinate concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D). Treatment with D-malate, a fumarase inhibitor, increased GPR91 and α-SMA production in HSCs (Fig. 1E), decreased fumarase and SDH activity (Fig. 1, F and G), and increased succinate concentrations (Fig. 1H). To investigate the role of SIRT3 in HSC activation, we used siRNA to deplete SIRT3 in HSCs. SIRT3 siRNA transfection increased the mRNA levels of GPR91, α-SMA, TGF-β1, and collagen type 1 (Fig. 2, A and B). SIRT3 siRNA transfection increased the expression of the mRNA levels of GPR91, suggesting a negative association of SIRT3 and GPR91 in HSCs activation. LX2 cells treated with SIRT3 siRNA for 24 h demonstrated decreased expression of SIRT3 and increased protein expression of GPR91 and α-SMA compared with control siRNA treatment (Fig. 3A). Moreover, LX2 cells treated with SIRT3 siRNA for 24 h demonstrated decreased SDH activity and increased succinate concentrations (Fig. 3, B and C). SIRT3 siRNA treatment in LX2 cells induced decreased SIRT3 expression and increased acetylation of SDHA in immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3D). LX2 cells treated with adenoviral transfection of SIRT3 overexpression for 24 h showed increased expression of SIRT3 and decreased expression of GPR91 and α-SMA compared with a control adenoviral transfection (Fig. 3E). Additionally, LX2 cells transfected with adenoviral SIRT3 overexpression showed increased SDH activity and decreased succinate concentrations in HSC lysates (Fig. 3, F and G). SIRT3 overexpression in LX2 cells increased SIRT3 production and decreased acetylation of SDHA in immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3H). Therefore, SIRT3 regulates SDH activity and cellular succinate levels, leading to HSC deactivation through inhibition of GPR91. Both SIRT3 silencing and overexpression modulate MAP kinase, as evidenced by the SIRT3 siRNA-induced increase in phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 3A) or the Ad-SIRT3-induced decrease in ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). We tested whether SIRT3 expression was affected by palmitate or MCD medium treatment in HSCs. When LX2 cells were incubated with palmitate for 20 h, this led to decreased protein expression of SIRT3 and increased expression of GPR91 and α-SMA (Fig. 4A) as well as decreased mRNA expression of SIRT3 in cell lysates compared with control treatment (Fig. 4B). We used MCD medium instead of the MCD diet, which is a widely used technique to create an animal model of NASH, to investigate the influence of MCD medium on the SIRT3, SDH, and GPR91 pathway in HSCs. We cultured LX2 cells in MCD medium for 24 h and monitored SIRT3, GPR91, and α-SMA expression in LX2 cells after treatment. LX2 cells incubated with MCD medium for 24 h showed decreased protein expression of SIRT3 and increased expression of GPR91 and α-SMA (Fig. 4C). Additionally, LX2 cells incubated with MCD medium for 24 h demonstrated decreased mRNA expression of SIRT3 in HSC lysates compared with control treatment (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that palmitate and MCD medium can induce activation of HSCs through SIRT3 deactivation and GPR91 activation. To test whether SIRT3 could improve palmitate or MCD medium-induced HSC activation, LX2 cells were infected with Ad-SIRT3 or Ad-control and subsequently treated with palmitate (300 μm) for 20 h. Palmitate treatment significantly decreased SIRT3 expression (Fig. 5A) and increased GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression in LX2 cells infected with Ad-control (Fig. 5A). However, GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression was attenuated in LX2 cells infected with Ad-SIRT3 in the presence of palmitate (Fig. 5A). We also found that SIRT3 adenoviral overexpression ameliorated the palmitate-induced decrease in SDH activity and the palmitate-induced increase in succinate concentrations (Fig. 5, B and C). MCD medium treatment significantly increased GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression in LX2 cells infected with Ad-control (Fig. 5D). However, GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression was decreased in LX2 cells infected with Ad-SIRT3 in the presence of MCD medium (Fig. 5D). Overexpression of SIRT3 ameliorated the reduction of SDH activity and attenuated increased concentrations of succinate by MCD medium (Fig. 5, E and F). We further found that, when LX2 cells were incubated with Ad-SIRT3, phosphorylation of ERK was attenuated in the presence of palmitate or MCD medium (Fig. 5, A and D). To test whether honokiol, a natural biphenolic compound, could improve palmitate- or MCD medium-induced HSC activation, LX2 cells were treated with or without honokiol (10 μm). After 4 h, the cells were incubated with or without palmitate (300 μm) for 20 h. Palmitate treatment significantly decreased SIRT3 expression (Fig. 6A) and increased GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression in LX2 cells treated with the control (Fig. 6A). However, GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression was attenuated in LX2 cells treated with honokiol in the presence of palmitate (Fig. 6A). We also found that honokiol treatment increased SIRT3 expression (Fig. 6A) and ameliorated the palmitate-induced decrease in SDH activity and the palmitate-induced increase of succinate concentrations (Fig. 6, B and C). MCD medium treatment significantly increased GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression in LX2 cells (Fig. 6D). However, GPR91 and α-SMA protein expression was decreased in the LX2 cells treated with honokiol in the presence of MCD medium (Fig. 6D). Honokiol treatment attenuated the MCD medium-induced decrease in SIRT3 expression (Fig. 6D) and ameliorated the reduction of SDH activity and attenuated increased concentrations of succinate by MCD medium (Fig. 6, E and F). We further found that, when LX2 cells were incubated with honokiol, phosphorylation of ERK was attenuated in the presence of palmitate or MCD medium (Fig. 6, A and D). In a previous study, we demonstrated overexpression of GPR91 protein, decreased SDH activity, and increased succinate concentrations in isolated HSCs of MCD diet-fed mice as a model of NAFLD (32.Li Y.H. Woo S.H. Choi D.H. Cho E.H. Succinate causes alpha-SMA production through GPR91 activation in hepatic stellate cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this study, we applied a novel gene therapeutic approach using recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated RNA knockdown of GPR91 gene expression in a mouse model of NAFLD. All mice were fed their assigned MCD diet for 4 weeks, and AAV6-GFP shRNA (control shRNA) or AAV-GPR91 shRNA was injected into C57BL/6 mice via the tail vein on the first day of MCD diet feeding.

Here, we examined expression, distribution, and activity of V-ATPase isoforms in invasive prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells. Isoforms 1 and 3 were the most highly expressed forms of membrane subunit a, with a1 and a3 the dominant plasma membrane isoforms. Correlation between plasma membrane V-ATPase activity and invasiveness was limited, but RNAi knockdown of either a isoform did slow cell proliferation and inhibit invasion in vitro. Isoform a1 was recruited to the cell surface from the early endosome-recycling complex pathway, its knockdown arresting transferrin receptor recycling. Isoform a3 was associated with the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Both a isoforms associated with accessory protein Ac45, knockdown of which stalled transit of a1 and transferrin-transferrin receptor, decreased proton efflux, and reduced cell growth and invasiveness; this latter effect was at least partly due to decreased delivery of the membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase MMP-14 to the plasma membrane. These data indicate that in prostatic carcinoma cells, a1 and a3 isoform populations predominate in different compartments where they maintain different luminal pH. Ac45 plays a central role in navigating the V-ATPase to the plasma membrane, and hence it is an important factor in expression of the invasive phenotype.

The ATP-hydrolyzing V1 domain contains subunits A–H in a stoichiometry (AB)3CDE3FG3H. Vo translocates protons across the membrane and consists of a, d, and e subunits linked to a 6–10-member ring of c subunits. Operating as a rotary motor, proton translocation is postulated to take place at the dynamic interface of the a subunit and c-ring in the membrane (see Ref. 5.Muench S.P. Trinick J. Harrison M.A. Structural divergence of the rotary ATPases.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 44: 311-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and references therein). In higher eukaryotes, most subunits occur as multiple isoforms (9.Toei M. Saum R. Forgac M.

For many, a common ubiquitous form predominates with others expressed at high levels in particular tissues. The B1 subunit (ATP6V1B1), for example, is highly expressed in kidney, with naturally occurring mutations causing distal renal tubular acidosis, whereas B2 is ubiquitously expressed (11.Karet F.E.

Cultures were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transfer to microphysiometry and invasion assay supports, the adherent cells were released by treatment with Accutase (PAA Laboratories). Two cultures of PC-3 cells used at different stages in this study were both validated by STR profiling (Public Health England Cell Line Authentication Service, Porton Down, UK). Cells cultured in 6-well plates were treated with 19-mer siRNAs targeted against Ac45 (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon SMARTpool M-021378-00, 25 nm), ATP6V0A1 (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon SMARTpool M-017618-00, 100 nm), ATP6V0A3 (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon SMARTpool M-012198-00, 100 nm), and ATP6V1A1 (Thermo Scientific Dharmacon SMARTpool L-017590-01, 50 nm). A control siRNA (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon non-targeting pool D-001810-10) was also used at 100 nm. The four constituent siRNAs within each pool were also tested individually for effects on expression and for phenotypic effects. As an additional negative control, a representative siRNA from each pool was tested after custom synthesis (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon) to include nucleotide changes as underlined: a1, caacaucucaguaaugcua; a3, cccucgcgcagcacaagua; Ac45, ccaccugucaacguaguuu). The siRNAs were incubated with DharmaFECT-2 transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific) in serum-free medium for 45 min at room temperature before mixing 1:4 with complete medium (7% fetal bovine serum). Cells were treated with the siRNA mixture for 24 h before replacement with fresh complete medium. Where necessary for certain assays (invasion, microphysiometry), cells were transferred after this time and used within the subsequent 24 h. Measurements of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were performed using a Cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices). Adherent PC-3 cells (105 cells per cup) were seeded directly into the microphysiometer capsule cups and cultured for 48 h as above to allow an adherent monolayer to form. Weakly adherent LNCaP cells required embedding in agarose to prevent detachment from the capsule membrane.

However, the mechanism(s) underlying PARP-mediated promotion of immune dysregulation in colitis remains unknown, although depletion of cellular energetic pools, which could culminate in cell dysfunction and necrosis as well as the promotion of the transcription of proinflammatory genes, has been postulated (2.Sodhi R.K. Singh N. Jaggi A.S. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and its therapeutic implications.Vascul. Pharmacol. 2010; 53: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PARP1 has been shown to enhance inflammatory responses by promoting the expression of inflammation-associated genes, such as proinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and NADPH oxidase as well as major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II). PARP1 potentiates NF-κB activity and AP-1 expression, fostering the expression of major NF-κB and AP-1-depandant proinflammatory mediators (12.Zingarelli B. Hake P.W. Burroughs T.J. Piraino G. O'connor M. Denenberg A. Activator protein-1 signalling pathway and apoptosis are modulated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in experimental colitis.Immunology. 2004; 113: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, inhibition of PARP-1 with PJ-34 is protective during invasive Salmonella spp. infection by up-regulating IL-6 production through ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways (14.Huang F.C. Upregulation of Salmonella-induced IL-6 production in Caco-2 cells by PJ-34, PARP-1 inhibitor: involvement of PI3K, p38 MAPK, ERK, JNK, and NF-κB.Mediators Inflamm. 2009; 2009: 103890Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting an enhanced innate immune response to pathogenic bacteria. It is, therefore, plausible that PARP1 inhibition in vivo could modulate the inflammatory tone in the colonic mucosa, which might prove protective in the face of epithelial barrier breach and translocation of commensal bacteria. To test this, we utilized a model of dextran-sulfate sodium (DSS)-mediated mucosal injury, which leads to bacterial translocation and transient ulcerative colitis-like inflammation in Parp1−/− mice and their wild-type littermates. We performed genome-wide analysis of the colonic transcriptome profile in combination with 16S amplicon library profiling to test the potential effect of PARP1 deficiency on the colonic microbiome. We also tested the effects of Parp1 deletion in T-and B-cell-deficient Rag2−/− mice in the DSS model of colitis. We show that Parp1 deficiency offers significant protection from mucosal injury in Parp1−/− mice and that deletion of the Parp1 gene leads to dramatic transcriptional reprogramming in the colonic mucosa. This effect is accompanied by modulation of the composition of colonic microbiota and an increased relative abundance of Firmicutes, including Clostridia clusters IV and XIVa. Consistent with this, colonic lamina propria CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ iTreg were present at a higher frequency in Parp1−/− mice. Protective effects related to Parp1 deletion were lost in DSS-treated Parp1/Rag1 double knock-out mice, thus suggesting the requirement for elements of the adaptive immune system for full protection. Specific pathogen-free wild-type (WT) 129/SvEv mice, Parp1−/− and Rag2−/− mice on the same genetic background, were originally obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Rag2−/− were crossed with Parp1−/− mice to develop double knockouts (DKOs). All mice were maintained in a conventional animal facility at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center. Sentinel mice were routinely monitored and determined as free from common murine pathogens (MHV, MPV, MVM, TMEV, Mycoplasma pulmonis, Sendai, EDIM, MNV, and ecto- and endoparasites). All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the University of Arizona Animal Care and Use Committee. Colitis was induced by DSS treatment (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), administrated in drinking water. 6–8-Week-old Parp1−/− mice or their genetically matched WT mice were left untreated or given drinking water with DSS for up to 7 days. Mortality and body weight were monitored daily. In the initial experiment, 4% DSS was used for 7 days followed by H2O for another week. The DSS lot used was determined to be too toxic at this concentration, as it led to 70% mortality during the recovery period (Fig. 1A). In all subsequent experiments, 3% DSS was used for 7 days only to determine the effects of Parp1 status on acute mucosal injury and immune response. A separate study aimed at microarray analysis of colonic gene expression was performed with a new lot of DSS, empirically determined to result in no mortality, at a dose of 4% in drinking water for 7 days. Proximal and distal colons were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Tustin, CA). Fixed tissues were then embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick tissue cuts were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for light microscopic examination. Colon segments were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove fecal contents, opened lengthwise, and shaken vigorously for 10 min in PBS. Tissue was then apportioned to the wells (50–100 mg of tissue per well) of a 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Lowell, MA) and cultured in 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (all from Invitrogen). Tissues were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C until being assayed. Selected cytokine concentrations were evaluated by an xMAP assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and Luminex 100 platform (Millipore, Danvers, MA). Real-time RT-PCR was used to evaluate mucosal expression of IL-17, IL-12p40, TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ, and MMP-8 mRNA (the latter as a surrogate marker of neutrophil infiltration). Total RNA was isolated from mouse proximal and distal colon using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 250 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, 20 μl of the PCR reactions were set up in 96-well plates containing 10 μl of 2× IQ Supermix (Bio-Rad), 1 μl of TaqMan® primer/probe set (ABI, Foster City, CA), 2 μl of the cDNA synthesis reaction (10% of the reverse transcription reaction), and 7 μl of nuclease-free water. Reactions were run and analyzed on a Bio-Rad CFX real-time PCR detection system. Data were analyzed by using the comparative Ct method as the means of relative quantification, normalized to an endogenous reference (TATA box-bonding protein (TBP) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)) and relative to a calibrator (normalized Ct value obtained from control mice) and expressed as 2−ΔΔCt (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin #2: Rev B “Relative Quantification of Gene Expression”). Amplified and biotinylated sense-stranded DNA targets were generated from total RNA isolated from WT and Parp1−/− mice treated with water or DSS (n = 3 in each genotype/treatment group) using GeneChip® WT PLUS Reagent kit (Affymetrix) and hybridized to GeneChip® Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix). Gene expression analysis was performed using GeneSpring 13.0 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Data were processed using the RMA16 summarization algorithm and normalized against the median of all samples or, in some instances, to the median of control samples (WT + H2O). Statistical analysis was performed using built-in tools, including normalized t test or two-way ANOVA, in both cases with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Gene ontology (GO) functional annotation analysis was performed either with GeneSpring or using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 online tool (15.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25346) Google Scholar). Single-site analysis to detect over-represented conserved transcription factor binding sites in a set of genes regulated in Parp1 deficiency was performed using the oPOSSUM 3.0 online tool (16.Kwon A.T. Arenillas D.J. Worsley Hunt R. Wasserman W.W. oPOSSUM-3: advanced analysis of regulatory motif over-representation across genes or ChIP-Seq datasets.G3. 2012; 2: 987-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More detailed results of the analyses, including raw and normalized expression values, can be viewed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus microarray depository web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; GEO accession no. GSE76658). WT and Parp1−/− mouse colons were harvested and cleaned of luminal contents using 1× PBS. The colons were cut open longitudinally and into ∼5-mm pieces. Colonic pieces were washed extensively in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5% FBS and 10 mm HEPES (HHF) (Life Technologies) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in the pre-digestion solution: 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT in HHF to remove epithelial cells. Free of intestinal epithelial cells, colonic pieces were further digested with a solution containing 100 units/ml collagenase (Worthington, NJ) and 40 μg/ml DNase (Roche Diagnostics) in HHF at 37 °C for two consecutive 15-min incubations. After each incubation, cells passing through a 100-μm strainer were collected in RPMI with 10% FBS. After centrifugation at 400 × g at 4 °C, cells were resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and counted with a Beckman Coulter viability counter (Vi-Cell XR). Colonic lamina propria single cell suspensions were stained for Live-Dead cells (Zombie Aqua, Biolegend, San Diego, CA) followed by anti-mouse CD16/CD32 blocking for 15 min (2.4G2 antibody). Cells were labeled with different conjugated antibodies in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C: anti-mouse CD4-FITC, CD25-Brilliant Violet 421, FoxP3-APC, and CCR9-PE (BD Biosciences or eBioscience Inc., San Diego, CA). After washing in FACS stain buffer (BD Biosciences), cells were fixed and permeabilized at 4 °C overnight using fixation/permeabilization buffer following the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience). Intracellular staining for Foxp3 was performed following the manufacturer's recommendation for the Treg staining kit (ebioscience). Data were acquired using an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FlowJo Software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR). Fecal pellets were collected from mice and stored at −80 °C. Fecal DNA was extracted using the FAST DNA SPIN Kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified DNA was resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer and quantified on a Nanodrop ND-1000. DNA samples were stored at −80 °C. The hypervariable region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from each sample using barcoded 806R primers and 515F primer (17.Caporaso J.G. Lauber C.L. Walters W.A. Berg-Lyons D. Huntley J.

The quality of the amplicons and potential contaminants was checked on a 1.5% agarose gel. Replicates were pooled and quantified using Picogreen (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of 240 ng of DNA from each sample were pooled into one multiplexed library and cleaned using an UltraClean PCR Clean-Up kit (MoBio). Pooled amplicons were diluted, denatured (0.2 n NaOH), and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using custom primers (17.Caporaso J.G. Lauber C.L. Walters W.A. Berg-Lyons D. Huntley J. Fierer N. Owens S.M. Betley J. Fraser L. Bauer M. Gormley N. Gilbert J.A. Smith G. Knight R. Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms.ISME J. 2012; 6: 1621-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (5368) Google Scholar). Due to the limited sequence diversity among 16S rRNA amplicons, 10% of the PhiX control library (Illumina) made from phiX174 was added to the run. At a final concentration of 6.75 pm, the pooled 16S rRNA library was subjected to paired-end sequencing using the 2 × 150bp MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 (Illumina). Sequencing was performed in our laboratories on the Illumina MiSeq (serial #M03190, with the MiSeq Control Software v 2.5.0.5). The run of 105 pooled samples generated 12,491,854 sequences. After de-multiplexing and quality filtering 11,371,676 reads remained. Of 105 samples, only 20 pertained to the experiment with a total number of 4,227,058 reads. The reads had a median length of 253 bases. De-multiplexing and filtering were done using the QIIME 1.9.1 software package (18.Caporaso J.G. Kuczynski J. Stombaugh J. Bittinger K. Bushman F.D. Costello E.K. Fierer N. Peña A.G. Goodrich J.K. Gordon J.I. Huttley G.A. Kelley S.T. Knights D. Koenig J.E. Ley R.E. et al.QIIME allows analysis of high-throughput community sequencing data.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (24570) Google Scholar). Sequences were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTU) with a 97% similarity threshold using QIIME's uclust-based open-reference OTU picking protocol against the SILVA reference database (release 119). The average number of sequences per sample was 203,918.6 ± 21,727.4 (mean ± S.D.). The threshold for the minimum number of sequences in a given sample was set to 24,000. The minimum number of reads per sample in this experiment was 173,086; therefore, all samples were included in our analysis. Clostridia clusters IV and XIVa were amplified from 10 ng of fecal DNA using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Fastmix (Quanta Biosciences) at primer annealing temperatures optimized by gradient PCR and melting curve analysis. Quantification cycle (Cq) values were used to calculate relative abundance. All samples were normalized to all bacteria/archaea detectable with universal 16S primers 926F and 1062R. The following PCR protocol was run: 95 °C (30 s), then 95 °C (5 s), variable annealing temperature (15 s), and 72 °C (10 s) for 30 cycles. Each sample was run in duplicate, and the mean Ct value was used to calculate 2−ΔΔCt values. p values were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t test.

Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of mean. At baseline, Parp1−/− mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from their WT littermates, with normal colonic histology and no evidence of mucosal inflammation (not shown). To determine the influence of Parp1 in the modulation of the mucosal immune response during epithelial injury (acute colitis), colitis was initially induced in WT or Parp1−/− mice with 4% DSS in drinking water for 7 days followed by 7 days of H2O alone. In this initial study, the DSS lot used resulted in 70% mortality during the recovery period. However, Parp1−/− mice had a 100% survival rate (Fig. 1A). All subsequent experiments focused on the development of acute colitis 7 days into the administration of reduced-dose DSS (3%). WT mice had bloody stools and extensive changes primarily in distal colonic tissue architecture with hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, loss of goblet cells, extensive mucosal destruction, and loss of the surface epithelium (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Parp1−/− mice displayed no overt pathology (no blood in stools or diarrhea) and showed significantly milder histopathologic changes (Fig. 1B). In the colonic mucosa, TNFα and IL-17 mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in DSS-treated Parp1−/− mice compared with DSS-treated WT mice (Fig. 1, C and D). Potential anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 and IL-22, both protective cytokines in the DSS model, were unlikely to account for colitis resistance in Parp1−/− mice as their mucosal expression pattern closely followed that of other cytokines, i.e. no significant difference between genotypes at baseline and blunted response to DSS in Parp1−/− mice (supplemental Fig. S1). In DSS-treated Parp1−/− mice, although not statistically significant, a clear trend toward decreased IFNγ mRNA, IFNγ protein, and IL12p40 mRNA production in colonic explant culture was observed (Fig. 1D). To better understand the PARP1-mediated effects on inflammation, we performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of gene expression patterns in WT and Parp1−/− mice with and without DSS treatment. Hierarchical clustering of all samples with Euclidean similarity measure indicated that the gene expression pattern in Parp1−/− mice was dramatically different from WT mice at baseline. Limited changes in the gene expression profiles of Parp1−/− mice treated with water or DSS were reflected by close clustering of those two experimental groups (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Parp1−/− status, irrespective of treatment, was closely related to DSS-treated WT mice (Fig. 2). The same clustering algorithm was applied to non-averaged data to demonstrate uniformity of gene expression within each experimental group (supplemental Fig. S2). When WT and Parp1−/− colonic transcriptomes were compared at baseline (no DSS), 10,787 transcript cluster IDs were identified as significantly different (p < 0.05, moderated t test with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction), of which 4,785 transcripts were affected 2-fold or more. The magnitude of this difference is depicted in Fig. 3 as subsets of this list with increasing -fold change (up- or down-regulated transcript cluster IDs) between 2- and 10-fold. The emerging pattern, which favored up-regulated genes, strongly implied a transcriptional de-repression in Parp1−/− mice and suggests that the primary role of PARP1 is to suppress the transcription of a significant proportion of the genes. We further performed gene ontology analysis to identify the most overrepresented categories (biological process) among genes differentially expressed between the genotypes at baseline. The 4785 transcript cluster IDs were converted into 3587 unique annotated genes that were analyzed with the DAVID functional annotation tool under high stringency (minimum 10 genes per category, EASE score <0.01). As shown in Fig. 4 (limited to categories with >100 genes each), the Parp1-regulated genes were greatly enriched in the categories related to proteolysis, protein localization, metabolic processes, cell cycle and cell death, and RNA metabolism and translation.FIGURE 4Gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes differentially expressed in WT and Parp1−/− mice at baseline. 4,785 transcript cluster IDs (WT versus Parp1−/−; -fold change ≥2, p < 0.05) were converted into 3,587 uniquely annotated proteins and analyzed with the DAVID functional annotation tool with the following options: minimum 10 per category, Ease score <0.01.

https://openalex.org/W2275039131,"Several studies have now reported associations between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and low free thyroxine (fT4) during the second and third trimesters, but not in the first trimester. The present study further examines relationships between low fT4, maternal weight, and GDM among women in the FaSTER (First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk) trial, in an effort to determine the extent to which thyroid hormones might contribute to causality. The FaSTER cohort includes 9351 singleton, euthyroid women; 272 of these women were subsequently classified as having GDM. Thyrotropin (TSH), fT4, and thyroid antibodies were measured at 11–14 weeks’ gestation (first trimester) and 15–18.9 weeks’ gestation (second trimester). An earlier report of this cohort documented an inverse relationship between fT4 in the second trimester and maternal weight. In the current analysis, women with GDM were significantly older (32 vs. 28 years) and weighed more (75 vs. 64.5 kg). Maternal weight and age (but not TSH) were significantly associated univariately with fT4 (dependent variable), in the order listed. Second trimester fT4 odds ratios (OR) for GDM were 2.06 [95% CI 1.37–3.09] (unadjusted); and 1.89 [95% CI 1.26–2.84] (adjusted). First trimester odds ratios were not significant: OR 1.45 [95%CI 0.97–2.16] (unadjusted) and 1.11 [95% CI 0.74–1.62] (adjusted). The second trimester fT4/GDM relationship thus appeared to strengthen as gestation progressed. In FaSTER, high maternal weight was associated with both low fT4 and a higher GDM rate in the second trimester. Peripheral deiodinase activity is known to increase with high caloric intake (represented by high weight). We speculate that weight-related low fT4 (the metabolically inactive prohormone) is a marker for deiodinase activity, serving as a substrate for conversion of fT4 to free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active hormone responsible for glucose-related metabolic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2273708304,"Poxvirus-based active immunotherapies mediate anti-tumor efficacy by triggering broad and durable Th1 dominated T cell responses against the tumor. While monotherapy significantly delays tumor growth, it often does not lead to complete tumor regression. It was hypothesized that the induced robust infiltration of IFNγ-producing T cells into the tumor could provoke an adaptive immune evasive response by the tumor through the upregulation of PD-L1 expression. In therapeutic CT26-HER-2 tumor models, MVA-BN-HER2 poxvirus immunotherapy resulted in significant tumor growth delay accompanied by a robust, tumor-infiltrating T cell response that was characterized by low to mid-levels of PD-1 expression on T cells. As hypothesized, this response was countered by significantly increased PD-L1 expression on the tumor and, unexpectedly, also on infiltrating T cells. Synergistic benefit of anti-tumor therapy was observed when MVA-BN-HER2 immunotherapy was combined with PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. Interestingly, PD-1 blockade stimulated a second immune checkpoint molecule, LAG-3, to be expressed on T cells. Combining MVA-BN-HER2 immunotherapy with dual PD-1 plus LAG-3 blockade resulted in comprehensive tumor regression in all mice treated with the triple combination therapy. Subsequent rejection of tumors lacking the HER-2 antigen by treatment-responsive mice without further therapy six months after the original challenge demonstrated long lasting memory and suggested that effective T cell immunity to novel, non-targeted tumor antigens (antigen spread) had occurred. These data support the clinical investigation of this triple therapy regimen, especially in cancer patients harboring PD-L1neg/low tumors unlikely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade alone."
https://openalex.org/W2277350716,"Stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) have been widely used to model randomness which is an inherent feature of biological systems. However, for many biological systems, some kinetic parameters may be uncertain due to incomplete, vague or missing kinetic data (often called fuzzy uncertainty), or naturally vary, e.g., between different individuals, experimental conditions, etc. (often called variability), which has prevented a wider application of SPNs that require accurate parameters. Considering the strength of fuzzy sets to deal with uncertain information, we apply a specific type of stochastic Petri nets, fuzzy stochastic Petri nets (FSPNs), to model and analyze biological systems with uncertain kinetic parameters. FSPNs combine SPNs and fuzzy sets, thereby taking into account both randomness and fuzziness of biological systems. For a biological system, SPNs model the randomness, while fuzzy sets model kinetic parameters with fuzzy uncertainty or variability by associating each parameter with a fuzzy number instead of a crisp real value. We introduce a simulation-based analysis method for FSPNs to explore the uncertainties of outputs resulting from the uncertainties associated with input parameters, which works equally well for bounded and unbounded models. We illustrate our approach using a yeast polarization model having an infinite state space, which shows the appropriateness of FSPNs in combination with simulation-based analysis for modeling and analyzing biological systems with uncertain information."

https://openalex.org/W2293414019,"Although aldosterone is a known regulator of renal and cardiovascular function, its role as a regulator of cancer growth and spread has not been widely considered. This study tested the hypothesis that aldosterone regulates cancer cell growth/spread via G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) activation. In vitro in murine renal cortical adenocarcinoma (RENCA) cells, a widely used murine in vitro model for the study of renal cell adenocarcinoma, aldosterone increased RENCA cell proliferation to a maximum of 125 ± 3% of control at a concentration of 10 nM, an effect blocked by the GPER antagonist G15 or by GPER knockdown using short interfering (sh) RNA techniques. Further, aldosterone increased RENCA cell migration to a maximum of 170 ± 20% of control at a concentration of 100 nM, an effect also blocked by G15 or by GPER down-regulation. In vivo, after orthotopic RENCA cell renal transplantation, pulmonary tumor spread was inhibited by pharmacologic blockade of aldosterone effects with spironolactone (percentage of lung occupied by metastasis: control = 68 ± 13, spironolactone = 26 ± 8, P < 0.05) or inhibition of aldosterone synthesis with a high dietary salt diet (percentage of lung: control = 44 ± 6, high salt = 12 ± 3, P < 0.05), without reducing primary tumor size. Additionally, adrenalectomy significantly reduced the extent of pulmonary tumor spread, whereas aldosterone infusion recovered pulmonary metastatic spread toward baseline levels. Finally, inhibition of GPER either with the GPER antagonist G15 or by GPER knockdown comparably inhibited RENCA cell pulmonary metastatic cancer spread. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for aldosterone serving a causal role in renal cell cancer regulation via its GPER receptor; thus, antagonism of GPER represents a potential new target for treatment to reduce metastatic spread.—Feldman, R.

We aimed to determine the discriminators for aneurysm rupture status by focusing on only posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms.In 129 PCoA aneurysms (85 ruptured, 44 unruptured), clinical, morphological and hemodynamic characteristics were compared between the ruptured and unruptured cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the discriminators for rupture status of PCoA aneurysms.While univariate analyses showed that the size of aneurysm dome, aspect ratio (AR), size ratio (SR), dome-to-neck ratio (DN), inflow angle (IA), normalized wall shear stress (NWSS) and percentage of low wall shear stress area (LSA) were significantly associated with PCoA aneurysm rupture status. With multivariate analyses, significance was only retained for higher IA (OR = 1.539, p < 0.001) and LSA (OR = 1.393, p = 0.041).Hemodynamics and morphology were related to rupture status of intracranial aneurysms. Higher IA and LSA were identified as discriminators for rupture status of PCoA aneurysms."

Abstraction of clinical records and telephone interviews of a retrospective cohort of HIV-diagnosed SOKA and SHIMS clients were conducted in 2013–2014 to evaluate compliance with new linkage procedures and enrollment in HIV care at 92 facilities throughout Swaziland. Of 1,105 clients evaluated, within 3, 12, and 24 months of diagnosis, an estimated 14.0%, 24.3%, and 37.0% enrolled in HIV care, respectively, after adjusting for lost to follow-up and non-response. Kaplan-Meier functions indicated lower enrollment probability among clients 14–24 (P = 0.0001) and 25–29 (P = 0.001) years of age compared with clients >35 years of age. At 69 facilities to which clients were referred for HIV care, compliance with new linkage procedures was low: referral forms were located for less than half (46.8%) of the clients, and few (9.6%) were recorded in the appointment register or called either before (0.3%) or after (4.9%) their appointment. Of over one thousand clients newly HIV diagnosed in Swaziland in 2011 and 2012, few received linkage services in accordance with national procedures and most had not enrolled in HIV care two years after their diagnosis.

https://openalex.org/W2279530658,"Non-bone in vivo micro-CT imaging has many potential applications for preclinical evaluation. Specifically, the in vivo quantification of changes in the vascular network and organ morphology in small animals, associated with the emergence and progression of diseases like bone fracture, inflammation and cancer, would be critical to the development and evaluation of new therapies for the same. However, there are few published papers describing the in vivo vascular imaging in small animals, due to technical challenges, such as low image quality and low vessel contrast in surrounding tissues. These studies have primarily focused on lung, cardiovascular and brain imaging. In vivo vascular imaging of mouse hind limbs has not been reported. We have developed an in vivo CT imaging technique to visualize and quantify vasculature and organ structure in disease models, with the goal of improved quality images. With 1–2 minutes scanning by a high speed in vivo micro-CT scanner (Quantum CT), and injection of a highly efficient contrast agent (Exitron nano 12000), vasculature and organ structure were semi-automatically segmented and quantified via image analysis software (Analyze). Vessels of the head and hind limbs, and organs like the heart, liver, kidneys and spleen were visualized and segmented from density maps. In a mouse model of bone metastasis, neoangiogenesis was observed, and associated changes to vessel morphology were computed, along with associated enlargement of the spleen. The in vivo CT image quality, voxel size down to 20 μm, is sufficient to visualize and quantify mouse vascular morphology. With this technique, in vivo vascular monitoring becomes feasible for the preclinical evaluation of small animal disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2276231426,"Mycoplasma genitalium is a potentially major cause of urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and increased HIV risk. A better understanding of its natural history is crucial to informing control policy. Two extensive cohort studies (students in London, UK; Ugandan sex workers) suggest very different clearance rates; we aimed to understand the reasons and obtain improved estimates by making maximal use of the data from the studies. As M. genitalium is a sexually-transmitted infectious disease, we developed a model for time-to-event analysis that incorporates the processes of (re)infection and clearance, and fitted to data from the two cohort studies to estimate incidence and clearance rates under different scenarios of sexual partnership dynamics and study design (including sample handling and associated test sensitivity). In the London students, the estimated clearance rate is 0.80p.a. (mean duration 15 months), with incidence 1.31%-3.93%p.a. Without adjusting for study design, corresponding estimates from the Ugandan data are 3.44p.a. (mean duration 3.5 months) and 58%p.a. Apparent differences in clearance rates are probably mostly due to lower testing sensitivity in the Uganda study due to differences in sample handling, with 'true' clearance rates being similar, and adjusted incidence in Uganda being 28%p.a. Some differences are perhaps due to the sex workers having more-frequent antibiotic treatment, whilst reinfection within ongoing sexual partnerships might have caused some of the apparently-persistent infection in the London students. More information on partnership dynamics would inform more accurate estimates of natural-history parameters. Detailed studies in men are also required."

To examine the process and outcomes of care of COPD patients by Advanced Practice Providers (APPs) and primary care physicians.


Methods 
We conducted a cross sectional retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who had at least one hospitalization in 2010. We examined the process measures of receipt of spirometry evaluation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccine, use of COPD medications, and referral to a pulmonary specialist visit. Outcome measures were emergency department (ER) visit, number of hospitalizations and 30-day readmission in 2010.


Results 
A total of 7,257 Medicare beneficiaries with COPD were included. Of these, 1,999 and 5,258 received primary care from APPs and primary care physicians, respectively. Patients in the APP group were more likely to be white, younger, male, residing in non-metropolitan areas and have fewer comorbidities. In terms of process of care measures, APPs were more likely to prescribe short acting bronchodilators (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.18, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05–1.32), oxygen therapy (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.12–1.40) and consult a pulmonary specialist (aOR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.23–1.56), but less likely to give influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Patients receiving care from APPs had lower rates of ER visits for COPD (aOR = 0.84, 95%CI 0.71–0.98) and had a higher follow-up rate with pulmonary specialist within 30 days of hospitalization for COPD (aOR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.07–1.48) than those cared for by physicians.


Conclusions 
Compared to patients cared for by physicians, patients cared for by APPs were more likely to receive short acting bronchodilator, oxygen therapy and been referred to pulmonologist, however they had lower rates of vaccination probably due to lower age group. Patients cared for by APPs were less like to visit an ER for COPD compared to patients care for by physicians, conversely there was no differences in hospitalization or readmission for COPD between MDs and APPs."
https://openalex.org/W2280222914,"The rapid Arab-Islamic conquest during the early Middle Ages led to major political and cultural changes in the Mediterranean world. Although the early medieval Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula is now well documented, based in the evaluation of archeological and historical sources, the Muslim expansion in the area north of the Pyrenees has only been documented so far through textual sources or rare archaeological data. Our study provides the first archaeo-anthropological testimony of the Muslim establishment in South of France through the multidisciplinary analysis of three graves excavated at Nimes. First, we argue in favor of burials that followed Islamic rites and then note the presence of a community practicing Muslim traditions in Nimes. Second, the radiometric dates obtained from all three human skeletons (between the 7th and the 9th centuries AD) echo historical sources documenting an early Muslim presence in southern Gaul (i.e., the first half of 8th century AD). Finally, palaeogenomic analyses conducted on the human remains provide arguments in favor of a North African ancestry of the three individuals, at least considering the paternal lineages. Given all of these data, we propose that the skeletons from the Nimes burials belonged to Berbers integrated into the Umayyad army during the Arab expansion in North Africa. Our discovery not only discusses the first anthropological and genetic data concerning the Muslim occupation of the Visigothic territory of Septimania but also highlights the complexity of the relationship between the two communities during this period."
https://openalex.org/W2282977004,"Humans have ridden bicycles for over 200 years, yet there are no continuous measures of how skill differs between novice and expert. To address this knowledge gap, we measured the dynamics of human bicycle riding in 14 subjects, half of whom were skilled and half were novice. Each subject rode an instrumented bicycle on training rollers at speeds ranging from 1 to 7 m/s. Steer angle and rate, steer torque, bicycle speed, and bicycle roll angle and rate were measured and steering power calculated. A force platform beneath the roller assembly measured the net force and moment that the bicycle, rider and rollers exerted on the floor, enabling calculations of the lateral positions of the system centers of mass and pressure. Balance performance was quantified by cross-correlating the lateral positions of the centers of mass and pressure. The results show that all riders exhibited similar balance performance at the slowest speed. However at higher speeds, the skilled riders achieved superior balance performance by employing more rider lean control (quantified by cross-correlating rider lean angle and bicycle roll angle) and less steer control (quantified by cross-correlating steer rate and bicycle roll rate) than did novice riders. Skilled riders also used smaller steering control input with less variation (measured by average positive steering power and standard deviations of steer angle and rate) and less rider lean angle variation (measured by the standard deviation of the rider lean angle) independent of speed. We conclude that the reduction in balance control input by skilled riders is not due to reduced balance demands but rather to more effective use of lean control to guide the center of mass via center of pressure movements."
https://openalex.org/W2284822437,"Host monopolization theory predicts symbiotic organisms inhabiting morphologically simple, relatively small and scarce hosts to live solitarily as a result of territorial behaviors. We tested this prediction with Tunicotheres moseri, an endosymbiotic crab dwelling in the atrial chamber of the morphologically simple, small, and relatively scarce ascidian Styela plicata. As predicted, natural populations of T. moseri inhabit ascidian hosts solitarily with greater frequency than expected by chance alone. Furthermore, laboratory experiments demonstrated that intruder crabs take significantly longer to colonize previously infected compared to uninfected hosts, indicating as expected, that resident crabs exhibit monopolization behaviors. While territoriality does occur, agonistic behaviors employed by T. moseri do not mirror the overt behaviors commonly reported for other territorial crustaceans. Documented double and triple cohabitations in the field coupled with laboratory observations demonstrating the almost invariable success of intruder crabs colonizing occupied hosts, suggest that territoriality is ineffective in completely explaining the solitary social habit of this species. Additional experiments showed that T. moseri juveniles and adults, when searching for ascidians use chemical cues to avoid hosts occupied by conspecifics. This conspecific avoidance behavior reported herein is a novel strategy most likely employed to preemptively resolve costly territorial conflicts. In general, this study supports predictions central to host monopolization theory, but also implies that alternative behavioral strategies (i.e., conflict avoidance) may be more important than originally thought in explaining the host use pattern of symbiotic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2282502386,"Introduction Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and hyperactivity symptoms exhibit an incidence that is male-biased. Thus androgen activity can be considered a plausible biological risk factor for these disorders. However, there is insufficient information about the association between increased androgen activity and hyperactivity symptoms in children with ASD. Methods In the present study, the relationship between parameters of androgenicity (plasmatic testosterone levels and androgen receptor sensitivity) and hyperactivity in 60 boys (age 3–15) with ASD is investigated. Given well documented differences in parent and trained examiners ratings of symptom severity, we employed a standardized parent`s questionnaire (Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form) as well as a direct examiner`s rating (Autism diagnostic observation schedule) for assessment of hyperactivity symptoms. Results Although it was found there was no significant association between actual plasmatic testosterone levels and hyperactivity symptoms, the number of CAG triplets was significantly negatively correlated with hyperactivity symptoms (R2 = 0.118, p = 0.007) in the sample, indicating increased androgen receptor sensitivity in association with hyperactivity symptoms. Direct trained examiner´s assessment appeared to be a relevant method for evaluating of behavioral problems in the investigation of biological underpinnings of these problems in our study. Conclusions A potential ASD subtype characterized by increased rates of hyperactivity symptoms might have distinct etiopathogenesis and require a specific behavioral and pharmacological approach. We propose an increase of androgen receptor sensitivity as a biomarker for a specific ASD subtype accompanied with hyperactivity symptoms. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for practice and future research."

The aim of this study was to investigate serum IgG4 concentrations in adults and their potential relationship with demographic, lifestyle, metabolic, and allergy-related factors. Methods Serum IgG4 concentrations were measured with a commercial assay in 413 individuals (median age 55 years, 45% males) who were randomly selected from a general adult population. Results Median IgG4 concentration was 26.8 mg/dL. Five out of the 413 individuals (1.2%) exhibited IgG4 concentrations >135 mg/dL, and 17 out of 411 (4.1%) exhibited an IgG4/total IgG ratio >8%. Serum IgG4 concentrations were significantly higher in males than in females and decreased with age. After adjusting for age and sex, serum IgG4 concentrations were not significantly influenced by alcohol consumption, smoking or common metabolic abnormalities (obesity and the related metabolic syndrome). Serum IgG4 concentrations were not significantly correlated with serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammation markers. Serum IgG4 concentrations were significantly correlated with IgE concentrations. Serum IgG4 concentrations tended to be higher in atopics (individuals with IgE-mediated sensitization to aeroallergens) than in non-atopics, particularly among atopics without respiratory symptoms. Serum IgG4 concentrations were not significantly correlated with total eosinophil blood count. Cases of IgG4-related disease were neither present at baseline nor detected after a median of 11 years of follow-up. Conclusions Studies aimed at defining reference IgG4 values should consider partitioning by age and sex. Further studies are needed to confirm the potential influence of atopy status on serum IgG4 concentrations."

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of phase errors in time averaged PC-MR imaging of the cerebral vasculature and explore the effects of three common correction schemes (local bias correction (LBC), local polynomial correction (LPC), and whole brain polynomial correction (WBPC)).Measurements of the eddy current induced phase error from a static phantom were first obtained. In thirty healthy human subjects, the methods were then assessed in background tissue to determine if local phase offsets could be removed. Finally, the techniques were used to correct VFR measurements in cerebral vessels and compared statistically.In the phantom, phase error was measured to be <2.1 ml/s per pixel and the bias was reduced with the correction schemes. In background tissue, the bias was significantly reduced, by 65.6% (LBC), 58.4% (LPC) and 47.7% (WBPC) (p < 0.001 across all schemes). Correction did not lead to significantly different VFR measurements in the vessels (p = 0.997). In the vessel measurements, the three correction schemes led to flow measurement differences of -0.04 ± 0.05 ml/s, 0.09 ± 0.16 ml/s, and -0.02 ± 0.06 ml/s. Although there was an improvement in background measurements with correction, there was no statistical difference between the three correction schemes (p = 0.242 in background and p = 0.738 in vessels).While eddy current induced phase errors can vary between hardware and sequence configurations, our results showed that the impact is small in a typical brain PC-MR protocol and does not have a significant effect on VFR measurements in cerebral vessels."

https://openalex.org/W2277874930,"Vertebrates have three isoforms of class V myosin (Myo5), Myo5a, Myo5b, and Myo5c, which are involved in transport of multiple cargoes. It is well established that the motor functions of Myo5a and Myo5b are regulated by a tail inhibition mechanism. Here we found that the motor function of Myo5c was also inhibited by its globular tail domain (GTD), and this inhibition was abolished by high Ca(2+), indicating that the tail inhibition mechanism is conserved in vertebrate Myo5. Interestingly, we found that Myo5a-GTD and Myo5c-GTD were not interchangeable in terms of inhibition of motor function, indicating isoform-specific interactions between the GTD and the head of Myo5. To identify the isoform-specific interactions, we produced a number of Myo5 chimeras by swapping the corresponding regions of Myo5a and Myo5c. We found that Myo5a-GTD, with its H11-H12 loop being substituted with that of Myo5c, was able to inhibit the ATPase activity of Myo5c and that Myo5a-GTD was able to inhibit the ATPase activity of Myo5c-S1 and Myo5c-HMM only when their IQ1 motif was substituted with that of Myo5a. Those results indicate that the H11-H12 loop in the GTD and the IQ1 motif in the head dictate the isoform-specific interactions between the GTD and head of Myo5. Because the IQ1 motif is wrapped by calmodulin, whose conformation is influenced by the sequence of the IQ1 motif, we proposed that the calmodulin bound to the IQ1 motif interacts with the H11-H12 loop of the GTD in the inhibited state of Myo5."
https://openalex.org/W2283541744,"Objective Life stress exposure may impact on health and disease. Previous literature showed that stressful life events are associated with cancer incidence, survival and mortality. In animal models, patterns of maternal care have been shown to critically affect stress sensitivity and immunity trajectories later in life, by modifying DNA methylation during critical periods early in life. However, the role of parental care in breast cancer progression and survival has only limitedly been explored. Here, we investigated whether these factors may be linked to biological prognostic variables. Methods One hundred twenty-three women hospitalized for surgery of primary breast cancer completed a questionnaire assessing parental bonding. Stressful events throughout the life span were also assessed. Results We found that the absence of optimal parental relationships is significantly associated with an increased risk of lymph node involvement, adjusting for confounders, while cumulative stress in the area of sentimental relationships is borderline significantly associated with the same prognostic factor. Conclusions Our results suggest that parental bonding and sentimental relations may have a role in breast cancer progression. These variables represent an important evolutionary aspect which may modulate cancer progression through psycho-physiological stress pathways and influence the immune system."

Here we performed a phylogenomic analysis of Mlxip (encoding MondoA) and Mlxipl (encoding ChREBP) genes across vertebrates. Analysis of extant Mlxip and Mlxipl genes suggests that the most recent common ancestor of these genes was composed of 17 coding exons. Single copy genes encoding both ChREBP and MondoA, along with their interacting partner Mlx, were found in diverse vertebrate genomes, including fish that have experienced a genome duplication. This observation suggests that a single Mlx gene has been retained to maintain coordinate regulation of ChREBP and MondoA. The ChREBP-β isoform, the more potent and constitutively active isoform, appeared with the evolution of tetrapods and is absent from the Mlxipl genes of fish. Evaluation of the conservation of ChREBP and MondoA sequences demonstrate that MondoA is better conserved and potentially mediates more ancient function in glucose metabolism."
