https://openalex.org/W1984903682,"The ultraviolet (UV) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B. The effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal activation domain. Here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of JNK1, a distant relative of the MAP kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr and Tyr during the UV response. Significantly, Ha-Ras partially activates JNK1 and potentiates the activation caused by UV. JNK1 binds to the c-Jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on Ser-63 and Ser-73. Thus, JNK1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and UV irradiation. These properties indicate that JNK1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion."

https://openalex.org/W2147242002,"gamma-Irradiation of human diploid fibroblasts in the G1 interval caused arrest of the cell cycle prior to S phase. This cell cycle block was correlated with a lack of activation of both cyclin E-Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and cyclin A-Cdk2 kinases and depended on wild-type p53. Although the accumulation of cyclin A was strongly inhibited in gamma-irradiated cells, cyclin E accumulated and bound Cdk2 at normal levels but remained in an inactive state. We found that both whole-cell lysates and inactive cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes prepared from irradiated cells contained an activity capable of inactivating cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. The protein responsible for this activity was shown to be p21CIP1/WAF1, recently described as a p53-inducible Cdk inhibitor. Our data suggest a model in which ionizing radiation confers G1 arrest via the p53-mediated induction of a Cdk inhibitor protein."

https://openalex.org/W1966917600,"Homologous recombination was utilized to generate mice with a deletion in the coding sequence of the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene. Animals homozygous for NGF disruption failed to respond to noxious mechanical stimuli, and histological analysis revealed profound cell loss in both sensory and sympathetic ganglia. Within dorsal root ganglia, effects of the mutation appeared to be restricted to small and medium peptidergic neurons. These observations confirm the critical dependence of sensory and sympathetic neurons on NGF and demonstrate that other neurotrophins are not able to compensate for the loss of NGF action on these cells. Examination of the central nervous system revealed that, in marked contrast with neurons of sensory and sympathetic ganglia, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons differentiate and continue to express phenotypic markers for the life span of the null mutant mice. Thus, differentiation and initial survival of central NGF-responsive neurons can occur in the absence of NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2142746886,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin, enhances the survival and differentiation of several classes of neurons in vitro. To determine its essential functions, we have mutated the BDNF gene. Most homozygote mutants die within 2 days after birth, but a fraction live for 2–4 weeks. These develop symptoms of nervous system dysfunction, including ataxia. The BDNF mutant homozygotes have substantially reduced numbers of cranial and spinal sensory neurons. Although their central nervous systems show no gross structural abnormalities, expression of neuropeptide Y and calcium-binding proteins is altered in many neurons, suggesting they do not function normally. In contrast with mice lacking the BDNF receptor TrkB, motor neurons appear normal in the BDNF mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2065843356,"Although astrocytes have been considered to be supportive, rather than transmissive, in the adult nervous system, recent studies have challenged this assumption by demonstrating that astrocytes possess functional neurotransmitter receptors. Astrocytes are now shown to directly modulate the free cytosolic calcium, and hence transmission characteristics, of neighboring neurons. When a focal electric field potential was applied to single astrocytes in mixed cultures of rat forebrain astrocytes and neurons, a prompt elevation of calcium occurred in the target cell. This in turn triggered a wave of calcium increase, which propagated from astrocyte to astrocyte. Neurons resting on these astrocytes responded with large increases in their concentration of cytosolic calcium. The gap junction blocker octanol attenuated the neuronal response, which suggests that the astrocytic-neuronal signaling is mediated through intercellular connections rather than synaptically. This neuronal response to local astrocytic stimulation may mediate local intercellular communication within the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2161020639,"We have generated H-2b mice with a homozygous null mutation in the granzyme (gzm) B gene. Gzm B is a neutral serine protease with Aspase activity that is found only in the granules of activated cytolytic T cells, natural killer cells, and lymphokine-activated killer cells. Gzm B−/− mice develop normally and have normal hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. In vitro, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) derived from gzm B−/− animals are able to induce 51Cr release from allotarget cells, but with reduced efficiency. However, gzm B−/− CTL have a profound defect in their ability to induce rapid DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in allogeneic target cells. This defect is kinetic since DNA fragmentation is partially compensated and 51Cr release is completely resuced with long incubation times. We conclude that gzm B serves a critical and nonredundant role for the rapid induction of target cell DNA fragmentation and apoptosis by alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2045457895,"The European wild boar was crossed with the domesticated Large White pig to genetically dissect phenotypic differences between these populations for growth and fat deposition. The most important effects were clustered on chromosome 4, with a single region accounting for a large part of the breed difference in growth rate, fatness, and length of the small intestine. The study is an advance in genome analyses and documents the usefulness of crosses between divergent outbred populations for the detection and characterization of quantitative trait loci. The genetic mapping of a major locus for fat deposition in the pig could have implications for understanding human obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2046608680,"We have examined the growth capacity of keratinocytes isolated from human scalp hair follicles. Like the keratinocytes of glabrous epidermis, most of the colony-forming cells are classified as holoclones or meroclones when analyzed in a clonal assay. Some of them have extensive growth potential, as they are able to undergo at least 130 doublings. Therefore, the hair follicle, like the epidermis, contains keratinocytes with the expected property of stem cells: an extensive proliferative capacity permitting the generation of a large amount of epithelium. We have also examined the distribution of clonogenic keratinocytes within the hair follicle. Several hundred colony-forming cells are concentrated at a region below the midpoint of the follicle and outside the hair bulb. This region lies deeper than the site of insertion of the arrector pili muscle, which corresponds with the position of the bulge when the latter can be identified. In contrast, few colony-forming cells are present in the hair bulb, where most of the mitotic activity is observed during the active growth phase of the follicle. Paraclones, which are present both in the midregion and in the bulb of hair follicles, are unlikely to be the transient amplifying cells expected from kinetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2055829187,"The consolidation of long-term memory requires protein and mRNA synthesis. A similar requirement has been demonstrated for learning-related synaptic plasticity in the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. The monosynaptic component of this reflex can be reconstituted in vitro, where it undergoes both short- and long-term increases in synaptic strength in response to serotonin (5-HT), a neurotransmitter released during behavioral sensitization, a simple form of learning. As with sensitization, the long-term synaptic modification is characterized by a brief consolidation period during which gene expression is required. We find that during this phase, the transcription factor Aplysia CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (ApC/EBP) is induced rapidly by 5-HT and by cAMP, even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Blocking the function of ApC/EBP blocks long-term facilitation selectively without affecting the short-term process. These data indicate that cAMP-inducible immediate-early genes have an essential role in the consolidation of stable long-term synaptic plasticity in Aplysia."

https://openalex.org/W2028154752,"The folded gastrulation (fog) gene is required during Drosophila gastrulation for two morphogenetic movements, formation of the ventral furrow and invagination of the posterior midgut primordium. fog coordinates cell shape changes during these invaginations by inducing apical constriction of cells in spatially and temporally defined manners. fog is expressed in the invagination primordia in a pattern that precisely precedes the pattern of constrictions. Overexpression of fog in the dorsoanterior region of the embryo induces ectopic constrictions, indicating localization of fog transcripts may define domains of cell shape changes. fog encodes a novel protein with a putative signal sequence but no potential transmembrane domains. We suggest fog functions as a secreted signal that activates the G protein alpha subunit encoded by concertina in neighboring cells. Our analyses indicate that cell-cell communication ensures the rapid, orderly progression of constriction initiations from the middle of invagination primordia out toward the margins."

https://openalex.org/W2021943181,"YY1 is a zinc finger transcription factor whose DNA-binding motif exhibits the properties of an initiator element. Only three factors were required to direct specific basal transcription on a supercoiled template DNA carrying the YY1 initiator: YY1, general transcription factor IIB, and RNA polymerase II. This minimal in vitro reaction did not require the TATA-binding protein (TBP). We propose that, under appropriate conditions, YY1 can function like TBP, as a factor that binds to the core promoter and recruits the polymerase to the initiation complex."

https://openalex.org/W2078553950,"DARWIN1 believed that sexual selection accounts for the evolution of exaggerated male ornaments, such as the sword-like caudal fin extensions of male fishes of the genus Xiphophorus, that appear detrimental to survival. Swordtails continue to feature prominently in empirical work and theories of sexual selection; the pre-existing bias hypothesis has been offered as an explanation for the evolution of swords in these fishes2,3. Based upon a largely morphological phylogeny, this hypothesis suggests that female preference to mate with sworded males arose in ancestrally swordless species, thus pre-dating the origin of the sword itself and directly driving its evolution. Here we present a molecular phylogeny (based on mitochondria! and nuclear DNA sequences) of Xiphophorus which differs from the traditional one: it indicates that the sword originated and was lost repeatedly. Our phylogeny suggests that the ancestor of the genus is more likely to have possessed a sword than not, thus questioning the applicability of the pre-existing bias hypothesis as an explanation for the evolution of this sexually selected trait."

https://openalex.org/W2022481460,"The three-dimensional structure of a member of the beta subfamily of chemokines, human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (hMIP-1 beta), has been determined with the use of solution multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Human MIP-1 beta is a symmetric homodimer with a relative molecular mass of approximately 16 kilodaltons. The structure of the hMIP-1 beta monomer is similar to that of the related alpha chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). However, the quaternary structures of the two proteins are entirely distinct, and the dimer interface is formed by a completely different set of residues. Whereas the IL-8 dimer is globular, the hMIP-1 beta dimer is elongated and cylindrical. This provides a rational explanation for the absence of cross-binding and reactivity between the alpha and beta chemokine subfamilies. Calculation of the solvation free energies of dimerization suggests that the formation and stabilization of the two different types of dimers arise from the burial of hydrophobic residues."

https://openalex.org/W2004066268,"The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of rat DNA polymerase β (pol β) has been determined at 2.3 Å resolution and refined to an R factor of 0.22. The mixed protein has three subdomains arranged in an overall U shape reminlscent of other polymerase structures. The folding topology of pol β, however, is unique. Two divalent metals bind near three aspartic acid residues implicated in the catalytic activity. In the presence of Mn2+ and dTTP, interpretable electron density is seen for two metals and the triphosphate, but not the deoxythymidine molety. The principal interaction of the triphosphate molety is with the bound divalent metals."

https://openalex.org/W2078487164,"The mating-type locus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exists as two apparent alleles (mt+ and mt-) that control mating in haploid gametes and sporulation and meiosis in diploid mt+/mt- zygotes. Twelve genes, seven unrelated to life cycle transitions, are tightly linked to mt, suggesting that the locus exerts recombinational suppression. A 1.1 Mb chromosome walk from a gene linked to mt demonstrates that the mt+ and mt- loci carry four intrachromosomal translocations, two inversions, and large deletions and duplications within a 190 kb sector, presumably accounting for the recombinational suppression that extends through 640 kb of flanking homologous DNA. The rearranged domain also carries blocks of mt(+)- and mt(-)-specific sequences, at least one of which includes a mt(+)-specific gene. The locus has the properties of an incipient sex chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2031133042,"The Drosophila decapentaplegic (dpp) gene encodes a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-like protein that plays a key role in several aspects of development. Transduction of the DPP signal was investigated by cloning of serine-threonine kinase transmembrane receptors from Drosophila because this type of receptor is specific for the TGF-beta-like ligands. Here evidence is provided demonstrating that the Drosophila saxophone (sax) gene, a previously identified female sterile locus, encodes a TGF-beta-like type I receptor. Embryos from sax mothers and dpp embryos exhibit similar mutant phenotypes during early gastrulation, and these two loci exhibit genetic interactions, which suggest that they are utilized in the same pathway. These data suggest that sax encodes a receptor for dpp."

https://openalex.org/W2056542380,"The intercalated epithelial cell exists in two interconvertible forms in vivo, one where band 3 protein is apical and the other where it is basolateral. We seeded an immortalized clone of these cells at low density and found that band 3 was apical at confluence. There was little or no apical endocytosis. But when the cells were plated at high density, band 3 was basolateral, and there was vigorous apical endocytosis. Extracellular matrix produced by high density cells was able to retarget band 3 in low density cells and to induce apical endocytosis, as did a 230 kd protein partially purified from this matrix. Therefore, polarized targeting of some proteins is determined by external cues that might determine their polarity by reorganizing the cytoplasm."
