https://openalex.org/W2910593560,"Background Most of the evidence on antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) to help sustain the effectiveness of antimicrobials is generated in high income countries. We report a study investigating implementation of ASP in secondary care across low-, middle- and high-income countries. The objective of this study was to map the key contextual, including cultural, drivers of the development and implementation of ASP across different resource settings. Materials and methods Healthcare professionals responsible for implementing ASP in hospitals in England, France, Norway, India, and Burkina Faso were invited to participate in face-to face interviews. Field notes from observations, documentary evidence, and interview transcripts were analysed using grounded theory approach. The key emerging categories were analysed iteratively using constant comparison, initial coding, going back the field for further data collection, and focused coding. Theoretical sampling was applied until the categories were saturated. Cross-validation and triangulation of the findings were achieved through the multiple data sources. Results 54 participants from 24 hospitals (England 9 participants/4 hospitals; Norway 13 participants/4 hospitals; France 9 participants/7 hospitals; India 13 participants/ 7 hospitals; Burkina Faso 8 participants/2 hospitals) were interviewed. Across Norway, France and England there was consistency in ASP structures. In India and Burkina Faso there were country level heterogeneity in ASP. State support for ASP was perceived as essential in countries where it is lacking (India, Burkina Faso), and where it was present, it was perceived as a barrier (England, France). Professional boundaries are one of the key cultural determinants dictating involvement in initiatives with doctors recognised as leaders in ASP. Nurse and pharmacist involvement was limited to England. The surgical specialty was identified as most difficult to engage with in each country. Despite challenges, one hospital in India provided the best example of interdisciplinary ASP, championed through organisational leadership. Conclusions ASP initiatives in this study were restricted by professional boundaries and hierarchies, with lack of engagement with the wider healthcare workforce. There needs to be promotion of interdisciplinary team work including pharmacists and nurses, depending on the available healthcare workforce in different countries, in ASP. The surgical pathway remains a hard to reach, but critical target for ASP globally. There is a need to develop contextually driven ASP targeting the surgical pathway in different resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W2909171556,"Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, the space fillers or molecular shields, are the hydrophilic protective proteins which play an important role during plant development and abiotic stress. The systematic survey and characterization revealed a total of 68 LEA genes, belonging to 8 families in Sorghum bicolor. The LEA-2, a typical hydrophobic family is the most abundant family. All of them are evenly distributed on all 10 chromosomes and chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 appear to be the hot spots. Majority of the S. bicolor LEA (SbLEA) genes are intron less or have fewer introns. A total of 22 paralogous events were observed and majority of them appear to be segmental duplications. Segmental duplication played an important role in SbLEA-2 family expansion. A total of 12 orthologs were observed with Arabidopsis and 13 with Oryza sativa. Majority of them are basic in nature, and targeted by chloroplast subcellular localization. Fifteen miRNAs targeted to 25 SbLEAs appear to participate in development, as well as in abiotic stress tolerance. Promoter analysis revealed the presence of abiotic stress-responsive DRE, MYB, MYC, and GT1, biotic stress-responsive W-Box, hormone-responsive ABA, ERE, and TGA, and development-responsive SKn cis-elements. This reveals that LEA proteins play a vital role during stress tolerance and developmental processes. Using microarray data, 65 SbLEA genes were analyzed in different tissues (roots, pith, rind, internode, shoot, and leaf) which show clear tissue specific expression. qRT-PCR analysis of 23 SbLEA genes revealed their abundant expression in various tissues like roots, stems and leaves. Higher expression was noticed in stems compared to roots and leaves. Majority of the SbLEA family members were up-regulated at least in one tissue under different stress conditions. The SbLEA3-2 is the regulator, which showed abundant expression under diverse stress conditions. Present study provides new insights into the formation of LEAs in S. bicolor and to understand their role in developmental processes under stress conditions, which may be a valuable source for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2908645184,"Four new species of Capsicum (Capsiceae, Solanaceae) from Andean tropical forests in South America are described. Capsicum benoistii Hunz. ex Barboza sp. nov. (incertae sedis) is endemic to a restricted area in south-central Ecuador and is most similar to the more widespread C. geminifolium (Dammer) Hunz. (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). Capsicum piuranum Barboza & S. Leiva sp. nov. (Andean clade) is found in northern Peru (Department Piura) and is morphologically most similar to C. caballeroi M. Nee of the Bolivian yungas (Departments Santa Cruz and Cochabamba) but closely related to C. geminifolium and C. lycianthoides Bitter. Capsicum longifolium Barboza & S. Leiva sp. nov. (Andean clade) occurs from northern Peru (Departments Amazonas, Cajamarca, and Piura) to southern Ecuador (Province Zamora-Chinchipe), and is morphologically most similar to C. dimorphum (Miers) Kuntze (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). Capsicum neei Barboza & X. Reyes sp. nov. (Bolivian clade) is endemic to southeastern Bolivia (Departments Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz) in the Boliviano-Tucumano Forest, is morphologically most similar to another Bolivian endemic species C. minutiflorum Rusby (Hunz.), and is closely related to C. caballeroi. Complete descriptions, illustrations, distributions and conservation assessments of all new species are given. Chromosome numbers for C. piuranum and C. longifolium are also provided. Three of the new species were included in a new phylogenetic analysis for Capsicum; their positions were strongly resolved within clades previously recognized in the genus."
https://openalex.org/W2950624124,"The gut microbiome of insects directly or indirectly affects the metabolism, immune status, sensory perception and feeding behavior of its host. Here, we examine the hypothesis that in the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis, Diptera: Tephritidae), the presence or absence of gut symbionts affects foraging behavior and nutrient ingestion. We offered protein-starved flies, symbiotic or aposymbiotic, a choice between diets containing all amino acids or only the non-essential ones. The different diets were presented in a foraging arena as drops that varied in their size and density, creating an imbalanced foraging environment. Suppressing the microbiome resulted in significant changes of the foraging behavior of both male and female flies. Aposymbiotic flies responded faster to the diets offered in experimental arenas, spent more time feeding, ingested more drops of food, and were constrained to feed on time-consuming patches (containing small drops of food), when these offered the full complement of amino acids. We discuss these results in the context of previous studies on the effect of the gut microbiome on host behavior, and suggest that these be extended to the life history dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2910306234,"Decisions that we make about email legitimacy can result in a pernicious threat to security of both individuals and organisations. Yet user response to phishing emails is far from uniform; some respond while others do not. What is the source of this diversity in decision-making? From a psychological perspective, we consider cognitive and situational influences that might explain why certain users are more susceptible than others. Alongside an email judgment task employed as a proxy for fraud susceptibility, 224 participants completed a range of cognitive tasks. In addition, we manipulated time pressure for email legitimacy judgments. We identify cognitive reflection and sensation seeking as significant, albeit modest, predictors of susceptibility. Further to this, participants asked to make quicker responses made more judgment errors. We conclude there are cognitive signatures that partially contribute to email fraud susceptibility, with implications for efforts to limit online security breaches and train secure behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2909568496,"There is a critical need for fast, inexpensive, objective, and accurate screening tools for childhood psychopathology. Perhaps most compelling is in the case of internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, where unobservable symptoms cause children to go unassessed–suffering in silence because they never exhibiting the disruptive behaviors that would lead to a referral for diagnostic assessment. If left untreated these disorders are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new approach for identifying children with internalizing disorders using an instrumented 90-second mood induction task. Participant motion during the task is monitored using a commercially available wearable sensor. We show that machine learning can be used to differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with 81% accuracy (67% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We provide a detailed description of the modeling methodology used to arrive at these results and explore further the predictive ability of each temporal phase of the mood induction task. Kinematical measures most discriminative of internalizing diagnosis are analyzed in detail, showing affected children exhibit significantly more avoidance of ambiguous threat. Performance of the proposed approach is compared to clinical thresholds on parent-reported child symptoms which differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with slightly lower accuracy (.68-.75 vs. .81), slightly higher specificity (.88–1.00 vs. .88), and lower sensitivity (.00-.42 vs. .67) than the proposed, instrumented method. These results point toward the future use of this approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success."
https://openalex.org/W2803512558,"The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a powerful environmental law protecting imperiled plants and animals, and a growing number of marine species have been protected under this law as extinction risk in the oceans has increased. Marine mammals and sea turtles comprise 38% of the 163 ESA-listed marine “species”, which includes subspecies and distinct population segments, yet analyses of recovery trends after listing are lacking. Here we gathered the best available annual abundance estimates for geographically delimited populations of all 62 marine mammal and sea turtle species listed under the ESA. Of these, we chose representative populations of species that were listed before 2012, occur and reproduce in U.S. waters, and have data of sufficient quality and timespan for trend analyses. Thus, we quantitatively analyzed population trends, magnitude of population change, and recovery status for 23 and 8 representative populations of 14 marine mammal and 5 sea turtle species, respectively. Using generalized linear and non-linear models, we found that 18 marine mammal (78%) and 6 sea turtle (75%) populations significantly increased after listing; 3 marine mammal (13%) and 2 sea turtle (25%) populations showed non-significant changes; while 2 marine mammal (9%), but no sea turtle populations declined after ESA protection. Overall, the 24 populations that increased in abundance were from species listed for 20 years or more (e.g., large whales, manatees, and sea turtles). Conservation measures triggered by ESA listing such as ending exploitation, tailored species management, and fishery regulations, and other national and international measures, appear to have been largely successful in promoting species recovery, leading to the delisting of some species and to increases in most populations. These findings underscore the capacity of marine mammal and sea turtle species to recover from substantial geographical population declines when conservation actions are implemented in a timely and effective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2909795082,"People typically rely heavily on visual information when finding their way to unfamiliar locations. For individuals with reduced vision, there are a variety of navigational tools available to assist with this task if needed. However, for wayfinding in unfamiliar indoor environments the applicability of existing tools is limited. One potential approach to assist with this task is to enhance visual information about the location and content of existing signage in the environment. With this aim, we developed a prototype software application, which runs on a consumer head-mounted augmented reality (AR) device, to assist visually impaired users with sign-reading. The sign-reading assistant identifies real-world text (e.g., signs and room numbers) on command, highlights the text location, converts it to high contrast AR lettering, and optionally reads the content aloud via text-to-speech. We assessed the usability of this application in a behavioral experiment. Participants with simulated visual impairment were asked to locate a particular office within a hallway, either with or without AR assistance (referred to as the AR group and control group, respectively). Subjective assessments indicated that participants in the AR group found the application helpful for this task, and an analysis of walking paths indicated that these participants took more direct routes compared to the control group. However, participants in the AR group also walked more slowly and took more time to complete the task than the control group. The results point to several specific future goals for usability and system performance in AR-based assistive tools."
https://openalex.org/W2908661085,"Aflatoxins (AFs) are a family of fungal toxins that produced in food and feed by two Aspergillus species (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus). Several techniques have been reported for AFs detection including high-pressure liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, surface plasmon resonance and recombinant immune blotting assay. But, these methods are disadvantaged because they consumed a long time for analysis; in addition, they required a piece of complicated and expensive equipment. Therefore, developing of inexpensive sensors with high selectivity and sensitivity for detecting of AFs levels without extensive sample preparation has received great attention. Several electrochemical AFs sensors have been reported; however, there is still a need for developing a new, simple and rapid electrochemical AFs sensor. Here, we have developed a new AFs sensor based on Au nanostructures/graphene nanosheets modified ITO substrate that could enhance the Raman effect and the electrochemical conductivity. The modified electrode was prepared based on layer-by-layer electrochemical deposition method. AFs antibody was immobilized onto the Au nanostructures/graphene nanosheets; then it was used as a probe for rapid, simple and cheap detection of AFs level using Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. Our results demonstrated that the developed system showed a simple, easy and sensitive sensor for monitoring low concentrations of AFB1 with a detection limit of about 6.9 pg/mL, also it allowed the determination of AFB1 in spiked food samples."
https://openalex.org/W2910449610,"Limited data exist related to low birth weight (LBW) incidence and risk factors in Western China. This paper aims to assess LBW and its relationship with antenatal care (ANC) in the poor counties of Western China. A community-based study in rural Western China was conducted in 2011. A kernel distribution was used to estimate the adjusted LBW incidence, and associations between LBW and socio-demographic or maternal factors were examined using multilevel logistic regression. Among 8,964 participants, 65.7% were weighed at birth. Crude LBW incidence was 6.6% and the adjusted rate was 9.3%. The study revealed that risk factors of LBW are being female, raised within a minority group, and with a family income below the national poverty line. For maternal risk factors, LBW was positively associated with not attending at least five or eight ANC visits, not receiving any ANC during the first trimester, and not having access to assess certain ANC content (weight, blood pressure, blood test, urine test, B-scan ultrasound, and folic acid supplement). There is urgent need to promote quality ANC in poor and rural areas of Western China and to prioritize vulnerable women and children who will benefit from quality ANC."
https://openalex.org/W2908590016,"Rationale Adolescent pregnancy in Lao PDR is the highest in Southeast Asia. It leads to negative health and social consequences in young people. It is anticipated that this problem is partly caused by limited sexual and reproductive health literacy (SRHL), leading to poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) decisions. Based on the concept of health literacy, SRHL goes beyond knowledge and behavior and is the self-perceived ability of an individual to access the needed information, understand the information, appraise and apply the information into informed decision making for a good way to contribute to sexual and reproductive health. It is not only knowing (knowledge) and doing (behavior), but it is the process of individual’s thought on an SRH problem before taking an action. The aim of this study was to measure SRHL among school-going adolescents aged 15–19 and to determine factors associated with SRHL. Method We conducted a cross-sectional study in rural and urban areas of Lao PDR in 2017. Respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire with five parts: socio-demographic, personal health, SRH knowledge and behavior, SRHL, and functional literacy. We calculated the SRHL score based on the HL-EU index and used descriptive statistics to determine the score and levels. Then we used bivariate statistics and multiple linear regression to identify factors associated with SRHL in these adolescents. Result Among 461 respondents, 65.5% had inadequate SRHL. Scores were positively and significantly associated with several factors, including: school location (β: 3.218; p<0.001), knowledge on SRH and attending SR class in school (p:0.010—p<0.001), and functional literacy on condoms, which reflected how respondents understood the use of condoms (β: 0.871; p<0.001). Conclusion Because most school adolescents had inadequate SRHL, comprehensive sexual education and enabling information as well as service access for adolescents are essential to ensure that adolescents can access, understand, appraise and apply good SRH knowledge in decision-making to benefit their own health."
https://openalex.org/W2909275566,"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a potent antiviral protein that enhances cellular resistance to a variety of pathogens, including influenza virus. Classically defined as an interferon-stimulated gene, expression of IFITM3 on cells is rapidly up-regulated in response to type I and II interferon. Here we found that IFITM3 is rapidly up-regulated by T cells following their activation and this occurred independently of type I and II interferon and the interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7. Up-regulation of IFITM3 on effector T cells protected these cells from virus infection and imparted a survival advantage at sites of virus infection. Our results show that IFITM3 expression on effector T cells is crucial for these cells to mediate their effector function and highlights an interferon independent pathway for the induction of IFITM3 which, if targeted, could be an effective approach to harness the activity of IFITM3 for infection prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2910172279,"Antarctica is often associated with images of masculine figures battling against the blizzard. The pervasiveness of heroic white masculine leadership and exploration in Antarctica and, more broadly, in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) research cultures, has meant women have had lesser access to Antarctic research and fieldwork opportunities, with a marked increase since the 1980s. This article presents findings from an exploratory online survey examining how 95 women experienced research and remote Antarctic fieldwork with the Australian Antarctic Program. Although women are entering polar science in greater numbers, a key theme of the qualitative findings of this survey is that gendered barriers to participation in research and fieldwork persist. We discuss five key gendered barriers including: 1) Physical barriers, 2) Caring responsibilities/unpaid work, 3) Cultural sexism/gender bias, 4) Lack of opportunities/recognition, and 5) Unwanted male attention/sexual harassment. We argue that the lack of attention paid to gender and sexuality in polar fieldwork contributes to the invisibility and exclusion of women and other marginalized identities broadly. To conclude, we point to the importance of targeted inclusivity, diversity and equity initiatives through Antarctic research globally and specifically by National Antarctic Programs."
https://openalex.org/W2908587322,"The most common type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is caused by a duplication of PMP22 leading to dysmyelination, axonal loss and progressive muscle weakness (CMT1A). Currently, no approved therapy is available for CMT1A patients. A novel polytherapeutic proof-of-principle approach using PXT3003, a low-dose combination of baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol, slowed disease progression after long-term dosing in adult Pmp22 transgenic rats, a known animal model of CMT1A. Here, we report an early postnatal, short-term treatment with PXT3003 in CMT1A rats that delays disease onset into adulthood. CMT1A rats were treated from postnatal day 6 to 18 with PXT3003. Behavioural, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses were performed until 12 weeks of age. Daily oral treatment for approximately 2 weeks ameliorated motor deficits of CMT1A rats reaching wildtype levels. Histologically, PXT3003 corrected the disturbed axon calibre distribution with a shift towards large motor axons. Despite dramatic clinical amelioration, only distal motor latencies were improved and correlated with phenotype performance. On the molecular level, PXT3003 reduced Pmp22 mRNA overexpression and improved the misbalanced downstream PI3K-AKT / MEK-ERK signalling pathway. The improved differentiation status of Schwann cells may have enabled better long-term axonal support function. We conclude that short-term treatment with PXT3003 during early development may partially prevent the clinical and molecular manifestations of CMT1A. Since PXT3003 has a strong safety profile and is currently undergoing a phase III trial in CMT1A patients, our results suggest that PXT3003 therapy may be a bona fide translatable therapy option for children and young adolescent patients suffering from CMT1A."
https://openalex.org/W2951379231,"Gradient-based approaches to brain function have recently unmasked fundamental properties of brain organization. Diffusion map embedding analysis of resting-state fMRI data revealed a primary-to-transmodal axis of cerebral cortical macroscale functional organization. The same method was recently used to analyze resting-state data within the cerebellum, revealing for the first time a sensorimotor-fugal macroscale organization principle of cerebellar function. Cerebellar gradient 1 extended from motor to non-motor task-unfocused (default-mode network) areas, and cerebellar gradient 2 isolated task-focused processing regions. Here we present a freely available and easily accessible tool that applies this new knowledge to the topographical interpretation of cerebellar neuroimaging findings. LittleBrain illustrates the relationship between cerebellar data (e.g., volumetric patient study clusters, task activation maps, etc.) and cerebellar gradients 1 and 2. Specifically, LittleBrain plots all voxels of the cerebellum in a two-dimensional scatterplot, with each axis corresponding to one of the two principal functional gradients of the cerebellum, and indicates the position of cerebellar neuroimaging data within these two dimensions. This novel method of data mapping provides alternative, gradual visualizations that complement discrete parcellation maps of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy. We present application examples to show that LittleBrain can also capture subtle, progressive aspects of cerebellar functional neuroanatomy that would be difficult to visualize using conventional mapping techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2909466292,"In the Southeast USA, major contributors to estuarine soundscapes are the courtship calls produced by fish species belonging to the family Sciaenidae. Long-term monitoring of sciaenid courtship sounds may be valuable in understanding reproductive phenology, but this approach produces massive acoustic datasets. With this in mind, we designed a feature-based, signal detector for sciaenid fish calls and tested the efficacy of this detector against manually reviewed data. Acoustic recorders were deployed to collect sound samples for 2 min every 20 min at four stations in the May River estuary, South Carolina, USA from February to November, 2014. Manual analysis of acoustic files revealed that four fish species, belonging to the family Sciaenidae, were the major sound producers in this estuarine soundscape, and included black drum (Pogonias cromis), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Recorded calls served as an acoustic library of signature features that were used to create a signal detector to automatically detect, classify, and quantify the number of calls in each acoustic file. Correlation between manual and automatic detection was significant and precision varied from 61% to 100%. Automatic detection provided quantitative data on calling rates for this long-term data set. Positive temperature anomalies increased calling rates of black drum, silver perch, and spotted seatrout, while negative anomalies increased calling rates of red drum. Acoustic monitoring combined with automatic detection could be an additional or alternative method for monitoring sciaenid spawning and changes in phenology associated with climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2909532877,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of a fraction of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Although this relation is well-known, it is still not clear the role of HPV in premalignant oral lesions such as oral lichen planus (OLP) and dysplasia. We aimed to evaluate the HPV-DNA prevalence and type distribution in a set of oral biopsies obtained from patients diagnosed with OLP and dysplasia, as well as the role of HPV in these lesions. Methods A retrospective cohort of all premalignant oral lesions consecutively diagnosed from March 30th 1995 to May 21st 2014 at Hospital of Bellvitge and Odontological University Hospital of Bellvitge was identified and classified in four groups: OLP (groups 1 and 2) and dysplasias (groups 3 and 4) that progressed or not to invasive cancer during follow-up. A random selection targeting 25 cases was aimed to be performed for each group. All selected cases were subjected to pathological evaluation, DNA quality control and HPV-DNA detection. HPV-DNA positive samples were further subject to p16INK4a analysis. Results A total of 83 cases yielded a valid HPV-DNA result. From those, 7 and 34 cases were OLP that progressed or not to invasive cancer during follow-up, whereas 24 and 18 cases were displasias that progressed or not to invasive cancer during follow-up, respectively. HPV-DNA was detected in 4 samples (3 dysplastic lesions and 1 OLP). Two samples were HPV16 positive (2%), 1 sample HPV18 positive (1%) and 1 sample (1%) was HPV indeterminate. Two out of four HPV-DNA positive cases had high p16INK4a expression and none of the HPV positive cases progressed to invasive cancer during long-term follow-up. Conclusions We found a low HPV-DNA attributable fraction in premalignant lesions of the oral cavity, suggesting that HPV is unlikely to play a significant role in oral carcinogenesis in our setting."
https://openalex.org/W2910129827,"Background As worldwide cancer prevalence continues to increase, the challenges facing cancer care are also increasing. Various topics related to deficiencies in cancer care have been discussed repeatedly in the literature. The most frequently stated topics are the unmet psychosocial support needs of cancer patients, difficulties in multidisciplinary teamwork, difficulties in communication between physicians and patients, and issues in palliative care settings. However, there is little research regarding the views of health care providers on these topics. With the aim of gaining abundant information regarding the care of German cancer patients, this study explores the stances of psycho-oncologists, physicians, and nurses regarding the quality of cancer care. Materials and methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and in different oncological outpatient offices in Hamburg; twenty-five interviews in total were conducted with health care providers. Interviews were semi-structured to gain a broad range of information on cancer care. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke with an inductive, constant comparison approach to identify themes and categorized codes. Results The following five principle themes were identified in the interviews: “psycho-oncological care”, “cooperation of health care providers”, “palliative care”, “health care provider-patient contact”, and “coordination and organization of care”. Participants seemed satisfied with the overall quality of cancer care in Germany. Nevertheless, the results showed deficiencies regarding communication among different health care providers and between health care providers and patients. Important findings in conjunction with these communication problems were a lack of psycho-oncological support, shortages in the oncology work force, language and cultural barriers, and deficient education in the communication of providers. Conclusions The statements of psycho-oncologists, physicians, and nurses on cancer care provide a suitable basis to conduct further focused research on the studied deficiencies in cancer care. In particular, communication in psycho-oncological care, communication within multidisciplinary teams, and health care provider-patient communication should be further explored with the aim of developing new ideas for improvements and thereby enhancing the quality of cancer care."
https://openalex.org/W2908534638,"Symptoms of internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety increase in adolescence, especially in females. However, gender differences in depression and anxiety symptoms emerge only after puberty onset. Levels of alexithymia, characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one’s emotions, are elevated in depression and anxiety, and fluctuate across adolescence in a gender-specific manner. This study investigated changes in alexithymia across adolescence, and explored the potential role of alexithymia in the development of depression and anxiety, separately for females and males. Accordingly, 140 adolescents aged 11 to 21 years (77 female) completed self-report measures of alexithymia, depression and anxiety, and pubertal development. For females alone, pubertal maturation was associated with alexithymic traits (specifically difficulties identifying and describing feelings), as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. After accounting for alexithymia, the relationship between puberty and depression and anxiety was absent or reduced in females. Thus, alexithymic traits may have differential consequences for males and females, and possibly contribute towards increased depression and anxiety symptoms in females during adolescence. We propose that developmental changes in alexithymia should be considered when studying the onset and development of internalizing psychological disorders during adolescence."

Much has been written about the drug and the birth defects it caused but evidence about the health of Thalidomide survivors as they age is limited.The aim of this study was to: explore the health and wellbeing UK Thalidomide survivors; document the health problems experienced by them as they reach their mid-50s; and examine the impacts on their health-related quality of life and employment.A health and wellbeing survey of 351 UK Thalidomide survivors, which gathered information about home and employment circumstances, recent health problems, and health related quality of life (using SF12 Health Survey). Overall analysis focused on descriptive statistics; the association between respondents' health related quality of life and original impairment was examined using Pearson Correlation; and a three step Hierarchical Regression was used to explore the influence of five factors which narrative responses suggested might be important.As Thalidomide survivors reach their mid-50's they are experiencing a wide range of secondary health problems, in particular musculoskeletal problems, and depression and anxiety, with multimorbidity a growing issue. These health problems are having a negative impact on their employment (two fifths are unable to work) and their physical health related quality of life, which is significantly poorer than the general population.Having lived relatively independent lives, many Thalidomide survivors are now having to adjust to growing disability. The study provides further evidence of the accumulative impact of disability over peoples' lifetimes and highlights the value of a life course perspective in understanding the complex experience of growing older with a disability."
https://openalex.org/W2910458816,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where autoreactive T lymphocytes destroy pancreatic beta cells. We previously reported a defect in CD4+ Tregs cell proliferation and reduced CD4+ Tregs PD-1 expression in patients. Another ‘memory-like’ regulatory subset, CD8+ Tregs, evaluated as CD8+CD25+FOXP3+, has recently raised interest for their effective suppressive activity. Different CD8+ T cell populations, their proliferation capacity and expression of PD-1 molecule were evaluated by flow-cytometer analysis in newly diagnosed, long-term Type 1 diabetes patients compared to healthy normal donors. Under basal conditions, CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs were seemingly represented among study groups while there was evidence of diminished expression of PD-1 in Teff subsets of long-term patients. After 3 days of PMA/ionomycin stimulation, patients CD8+ Tregs showed decreased percentage in respect to control group. CD8+ Teffs were instead increased in long-term diabetics versus controls. PD-1+CD8+ Tregs were represented at a much lower percentage in long-term diabetic patients, in respect to controls. Importantly, patients CD8+ Tregs and CD8+ Teffs presented a significant proliferation defect in respect to the control group. In conclusion, our study indicates that a defect of CD8+ Tregs is observed in diabetics. This subset could thus represent a novel target of immunotherapy in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908859065,"Background Bladder cancer (BC) is the 9th most common cancer diagnosis worldwide. Low grade (LG) represents 70% of all BCs, characterized by recurrence and rare ability (10–15%) to progress to high grade (HG) and invade. The remaining 30% is high grade (HG), fast invasive BC, which is resistant to therapy. Identifying biomarkers for predicting those tumors able to progress is a key goal for patient outcome improvement. This study focuses on the most promising prognostic markers. Materials and methods TP53 and FGFR3 mutational status, Survivin, CK19, CK20, E-cadherin and CD44 gene expression analysis were performed on 66 BCs. Results Survivin was found associated to tumor grade (p<0.05). Moreover, Survivin correlated with CD44 in TP53 wild type (p = 0.0242) and FGFR3 wild type (p = 0.0036) tumors. In particular the Survivin-CD44 correlation was associated to HG FGFR3 wild type BCs (p = 0.0045). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on gene expression data identified four distinct molecular groups reflecting the patient histology (p = 0.038). Conclusion We suggest Survivin, both as a biomarker associated to G3 BCs but negatively related to TP53 mutational status, and as a potential novel therapeutic target."

Worldwide, it is estimated that only 34.8% of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6months of life, the majority receiving some other food or fluid in the early months. Besides, the Ethiopian demographic and health survey (2016) stated that the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding in Tigray region was 3.8 months which is shorter than the recommended duration. The main purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude of exclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia.A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 9 to October 11, 2016, in public hospitals of Tigray region. Data was collected by using structured questionnaire using face-to-face interview among 304 eligible women through a systematic sampling technique. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Binary and multiple variable logistic regressions (""odds ratio"") analyses were calculated with 95% CI and p value ≤ 0.05 as significance were used.Two hundred seventy (88.8%) of mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. Infant feeding counseling during antenatal care of last pregnancy [AOR = 6.9, 95% CI; 2.63, 17.99], knowledge on exclusive breastfeeding (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI; (2.12, 14.02] and attitude towards exclusive breastfeeding [AOR = 7.9; 95% CI; 2.96, 21.21] had significant association with exclusive breastfeeding practice.A high proportion of mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. Infant feeding counseling, knowledge and attitude towards exclusive breastfeeding practice were the predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among HIV positive mothers. Strengthening infant feeding counseling during antenatal care and improving mothers' knowledge and attitude on exclusive breastfeeding is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2910312169,"Background Although empirical evidence suggests that the adherence club model is more effective in retaining people living with HIV in antiretroviral treatment care and sustaining medication adherence compared to standard clinic care, it is poorly understood exactly how and why this works. In this paper, we examined and made explicit how, why and for whom the adherence club model works at a public health facility in South Africa. Methods We applied an explanatory theory-building case study approach to examine the validity of an initial programme theory developed a priori. We collected data using a retrospective cohort quantitative design to describe the suppressive adherence and retention in care behaviours of patients on ART using Kaplan-Meier methods. In conjunction, we employed an explanatory qualitative study design using non-participant observations and realist interviews to gain insights into the important mechanisms activated by the adherence club intervention and the relevant contextual conditions that trigger the different mechanisms to cause the observed behaviours. We applied the retroduction logic to configure the intervention-context-actor-mechanism-outcome map to formulate generative theories. Results A modified programme theory involving targeted care for clinically stable adult patients (18 years+) receiving antiretroviral therapy was obtained. Targeted care involved receiving quick, uninterrupted supply of antiretroviral medication (with reduced clinic visit frequencies), health talks and counselling, immediate access to a clinician when required and guided by club rules and regulations within the context of adequate resources, and convenient (size and position) space and proper preparation by the club team. When grouped for targeted care, patients feel nudged, their self-efficacy is improved and they become motivated to adhere to their medication and remain in continuous care. Conclusion This finding has implications for understanding how, why and under what health system conditions the adherence club intervention works to improve its rollout in other contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2910677616,"Purpose To compare repeatability between SS-OCT and SD-OCT for measurement of macular, macular retinal nerve fiber (mRNFL), and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness in various retinal diseases. Methods One hundred and fourteen eyes of 114 subjects were investigated. Seventy-eight eyes with retinal disease and 36 normal eyes underwent two consecutive measurements of macular, mRNFL, and GC-IPL thickness using SS-OCT and SD-OCT. The data were obtained using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. The eyes with retinal diseases were divided into three subgroups according to central macular thickness (CMT) for analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to determine the repeatability of OCT device. Results In normal eyes, both OCT devices showed excellent repeatability of macula, mRNFL, and GC-IPL thickness measurements with high ICCs in all ETDRS subfields. In eyes with retinal disease, although SS-OCT showed better repeatability for inner retinal thickness measurements than SD-OCT, the overall ICCs were lower than those in normal eyes. In subgroup analysis, the ICCs in the low CMT group were lower than those in the normal and high CMT groups, particularly when using SD-OCT. Conclusions Both OCT devices had comparable repeatability for retinal thickness measurement in normal eyes and eyes with retinal disease. However, the possibility of measurement error should be considered in eyes with a thin and atrophic retina."
https://openalex.org/W2910481145,"The non-proteinogenic amino acid ornithine links several stress response pathways. From a previous study we know that ornithine accumulates in response to low CO2. To investigate ornithine accumulation in plants, we shifted plants to either low CO2 or low light. Both conditions increased carbon limitation, but only low CO2 also increased the rate of photorespiration. Changes in metabolite profiles of light- and CO2-limited plants were quite similar. Several amino acids that are known markers of senescence accumulated strongly under both conditions. However, urea cycle intermediates respond differently between the two treatments. While the levels of both ornithine and citrulline were much higher in plants shifted to 100 ppm CO2 compared to those kept in 400 ppm CO2, their metabolite abundance did not significantly change in response to a light limitation. Furthermore, both ornithine and citrulline accumulation is independent from sugar starvation. Exogenous supplied sugar did not significantly change the accumulation of the two metabolites in low CO2-stressed plants, while the accumulation of other amino acids was reduced by about 50%. Gene expression measurements showed a reduction of the entire arginine biosynthetic pathway in response to low CO2. Genes in both proline biosynthesis and degradation were induced. Hence, proline did not accumulate in response to low CO2 like observed for many other stresses. We propose that excess of nitrogen re-fixed during photorespiration can be alternatively stored in ornithine and citrulline under low CO2 conditions. Furthermore, ornithine is converted to pyrroline-5-carboxylate by the action of δOAT."
https://openalex.org/W2910877659,"Xylanases isolated from microorganisms such as the Trichoderma reesei have attracted considerable research interest because of their potential in various industrial applications. However, naturally isolated xylanases cannot withstand harsh conditions such as high temperature and basic pH. In this study, we performed structural analysis of the major T. reesei xylanase (Xyn2), and novel flexible regions of the enzyme were identified based on B-factor, a molecular dynamics (MD) parameter. To improve thermostability of the Xyn2, disulfide bonds were introduced into the unstable flexible region by using site-directed mutagenesis and two recombinant xylanases, XM1 (Xyn2Cys12-52) and XM2 (Xyn2Cys59-149) were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Secreted recombinant Xyn2 was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 24 kDa. Interestingly, the half-lives of XM1 and XM2 at 60°C were 2.5- and 1.8- fold higher, respectively than those of native Xyn2. The XM1 also exhibited improved pH stability and maintained more than 60% activity over pH values ranging from 2.0 to 10.0. However, the specific activity and catalytic efficiency of XM1 was decreased as compared to those of XM2 and native Xyn2. Our results will assist not only in elucidating of the interactions between protein structure and function, but also in rational target selection for improving the thermostability of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2911219140,"Recent studies reported morphokinetic indices for optimal selection of embryos in assisted reproductive technology (ART). The morphokinetics in blastocyst stage include the collapse and re-expansion rates after thawing. However, evaluation methods using these morphokinetics have not been established, mainly because the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclarified. In this study, we focused on the relationship between these morphokinetic observation of the blastocyst behaviour and the number of cells constituting the blastocyst. We evaluated 38 surplus human frozen-thawed blastocysts using time-lapse cinematography and recorded their expansion, contraction, and hatching. A total of 28 blastocysts expanded in culture (cross-sectional area ≥ 5,000 π μm2). In comparison to the ones that did not, the expanded group presented significantly more number of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) cells, which eventually develop into the fetus and placenta, respectively (ICM: Expanded 10.2 ± 6.3 vs. Non-Expanded 6.0 ± 12.3, p < 0.05; TE: Expanded 165.7 ± 74.8 vs. Non-Expanded 57.0 ± 29.4, p < 0.05). Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the expansion rate (up to 4 h) and the number of TE cells (r = 0.558, p = 0.0021). Additionally, blastocysts that hatched had a significantly higher number of TE cells than those that did not (hatching 225.2 ± 61.2 vs. no hatching 121.1 ± 48.6, p < 0.0001). The number of TE cells per unit of cross-sectional area correlated negatively with the contraction time (r = –0.601, p = 0.0007). No correlation between the number of ICM cells and these morphokinetics was detected. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that different morphokinetics of frozen-thawed blastocysts reflect the number of TE cells. The differentiation of blastocysts containing sufficient TE cells would be beneficial for implantation and prognosis of a subsequent pregnancy. Thus, evaluation of these morphokinetics can be an effective method to screen good embryos for ART."

Two experimental sessions were arranged according to the same protocol: (P0) before pregnancy and (P1) at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy (12th week of gestation). At first the anthropometric measures were taken. Then, walking trials at a self-selected speed along a walkway were registered with Vicon 250 (Oxford Metrics Ltd.; Oxford, UK) and FreeMED force platform (Sensor Medica, Italy).An analysis of anthropometric parameters in 12th pregnancy week demonstrated significant changes in mean values of waist circumference and waist to hip ratio as well as waist to height ratio indexes compared to the results before pregnancy. No significant differences were found in the basic kinematic gait parameters between experimental conditions. Significant increase of mean inter-ankle distance during double support phase occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy. Also, the ratio of the ankle separation width to the pelvic width was noticeably higher in gestation. Then, angular changes of the pelvis in coronal and transverse planes throughout gait cycle during pregnancy demonstrated significant differences compared to those measured before pregnancy. At the same time in the first trimester of pregnancy no adaptive changes in the pattern of feet loading take place.Since our study is of longitudinal character, in the course of pregnancy we expect compensatory mechanisms more clearly demonstrated. Therefore, we hope to identify a strategy of the gravid body progression in space."
https://openalex.org/W2910667264,"We examined trends in the MI incidence and age at MI diagnosis among adults living with HIV-1 between 2000 and 2009, by comparison with the French MI registries, by gender. Age standardized incidence rates and standardized incidence-ratios (SIRs) were estimated for individuals included in the French hospital database on HIV (n = 71 204, MI = 663) during three periods: 2000–2002, 2003–2005 and 2006–2009. Median ages at MI diagnosis were compared using the Brown-Mood test. Over the study periods, the absolute rate difference and relative risks were higher in women than in men in 2000–2002 and 2006–2009, with respective SIRs 1.99 (1.39–2.75) and 1.12 (0.99–1.27) in 2006–2009. The trends were different for men and women with a decreasing trend in SIRs in men and no change in women. In both sexes, among individuals with CD4 ≥500/μL and controlled viral-load on cART, the risk was no longer elevated. Age at MI diagnosis was significantly younger than in the general population, especially among women (-6.2 years, p<0.001; men: -2.1 years, p = 0.02). In HIV-1-positive adults, absolute rate difference and relative risks and trends of MI were different between men and women and there was no additional risk among individuals on effective cART."
https://openalex.org/W2909187209,"Background Perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure was found associated with atopic diseases. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a childhood skin disorder. However, the effect of interaction between PFASs and glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1/M1 genotype on AD remains unclear. Objective To investigate the association between gene-environmental interaction and childhood AD using a birth cohort study. Methods From 2001 to 2005, 1,264 mother–newborn pairs were recruited from eight Taiwanese maternity hospitals. PFAS levels and Genotypes were analysed from cord blood. Information on children’s health status including AD occurrence was obtained via phone interviews at 6 months and 2 years. Cord plasma concentrations of nine PFASs were measured via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. GSTT1/M1 was genotyped (null/present) via polymerase chain reaction. Environment-gene interaction effects on AD were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Overall, 839 mother–newborn pairs completed all measurements. The prevalence of ever having physician-diagnosed AD by 2 years of age was 5.4%. Among PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was positively associated with AD adjusted for potential confounders. After grouping PFOA levels into three groups: undetected, below and above the median in those with detected, children in above the median group who had the GSTT1-null, or GSTM1-null genotype exhibited a higher odds ratio for AD (OR [95%CI] = 3.45 [1.26–9.99] and 2.92 [1.12–7.91], respectively) as compared to the undetected group. Conclusions Our data demonstrated that in-utero PFOA exposure with GSTT1/M1 null genotype were associated with AD. Minimizing early-life PFAS exposure may help against AD development, especially in genetically susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2910603702,"Genetic analyses provide a powerful tool with which to identify the biological components of historical objects. Te Tiriti o Waitangi | The Treaty of Waitangi is New Zealand’s founding document, intended to be a partnership between the indigenous Māori and the British Crown. Here we focus on an archived piece of blank parchment that has been proposed to be the missing portion of the lower parchment of the Waitangi Sheet of the Treaty. However, its physical dimensions and characteristics are not consistent with this hypothesis. We perform genetic analyses on the parchment membranes of the Treaty, plus the blank piece of parchment. We find that all three parchments were made from ewes and that the blank parchment is highly likely to be a portion cut from the lower membrane of the Waitangi Sheet because they share identical whole mitochondrial genomes, including an unusual heteroplasmic site. We suggest that the differences in size and characteristics between the two pieces of parchment may have resulted from the Treaty’s exposure to water in the early 20th century and the subsequent repair work, light exposure during exhibition or the later conservation treatments in the 1970s and 80s. The blank piece of parchment will be valuable for comparison tests to study the effects of earlier treatments and to monitor the effects of long-term display on the Treaty."
https://openalex.org/W2911072825,"Under anaerobic conditions, Euglena gracilis produces a large amount of wax ester through mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis from storage polysaccharides termed paramylon, to generate ATP. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductases (TERs) in mitochondria have been considered to play a key role in this process, because the enzymes catalyze the reduction of short chain length CoA-substrates (such as crotonyl-CoA). A TER enzyme (EgTER1) has been previously identified and enzymologically characterized; however, its physiological significance remained to be evaluated by genetic analysis. We herein generated EgTER1-knockdown Euglena cells, in which total crotonyl-CoA reductase activity was decreased to 10% of control value. Notably, the knockdown cells showed a severe bleaching phenotype with deficiencies in chlorophylls and glycolipids, but grew normally under heterotrophic conditions (with glucose supplementation). Moreover, the knockdown cells accumulated much greater quantities of wax ester than control cells before and after transfer to anaerobic conditions, which was accompanied by a large metabolomic change. Furthermore, we failed to find any contribution of other potential TER genes in wax ester production. Our findings propose a novel role of EgTER1 in the greening process and demonstrate that this enzyme is dispensable for wax ester production under anaerobic conditions."

Also, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6 was found to be underrepresented in severe psoriasis who failed conventional systemic therapies, but the effect of HLA polymorphism on PsA severity needs to be confirmed.To describe the severity of psoriasis, demographic features and HLA polymorphism among Chinese patients with active peripheral type PsA who had inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.We included all patients with PsA who had at least 3 tender and swollen peripheral joints despite at least two conventional non-biologic treatments in our clinic. Demographic results were compared with global pivotal studies of biologics for PsA. HLA-Cw and HLA-DRB1 genotyping was also analyzed.We identified 60 patients who met our inclusion criteria. The male to female ratio was 1.31:1. The majority of patients presented with psoriasis first (81.7%). The mean interval between psoriasis and PsA was 7.2 ± 8.1 years (mean ± SD). The baseline number of tender and swollen joints was 14.9 ± 10.7 and 11.3 ±10.2, respectively. In total, 41.7% subjects had more than 3% body surface area involvement of psoriasis. Genotyping of HLA-Cw and HLA-DRB1 was performed in 47 subjects. HLA-Cw*0702 was the most frequent allele (29.8%), followed by HLA-Cw*01 (26.6%). The frequency of HLA-Cw*0602 allele was similar to normal population. The most frequent HLA-DRB1 allele was HLA-DRB1*04 (20.2%), followed by HLA-DRB1*08 (16.0%). No cases carrying HLA-DRB1*13 were detected.Compared with Western population, our patients had less psoriasis and PsA burden. The frequencies of HLA-Cw*06, HLA-Cw*12, and HLA-DRB1*07 were not increased. In contrast, HLA-Cw*0702 and HLA-DRB1*08 allele frequencies were increased compared with psoriasis patients and normal population in Taiwan.

We analyzed the prevalence of heterosexual oral and anal sex among HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) attendees in Kinshasa and the associated sociodemographics, perceptions and behavioral factors.OKAPI (Observational Kinshasa AIDS Prevention Initiative) prospective cohort study. It evaluates the VCT impact on HIV-related knowledge and behaviors at 6 and 12-month follow-up. Since April 2016 until April 2018, 797 persons aged 15-59 years were HIV tested and replied to a baseline interview, including information about anal and oral sex. Descriptive, bi- and multivariate analyses were performed using baseline data.Among 718 sexually active participants reporting heterosexual sex, 59% had had oral sex, 22% anal sex and 18% both practices. Among participants reporting ""not"" having had sex, 6% reported oral sex, 3% anal sex and 1% both. Oral sex was associated with a daily use of the Internet/mobile phone, perceiving low community HIV risk, reporting HIV-related behaviors (multiple partners, inconsistent condom use, anal, paid and forced sex) and having been pregnant. Being married-monogamous was inversely associated with oral sex. Anal sex was directly associated with having other risk sexual behaviors.Oral and anal sex were common among people reporting heterosexual sex in Kinshasa. Perceiving a low community HIV risk and having other sexual risk behaviors are associated with these practices, which are commonly not considered as risky despite their strong association with HIV/STIs. They need to be considered when designing preventive strategies in Kinshasa."
https://openalex.org/W2910981382,"Nitrogen stable isotope (15N) natural abundance is widely used to study nitrogen cycling. In grazed ecosystems, urine patches are hot-spots of nitrogen inputs, losses, and changes in δ15N. Understanding δ15N dynamics in urine-affected vegetation is therefore crucial for accurate inferences from 15N natural abundance in grasslands. We hypothesized that leaf δ15N following urine deposition varies with time and plant functional group. Specifically, we expected (i) short-term decreases in δ15N due to foliar absorption of 15N-depleted volatilized ammonia, (ii) followed by increases in δ15N due to uptake of 15N-enriched soil inorganic nitrogen, and (iii) that the magnitude of these changes is less in legumes than in grasses. The latter should be expected because ammonia absorption depends on leaf nitrogen concentration, which is higher in legumes than grasses, and because biological nitrogen fixation will modify the influence of urine-derived nitrogen on δ15N in legumes. We applied cattle urine to a mixture of Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens in a pot experiment. Nitrogen concentration and δ15N were determined for successive leaf cohorts and bulk biomass either 17 (early) or 32 (late) days after urine application. Early after urine application, leaves of L. perenne were 15N-depleted compared to control plants (δ15N 0.1 vs. 5.8‰, respectively), but leaves of T. repens were not (-1.1 vs. -1.1‰, respectively). Later, both species increased their δ15N, but T. repens (4.5‰) less so than L. perenne (5.9‰). Vegetation sampled within and outside urine patches in the field further supported these results. Our findings confirm that foliar ammonia uptake can substantially decrease grass foliar δ15N, and that in both grass and legume the direction of the δ15N response to urine changes over time. Temporal dynamics of plant δ15N at urine patches therefore need to be explicitly addressed when 15N natural abundance is used to study nitrogen cycling in grazed grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2909614606,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a neurological virus causing life-threatening diseases in young children and infants. Although EV71 vaccines in development have presented promising results in several clinical trials, the identified key antigen for improving the broad protective efficacy of EV71 vaccines has not been well investigated. In this report, we show that different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of the B4(E59) virus significantly affect EV71 vaccine production in a serum-free microcarrier bioreactor system. The antigens produced from high MOIs of 10-1 and 10-2 exhibited higher yield and more infectious full particle (FP) contents in the EV71 vaccines than those produced with low MOIs of 10-4 and 10-6, leading to better cross-neutralizing efficacy. The C4(E36) neutralization results showed that only antisera raised from EV71 FPs provided substantial neutralizing titers against C4(E36), whereas empty particles (EPs) of EV71 conferred no efficacy. Competitive ELISA showed that anti-FP mainly binds to FPs and that 20% of antibodies bind to EPs, whereas most anti-EP binds EPs, with only 10% antibodies binding to FPs. VP1-adsorbed anti-FP lost most of the virus neutralization efficiency, suggesting that the VP1 subunit of FP is the major immunogenic antigen determining the ability of the EV71 vaccine to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against EV71 virus subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the high-MOI production approach is significantly correlated with FP productivity, thereby improving the cross-neutralization efficacy of an EV71 vaccine and providing the basis for a better vaccine design against widespread EV71 viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2910254310,"Aim The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential role of resistin in estimating the 30 days prognosis in patients with hypoxic-ischemic organ injury who survived after a cardiac arrest (CA). Materials and methods The study included 40 patients resuscitated after a non-traumatic out-of-hospital CA admitted in Emergency Department (ED). All patients were followed for 30 days after CA or until death. Clinical data on admission were recorded. Blood samples were collected on admission in ED (0-time interval), and at 6, 12, 24, 48- and 72-hours following resuscitation. Serum concentrations of resistin, S100B and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were measured. Several predictive scores for the mortality at 30 days were created with logistic regressions. Results At each time interval, median serum levels of resistin and S100 B were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors. For NSE, plasma levels were significantly lower in survivors as compared to non-survivors at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. Accurate predictive scores for 30-days mortality were the ones which included the values of resistin and S100B measured at 12 hours after admittance [AUC 0.938 (0.813–0.989), sensitivity 85.71% (67.3%– 96%), specificity 91.67% (61.5%’99.8%), p<0.001], which included the values of all three markers measured at 12 hours after admittance [AUC 0.955 (0.839–0.995), sensitivity 82.14% (63.1%’93.9%), specificity 100.00% (73.5%’100.0%), p<0.001] and the that included the values of resistin and S-100B at 6 hours together with serum lactate on admission [AUC = 0.994 (0.901–1.0), sensitivity 96.4% (81.7%’99.9%), specificity 100.00% (73.5%’100.0%), p<0.001]. Conclusion In our study, serum levels of resistin or a combination of resistin with S-100B or resistin with S-100B and lactate, were highly predictive for 30 days mortality in resuscitated patients after CA. Further studies on large number of patients are needed to confirm our data."
https://openalex.org/W2910543071,"How housing and transport conditions may affect welfare in porcine production is a leading topic in livestock research. This study investigated whether pigs present a different neurological response to management conditions and to ascertain whether pigs living partially outdoors cope differently with road transport-associated stress. Twenty-four female pigs were divided in two groups: one living indoors (ID, n = 12) and the other housed combining indoor conditions with 4 hours per day of outdoor pasture (OD, n = 12). After one month, one set of animals from each housing condition were driven in a truck to the slaughterhouse in low-stress conditions (5 min drive, no mixing groups, soft management, LS group, n = 12) or high-stress conditions (2 hours drive, mixing groups, harsh management, HS group, n = 12). At the slaughterhouse, blood was collected, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HC) dissected. OD pigs had lower serum haptoglobin and increased dopaminergic pathway (DA-system) in the PFC, suggesting that living outdoors increases their wellbeing. HS conditions increased serum creatine kinase (CK) and affected several brain pathways: activation of the noradrenergic (NA-system) and DA -system in the PFC and the activation of the DA-system and an increase in c-Fos as well as a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the HC. The serotonergic system (5-HT-system) was mildly altered in both areas. There was an interaction between housing and transport in serum NA and the DA-system in the HC, indicating that living conditions affected the response to stress. Multivariate analysis was able to discriminate the four animal groups. In conclusion, this work indicates that housing conditions and road transport markedly modifies the neurophysiology of pigs, and suggests that animals raised partially outdoors respond differently to transport-associated stress than animals raised indoors, indicating that they cope differently with unknown environments."

https://openalex.org/W2908530266,"The carabid subfamily Paussinae contains many species known to be obligately associated with ants during at least one stage of their life history. Myrmecophilous larvae have been documented for members of the tribe Paussini as well as several genera in the tribes Ozaenini, including Physea and Eustra. Here we describe the first instar larva of Ozaena lemoulti, and find it to be the most highly modified ozaenine larva that we have examined to date. Many structures of the larva suggest that it is a myrmecophile. Unlike all other described ozaenine larvae, which live in burrows that they construct and seal with their terminal disk, the completely unique larval morphology suggests Ozaena has adapted to living without the protection of a burrow and therefore must have a completely different feeding strategy than the typical ambush strategy of burrow dwelling larvae. We hypothesize that Ozaena larvae live in association with ants and use their long legs for running within the nest, and modifications of the mouthparts suggest the larva feeds on soft lightly sclerotized prey, such as ant brood. Our findings support an earlier hypothesis that Ozaena is mymecophilous during the adult stage. Comparisons of the functional anatomy of the eggs, larvae and adult between Ozaena lemoulti and the closely related, non-myrmecophilous general arthropod predator, Goniotropis kuntzeni, provide complementary, yet independent, evidence suggestive of this shift in lifestyle. We also examine and molecularly identify gut contents, providing direct evidence that adult Ozaena exclusively eat Camponotus ants. We conclude that Ozaena represents an independent shift to adopting a life of myrmecophily among beetles classified within the carabid subfamily Paussinae and document the morphological changes at each life history stage associated with the shift to a nest parasite lifestyle."

Very little has been published on the association of post-treatment visual acuity with pre-treatment electroretinography (ERG), which can be performed on infants too young to reliably quantify visual acuity. Objective To report associations of pre-treatment ERG with post-treatment visual acuity in eyes with advanced retinoblastoma treated with ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). Design Retrospective case-control study of eyes treated from 2006 through 2017, with mean follow-up of 51 months (range 2.3–150 months). Setting Single large academic center. Participants Group D and E eyes treated with OAC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with recorded visual acuity and ERG (30Hz flicker). Main outcome and measure Snellen visual acuity (uncorrected) compared to initial 30Hz flicker ERG. Results This study included 157 Group D and E eyes. Results of the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for trend were statistically significant and indicated that eyes with lower pre-treatment ERG readings tended to have more visual impairment post-treatment. Among eyes with initial ERG 75+ μV, 11 of 32 eyes (34%) had visual acuity 20/40 or better. Among eyes with ERG 0 μV, 44 of 46 (96%) had visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Conclusions and relevance Eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma treated with OAC can achieve excellent visual acuity, but poor ERG at initial visit is associated with poor visual acuity after treatment in the majority of eyes. Expectations regarding visual potential may influence decisions about treatment."

One of the major problems encountered in large-scale production of therapeutic proteins is misfolded protein production. The accumulation of misfolded therapeutic proteins is an immunogenic signal and a risk factor for immunogenicity of the final product. The aim of this study was the statistical optimization of three-phasic temperature shift and timing for enhanced production of correctly folded Fc-fusion protein. The effect of culture temperatures were investigated using the biphasic culture system. Box–Behnken design was then used to compute temperature and time of shifting optimum. Response surface methodology revealed that maximum production with low level of misfolded protein was achieved at two-step temperature shift from 37°C to 30°C during the late logarithmic phase and 30°C to 28°C in the mid-stationary phase. The optimized condition gave the best results of 1860 mg L−1 protein titer with 24.5% misfolding level. The validation experiments were carried out under optimal conditions with three replicates and the protein misfolding level was decreased by two times while productivity increased by ~ 1.3-fold. Large-scale production in 250 L bioreactor under the optimum conditions was also verified the effectiveness and the accuracy of the model. The results showed that by utilizing two-step temperature shift, productivity and the quality of target protein have been improved simultaneously. This model could be successfully applied to other products."

Solvent flows can occur in this gap, hence giving rise to a finite particle mobility along the tube. While our study has relevance for how cells are able to transport large organelles or other cargo along connecting membrane tubes, known as tunneling nanotubes, our calculations are also framed so that they can be tested by a specific in vitro experiment: A tubular membrane tether can be pulled from a membrane reservoir, such as an aspirated Giant Unilamellar Vesicle (GUV), e.g. using a conjugated bead that binds to the membrane and is held in a laser trap. We compute the subsequent mobility of colloidal particles trapped in the tube, focusing on the case when the particle is large compared to the equilibrium tube radius. We predict that the particle mobility should scale as ∼ σ-2/3, with σ the membrane tension."
https://openalex.org/W2910121601,"Salinity is increasing in aquatic ecosystems in the Mediterranean region due to global change, and this is likely to have an important impact on host-parasite interactions. Here we studied the relationships between infection by ectoparasitic water mites and salinity variation, on survival and fecundity of water boatmen Corixidae in the laboratory. Larvae of Sigara lateralis parasitised by larval mites (Hydrachna skorikowi) had lower survivorship, and failed to moult to the adult stage. In adult corixids (S. lateralis and Corixa affinis) fitness was reduced at high salinities and in individuals infected by H. skorikowi, both in terms of survival and fecundity. We also found evidence for parasitism-salinity interactions. Our results suggest that ongoing increases in salinity in Mediterranean ponds due to climate change and water abstraction for agriculture or urban use have a strong impact on water bugs, and that their interactions with ectoparasites may modify salinity effects."
https://openalex.org/W2908792863,"Non-apnea sleep disorder (NASD) increases the risk of cardiovascular events, such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease (IHD). Patients with heart failure (HF) are at higher risk for sleep disorder; however, there is no documentation on NASD's association with HF to date. Therefore, our study aimed to determine whether NASD increases the risk of incident HF.Using the outpatient and inpatient data from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of patients with a first-time diagnosis of NASD in the year 2000 and followed up the risk of incident heart failure until December 31, 2013. We calculated risks and incidence ratios of HF for patients with NASD compared with the general population. The cumulative incidence of NASD and the subsequent risk of HF are assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of HF patients without NASD.The NASD cohort had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of incident HF 19.7% higher than that of the cohort without NASD (95% CI = 1.130-1.270; p<0.001). In the NASD population, the mean interval to HF in males and females were 5.00±3.69 years and 5.00±3.66 years, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that after the seventh year, the incidence of HF was higher in the NASD cohort than in the control cohort till the end of the follow up.Our study demonstrates that NASD patients are associated with a higher risk of incident HF."
https://openalex.org/W2725157833,"Although some jealous children respond to outsider interference in friendships with problem solving and discussion, others withdraw from the relationship or retaliate against the friends or others. Beliefs about the nature of social characteristics are proposed as an explanation for behavioral heterogeneity in response to jealous provocation. Based on learned helplessness theory and research on children's implicit personality theories, children who subscribed strongly to the belief that social characteristics are fixed and that social outcomes are uncontrollable (high entity beliefs), were expected to more strongly endorse asocial and antisocial responses and less strongly endorse prosocial responses to outsider interference than children who did not have strong entity beliefs, depending on their internal versus external attributions of blame. Two hundred eighty-six children in sixth through eighth grades (primarily Caucasian) participated in an experimental test of this hypothesis. Although hypothesized interactions between beliefs and locus of blame were not supported, results indicated that children who believe social characteristics are changeable also believed they had more control in the internal condition than children who believe social characteristics are immutable. Further, pessimistic children were more likely to tend to endorse asocial and antisocial behavior and less likely to endorse prosocial behavior than optimistic children."
https://openalex.org/W2910035330,"The current commercial access point (AP) selection schemes are mostly based on received signal strength, but perform poorly in many situations. To address this problem, a number of alternative schemes collect and analyze the actual load of every candidate AP. However, these schemes may incur significant latency and signaling overhead in dense wireless local area networks (WLANs). To mitigate such overhead, we propose a user application-based AP selection scheme that considers historical information about AP performance. Without inducing any signaling activity, our scheme monitors the amount of network traffic used by applications and estimates the achievable throughput of APs. Our scheme employs the characteristics of application traffic with the intent of accurately predicting AP performance. Using a measurement study in dense WLAN environments, we show that our scheme achieves higher throughput and lower association latency than those of existing schemes in places highly accessible to the user."
