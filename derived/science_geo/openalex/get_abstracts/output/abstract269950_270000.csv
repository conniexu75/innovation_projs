https://openalex.org/W2058160626,"The general economic analysis of a biological resource presented in this article suggests that overexploitation in the physical sense of reduced productivity may result from not one, but two social conditions: common-property competitive exploitation on the one hand, and private-property maximization of profits on the other. For populations that are economically valuable but possess low reproductive capacities, either condition may lead even to the extinction of the population. In view of the likelihood of private firms adopting high rates of discount, the conservation of renewable resources would appear to require continual public surveillance and control of the physical yield and the condition of the stocks."
https://openalex.org/W2053587100,"(Z)-II-Tetradecenyl acetate is the reported sex pheromone of European corn borer and redbanded leafroller moths. However, geometrically pure preparations of the compound are weakly attractive to these species. Presence of the E geometrical isomer in the Z is necessary for maximum sex attraction and these moths are ""tuned"" to respond optimally to specific proportions of Z to E. This discovery is important to considerations of moth pheromonal specificity, evolution, and in application of knowledge of the pheromones to insect-pest suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2091818449,Estimates of relative selective values of different genotypes in natural populations of predominantly self-pollinated plants have consistently shown a net heterozygote advantage. Heterozygote advantage is further analyzed in the present study by estimating components of selective values corresponding approximately to viability and fecundity. The results show that a higher proportion of heterozygotes than of homozygotes survive from seeding to adult stages and that this viability selection accounts for the overall excess of heterozygotes.
https://openalex.org/W1968938784,A sex-linked gene controlling the age at which the gonadotrops of the pituitary gland differentiate has been discovered in Xiphophorus maculatus. Males homozygous for early differentiation become sexually mature between 10 and 16 weeks; those homozygous for late maturation between 22 and 40 weeks. Heterozygotes are intermediate. Since growth rate decreases when testes mature. the two classes of males differ significantly in adult size.
https://openalex.org/W2055186934,Many synthetic compounds that exhibit activity in juvenile hormone assays have limited structural resemblance to natural juvenile hormones. The observed morphogenic action of many of the compounds considered to be biologically analogous to juvenile hormones is probably synergistic rather than intrinsically hormonal.
https://openalex.org/W1996127448,"Sediments of deep Canadian shield lakes have a firm mud-water interface and an intricately structured, oxygenated surface. Surface relief is not uniform, but is broken by small ridges and upright chironomid tubes. The sedimentary material behaves like a weak jelly and becomes flocculent only when violently disturbed. Sculpins were observed to rest on and, when started, to hide in the oxygenated layers. Sequestering of nutrients in the bottom sediments is enhanced by the structuring of the substrate surface below 10 meters, and may inhibit nutrient recycling at overturn."

The Apollo program, an undertaking that began as a demonstration of technological prowess and evolved into one of the greatest voyages of scientific exploration in our century, had drawn to a close."

https://openalex.org/W2089356463,"Glacial polish, grooves, and striations discovered at an elevation of 1370 meters in the headwaters of Boone Fork on Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina, indicate the former, existence of alpine glaciation at a latitude of 36 degrees 07'N. The Boone Fork glacier was located 890 kilometers south of the previously recognized southern limit of alpine glaciation in the Appalachian Mountains, and 350 kilometers southeast of the nearest point on the Laurentide ice sheet. This find has significant implications for studies of Pleistocene geomorphology, paleobiology, and paleoclimatology in the eastern United States."
https://openalex.org/W2044012974,"Radiocarbon ages for the marine late Pleistocene stratigraphic units of the Baldwin Hills are 36,200 +/- 2,750 years and 28,450 +/- 2,600 years, respectively, defining the termination of marine deposition in this area of the Los Angeles Basin at less than 28,000 years ago. Faunas of the older sample suggest that water depths were about 100 meters at the time of deposition. Shoaling of waters by deposition resulted in very shallow marine to nonmarine conditions about 28,000 years ago. The average rates of uplift for the past 36,000 years have been between 0.5 and 0.8 meter per 100 years."

https://openalex.org/W1973498694,"This is the third is a continuing series of articles on natural disasters, their prediction and modification, and progress in understanding the physical bases of these phenomena. Two earlier articles (Science, 25 May, p. 851, and 1 June, p. 940) reported advances in earthquake prediction. Hurricanes are the subject here. Generally less devastating than major earthquakes—although a single hurricane in 1970 killed an estimated 200,000 persons in Bangladesh—these storms are still the most destructive of all atmospheric phenomena. A recent report of the National Academy of Sciences (see box) recommends that efforts to modify hurricanes and other severe storms become a national goal."
