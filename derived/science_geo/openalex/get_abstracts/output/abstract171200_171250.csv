https://openalex.org/W1995690036,"Why do females typically mate with more than one male? Female mating patterns have broad implications for sexual selection1,2, speciation3 and conflicts of interest between the sexes4, and yet they are poorly understood. Matings inevitably have costs5, and for females, the benefits of taking more than one mate are rarely obvious. One possible explanation is that females gain benefits because they can avoid using sperm from genetically incompatible males, or invest less in the offspring of such males6,7. It has been shown that mating with more than one male can increase offspring viability8,9,10,11,12, but we present the first clear demonstration that this occurs because females with several mates avoid the negative effects of genetic incompatibility13. We show that in crickets, the eggs of females that mate only with siblings have decreased hatching success. However, if females mate with both a sibling and a non-sibling they avoid altogether the low egg viability associated with sibling matings. If similar effects occur in other species, inbreeding avoidance may be important in understanding the prevalence of multiple mating."

To determine how alterations in PDX-1 affect islet function, we examined insulin secretion and islet physiology in mice with one PDX-1 allele inactivated. PDX-1(+/-) mice had a normal fasting blood glucose and pancreatic insulin content but had impaired glucose tolerance and secreted less insulin during glucose tolerance testing. The expression of PDX-1 and glucose transporter 2 in islets from PDX-1(+/-) mice was reduced to 68 and 55%, respectively, whereas glucokinase expression was not significantly altered. NAD(P)H generation in response to glucose was reduced by 30% in PDX-1(+/-) mice. The in situ perfused pancreas of PDX-1(+/-) mice secreted about 45% less insulin when stimulated with 16.7 mm glucose. The K(m) for insulin release was similar in wild type and PDX-1(+/-) mice. Insulin secretion in response to 20 mm arginine was unchanged; the response to 10 nm glucagon-like peptide-1 was slightly increased. However, insulin secretory responses to 10 mm 2-ketoisocaproate and 20 mm KCl were significantly reduced (by 61 and 66%, respectively). These results indicate that a modest reduction in PDX-1 impairs several events in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (such as NAD(P)H generation, mitochondrial function, and/or mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+)) and that PDX-1 is important for normal function of adult pancreatic islets."

A time- and dose-dependent increase in LXRα steady-state mRNA level was seen after insulin stimulation of primary rat hepatocytes in culture. A maximal induction of 10-fold was obtained when hepatocytes were exposed to 400 nminsulin for 24 h. Cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, prevented induction of LXRα mRNA expression by insulin, indicating that the induction is dependent on de novo synthesis of proteins. Stabilization studies using actinomycin D indicated that insulin stimulation increased the half-life of LXRα transcripts in cultured primary hepatocytes. Complementary studies where rats and mice were injected with insulin induced LXRα mRNA levels and confirmed our in vitrostudies. Furthermore, deletion of both the LXRα and LXRβ genes (double knockout) in mice markedly suppressed insulin-mediated induction of an entire class of enzymes involved in both fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. The discovery of insulin regulation of LXR in hepatic tissue as well as gene targeting studies in mice provide strong evidence that LXRs plays a central role not only in cholesterol homeostasis, but also in fatty acid metabolism.

Hepatic fatty acid oxidation, lipogenesis, and glycerolipid synthesis are subject to regulation by insulin (for review, see Ref.1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Control of lipid synthesis is especially important in the liver, which synthesizes lipids from glucose as precursor, for its own uses but also for export into plasma as lipoproteins. Hepatic fatty acid synthesis is elevated when plasma insulin rises, as in states of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The fatty acids are exported from the liver in lipoproteins and reach extrahepatic organs in which they are either utilized or stored.The factors mediating the insulin regulation of lipid metabolism have for a long time been unknown, but recently several reports have identified sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)1 as a necessary transcription factor activating fatty acid synthesis in response to insulin (2Osborne T.F.

SREBP-1c activates transcription of the major genes of fatty acid synthesis including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (3Azzout-Marniche D.

During recent years the LXRs have been proposed to act as sterol sensors that function to help the organism adapt so it can cope with the effects of high free cholesterol levels in blood (6Willy P.J.

LXRα has a relatively restricted expression pattern (liver, kidney, intestine, adipose tissue, and adrenals) (also termed NR1H3 per the Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee) (9Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 10Willy P.J.

Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.-Å. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The first responsive element for LXR was found in the promoter of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a), an essential enzyme constituting the initial and rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (16Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Consistent with these in vitroobservations, LXRα knockout mice lose the capacity to regulate catabolism of excess dietary cholesterol in liver resulting in a rapid accumulation of hepatic cholesteryl esters that eventually leads to liver failure (17Peet D.J.

This effect cannot be compensated for by the related isoform, LXRβ (17Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Additional LXR target genes involved in lipid metabolism include the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which translocates cholesteryl esters between lipoprotein fractions (19Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and the ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABC1 and ABC8, which are implicated in the efflux of cellular free cholesterol (20Repa J.J.

Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 24Yoshikawa T.

We show that, indeed, insulin regulates LXRα in primary cultures of hepatocytes as well as in vivo in liver of rodents injected with insulin. Furthermore, we show that LXRs are necessary for insulin regulation of several lipogenic enzymes, indicating a key role for LXR in mediating insulin effects on lipid metabolism.DISCUSSIONThis study clearly demonstrates that insulin induces LXRα mRNA levels in liver, leading to an increase in the steady-state mRNA level of LXR target genes, such as SREBP-1c as well as many genes encoding enzymes in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, gene targeting studies in mice (LXRα/β double knockout mice), where insulin-mediated induction of an entire class of lipogenic and cholesterogenic enzymes was suppressed, provide strong evidence that LXR plays a central role as an insulin sensor in hepatic lipid homeostasis.Lipogenesis encompasses fatty acid synthesis and subsequent triglyceride synthesis, and takes place in both liver and adipose tissue. Insulin is probably the most important hormonal factor influencing lipogenesis. Evidence gathered over the past few years clearly indicates that the effects of insulin on the expression of lipogenic genes are mediated by SREBP-1c (2Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 4Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). However, there are reports indicating that SREBP-1c is not the only transcription factor involved. In starved and refed SREBP-1c −/− mice, expression of some of the genes encoding hepatic lipogenic enzymes was completely abolished, whereas that of others was only partially suppressed, indicating that factors other than SREBP-1c might be involved in the refeeding response (35Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Additionally, the rapid effect of insulin on transcription of genes such as glucokinase does not require an increased amount of the mature form of SREBP-1c in the nucleus, suggesting that additional actions of insulin are necessary (3Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that SREBP-1c is not the only transcription factor mediating the effects of insulin on gene expression. We show in this study that LXRα mRNA and protein are stimulated by insulin to the same extent as SREBP-1c in the liver. Interestingly, the up-regulation of SREBP-1c was abolished in LXRα/β double knockout mice, indicating a cross-regulation between LXR and SREBP-1c in response to insulin. Cross-regulation between LXR and transcription factors in lipid metabolism has also recently been shown in other studies. Schultz et al. (37Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar) identified an LXR binding site in the SREBP-1c promoter, and disruption of this binding site abolished the response to T0901317, a non-sterol synthetic ligand of LXR. Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acids inhibit transcription of the SREBP-1c gene by antagonizing ligand-dependent activation of the LXR (38Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated in liver and adipocytes that LXRα is a target gene for PPARα and PPARγ, respectively (39Tobin K.A.R. Steineger H.H. Alberti S. Spydevold O. Auwerx J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 3L. K. Juvet, S. M. Andresen, K. T. Dalen, K. A. R. Tobin, K. Hollung, F. Haugen, S. Jacinto, J.-Å. Gustafsson, K. Bamberg, and H. I. Nebb, submitted for publication. We further analyzed the physiological role of LXR and the transcriptional regulation by insulin on hepatic lipogenic enzymes (GK, ME, ACC, and FAS) in normal and LXRα/β double knockout mice. Whereas the expression of these genes was induced in normal mice injected with insulin, the basal mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes in LXRα/β double knockout mice were repressed and insensitive to insulin compared with wild type animals. Additionally, the expression of genes in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG-CoA reductase, squalene synthase) was induced by insulin in normal mice. In contrast to the down-regulation of basal mRNA levels of genes involved in lipogenesis, the expression of genes in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase) was markedly up-regulated in LXRα/β double knockout mice compared with wild type animals. Again, these genes like the genes encoding enzymes in lipogenesis were insensitive to insulin, indicating a suppressive role of LXR for genes in cholesterol synthesis. Down-regulation of the basal mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes as well as of cholesterogenic enzymes in LXRα knockout mice has been reported previously (17Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). However, in another study involving both LXRα and LXRβ single knockout mice, no major differences were shown between wild type and knockout animals in the basal expression levels of these enzyme genes (18Alberti S. Schuster G. Parini P. Feltkamp D. Diczfalusy U. Rudling M. Angelin B. Bjorkhem I. Pettersson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), possibly indicating a synergistic/redundant action of LXRα and LXRβ in maintaining expression of these genes in hepatic lipid metabolism. This coordinated regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis might constitute a way for the body to protect itself against elevated levels of cholesterol by esterifying fatty acids into cholesteryl esters (23Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Anyway, our data strongly suggest that LXR is an obligatory intermediary component in insulin regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. The mechanisms by which insulin stimulates the transcriptional activity of LXR are presently unknown. Regulation of transcriptional activity of LXR by insulin could be through,e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway has earlier been shown to account for the metabolic action of insulin because it is involved in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis and glucose transport (GLUT4) by the hormone (3Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 40Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several cis-acting elements in genes that mediate the effect of insulin on gene transcription have recently been defined. These are referred to as insulin response sequences or elements (43O'Brien R.M. Streeper R.S. Ayala J.E. Stadelmaier B.T. Hornbuckle L.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).In vitro studies have clearly established the importance of the upstream stimulatory factors in the insulin regulation of the fatty acid synthetase promoter through insulin response elements consisting of E boxes of CANNTG sequence (44Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1c-mediated insulin regulation of genes also occurs by binding to E-boxes; however, the effects of upstream stimulatory factors and SREBP-1c seem to be additive and independent (45Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The LXRα induction by insulin is dose- and time-dependent, and dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. This up-regulation could, at least partly, be the result of stabilization of the transcripts. The robust insulin regulation of LXRα suggests that upstream factors, as yet undefined, are influenced by insulin at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels. In line with this notion, we have found that LXRα mRNA regulation by insulin is dependent on de novo synthesis of proteins. Further studies of the LXRα promoter will be required to understand the mechanisms of this regulation and the corresponding effects on cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Similarly, changes in the levels of PPARα and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α (RXRα) as well as products of PPARα target genes in rat liver cells by insulin and glucocorticoids are the result of a major effect on steady-state mRNA levels giving rise to corresponding alterations in protein levels explained by changes in mRNA stability and/or translation efficiency (27Sorensen H.N. Gautvik K.M. Bremer J. Spydevold O. Eur. J Biochem. 1992; 208: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Steineger H.H. Sorensen H.N. Tugwood J.D. Skrede S. Spydevold O. Gautvik K.M. Eur.

Acta. 1993; 1171: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which insulin stimulates the transcriptional activity of LXR in the liver. We have previously shown a PPARα-dependent fatty acid up-regulation of LXRα mRNA and protein (39Tobin K.A.R. Steineger H.H. Alberti S. Spydevold O. Auwerx J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and PPARα has previously been shown to be phosphorylated in response to insulin, resulting in stimulation of basal as well as ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of PPARα (46Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 47Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C.

PPARα could therefore be an upstream factor mediating the insulin effect on LXRα.We have previously shown in rats that liver LXRα is up-regulated during fasting, and down-regulated during refeeding (39Tobin K.A.R.

This is in contrast to the typical insulin effect on gene regulation, where the general trend is down-regulation when energy supply is low, and up-regulation during refeeding. We have also shown fatty acid induction of LXRα, which could explain the induction of LXRα seen during fasting, a state characterized by a high level of free fatty acids. Further studies are required to understand the interplay between insulin and fatty acids in the regulation of LXRs and the effect this might have on target genes. Furthermore, the present study opens up new perspectives regarding cellular mechanisms involved in insulin regulation of gene expression in lipid metabolism. Taken together, our results show that LXR functions as an essential regulatory component in insulin regulation of both cholesterol homeostasis and triglyceride metabolism. Insulin plays a major role in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation, lipogenesis, and glycerolipid synthesis are subject to regulation by insulin (for review, see Ref.1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Control of lipid synthesis is especially important in the liver, which synthesizes lipids from glucose as precursor, for its own uses but also for export into plasma as lipoproteins. Hepatic fatty acid synthesis is elevated when plasma insulin rises, as in states of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The fatty acids are exported from the liver in lipoproteins and reach extrahepatic organs in which they are either utilized or stored. The factors mediating the insulin regulation of lipid metabolism have for a long time been unknown, but recently several reports have identified sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)1 as a necessary transcription factor activating fatty acid synthesis in response to insulin (2Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c activates transcription of the major genes of fatty acid synthesis including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (3Azzout-Marniche D.

The liver X receptors (LXRs) belong to a subclass of nuclear hormone receptors that form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and are bound and activated by oxysterols. During recent years the LXRs have been proposed to act as sterol sensors that function to help the organism adapt so it can cope with the effects of high free cholesterol levels in blood (6Willy P.J.

Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.-Å. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The first responsive element for LXR was found in the promoter of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a), an essential enzyme constituting the initial and rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (16Lehmann J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2026145775,"Using bone marrow derived mast cells from SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP) +/+ and −/− mice, we found that the loss of SHIP leads to a dramatic increase in Steel Factor (SF)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), a substantial reduction in PI(3,4)P2, and no change in PI(4,5)P2 levels. We also found that SF-induced activation of protein kinase B (PKB) is increased and prolonged in SHIP−/− cells, due in large part to more PKB associating with the plasma membrane in these cells. Pretreatment of SHIP−/− cells with 25 μm LY294002 resulted in complete inhibition of SF-induced PI(3,4)P2, while still yielding PI(3,4,5)P3 levels similar to those achieved in SHIP+/+ cells. This offered a unique opportunity to study the regulation of PKB by PI(3,4,5)P3, in the absence of PI(3,4)P2. Under these conditions, PKB activity was markedly reduced compared with that in SF-stimulated SHIP+/+ cells, even though more PKB localized to the plasma membrane. Although phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 mediated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr-308 was unaffected by LY294002, phosphorylation at Ser-473 was dramatically reduced. Moreover, intracellular delivery of PI(3,4)P2 to LY294002-pretreated, SF-stimulated SHIP−/− cells increased phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473 and increased PKB activity. These results are consistent with a model in which SHIP serves as a regulator of both activity and subcellular localization of PKB."

Further deletions within the death/C-terminal domain demonstrated that the C-terminal domain determines ankyrin-B activity, whereas deletion of the death domain had no effect.

Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Vertebrate ankyrins are derived from three genes including ankyrin-R (ankyrin-1), ankyrin-B (ankyrin-2), and ankyrin-G (ankyrin-3) that encode multiple variants due to alternatively spliced transcripts of each gene product (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Members of the ankyrin family have a high degree of sequence similarity, share common structural domains, and are often co-expressed in the same cells. For example, ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G isoforms are co-expressed in brain, cardiac and skeletal muscle, and kidney (2Kordeli E. Ludosky M.A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The results of ankyrin gene-specific knockouts in mice demonstrate that ankyrin isoforms have divergent and non-overlapping functions. For example, mutant mice with a cerebellar-specific knockout of ankyrin-G that still show normal expression of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-R in the cerebellum display a loss of voltage-gated Na+ channels and neurofascin from axon initial segments, a decreased ability of Purkinje neurons to fire action potentials, and a progressive ataxia (4Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice deficient in ankyrin-B exhibit down-regulation and mis-sorting of calcium-release channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle and cardiac arrhythmias, despite the fact that ankyrin-R and ankyrin-G isoforms are normally expressed in both cardiac and skeletal muscle (2Kordeli E. Ludosky M.A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J.

Furthermore, ankyrin-B null mice display significant central nervous system defects including reduced expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule, dilated ventricles, optic nerve degeneration, along with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and pyramidal tracts (7Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), even though ankyrin-R and ankyrin-G are normally expressed in many of these areas of the brain (4Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 8Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3725-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike a number of other protein families that can compensate for lack of specific isoform expression, ankyrin gene functions appear to be specific and are not compensated by other similar gene products. An important but currently unanswered question regarding these similar molecules is the basis for specificity in the unique functions of ankyrins. Ankyrins are modular proteins composed of three major domains (see Fig.4). The membrane-binding domains of ankyrins -B, -G, and -R are each composed of 24 consecutive ANK repeats. While possessing the same basic folding structure and 74% amino acid identity (human ankyrin-B compared with rat ankyrin-G), the membrane-binding domains of ankyrins exhibit functional differences in binding assays. For example, ankyrin-R and ankyrin-B display up to 10-fold differences in affinities for kidney microsomes (9Davis J. Davis L. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6417-6426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, ankyrin-B and ankyrin-R membrane-binding domains also have significant differences in affinities for the anion exchanger (10Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, the membrane-binding domain for each ankyrin has evolved for efficient function in specific cellular roles. Ankyrins also share a relatively conserved spectrin-binding domain with 68% amino acid identity between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G. Spectrin-binding domains provide specificity for spectrin subtype association (i.e. ankyrin-R and β1-(erythroid) spectrin compared with ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin (12Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16198-16206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1874-1881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Finally, ankyrins all share a domain containing a conserved death domain of unknown function (59% amino acid identity between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G) and a C-terminal domain that is highly divergent across the ankyrin family (11% amino acid identity between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G). Transfection with ankyrin-B, but not ankyrin-G, can restore normal localization of calcium-release channels in the ER1/SR of ankyrin-B (−/−) neonatal cardiomyocytes (14Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates, using ankyrin-B/G chimeras, that the death/C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B defines the subcellular localization of 220-kDa ankyrin-B as well as activity in restoring normal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) localization and cardiomyocyte contractility in ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes. We further report that within the death/C-terminal domain, the C-terminal domain, and not the death domain, determines ankyrin-B activity. These findings indicate that ankyrin-B domains function in an integrated fashion and provide the first insights into how ankyrins can selectively target proteins to diverse cellular sites. Cardiomyocytes were dissociated from 1- to 2-day-old ankyrin-B (−/−) (7Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or wild type littermates as described previously (14Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For transfection assays, purified endotoxin-free DNA was isolated using Qiagen MidiPreps (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) or Genefector (Venn Nova, Pompano Beach, FL) according to manufacturer's guidelines into 3–4-day-old myocyte cultures or cultured HEK293 cells. Concentrations and time for assays were determined empirically to ensure high population transfection efficiency (∼70%) together with a moderate level of single cell expression (results not shown). pEGFP (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G chimeric expression constructs were engineered using common molecular techniques. Briefly, an internal EcoRI site in ankyrin-B was removed by Quickchange PCR (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). Next, pEGFPC2 and pEGFPN3 were modified to create a novel PmeI site in the pEGFP multiple cloning site (3′). The membrane-binding domains of 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G were amplified by PCR to engineer a 5′EcoRI site and 3′ AscI site resulting in a 3-amino acid linker (Gly-Ala-Pro) between the membrane- and spectrin-binding domains. The spectrin-binding domains of 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G (which lack the serine/threonine-rich insert and tail of 270-kDa ankyrin-G) were amplified by PCR with 5′AscI and 3′ PacI sites resulting in a 3-amino acid linker (Leu-Ile-Asn) between the spectrin-binding and death/C-terminal domains. Finally, the death/C-terminal domains of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G were amplified to contain 5′ PacI and 3′ PmeI sites. Amplified constructs were inserted into pNEB193 (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) and subsequently ligated into the modified pEGFP vectors using the available EcoRI and PmeI sites to create full-length GFP 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G expression constructs, as well as six other full-length ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G chimeras (Fig. 4). Similar methods were utilized to create additional constructs (see Figs. 7 Aand 8 A). All plasmids were verified first by restriction digestions and sequencing (ABI Prism; Duke DNA Core Facility), subsequently expressed in HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); Manassas, VA), and immunoblotted using GFP-specific antisera (CLONTECH) to ensure full-length protein products.Figure 8The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain, but not the death domain, is necessary for striated localization of ankyrin-B and activity in rescuing IP3R and RyR localization in ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes.

Data represent at least three separate experiments (using at least three different mice), with a minimum of 50 cardiomyocytes analyzed per group. Myocytes were subsequently fixed in paraformaldehyde, and GFP-ankyrin chimera expression was confirmed by immunostaining (GFP-specific antisera) and confocal microscopy as described below. Primary cultures were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibodies including green fluorescent protein (mouse, rabbit, and chicken; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), α-actinin (mouse; Sigma), IP3 receptor (type 1, rabbit; type 2, rabbit; Pan-antibody; rabbit), ryanodine receptor (type 2; mouse), SERCA2 (mouse; Affinity Bioreagents, Cambridge, UK), or ankyrin-B (mouse and rabbit), followed by appropriate secondary antisera (Alexa 488, 568; Molecular Probes; Sunnyvale, CA), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Images at each wavelength (488 and 568 nm) were collected separately to ensure that there was no fluorescent channel bleed through. GFP ankyrin-transfected HEK293 cells were processed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (7Scotland P. Zhou D. Benveniste H. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using GFP-specific antisera (Chemicon). All rescue experiment images are representative of hundreds of transfected myocytes in each culture. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times using different neonatal mice. Data were analyzed using either paired two-tailed Student's t tests or two-way ANOVA, andp values less than 0.05 were considered significant.Error bars in figures represent S.E. The goal of this study was to identify the ankyrin domain(s) that determine the difference between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G in their cellular localization and the ability to restore localization of IP3R and RyR in primary cultures of ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes from 1- to 2-day-old neonatal mice. The first step in establishing a rescue assay was to define culture conditions where ankyrin-B, IP3R, and RyR are normally organized. Cardiomyocytes were not examined before 24 h of culture, because at this stage cells were not yet firmly adhered to the coverslip and were routinely spherical (15Larsen T.H. Dalen H. Sommer J.R. Boyle R. Lieberman M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, in 2-day-old cardiomyocyte cultures, cells were firmly attached, and α-actinin displays a costameric pattern as revealed by the normal Z-line localization pattern (Fig. 1). At this early developmental stage, ankyrin-B is striated and highly concentrated at the A-band. In addition, some ankyrin-B staining (∼15–20% of the total level of ankyrin-B) co-localizes with α-actinin, as well as in small (<0.5 μm) punctate structures throughout the cardiomyocyte (Figs. 1 and 2 A). In day 2 cultures, the organization of the SR is poorly developed, as evidenced by the diffuse, punctate distribution of ryanodine receptor (RyR), IP3 receptor (IP3R), and the SR/ER calcium ATPase (SERCA2; Fig. 1,left-most portion of panel). Components of the calcium-release/uptake machinery of the SR begin to organize at ∼4 days in culture (see SERCA2 staining); however, complete organization of ryanodine and IP3 receptor calcium-release channels does not display a more defined pattern until postnatal day 6 and 7. These developmental data also correlate with our observations that normal calcium waves and cellular contractions take several days to display a rhythmic, fluid characteristic (data not shown). The early expression and organized distribution of ankyrin-B in neonatal cardiomyocytes are consistent with a role of ankyrin-B in subsequent organization of IP3 and ryanodine receptors, which become localized only later in cardiomyocyte development.Figure 2GFP 220-kDa ankyrin-B (AnkB) and 190-kDa ankyrin-G (AnkG) show similar localizations to corresponding endogenous ankyrins.Four-to 6-day-old wild type and ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocyte cultures were transfected with 220-kDa GFP ankyrin-B (A) or 190-kDa GFP ankyrin-G (B). Following 24–36 h, cultures were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.A, top panel, wild type untransfected cardiomyocytes were co-labeled with α-actinin and ankyrin-B.Lower panels in A show ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes transfected with 220-kDa ankyrin-B which was N- (nGFP-AnkB) or C-terminally (cGFP-AnkB) fused with GFP and subsequently stained with α-actinin and GFP antisera.B, wild type untransfected cardiomyocytes were co-labeled with α-actinin and ankyrin-G (top panel), and the lower panels in B show ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes transfected with 190-kDa GFP ankyrin-G (nGFP-AnkG and cGFP-AnkG) and subsequently stained with α-actinin and GFP antisera.

Data are representative of hundreds of transfected myocytes from more than 10 different mice in each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These developmental time course experiments provided a framework for rescue studies using transiently transfected GFP expression constructs (see below) (Fig. 5). Because all of the cardiac molecules examined display a normal striated pattern by 6–7 days in culture, we chose this developmental stage to address the effect of expression constructs on receptor channel localization. Therefore, cultures were transfected with the various GFP expression constructs at day 4–5 and subsequently analyzed at 6–7 days in culture. The next step in establishing a system for evaluating ankyrin-dependent rescue of IP3R and RyR localization in cardiomyocytes was to develop methods for transfection of cardiomyocytes resulting in normal localization of GFP-tagged ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G. We generated 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G cDNAs that were either N- or C-terminally fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP; Fig. 4, A and B). GFP expression was adjusted to low levels such that the GFP signal could only be detected by immunofluorescent staining with GFP antibody. Endogenous ankyrin-B in wild type cardiomyocytes localizes mainly at the A-band, with lower levels at the Z-line (Fig. 1 and Fig.2 A, upper panel). Similar to endogenous ankyrin-B, both the N- and C-terminal GFP fusions of 220-kDa ankyrin-B are primarily localized to the A-band in transfected ankyrin-B null cardiomyocytes with a less intense signal observed at the Z-line (Fig. 2 A; shown are data using both the N-terminal GFP fusion, referred to as nGFP-ankyrin-B, and the C-terminal construct, cGFP-ankyrin-B). Endogenous ankyrin-G in wild type myocytes displays a diffuse membrane expression (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) which is also seen using both N- and C-terminal GFP-fusions of 190-kDa ankyrin-G (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). These data establish that transfected GFP-ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G are expressed and targeted to identical localization patterns as their endogenous counterparts under our experimental conditions. In addition, these experiments demonstrate that GFP fused at either end of the proteins or the presence of the additional six linker residues (between the three major ankyrin domains; see under “Experimental Procedures”) do not interfere with the steady-state localization of either GFP 220-kDa ankyrin-B or 190-kDa ankyrin-G. Evidence that transfections under these conditions are not toxic to cardiomyocytes is that reduced contraction rates of ankyrin-B (−/−) cells is restored by transfection with ankyrin-B constructs (see below). Ryanodine and IP3receptors (Fig. 3, B andC), but not other calcium homeostasis proteins (including SERCA2, triadin, calreticulin, or the dihydropyridine receptor) are mis-localized in ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes. 2P. J. Mohler, A. O. Gramolini, and V. Bennett, unpublished observations. Transfection with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged 220-kDa ankyrin-B (both N- and C-terminal fusions; Fig. 3 B), but not GFP alone (data not shown), restores the normally striated distribution of both ryanodine and IP3 receptors in neonatal ankyrin-B null cardiomyocytes. In contrast, transfection with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged 190-kDa ankyrin-G does not restore a striated localization of either IP3 or ryanodine receptor, which exhibit localization patterns in transfected cells resembling mock or untransfected phenotypes (Fig. 3 C). We measured spontaneous contraction rates of ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes before and after transfection to assess the physiological impact of restoring IP3R and RyR localization in ankyrin-B-deficient cardiomyocytes. Wild type cardiomyocytes contract rhythmically from a central perinuclear point at 144 ± 10 spontaneous beats per min (bpm; n = 8 mice, >20 cells averaged/mouse), whereas ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes contract at 42 ± 3 bpm (p < 0.05,n = 5; Fig. 4). We next measured spontaneous contraction rates of ankyrin-B (−/−) cultures transfected with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B or GFP-190-kDa ankyrin-G. Analysis of GFP-ankyrin expression by immunofluorescence using GFP-specific antisera demonstrated that transfection efficiencies were 60–80% (Fig. 4). Therefore, a large number of cardiomyocytes were monitored to arrive at statistically significant sample populations. Ankyrin-B (−/−) cultures transfected with GFP, either C- or N-terminally fused to 220-kDa ankyrin-B contract at a rate similar to that of wild type cultures (129 ± 3 bpm; p > 0.05, n = 4 mice, >80 cells counted/mouse). In contrast to the normal beat frequency observed in ankyrin-B-transfected cells, ankyrin-B null myocytes expressing either C- or N-terminal GFP fusions of 190-kDa ankyrin-G display contraction rates that are not different from untransfected cardiomyocytes (32 ± 2 bpm,n = 4). As expected, the beat frequencies of mock-transfected (37 ± 4 bpm, n = 3) or GFP-transfected myocytes (41 ± 5 bpm, n = 3) are not significantly different from untransfected null cultures. These results are consistent with the lack of striated patterns of IP3 and ryanodine receptor distribution in these cultures (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the abnormal beat frequency characteristics displayed by ankyrin-B null cardiomyocytes are the direct result of a single molecular defect, because the reintroduction of 220-kDa ankyrin-B into these cultures restores normal contraction rates. We generated ankyrin-B/G chimeric constructs with the eight possible combinations of 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G membrane-binding, spectrin-binding, and death/C-terminal domains (Fig.5 B) to determine the essential domain(s) required for native ankyrin-B targeting and ability to rescue IP3R and RyR localization in ankyrin (−/−) cardiomyocytes. Each construct (containing three amino acid linkers between domains) was N- and C-terminally fused with pEGFP resulting in a total of 16 ankyrin-B/ankyrin-G chimeras. Western blot analysis of cultured HEK293 cells transfected with these constructs using GFP-specific antisera revealed that ankyrin-B/G expression constructs generate proteins that migrate at the expected molecular weight (Fig.5 C). GFP-tagged ankyrin-B/ankyrin-G chimeric constructs were transfected into 4–5-day-old ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes and the localizations of the GFP-ankyrin chimera as well as the IP3and ryanodine receptor were subsequently examined in the same cells by double-label immunofluorescence. For these experiments, either N- or C-terminal fusions of GFP-ankyrin chimeras yielded identical findings; results for the remaining portion of the manuscript show data using the N-terminally fused constructs, i.e. those with GFP located at the C terminus of ankyrins. Expression constructs where only the membrane-binding domains of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G have been switched (i.e. comparing full-length ankyrin-B, MBSBDCB, and MGSBDCB) not only show very similar subcellular localization but both appear equally capable of restoring IP3R and RyR localization in ankyrin-B (−/−) cultures (compare Fig. 3 A and Fig. 6,top left panel). Conversely, the substitution of the ankyrin-B membrane-binding domain onto an ankyrin-G backbone (construct MBSGDCG) results in a non-striated pattern of GFP expression and lack of activity in restoring IP3R or RyR localization (Fig. 6). Together, these results demonstrate that the membrane-binding domains of 220-kDa ankyrin-B and 190-kDa ankyrin-G are interchangeable in this rescue assay, even though these domains share only 74% amino acid identity in their primary sequences. Analysis of GFP constructs containing switched ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G spectrin-binding domains reveal that this domain is also interchangeable in our targeting/rescue assay. For example, chimeric ankyrin MBSGDCB is localized at the A-band and is also capable of restoring the localization of both ryanodine and IP3 receptors (Fig. 6, left panel,middle). Similarly, the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrin-B within the ankyrin-G membrane binding domain and death/C-terminal domain (MGSBDCG) is not capable of restoring the normal localization of ankyrin, IP3, or ryanodine receptor (Fig. 6, right panel, top), further demonstrating that the spectrin-binding domain is not the unique region of the molecule that confers normal localization and calcium-channel rescue specificity to 220-kDa ankyrin-B. The specificity of 220-kDa ankyrin-B targeting and activity in directing localization of IP3R and RyR both reside within the death/C-terminal domain. The presence of the ankyrin-B death/C-terminal domain within the context of ankyrin-G (MGSGDCB) can completely restore normal localization of GFP-ankyrin as well as of ryanodine and IP3 receptors (Fig. 6, left panel,bottom). Furthermore, inclusion of the ankyrin-G death/C-terminal domain within the ankyrin-B construct (MBSBDCG) abolished subcellular striated patterns for GFP and the ability to restore IP3 or ryanodine receptor localization (Fig. 6, right panel,bottom). Altogether, these data clearly show that the death/C-terminal domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B is required both for the localization of ankyrin and for normal IP3R and RyR localization in cardiac muscle. We next designed GFP fusion constructs containing only the death/C-terminal domain of either ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G (Fig.7 A, left), and we confirmed their activity in directing protein expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7 A, right). Transfection of the death/C-terminal domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B into null cultures does not restore the normal distribution of IP3 or ryanodine receptor (Fig. 7 B), indicating that the death/C-terminal domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B is necessary (see Fig. 5) but not sufficient for rescue of calcium-release channel localization. As expected, transfection of the ankyrin-G death/C-terminal domain construct into ankyrin-B (−/−) myocytes also does not restore normal localization to either ryanodine or IP3 receptors (Fig.7 C). We next constructed ankyrin-B expression plasmids with deletions of either the death domain or the C-terminal domain (Fig.8 A, left). These constructs were sequenced, and expression of the correct molecular weight GFP fusion was confirmed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8 A,right). Ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes transfected with GFP full-length ankyrin-B lacking the death domain exhibit striated localization patterns of GFP, suggesting that the death domain is not critical in targeting ankyrin within cardiomyocytes (Fig.8 B). Not surprisingly, this construct also restored IP3 and ryanodine receptor distributions to patterns that are comparable with those observed using the full-length GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (MBSBDCB) construct (Fig.3 B). By contrast, ankyrin-B, which has the death domain but lacks the C-terminal domain, is unable to localize in a striated A- and Z-line pattern and is also unable to rescue the localization of either the ryanodine or IP3 receptor (Fig. 8 C, bottom panel). Transfection of GFP-ankyrin MGSGDCB restores ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocyte contraction rates nearly to levels observed in wild type cultures (Fig. 9; 124 ± 3 bpm;p > 0.05; n = 4 mice). By contrast, transfection of ankyrin MBSBDCGdoes not restore normal contractility to ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes (41 ± 1 bpm, n = 4 mice; Fig. 9). These results are in agreement with immunolocalization studies demonstrating requirement of the death/C-terminal domain for activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras in restoring localization of IP3R and RyR (Fig. 5). We also determined that constructs encoding only the C-terminal domains of ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B fail to restore wild type contractility rates to null cultures (38 ± 4 and 36 ± 3 bpm, respectively, n = 3 mice; Fig. 9). Finally, transfection of cardiomyocytes with 220-kDa ankyrin-B lacking only the death domain largely restores normal beat frequency (126 ± 3 bpm;n = 4 mice) to ankyrin-B (−/−) myocytes. However, cardiomyocytes expressing GFP-ankyrin-B lacking the C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B (Fig. 9; 46 ± 1 bpm; n = 4 mice) did not display contractility properties that were significantly different from ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocyte cultures (Fig. 9; 42 ± 2 bpm, n = 5). These results confirm the requirement of the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain, but not the death domain, in the rescue of IP3 and ryanodine receptor localization and normal contraction rates ankyrin-B (−/−) cardiomyocytes. This study reports that the C-terminal domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B is necessary for activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras for proper localization and for restoring the localization of IP3 and ryanodine receptors as well as normal contraction rates to ankyrin-B null cardiomyocytes. The C-terminal domain is not active in the absence of membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains, indicating that one or more of these domains must cooperate to ensure normal function of ankyrin-B. A major role for the C-terminal domain was initially surprising due to expected activities of the membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains for ankyrin linkages to spectrin and membrane-associated proteins. However, as multiple ankyrin isoforms are commonly expressed within the same tissue, share closely related membrane- and spectrin-binding domains, but have non-overlapping functions, the C-terminal domains of other ankyrin isoforms may have similar regulatory functions that dictate isoform targeting and binding specificity within the ankyrin family. Functions of the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain could result, in principle, from intramolecular and/or intermolecular interactions. Evidence for the potential of the C-terminal domain to participate in intramolecular interactions with other ankyrin domains comes from biochemical analysis of the C-terminal domain of ankyrin-R (16Hall T.G. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Davis L.H. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ankyrin-R variant, lacking 161 residues in the C-terminal domain due to alternative splicing, has an increased affinity for spectrin and the anion exchanger. Moreover, the 161-residue segment binds directly to ankyrin-R, but not to individual spectrin- and membrane-binding domains, and can reverse the increased binding affinity for the anion exchanger. These observations led to the proposal that the 161 residues within the C-terminal domain of ankyrin-R bind to a site on ankyrin encompassing both membrane-binding and spectrin-binding domains and function as an allosteric repressor (17Davis L.H. Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B contains a segment (residues 1600–1760) with limited sequence similarity to the 161 residues of ankyrin-R, although the possibility of alternatively spliced forms lacking this domain has not been evaluated. To date, no published information is available regarding intermolecular interactions of the death/C-terminal domain of 220-kDa ankyrin-B or other ankyrins. Moreover, searches of the available data bases with the ankyrin-B C-terminal domain sequence have not revealed homologies to known protein domains or binding sites. One feature of the C-terminal domain potentially relevant to protein interactions is a predicted amphipathic helix (1778–1788) that could mediate interactions with GTPases or protein kinases (18Bernstein L.S.

Phosphorylation of the 220-kDa ankyrin-B C-terminal domain may also provide a mechanism for ankyrin-B-dependent localization of calcium-release proteins in the ER/SR membrane. It is of particular interest that multiple putative phosphorylation sites are predicted within this domain including 2 protein kinase A, 7 protein kinase C, 16 casein kinase II, and 1 tyrosine phosphorylation site (Fig. 10; Expasy Prosite, www.expasy.org). The cellular mechanism involved in 220-kDa ankyrin-B-dependent localization of IP3 and ryanodine receptor to the SR is currently unknown. The fact that 220-kDa ankyrin-B and IP3 or ryanodine receptors do not demonstrate extensive co-localization argues against a simple stoichiometric 1:1 association between 220-kDa ankyrin-B and these receptors at the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Immunoprecipitation studies have demonstrated interactions between IP3R and ankyrins from native brain tissue and cultured cells (20Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N.R. Zhang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Joseph S.K. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hayashi T. Su T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It will be important in future experiments to address the nature of ankyrin-B/calcium-release channel interactions to determine whether these are direct or indirect and if they are modulated by the C-terminal domain. In conclusion, the results from this rescue study indicate that the C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B is critical for the normal localization of ankyrin-B, IP3R, and RyR in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Extrapolation of these findings suggests that C-terminal domains in other ankyrins may also be required for dictating specificity for ankyrin function in diverse tissues. Both ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B isoforms have been implicated in the delivery of proteins to specialized membrane sites (4Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 23Devarajan P. De Stabach P.R. Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, unlike ankyrin-G polypeptides that have been characterized at plasma membranes in various cell types, ankyrin-B appears to be intimately involved in the regulation ER/SR calcium compartment. Therefore, these isoforms appear to have similar but non-overlapping roles in the organization of protein complexes. Based on the results of the current study, we speculate that the divergent roles of ankyrins are dependent on their C-terminal domains.

As a member of the subfamily of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate enzymes known as the α-oxoamine synthases, serine palmitoyltransferase catalyzes the committed step of sphingolipid synthesis. The residues that are mutated to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type I reside in a highly conserved region of Lcb1p that is predicted to be a catalytic domain of Lcb1p on the basis of alignments with other members of the α-oxoamine synthase family. We found that the corresponding mutations in the LCB1 gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae reduce serine palmitoyltransferase activity. These mutations are dominant and decrease serine palmitoyltransferase activity by 50% when the wild-type and mutantLCB1 alleles are coexpressed. We also show that serine palmitoyltransferase is an Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer and that the mutated Lcb1p proteins retain their ability to interact with Lcb2p. Modeling studies suggest that serine palmitoyltransferase is likely to have a single active site that lies at the Lcb1p·Lcb2p interface and that the mutations in Lcb1p reside near the lysine in Lcb2p that is expected to form the Schiff's base with the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor. Furthermore, mutations in this lysine and in a histidine residue that is also predicted to be important for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate binding to Lcb2p also dominantly inactivate SPT similar to the hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1-like mutations in Lcb1p.

Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In addition, sphingolipid metabolites are regulatory molecules for a variety of cellular processes (4Hannun Y.A.

These bioactive sphingolipid metabolites are formed as intermediates during both the synthesis and the breakdown of the complex sphingolipids. Many human diseases that result from defects in sphingolipid catabolism have been discovered (7Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but examples of defects in sphingolipid biosynthesis that cause diseases have been lacking. However, it was recently reported that hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1),1 the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy, results from mutations in the Lcb1p subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) (1Bejaoui K.

SPT catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of sphingolipids, the condensation of serine with palmitoyl CoA (see Fig.1 below). It is a member of the subfamily of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) enzymes known as the α-oxoamine synthases that all catalyze the condensation of a carboxylic acid CoA thioester with the α-carbon of an amino acid. The other α-oxoamine synthases are 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS), which catalyzes the first step of biotin synthesis in Escherichia coli (8Webster S.P. Campopiano D.J. Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Watt R.M. Sawyer L. Baxter R.L. Biochem. Soc.

Homologs of theLCB1 and LCB2 genes from higher eukaryotes have been identified based on their similarity to the S. cerevisiae LCB genes (15Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the AONS enzyme reveals that several functionally important residues, including those that are involved in PLP binding, are highly conserved in the α-oxoamine synthases (16Webster S.P.

Although Lcb1p and Lcb2p are homologous to each other and to AONS (see Fig. 2 A below), many of these conserved residues are present in Lcb2p (for example, Lys-366, which is predicted to form a Schiff's base with PLP), but not in Lcb1p. Interestingly, a soluble Lcb2p homodimeric form of SPT was recently characterized from the glycosphingolipid-producing bacterium Sphingomonas paucimobilis (18Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotes both proteins are required for SPT activity. Thus unlike the other α-oxoamine synthases that are soluble homodimers, the eukaryotic SPT enzyme is membrane-associated, and enzyme activity requires both the Lcb1p and the Lcb2p subunit. In comparison to the other members of the family, Lcb1p and Lcb2p also have amino- and carboxyl-terminal extensions that may be important for membrane association. The human homolog of the LCB1 gene, SPTLC1, is mutated at cysteine 133 (C133W or C133Y) or at valine 144 (V144D) in HSN1 patients (1Bejaoui K. Wu C. Scheffler M.D. Haan G. Ashby P. Wu L. de Jong P.

In the studies reported here, we show that the HSN1 mutations in yeast Lcb1p dominantly inactivate SPT. We also demonstrate that SPT is an Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer. On the basis of modeling studies, we predicted that the mutated cysteine in Lcb1p resides in close proximity to residues in Lcb2p that are involved in PLP binding. We mutated two residues in Lcb2p that are predicted to be important for PLP binding and found that these mutant proteins also dominantly inactivate SPT. Yeast cells were grown according to standard procedures (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The wild-type yeast strain was TDY2037 (Matα ura3–52 leu2 trp1 lys2), thecsg2Δ mutant was TDY2302 (Matα ura3–52 leu2 trp1 lys2 csg2::URA3), thelcb1Δ mutant was TDY2507 (Matα ura3–52 leu2 trp1 lys2 lcb1::TRP1), and thelcb2Δ mutant was TDY2503 (Mat a ura3–52 leu2 trp1 lys2 lcb2::TRP1). Phytosphingosine (PHS, 15 μm) and 0.1% tergitol was included in the medium for thelcb1Δ and lcb2Δ mutant cells. Thelcb1 and lcb2 mutant alleles were constructed by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). For the LCB1 mutations a pRS315-based plasmid containing a BamHI to KpnILCB1 fragment, which extended from 250 bp upstream of the start codon to 135 bp downstream of the stop codon, was used as template. The mutagenic primer pairs used to create the mutations were: For C180Y: 5′-TGTGGGCGCCTATGGTCCCGCCG and its complement; for C180W: 5′-TGTGGGCGCCTGGGGTCCCGCCG and its complement; for V191D: 5′-CGGTAACCAGGACGATCATTACACGTTGG and its complement. For theLCB2 mutations a pRS316-based plasmid containing aAvrII to EcoRI LCB2 fragment, which extended from 680 bp upstream of the start codon to 345 bp downstream of the stop codon, was used as template. The mutagenic primer pairs used to create the mutations were: For K366T: 5′-ATGGGTACTTTCACTACGTCGTTTGGTGCTGCT and its complement; for H334F: 5′-TTTATCGATGAAGCCTTTTCTATAGGCGCTATG and its complement. Attempts to construct functional Lcb1p or Lcb2p with HA tags on the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends were unsuccessful. Therefore, the tags were placed internal to the coding sequence. The tagged alleles used in these studies complemented their respective null mutants demonstrating that they were functional. For the HA-taggedLCB1 allele, the HA tag was inserted between codons 9 and 10 in the LCB1 gene. Codons 9 and 10 were first converted to an AvrII site in pRS315-LCB1 by Quik Change mutagenesis using the primer 5′-ACATCCCAGAGGTTTTACCTAGGTCAATACCGATTCCGGCA (the AvrII site is shown in bold) and its complement. ASpeI-ended triple-HA cassette (previously described) (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was inserted into the AvrII site. Using the same strategy, codons 53 and 54 of LCB2 were converted to anAvrII site in pRS316-LCB2 and theSpeI-ended triple-HA cassette was inserted into theAvrII site. The primer pair used to introduce theAvrII site in LCB2 was 5′- GGTCATGTTCACGACTTCTTACCTAGGACCTTCCAAAAAAACAAACATC and its complement. Microsomes were prepared as previously described except that the cells were grown in minimal medium (to maintain selection for plasmids) to an A 600 of ∼1 and were then diluted 20-fold into YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose) and allowed to double four or five times prior to harvesting. This eliminated the high background of palmitoyl CoA-independent incorporation of radioactivity from serine into the organic phase, which was consistently observed when microsomes prepared from cells grown in minimal medium were used for the SPT assay. TLC analysis of the extracted radioactive products confirmed that this labeled species was not a long-chain base (data not shown). SPT was assayed as previously described (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using 0.4 mg of microsomal protein and 0.1 mm palmitoyl CoA. Each assay was conducted in quadruplicate, and the average SPT activity is reported. Microsomal protein was prepared as previously described (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and 100 μg (at 1 mg/ml) was solubilized with 0.1% sucrose monolaurate. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Twenty μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (125 mg/ml), which had been prebound with 3 μl of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (BAbCO), were added to the solubilized microsomal protein. Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times, and 10% of the immunoprecipitated protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The methods used for immunoblotting and for detection of Lcb1p and Lcb2p with the anti-Lcb1p and anti-Lcb2p antibodies were previously described (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Microsomal proteins were solubilized in 0.05m Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% sucrose monolaurate, loaded onto a Superose-12 fast-protein liquid chromatography column, and eluted with the solubilization buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Molecular weight standards were added to the sample prior to application to the column. Fractions (0.5 ml) were concentrated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient gel. Molecular markers were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and Lcb1p and Lcb2p were detected by Western blotting as described previously (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The LCB1 gene is essential for viability, butlcb1Δ yeast cells will grow if phytosphingosine (PHS) is provided in the medium (Fig. 1). To determine the effect of the HSN1 mutations on SPT activity, we made the corresponding mutations (C180W, C180Y, and V191D) in the yeastLCB1 gene (Fig. 2). The HSN1-LCB1 alleles did not complement the PHS-requiring phenotype of the lcb1Δ mutant. Transformants carrying centromeric plasmids harboring the LCB1-C180W allele were unable to grow without PHS under any conditions, whereas those carrying the LCB1-C180Y or the LCB1-V191D alleles grew poorly at 26 °C and failed to grow at 37 °C (data not shown). Based on prior characterization of the growth phenotypes of SPT mutants (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Dunn T.M. Gable K. Monaghan E. Bacikova D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) these results indicated that the HSN1 mutations reduced SPT activity. Assays of microsomal SPT activity confirmed this conclusion (Fig. 3 A), because there was no detectable SPT activity in microsomes prepared from theLCB1-C180W and LCB1-C180Y mutant cells and about 10% of wild-type SPT activity in microsomes prepared fromLCB1-V191D cells. These results demonstrated that the HSN1 mutations in Lcb1p severely compromise SPT activity in yeast. The yeast HSN1-LCB1 alleles are loss-of-function mutations. Assuming that the corresponding mutations also inactivate human SPT, the dominant HSN1 disorder could result from haploinsufficiency or the mutations could be dominant-negative. We tested whether the HSN1-LCB1 alleles were dominant by introducing them into haploid LCB1+ yeast cells. AnLCB1+csg2Δ haploid strain was used, because it provided an assay for reduced in vivo SPT activity. Cells lacking the CSG2 gene fail to mannosylate inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) and therefore accumulate high levels of IPC (Fig. 1), which leads to Ca2+ sensitivity (12Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations that reduce IPC, including those that reduce SPT activity, suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the csg2Δ mutant (12Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol.

Introduction of the plasmid-borneLCB1-C180W, LCB1-C180Y, or LCB1-V191Dallele into the LCB1+csg2Δ haploid strain suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity indicating that the mutant alleles dominantly inactivated SPT activityin vivo (Fig. 4 A). Microsomal SPT activity measurements confirmed this, revealing a 2-fold reduction in enzyme activity (Fig. 3 B). These experiments demonstrated that the HSN1-LCB1 alleles were dominant inactivating mutations that reduced in vitro SPT activity about 50% when they were coexpressed with a wild-type LCB1allele, and that they also reduced in vivo SPT activity. We next investigated the subunit structure of SPT. As mentioned above, the other α-oxoamine synthases, including a bacterial SPT enzyme (18Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), are soluble homodimers. However, eukaryotic SPT is a membrane-associated enzyme comprised of two homologous subunits, Lcb1p and Lcb2p (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,23Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hanada and coworkers (23Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have shown that the mammalian SPT enzyme is comprised of Lcb1p and Lcb2p in a 1:1 stoichiometry. We addressed the oligomeric structure of yeast SPT to determine whether the enzyme is an Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer or some higher order structure, for example, a tetramer of homodimers. For these experiments, we generated HA-tagged Lcb1p and HA-tagged Lcb2p proteins. The tagged proteins were found to be functional because they complemented their respective knock-outs (see “Experimental Procedures”); thus, they associate to form active SPT. Untagged and HA-tagged Lcb1p or untagged and HA-tagged Lcb2p were coexpressed in cells, and the solubilized microsomal proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Lcb1p or anti-Lcb2p polyclonal antibodies. The untagged and HA-tagged Lcb1p and Lcb2p proteins could be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 5, lanes 4and 6). To address whether Lcb1p (and/or Lcb2p) could homodimerize, we investigated whether immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies would pull down only the tagged protein or both the tagged and untagged protein. Using the solubilized microsomes from the strain coexpressing HA-tagged and untagged Lcb1p, the anti-HA antibodies precipitated a complex containing the HA-Lcb1p and Lcb2p, but no untagged Lcb1p (Fig. 5, lane 1). This demonstrated that Lcb1p does not homodimerize, because none of the anti-HA-precipitated Lcb1p·Lcb2p complexes contained untagged Lcb1p. Using the same strategy with solubilized microsomes prepared from the strain coexpressing both untagged and HA-tagged Lcb2p (Fig. 5,lane 6), we also found that untagged Lcb2p does not coimmunoprecipitate with HA-tagged Lcb2p (Fig. 5, lane 3). Therefore, unlike the other α-oxoamine synthases, yeast SPT is a Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer. These immunoprecipitation data are consistent with the results of molecular exclusion sizing chromatography experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lcb1p and Lcb2p coeluted with an estimated molecular mass of 110 kDa (data not shown), in reasonable agreement with the predicted heterodimeric molecular mass of 124 kDa. We found that the HSN1 mutant Lcb1p proteins were stable (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3–5). Furthermore, although Lcb2p is unstable in the absence of Lcb1p (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A, lane 1), Lcb2p is present in each of the mutants indicating that the mutant Lcb1p proteins form stable heterodimers with Lcb2p. This was confirmed by showing that the mutant Lcb1p proteins coimmunoprecipitate with Lcb2p (data not shown). On the basis of the crystal structure of AONS and the alignment between AONS and Lcb1p, the residue in AONS Gly-74 that is analogous to Cys-180 of yeast (Cys-133 of human) Lcb1p resides at the interface between the subunits of the AONS homodimer. It is in close proximity to residues in the opposite subunit that are involved in catalysis, including the lysine residue of AONS that forms the Schiff's base with PLP (Fig. 2 B). This suggested that the mutations in Lcb1p might be affecting PLP binding. Indeed, Alexeev and coworkers (17Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Webster S.P. Sawyer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) noted that mutations in this region of AONS might alter the dimer structure and affect the geometry of the PLP binding site at the interface between the monomers to produce a loss of enzymatic activity. The AONS-V85 (Lcb1p-V191) residue is further from the interface, but mutations at this site may also alter the geometry of the PLP binding site by a long-range perturbation. By analogy to AONS, two residues in Lcb2p (Lys-366 and His-334) that are predicted to participate in PLP binding are expected to lie across the subunit interface from Cys-180 of Lcb1p. This is shown in a model of the central catalytic domain of the Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer that was generated using the crystal coordinates of the highly homologous AONS enzyme (Fig. 2 C). The Lys-366 residue of Lcb2p (predicted to form the Schiff's base with PLP) was replaced with threonine and His-334 (predicted to hydrogen-bond with O3′ of PLP) was replaced with phenylalanine, because these are the corresponding amino acids in Lcb1p (Fig. 2 A). We found that these mutations in Lcb2p also dominantly inactivated SPT activity similar to the HSN1-like mutations in Lcb1p. Centromeric plasmids carrying either theLCB2-K366T or the LCB2-H334F allele failed to rescue the PHS-requiring phenotype of an lcb2Δ mutant (data not shown). Assays of the microsomal SPT activity from these haploids confirmed that the mutations in LCB2 abolished SPT activity (Fig. 3 C). Introduction of the mutantLCB2 alleles into a haploidcsg2ΔLCB2+ strain suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 4 B) indicating that these mutant LCB2 alleles were dominant and reduced in vivo SPT activity. Coexpression of the wild-type and mutant Lcb2p proteins reduced in vitro SPT activity by about 50% (Fig.3 D). Furthermore, these Lcb2p mutant proteins were stable (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4) indicating that they retained their ability to heterodimerize with Lcb1p. Therefore, substitutions in the Lcb2p subunit of SPT that may disrupt PLP binding, but do not eliminate heterodimer formation, were also found to be dominant inactivating mutations. These studies clearly demonstrate that the HSN1-like substitutions in yeast Lcb1p catalytically inactivate SPT. Furthermore, mutations in predicted catalytic residues of the Lcb2p subunit that conferred similar phenotypes were also identified. The mutant Lcb1p and Lcb2p proteins retained their ability to associate with their partners to form catalytically inactive heterodimers. This suggests that there is no mechanism to up-regulate LCB1 and LCB2expression when SPT activity is low, because increased expression of the proteins would be expected to restore 100% SPT activity even if half of the heterodimers were inactive. However, it should be pointed out that it is not known whether the levels of Lcb1p and/or Lcb2p normally limit SPT activity. If a third protein limits SPT activity, then the dominant inactivation could result from its binding to the catalytically inactive heterodimers making it unavailable to optimally activate the functional heterodimers. In yeast the recently discovered Tsc3p protein that associates with Lcb1p·Lcb2p and stimulates SPT activity severalfold (20Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) is a candidate for a third protein that might limit SPT activity. The Lcb1p subunit lacks several of the catalytic residues that are conserved among the other α-oxoamine synthases, and this has led to the notion that Lcb1p might function exclusively as a regulatory subunit. On the other hand, it is well established that eukaryotic cells that lack Lcb1p have no SPT activity (24Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The recent identification of a bacterial SPT enzyme that is an Lcb2p homodimer (18Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) raised further questions about the role of Lcb1p and about the oligomeric structure of the eukaryotic enzyme. Although mammalian SPT was shown to consist of Lcb1p and Lcb2p in a 1:1 stoichiometry (23Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it remained possible that the oligomeric structure of the enzyme was higher order, for example a tetramer of Lcb2p and Lcb1p homodimers. The experiments presented here demonstrate that the native yeast enzyme is a heterodimer. In the AONS homodimer there are two symmetrical active sites that lie at the interface between the two monomers. In particular, the signature lysine-containing PLP-binding domain of one AONS monomer lies across the interface from the glycine-rich domain of the other monomer at each symmetrical active site. Because Lcb2p has the lysine-containing predicted PLP-binding domain whereas Lcb1p does not, it is likely that the Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer has a single active site. Modeling of the central catalytic domain of the Lcb1p·Lcb2p heterodimer suggests that the HSN1 substitutions in Lcb1p lie across the subunit interface from predicted PLP-binding residues of Lcb2p and may affect PLP binding. The cysteine residue lies in the conserved glycine-rich sequence that has been extensively mutagenized in the ALAS enzyme. On the basis of these studies, Ferreira and coworkers (25Gong J. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14109-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) concluded that this region of the ALAS enzyme was important for PLP binding and catalysis. As mentioned above, the crystal structure of AONS also provided evidence that this region is important in PLP binding (12Zhao C. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If, as the modeling studies suggest, the active site of SPT lies at the interface between the Lcb1p and Lcb2p subunits with residues in Lcb1p influencing PLP binding, then Lcb1p is not simply a regulatory subunit. Our characterization of the mutant proteins shows that the mutations do not grossly perturb the structures of the Lcb1p or Lcb2p subunits. The proteins are stable and retain their association with their partners. Bejaoui et al. (1Bejaoui K. Wu C. Scheffler M.D. Haan G. Ashby P. Wu L. de Jong P. Brown Jr., R.H. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) pointed out that the cysteine residue in human Lcb1p is in a potential consensus site forN-myristoylation and raised the possibility that the HSN1 mutations disrupt membrane association. However, this cysteine residue of yeast Lcb1p is not required for membrane association, because the mutant Lcb1p protein retains its association with the membranes. It would be surprising if the mutations in human Lcb1p were affecting membrane association, because they lie in the central domain of Lcb1p within a region that is conserved with the other soluble α-oxoamine synthases. Although this cysteine residue appears to be important for catalysis, it is unlikely that the sulfhydryl group participates directly in the catalytic chemistry, because the corresponding residue is a glycine in both AONS and ALAS. That the HSN1-like mutations in yeast Lcb1p are dominant inactivating mutations raises the possibility that the pathology associated with the HSN1 neuropathy might result from reduced rather than increased SPT activity. Because HSN1 is a dominant disease and lymphocytes from patients displayed increased levels of glucosylceramides, it was suggested that the mutations activate SPT and thereby increase ceramide, which in turn triggers apoptosis (2Dawkins J.L. Hulme D.J. Brahmbhatt S.B. Auer-Grumbach M. Nicholson G.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that the HSN1 mutations have opposite effects on yeast and human SPT activity, it seems unlikely, because the residues that are altered are in a particularly well-conserved region of Lcb1p and in a region of the protein that is known to be important for catalysis in other α-oxoamine synthases. It will be important to directly test the effect of expression of the HSN1-mutant Lcb1p proteins on SPT activity in mammalian cells to resolve this issue. If the HSN1 mutations do prove to dominantly inactivate mammalian SPT, the increased glucosylceramides could reflect an up-regulation of the glucosyltransferases in response to reduced SPT activity. All eukaryotic cells have sphingolipids, although the abundance and types of sphingolipids vary in different cell types. There is apparently a single LCB1 gene in humans. Therefore, regardless of whether the human mutations increase or decrease SPT activity, the HSN1 patients could have abnormal SPT activity in all their cells. However, little is known about the levels of SPT activity in different tissues and about how the enzyme is regulated. It may be that optimal SPT activity is not required for normal development and function of all types of cells and tissues. For example, the SPT deficiency may be most acute in neuronal cells, because they are especially dependent on normal sphingolipid synthesis. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the pathology of HSN1 results from altered lipid composition of the neuronal membranes that renders them more susceptible to damage, or whether the altered sphingolipid synthesis leads to an aberrant signaling process. It will be of interest to compare SPT activity and the lipid composition in various tissues from unaffected and HSN1-afflicted individuals. HSN1 is genetically heterogeneous with at least two loci (26Nicholson G.A. Dawkins J.L. Blair I.P. Kennerson M.L. Gordon M.J. Cherryson A.K. Nash J. Bananis T. Nat.

Hulme D.J. Brahmbhatt S.B. Auer-Grumbach M. Nicholson G.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Based on the results reported here, mutations that catalytically inactivate Lcb2p without compromising its ability to heterodimerize with Lcb1p, similar to those identified in this study, are likely to be found in HSN1 patients. The potential to alter SPT activity using the dominant mutant alleles of LCB1 and LCB2 should be useful for probing the functions of sphingolipids in higher eukaryotes. Studies in cultured cells and transgenic animals will provide the opportunity to establish how altered SPT activity influences the neural degeneration that accompanies HSN1.

Phosphorylation of keratins at specific sites affects their organization, assembly dynamics, and their interaction with signaling molecules. A number of keratin in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites have been identified. One example is K8 Ser-73, which has been implicated as an important phosphorylation site during mitosis, cell stress, and apoptosis. We show that K8 is strongly phosphorylated on Ser-73 upon stimulation of the pro-apoptotic cytokine receptor Fas/CD95/Apo-1 in HT-29 cells. Kinase assays showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was also activated with activation kinetics corresponding to that of K8 phosphorylation. Furthermore, K8 was also phosphorylated on Ser-73 by JNK in vitro, yielding similar phosphopeptide maps as the in vivo phosphorylated material. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that part of JNK is associated with K8 in vivo, correlating with decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate the endogenous c-Jun. Taken together, K8 is a new cytoplasmic target for JNK in Fas receptor-mediated signaling. The functional significance of this phosphorylation could relate to regulation of JNK signaling and/or regulation of keratin dynamics.

Furthermore, K8 was also phosphorylated on Ser-73 by JNK in vitro, yielding similar phosphopeptide maps as the in vivo phosphorylated material. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that part of JNK is associated with K8 in vivo, correlating with decreased ability of JNK to phosphorylate the endogenous c-Jun. Taken together, K8 is a new cytoplasmic target for JNK in Fas receptor-mediated signaling. The functional significance of this phosphorylation could relate to regulation of JNK signaling and/or regulation of keratin dynamics. Keratins constitute the largest group of the intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IFintermediate filamentcl-Acalyculin AJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseCHXcycloheximideFasRFas receptorK8/18keratin 8/18MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineTBSTris-buffered salineTNFtumor necrosis factorMBPmyelin basic proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseZ-VAD-FMKbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketonePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albumin protein family. Their expression is strictly tissue-specific; for example, keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are preferentially expressed in simple epithelia. Phosphorylation of keratins at specific sites affects their functional and assembly state and has been suggested to play a role in cell signaling (1.Ku N.O. Liao J. Chou C.F. Omary M.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the N-terminal Ser-33 on K18 enables a cell cycle-dependent interaction of K8/18 IFs with members of the 14-3-3 protein family, promotes depolymerization of K8/18 in vitro (2.Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and plays a role in the intracellular distribution of K8/18 polymers (3.Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1892-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). K8 is also phosphorylated upon activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (4.Baribault H. Blouin R. Bourgon L. Marceau N. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1665-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and by pro-urokinase stimulation (5.Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that K8/18 phosphorylation is elevated upon cell stress (6.Liao J. Lowthert L.A. Omary M.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin.

Drug-induced hepatotoxic stress, induced by feeding mice with a griseofulvin-supplemented diet, results in a dramatic K8/18 hyperphosphorylation (7.Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z. Broome R.L. Oshima R.G. Omary M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Drug-induced apoptosis in epithelial cells leads to phosphorylation of K18 on Ser-52 and a marked reorganization of K8/18. Pervanadate-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of K8 and -19 in a p38 kinase-dependent pathway has been reported recently (8.Feng L. Zhou X. Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2081-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured HT-29 cells, hyperphosphorylation of K8 at Ser-73 was associated with apoptosis induced by anisomycin or etoposide. The kinase regulating this site has not been identified, but members of the proline-directed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family have been suggested as candidates (9.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because Ser-73 is phosphorylated upon various stress conditions, it could be a putative target for the stress-activated MAPK family members. intermediate filament calyculin A c-Jun N-terminal kinase cycloheximide Fas receptor keratin 8/18 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphate-buffered saline Tris-buffered saline tumor necrosis factor myelin basic protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin The MAPK family is composed of the prototype kinase, the mitogen-activated MAPK/ERK, and the stress-activated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase. Both JNK and p38 kinase are involved in cellular responses to physical stresses, inflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis (10.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Among the most specific and physiological activators of JNK and p38 kinase are the death receptors, including the Fas receptor (FasR) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (13.Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). The FasR, belonging to the TNF receptor family, is a physiological activator of apoptosis in a wide range of cell types. A number of reports have shown that JNK is an integral part of FasR-mediated signaling, both when cells are sensitive and insensitive to FasR-mediated apoptosis (14.Abreu-Martin M.T. Palladino A.A.

JNK can be elicited through many of the following mechanisms in response to FasR activation: through the Daxx protein (16.Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), activation of JNK has been suggested to be independent of apoptosis, whereas in some other models, FasR-mediated apoptosis seems to require JNK activity. JNK was first identified as a kinase specific for phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun (22.Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Since then, a number of other substrates, predominantly transcriptional factors, have been established. These include Elk-1, ATF, p53, DPC4, NFAT4, and Sap-1 (23.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 24.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the possible cytoplasmic targets for JNK. In this respect, the neuronal intermediate filament neurofilament-H (NF-H) has been implicated as a JNK substrate, with phosphorylation at repeated Lys-Ser(P)-Pro-X-Glu motifs within the C-terminal domain (25.Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30404-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the this study, we wanted to elucidate the possible role of JNK in regulating K8/18 phosphorylation under physiological conditions, not involving unspecific stress. Therefore, we used stimulation of the FasR in HT-29 cells as a model, because in these cells FasR results in strong activation of JNK, without leading to apoptosis. By using this model, we observed that K8 is phosphorylated by JNK both in vitro and in vivo. K8 phosphorylation in vivo was observed after stress-mediated activation of JNK and following physiological JNK activation by stimulation of the FasR. The in vivo phosphorylation pattern of K8 follows the activation kinetics of JNK. Furthermore, JNK and K8/18 are associated with each other in vivo, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies. These results show that JNK participates in the regulation of K8/18 polymers. The association of JNK with K8/18 polymers may have a role in regulating JNK signaling and in adaptation to both environmental and physiological stresses.

Human HT-29 colon carcinoma cells and Jurkat T cells were obtained from American Type Cell Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium, respectively. The cell culture was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. For Fas stimulation experiments, cells were incubated with an agonistic anti-human FasR immunoglobulin M antibody (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. For combined treatment, cells were additionally treated with 10 nm cycloheximide (CHX). When indicated, cells were irradiated for 5 min with UV light or preincubated for 30 min with the irreversible general-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 μm), p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), or with the MKK1 kinase inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm). HT-29 cells (2 × 107/ml) were washed with PBS and harvested in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.6 m KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in dissasembly buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm Hepes, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) and sonicated on ice. It was centrifuged again at 70,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was dialyzed at 4 °C for 2 and 4 h against dialysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 0,2 mm PMSF, pH 7.4). Reassembled IF proteins (keratins 8 and 18) were stored at −70 °C. Cells (2 × 106/sample) were lysed with 400 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). For kinase immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was incubated with antibodies against JNK, coupled to protein A-Sepharose, and against ERK2 or p38, coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in RIPA buffer, three times in LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), and three times in JNK/p38 kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) and ERK kinase assay buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), respectively. The kinase reaction was carried out by adding to the immunoprecipitates 20 μl of kinase assay buffer, including 50 mmMgCl2, 25 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 μg of c-Jun GST protein (or 3 μg of GST-ATF or 3 μg of MBP as substrates). The reaction was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C and stopped with 3× Laemmli sample buffer (30% glycerol, 3% SDS, 0.19 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 0.015% bromphenol blue, 3% β-mercaptomethanol). The samples were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Quantification of phosphorylation of c-Jun, ATF, and MBP were carried out with a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). JNK was immunoprecipitated as described in the kinase activity assay from control and 9-h FasR-stimulated HT-29 cells. K8/18 protein preparations were used as a substrate and were boiled for 3 min to inactivate any endogenous kinase activity. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in kinase reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT) in the presence or absence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. This was followed by the addition of 3× Laemmli buffer to terminate the reaction. Phosphoproteins were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of phosphate groups into the substrate was quantified by using a MicroComputer Imaging Device (M4, Imaging Research Inc., Canada). For immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated substrates, the radioactive [γ-32P]ATP was omitted. For Western blotting, equal amounts of proteins were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking overnight at 4 °C with 1% BSA/PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or 1% BSA/TBS (Tris-buffered saline), membranes were probed at 22 °C for 1 h with the primary antibodies as follows: 1) LJ4-anti-pK8Ser-73 epitope (1:1000 in 0.1% BSA/PBS); 2) anti-K8/18 monoclonal antibody (1:5000 in 0.1% BSA/PBS); 3) anti-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 in 0.1% BSA/TBS, 0.1% Tween); 4) anti-p38 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 in 0.1% BSA/TBS, 0.1% Tween); 5) anti-c-Jun (1.500 in 1% milk/PBS, 0.1% Tween), washed three times with PBS or TBS containing 0.1% of Tween for 30 min, then incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (in dilutions recommended by supplier), and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Amplification of samples was performed using microcomputer imaging device. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, RIPA buffer cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 12 h at 4 °C with anti-JNK antibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose or to anti-K8, LJ4, or nodularin precoupled to protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed once with RIPA buffer and twice with PBS (3 m EDTA). Proteins were solubilized in 3× Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and without boiling and then immunoblotted as described above with the relevant antibodies. Keratins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, fixed in 50% methanol, dried, and autoradiographed. The corresponding K8 bands were cut out from the gels and digested twice (9 and 3 h) with trypsin (T-8642, Sigma, 10 μg/ml in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate) at 37 °C. The digested peptides were washed with sterile water and dried with a speed vacuum. The digested samples were separated on microcrystalline-cellulose TLC plates (Merck) in two dimensions. The first dimension utilized electrophoresis and the second utilized chromatography, followed by autoradiography. For mixing experiments, equal counts of in vivo and in vitromaterial was mixed and subjected for separation. To determine further the phosphorylation site of the phosphopeptide, manual Edman degradation was performed as described (52.Eriksson J.E. Toivola D.M. Sahlgren C. Mikhailov A. Härmälä-Braskén A.-S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 542-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Keratins have been shown to be hyperphosphorylated under various conditions, including heat stress, virus infection, and stress-induced apoptosis. To investigate whether this is true for death receptor-mediated signaling, we stimulated the FasR and followed the time course of K8 phosphorylation in HT-29 cells, which are insensitive to FasR-mediated apoptosis but can be sensitized to undergo apoptosis by CHX (14.Abreu-Martin M.T. Palladino A.A. Faris M. Carramanzana N.M. Nel A.E. Targan S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G599-G605PubMed Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were incubated with anti-FasR antibody alone or in combination with CHX at the indicated time points (Fig. 1A). A specific monoclonal antibody, LJ4, recognizing the phosphorylated Ser-73 on K8 was used, because this site is phosphorylated during heat shock and chemically induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells (9.Liao J. Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17565-17573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). K8 became hyperphosphorylated 3 h after FasR ligation, reaching a plateau of ∼7-fold activation at 9 h, then remaining elevated up to 24 h after FasR stimulation. This was not due to increased synthesis of K8, as the protein levels remained constant (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Combined treatment of anti-FasR and CHX for 6 h resulted in similar K8 phosphorylation, indicating that K8 phosphorylation upon Fas cross-linking occurs regardless if cells are undergoing apoptosis or not and indicating that there is no additive effect by the fact that the apoptotic machinery is triggered. Similarly, we observed a strong K8 phosphorylation when we subjected HT-29 cells to unspecific stress by exposure to UV light (compare 1st and 2nd lanes in Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of K8 and 18 is often accompanied by an increase in keratin solubility (2.Liao J. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26.Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27.Toivola D.M. Goldman R.D. Garrod D.R. Eriksson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test for this possibility, we prepared cell extracts from HT-29 cells and separated the pellet, containing insoluble keratins, and the supernatant, containing soluble keratins (see “Experimental Procedures”). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, no increase of K8-Ser-73 phosphorylation after FasR stimulation was detected in the insoluble keratin pool, even when cells were stimulated with UV light. On the contrary, hyperphosphorylation of K8 on Ser-73 upon FasR stimulation was observed in the pool of soluble keratins (Fig. 1A). This was further confirmed by an additional centrifugation of the soluble keratin pool at 200,000 × g for 1 h. In this assay, all long and short keratin filaments will be pelleted, whereas the truly soluble subunits stay in the supernatant. As shown in Fig. 1D, hyperphosphorylation of K8 on Ser-73 in response to FasR stimulation occurred preferentially in the soluble pool (3rd and 4th lanes), whereas this phosphorylation remained nearly invariable in the insoluble fraction. These results clearly demonstrated that the depolymerized subunits are the target for phosphorylation, and therefore, we have employed the soluble keratin pool for further investigations. JNK has been shown to be activated by FasR stimulation in many cell lines, both when cells are insensitive or sensitive to FasR-mediated apoptosis. (14.Abreu-Martin M.T. Palladino A.A. Faris M. Carramanzana N.M. Nel A.E. Targan S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G599-G605PubMed Google Scholar,28.Holmström T.H. Tran S.E. Johnson V.L. Ahn N.G. Chow S.C. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5991-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, JNK was an obvious candidate kinase for the FasR-induced K8 phosphorylation. We followed the activation kinetics of JNK after stimulation of the FasR in HT-29 cells. Parallel samples were taken from treatments described above (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Consistent with the results on K8 phosphorylation, both combined treatments of anti-FasR and CHX and UV light were able to activate JNK. The amount of JNK was confirmed by immunoblotting by using anti-JNK antibody that recognizes both the 46- and 54-kDa isoforms. A histogram of relative K8 phosphorylation and JNK activation (Fig. 2B) showed closely corresponding kinetics and levels of induction (Fig. 1C). Thus, it seemed plausible that JNK would be regulating the phosphorylation of K8 in response to FasR stimulation. If the hypothesis of JNK being a regulator of K8 is correct, JNK should also be able to phosphorylate K8 in vitro. We verified this by immunoprecipitating JNK from control cells and from cells 9 h after FasR stimulation. K8/18 isolated from HT-29 cells was used as a substrate for immunoprecipitated JNK. The autoradiograph in Fig. 3A (upper panel) shows an elevated phosphorylation of both K8 and K18 by Fas-activated JNK; however, the phosphorylation is significantly more pronounced on K8. Next, we examined whether this phosphorylation included K8 Ser-73. For that purpose, the preparation of isolated K8/18 was phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated JNK in the absence of [γ-32P]ATP and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the LJ4 antibody (Fig. 3A, middle panel). We could clearly see that the in vitro phosphorylation of K8 by JNK occurred on Ser-73, and this phosphorylation was markedly elevated upon FasR stimulation. Equal loading of K8/18 was confirmed by reblotting the same nitrocellulose membrane with anti-K8/18 antibodies (Fig. 3A, lower panel). To further substantiate that K8 is an in vivo JNK target, tryptic phosphopeptide maps of K8 immunoprecipitated from32P in vivo labeled HT-29 cells and of K8 phosphorylated by JNK in vitro were compared. Seven peptides (peptides 2–8) could be found in the maps of control cells and in those obtained from anti-FasR antibody stimulated cells (Fig. 3B), with enhanced activities primarily on peptides 3–8 (using peptide 2 as a reference). Peptides 9 and 10, which were absent in the control, appeared after FasR stimulation. Peptides 3 and 5–10 co-migrated with in vitro JNK phosphorylated K8. To identify which of these peptide(s) corresponded to Ser-73, manual Edman degradation was performed. Due to partial digestion, several peptides can potentially correspond to Ser-73. Ser-73 is located at position of 27 on its specific tryptic peptide (not shown), which makes it inaccessible for cleavage because Edman degradation is inefficient after 10 cycles. In the present study, 7 cycles of manual Edman degradation were done for each peptide. The peptides showing inducible phosphorylation, both in vivo and by JNK in vitro, and no phospholabel release within the 7 cycles was considered as phospho-Ser-73-containing peptides. Only peptides 3 and 10 met these criteria (Table I). Peptide 2, which was not inducibly phosphorylated and showed very little phosphorylation by JNK in vitro, was considered to be Ser-431. This assignment was based on its sequence context (i.e. inaccessible to manual Edman degradation, not shown) and by the use of anti-phospho-Ser-431 K8 antibody (3.Ku N.O. Liao J. Omary M.B.

Peptide 6, a major inducible site in vivo, corresponds to Ser-23 of the tryptic peptide 23SYTSGPGSR. Hence, our peptide mapping data support the assignment of K8 Ser-73 as a major in vivo phosphorylation site for JNK upon FasR stimulation.Table IManual Edman degradation of tryptic 32P-labeled K8 peptidesPeptide no.Edman degradation, label released on cycle number or remained on D (disc)Total no. cycles2D73D74No data752,3 and D761 and D772,3 and D783 and D793 and D710D7Tryptic peptides were extracted from the TLC plates used for peptide mapping (see Fig. 3B), immobilized on membrane discs, and subjected to seven Edman degradation cycles.

The variability of this emission from quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei can provide information on the size of the emitting regions and the physical process of fuelling the black hole. Some active galactic nuclei are variable at optical (and shorter) wavelengths, and display radio outbursts over years and decades. These active galactic nuclei often also show faster intraday variability at radio wavelengths3,4. The origin of this rapid variability has been extensively debated5, but a correlation between optical and radio variations in some sources6,7 suggests that both are intrinsic. This would, however, require radiation brightness temperatures that seem physically implausible, leading to the suggestion that the rapid variations are caused by scattering of the emission by the interstellar medium inside our Galaxy8,9. Here we show that the rapid variations in the extreme case of quasar J1819+3845 (ref. 10) indeed arise from interstellar scintillation. The transverse velocity of the scattering material reveals the presence of plasma with a surprisingly high velocity close to the Solar System."

https://openalex.org/W2022879400,"The cationic amino acid transporter, Cat-1, is a high affinity transporter of the essential amino acids, arginine and lysine. Expression of the cat-1 gene is known to be regulated by amino acid availability. It is shown here that cat-1 gene expression is also induced by Glc limitation, which causes a 7-fold increase in cat-1 mRNA, a 30-fold induction of Cat-1 protein levels, and a 4-fold stimulation of arginine uptake. Glc limitation is known to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR) by altering protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The studies here demonstrate that synthesis of Cat-1 occurs during the UPR when global protein synthesis is inhibited. The 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that is activated by amino acid starvation by a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, by the GCN2 kinase. It is shown here that translation from the cat-1/IRES is also induced by Glc deprivation in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α by the transmembrane ER kinase, PERK. Because PERK is a key constituent of the UPR, it is concluded that induction of cat-1 gene expression is part of the adaptive response of cells to ER stress.

These results also demonstrate that regulation of IRES activity in cellular mRNAs is part of the mechanism by which the UPR protects cells from unfolded proteins in the ER. Changes in the cellular nutrient supply cause changes in the transcriptional and translational regulation in many genes, including nutrient transporters, transcription factors, and amino acid biosynthetic genes (1.Fafournoux P.

However, the molecular events that activate these transcription factors during amino acid or Glc limitation are not known.We have previously shown that expression of the arginine/lysine transporter cat-1 gene is induced by amino acid availability (11.Hyatt S.L.

Amino acid starvation led to increased levels of cat-1mRNA and protein as well as increased high affinity transport of cationic amino acids (12.Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W.

Because the Cat-1 protein is synthesized during amino acid starvation when global protein synthesis decreases, we recently investigated the mechanism by which cat-1mRNA is translated (13.Fernandez J.

Translation from this IRES is activated during amino acid starvation in a process that requires phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) by GCN2 kinase (13.Fernandez J.

Levels of cat-1 mRNA and protein, as well as transport activity, were all increased by Glc limitation. Moreover, we demonstrate that translation from the cat-1/IRES is also increased in Glc-deprived cells.The detailed mechanism by which Glc limitation induces gene expression is not known (14.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). One effect of Glc limitation is altered protein glycosylation, which causes improper folding of newly made glycoproteins (3.Lee A.S. Trends Biol. Sci. 2001; 26: 504-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The accumulation of these proteins in the ER induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response that causes decreased protein synthesis and increased expression of genes that assist in protein folding in the ER. In yeast, Glc limitation induces the activation of the transmembrane serine/threonine protein kinase, Ire1p (5.Niwa M. Walter P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12396-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8.Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Ire1p activation results in transcriptional up-regulation of UPR target genes. In the mammalian UPR pathway, at least three different ER transmembrane kinases, IRE1α, IRE1β, and PERK, sense changes in protein folding in the ER lumen (14.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases regulates transcription of UPR-responsive genes. It also represses global protein synthesis and causes cell cycle arrest (8.Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar).This study demonstrates that translation from the cat-1/IRES is stimulated by Glc limitation via a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of eIF2α by PERK. These findings suggest that Glc deprivation activates cat-1/IRES-mediated translation as part of the adaptive response to ER stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression VectorsThe bicistronic mRNA expression vectors have been described previously (13.Fernandez J.

Expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant murine GCN2 were obtained from R. Wek (Indiana University). Mutant GCN2 contains a Lys618 to Met mutation in the kinase domain. Plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant PERK were obtained from D. Ron (New York University School of Medicine). Mutant PERK (PERKΔC) is missing the C-terminal kinase domain. All of these cDNAs were cloned into the XbaI/HindIII site of a derivative of pCDNA3 in which the neomycin resistance gene was replaced with a cDNA for the CD2 cell surface marker gene. In these expression vectors, the cDNAs are transcribed from the cytomegalovirus promoter.Cells and Cell CultureC6 glioma and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Similar results were obtained when the effects of Glc deprivation were examined in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. Cells were starved for amino acids as described earlier (13.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

The activities were normalized to the protein content of the cell extracts, which was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay. cat-1, asparagine synthase mRNAs, and 18 S ribosomal RNA were detected by Northern blotting using32P-labeled DNA hybridization probes.

PERKΔC and GCN2mut proteins were detected using anti-Myc and anti-FLAG peptide antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).[3H]Arginine Transport StudiesCells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/18-mm well, cultured in growth medium for 48 h, and then incubated under Glc-fed or -starved conditions prior to assay. Uptake of [3H]Arg was then measured as previously described (11.Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).RESULTScat-1 mRNA and Protein Levels Are Induced by Glc LimitationWe have previously shown that amino acid starvation regulates cat-1 gene expression at several different levels, causing increases in the amounts of cat-1 mRNA, protein, and transport activity (11.Hyatt S.L.

To determine whether other nutrients that cause cellular stress induce cat-1 expression, we examined the effects of Glc deprivation. First, the effect of Glc withdrawal on cat-1 mRNA levels was examined (Fig. 1A). cat-1mRNAs of 3.4 and 7.9 kb are found in cells, which result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites (16.Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29799-29806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Levels of both cat-1 mRNAs remained constant for the first 3 h of deprivation and increased thereafter, with a 7-fold increase seen after 6 h. As controls, we examined the levels of two other RNAs. Asparagine synthase (AS) mRNA levels are known to increase during Glc starvation (2.Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Pineda V.L. Nick H.S. Schuster S.M. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a finding that is confirmed by our results (Fig. 1A). The level of 18 S ribosomal RNA was measured to normalize for the amount of RNA analyzed. These results indicate that the level of cat-1 mRNA increases during Glc starvation as a response to this cellular stress.Next, the effect of Glc deprivation on the amount of Cat-1 protein was determined. Extracts from control and Glc-deprived cells were analyzed on Western blots using an anti-Cat-1 antiserum (Fig. 1B). The level of Cat-1 protein increased continuously during Glc deprivation; by 12 h, the level was 30-fold higher than in control cells (Fig. 1B). Finally, to determine whether the Cat-1 protein synthesized during Glc deprivation was functional, transport activity was assessed by measuring the uptake of [3H]Arg (Fig. 1C). Transport activity increased during Glc deprivation, showing a 4.5-fold increase by 12 h, the same increase caused by amino acid starvation (13.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that Glc deprivation increases cat-1 gene expression. mRNA levels increase, and this mRNA is translated into functional protein on the cell surface that is able to carry out the uptake of cationic amino acids.cat-1/IRES Activity Is Induced by Glc LimitationThe results in Fig. 1 suggest that cat-1 mRNA is subject to translational control because the Cat-1 protein/mRNA ratio increased 4-fold during Glc deprivation. Moreover, the absolute level of Cat-1 protein levels increased during Glc limitation, when global protein synthesis decreases. Translational control of cat-1mRNA under these conditions is likely, because we have previously shown that this mRNA contains an IRES sequence whose activity is stimulated by amino acid starvation, another type of cellular stress (13.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cat-1/IRES is also regulated by Glc limitation, we used a vector encoding a bicistronic mRNA containing two reporter genes, CAT and LUC (15.Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The CAT open reading frame is at the 5′-end of the mRNA, followed by a spacer and the LUC reading frame (Fig. 2). CAT translation is initiated from the 5′ cap of the mRNA. In contrast, LUC is translated only by initiation from the intercistronic spacer. Efficient LUC expression occurs only if the spacer contains an IRES sequence. We have previously shown that the 5′-end of the cat-1 mRNA contains an IRES element that can drive the translation of LUC in this bicistronic mRNA (13.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test the regulation of the cat-1/IRES during Glc limitation, C6 rat glioma cells were transiently transfected with a vector containing the cat-1 5′-UTR as the intercistronic spacer (13.Fernandez J.

Cells were then grown in medium with or without Glc for various times, and cell extracts were assayed for CAT and LUC activities (Fig. 2). LUC activity increased during Glc deprivation, reaching a peak at 9 h (4.5-fold increase) and then declining. Therefore, the activity of the cat-1/IRES increases during Glc deprivation. In contrast, CAT activity, which is due to cap-dependent translation of the bicistronic mRNA, decreased slowly during Glc deprivation. Fig. 2 also shows the effect of Glc deprivation on the LUC/CAT activity ratio. This ratio showed a time-dependent increase during Glc limitation, indicating that translation from the cat-1/IRES was stimulated during a time when global protein synthesis was declining. Interestingly, stimulation of the cat-1/IRES by Glc deprivation was reversible. When cells were incubated in Glc-free medium for 6 h and then returned to Glc-containing medium, CAT and LUC activities as well as the LUC/CAT ratio returned to control levels within 3 h (Fig. 2).Figure 2Stimulation of translation from the cat-1/IRES and not the BiP/IRES by Glc deprivation. C6 cells transfected with bicistronic mRNA expression vectors containing either the cat-1/IRES (CAT/cat-1 5′UTR/LUC) or the BiP/IRES (CAT/BiP/LUC) were cultured in either Glc-containing (9 h) or Glc-free media for the indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared, and LUC and CAT activities were measured.

Heikkila J.J. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BiP is the first mammalian mRNA shown to have an IRES in its 5′-UTR (15.Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with pSVCAT/BiP/LUC, which encodes a bicistronic mRNA containing the BiP IRES in the intercistronic spacer between the CAT and LUC open reading frames. As expected, Glc deprivation decreased CAT expression (Fig. 2), consistent with the inhibition of global protein synthesis caused by Glc deprivation. In contrast, LUC activity remained constant during Glc limitation. The LUC/CAT ratio increased slightly during Glc deprivation, due to the decreased CAT activity. These results demonstrate that translation from the BiP IRES is maintained, but not increased, during Glc deprivation when global protein synthesis decreases. These findings are consistent with our previous study of the effects of amino acid starvation on IRES activity (13.Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19.Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Translation from the cat-1/IRES was stimulated by amino acid starvation, but the BiP IRES was not affected. Note that the small increase in LUC/CAT at 9 h of glucose deprivation with BiP is a result of decreased cap-dependent translation (CAT) and not an increase in IRES-mediated translation (LUC). These results demonstrate that the activity of the cat-1/IRES is regulated by cellular stress using a mechanism that is not shared by IRES sequences of other cellular mRNAs.To characterize the effect of Glc deprivation on the cat-1/IRES, we examined the Glc concentration dependence of the increased translation (Fig. 3). Decreasing the Glc concentration to 1 mm had no effect on translation during a 9-h incubation. Further decreases in concentration stimulated translation from the IRES. The midpoint of the increase occurred at 0.05 mm, and the highest activity was seen in Glc-free medium. The concentration dependence supports the conclusion that the increase in translation from the cat-1/IRES is part of a physiological response to cellular stress.Figure 3Dependence of cat-1/IRES-mediated translation on Glc. C6 cells transfected with CAT/cat-1 5′-UTR/LUC were incubated in medium containing the indicated concentrations of Glc for 9 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and LUC and CAT activities were measured. Results were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Cells respond to Glc deprivation by activating the UPR, which affects protein synthesis. This pathway increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α, causing a decrease in ternary complexes and global inhibition of translation initiation (14.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). At the same time, translation of certain mRNAs increases via a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of eIF2α (20.Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether eIF2α phosphorylation is involved in the increased cat-1/IRES-mediated translation by Glc limitation. At least four kinases are known to phosphorylate eIF2α: GCN2, PERK, PKR, and HRI (21.de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). PERK is an ER protein that is regulated by unfolded proteins in the ER lumen. It has been suggested that Glc deprivation activates PERK by causing the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. It has also been suggested that Glc deprivation in yeast can activate GCN2 by causing the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs (22.Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To test whether these kinases are involved in the regulation of the cat-1/IRES by Glc deprivation, we examined the effects of dominant negative mutants of GCN2 and PERK. C6 glioma cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for bicistronic mRNA containing the cat-1/IRES along with expression vectors encoding wild-type or dominant-negative mutant kinases (23.Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative effect of the mutant kinases has been previously described (4.Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 23.Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinases were epitope-tagged, and their expression was monitored by Western blot analysis.In cells overexpressing wild-type PERK, Glc deprivation caused an increase in LUC translation from the cat-1/IRES (Fig. 4), similar to the response seen in cells that only contained endogenous PERK (Fig. 2). In contrast, in cells overexpressing the PERKΔC mutant, Glc deprivation did not cause an increase in the LUC level, indicating that PERK regulates translation of the cat-1/IRES. This effect was specific for PERK, because neither wild-type nor mutant GCN2 affected the regulation of CAT or LUC expression by Glc deprivation.Figure 4Induction of cat-1/IRES-mediated translation by Glc deprivation is dependent on PERK kinase.

They are involved in various pathophysiological processes leading to acute and chronic disease states (1Humphries J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1,1αLβ2, CD11a/CD18) belongs to the β2 integrin subfamily and is constitutively expressed on all leukocytes. LFA-1 is involved in leukocyte extravasation into tissue and T cell costimulation (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 3Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Several studies underscore the importance of LFA-1 in the pathophysiology of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (e.g. ischemia/reperfusion injury (4Martin X. Da Silva M. Virieux S.R. Hadj Aissa A. Buffet R. Tiollier J. Dubernard J.M. Transplant Proc. 2000; 32: 481Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (5Birner U. Issekutz T.B. Walter U. Issekutz A.C. Int.

Transplantation. 1996; 62: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The major ligands of LFA-1 are three members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, intercellular adhesion molecules 1, 2, and 3 (ICAM-1, -2, and -3, respectively) (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). Central to ligand binding by LFA-1 is an inserted domain of 200 amino acids at the N terminus of the αL subunit, the so called I domain (8Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Bio. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This LFA-1 I domain is highly homologous to I domains displayed on other integrin α subunits (9Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of I domains reveal that they adopt a dinucleotide-binding fold and contain a cation binding site designated the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). There is strong evidence that the metal ion of the MIDAS is coordinated by an acidic residue from ICAM and thus directly participates in ligand binding (9Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The LFA-1 I domain is inserted between the β sheets 2 and 3 of a seven-bladed putative β-propeller region on the αLsubunit (10Huang C. Springer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that integrin β subunits contain regions structurally homologous to the I domains, the so-called I-like domains (9Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 11Xiong Y-M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The existence of such I-like domains was recently confirmed by the crystal structure of the extracellular segment of the integrin αVβ3 (12Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The I-like domain of the LFA-1 β2 subunit is predicted to contact the putative β propeller of the αL subunit near β sheets 2 and 3 (13Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the I-like domain has a regulatory role rather than a direct role in ligand binding (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As described for other integrins, the ligand binding activity of LFA-1 is tightly regulated (1Humphries J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 311-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hogg N. Leitinger B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar). LFA-1 is expressed on leukocytes in an inactive state and can be rapidly activated by cations or by intracellular signals (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 15Hogg N. Leitinger B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor clustering and conformational changes are proposed to be the major mechanisms by which LFA-1 is converted from a low to a high affinity form (15Hogg N. Leitinger B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies provide strong evidence that in particular the C-terminal helix of the I domain plays an important role in the activation process. It has been recently demonstrated that LFA-1 can be locked in an open ligand binding and a closed nonbinding conformation by mutational introduction of disulfide bonds between the C-terminal helix and a central β sheet of the I domain (16Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The positions of the disulfide bonds were modeled according to the crystal structures of Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) and VLA-2 (α2β1, CD49b/CD29) I domains. These I domains have been crystallized in two conformations, which differed by a major shift in the positioning of the C-terminal helix (17Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 18Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfectants expressing mutant LFA-1 with alanine or tryptophan substitutions in the C-terminal helix region of the I domain show impaired or constitutively active binding to ICAM-1 (19Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The importance of this region in controlling LFA-1 activity is further underlined by the fact that small molecule LFA-1 inhibitors bind to a hydrophobic pocket between the C-terminal helix and the central β-sheet of the LFA-1 I domain, termed the lovastatin binding site (L-site) (20Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This pocket has been also termed the I domain allosteric site (IDAS) by others (19Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5231-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The first compound described to interact with the L-site was the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin (20Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Only recently it became evident that compounds of diverse chemical classes, including hydantoin and cinnamide derivatives, utilize the same pocket for inhibition of LFA-1 (22Last-Barney K. Davidson W. Cardozo M. Frye L.L. Grygon C.A. Hopkins J.L. Jeanfavre D.D. Pav S. Qian C. Stevenson J.M. Tong L. Zindell R. Kelly T.A. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2001; 44: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Since the L-site is distant from the MIDAS, it is thought that these compounds inhibit LFA-1 via an allosteric mechanism (20Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J.

Fesik S.W. von Geldern T.W. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, molecular details of this inhibition in the context of the whole receptor are unknown. Similarly, the molecular details of the natural activation process are not well understood. Addressing both molecular mechanisms, LFA-1 activation and inhibition, is the objective of this study. Here we investigate the effect of small molecule LFA-1 inhibitors on the LFA-1 I domain, the putative β-propeller region, and the β2 I-like domain using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) mapped to these different regions of the receptor. We show that the inhibitors induce epitope changes in the I-domain, the I-like domain, or both domains depending on their chemical structure and binding site. For the first time we establish the I-like domain on the β2 subunit as a molecular target for LFA-1 inhibition. Moreover, utilizing the native LFA-1 receptor, as compared with mutated LFA-1 studied previously (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we provide strong evidence for a functional relationship between the I domain and the I-like domain, which is induced upon activation. LFA-1 was purified from JY cells as described earlier (20Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat.

Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) conjugate and Alexa Fluor®488 goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) conjugate were purchased from Molecular Probes. Goat anti-human IgG-Fc fragment was purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). All other assay reagents were bought from Sigma. Jurkat E6–1 and HUT78 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% Glutamax I, and 1% nonessential amino acids. LFA-1 inhibitors were tested in a LFA-1-ICAM-1 ELISA-type binding assay, which was performed as previously described (20Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were coated with 2–10 μg/ml purified human LFA-1 and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h. After a washing step, compounds dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% fetal calf serum, pH 7.4 (assay buffer), were added to the plates. After 15 min of incubation, ICAM-1-mCκ in assay buffer (4 μg/ml) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After several washing steps, SPOD diluted 1:5000 in assay buffer was added and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. After the removal of unbound SPOD by washing, ICAM-1-mCκ was quantified using 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as substrate. The binding of biotinylated anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 mAbs to purified LFA-1 was investigated in the presence of the LFA-1 inhibitors. The compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and serially diluted with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.5% fetal calf serum, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). The inhibitors were added to LFA-1-coated and blocked microtiter plates (see above). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, biotinylated anti-LFA-1 mAbs in assay buffer (0.1 μg/ml) were added and incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 30 min. Then the plates were washed, and SPOD was added, diluted 1:5000 in assay buffer. After 35 min at room temperature and a washing step, bound anti-LFA-1 mAbs were quantified using 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. For experiments in the absence of cations, the immobilized LFA-1 was washed three times with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, and PBS containing 0.5% BSA and either 0.1 or 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was used as assay buffer. Purified Mac-1 was immobilized at 2–10 μg onto 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and serially diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.2% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). The compounds were added to the Mac-1-coated plates. After a 15-min incubation, biotinylated ICAM-1-mCκ in assay buffer (2 μg/ml) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After four washing steps with assay buffer, SPOD diluted 1:5000 in assay buffer was added and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. After washing, bound ICAM-1-mCκ was quantified using 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. The binding of the anti-CD18 mAb IB4 to purified Mac-1 was tested in the presence of LFA-1 inhibitors dissolved in Me2SO and diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.2% nonfat dry milk, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). The compounds were added to the microtiter plates coated with Mac-1 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then biotinylated mAb IB4 was added (0.1 μg/ml) in assay buffer. After a 30-min incubation, bound antibodies were detected by the streptavidin-peroxidase reaction as described above. LFA-1-dependent adhesion of HUT78 cells to immobilized ICAM-1-Fc, ICAM-2-Fc, and ICAM-3-Fc fusion proteins was carried out as described earlier for the HUT78/ICAM-1-mCκ assay (21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with goat anti-human IgG-Fc fragment in PBS, pH 7.8 (5 μg/ml), followed by a blocking step with 1.5% BSA in TBS. After washing with TBS, ICAM-1-Fc, ICAM-2-Fc, or ICAM-3-Fc were added at 0.1–0.3, 0.3, or 1 μg/ml, respectively, in TBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.5% BSA, 5 mm glucose, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2 (assay buffer). 3′-O-Acetyl-2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-4 or 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetoxy-methyl ester-labeled HUT78 cells (1.25 × 105 cells/well) in assay buffer were transferred to the plates and incubated together with the inhibitors at 37 °C for 30 min. The plates were then gently washed with assay buffer, and bound cells were quantified by measuring fluorescence using a VICTOR2 microplate reader (Wallac). The effect of the LFA-1 inhibitors on the conformation of cell-expressed LFA-1 was tested by monitoring the binding of anti-LFA-1 mAbs to Jurkat E6–1 cells using flow cytometry. Jurkat E6–1 cells were harvested and washed two times with TBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). For experiments in the absence of cations, cells were washed three times with TBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and the assay buffer was replaced by TBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. 3 × 105 cells were preincubated with the LFA-1 inhibitors at a final concentration of 50 μm in assay buffer at room temperature for 20 min followed by the addition of anti-CD11a and anti-CD18 mAbs (1–2 μg/ml). After a 25-min incubation, cells were washed two times with assay buffer and counterstained with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) conjugate or Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rat IgG (H + L) conjugate diluted 1:175 in assay buffer for 30 min. After a washing step, antibody binding was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Control experiments at low temperatures were performed as described above except that the antibody binding steps were carried out on ice. Mean fluorescence intensities (geometric mean) were calculated using the CellQuest software. Mean fluorescence intensities were corrected for background staining by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensities of the appropriate isotype-matched negative control. Mean fluorescence intensities of the solvent controls were set as 100%. Inhibition of anti-LFA-1 mAb binding induced by inhibitor treatment was expressed as a percentage of these controls. The NMR binding assay was performed as previously described (21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1H,15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer (Bruker AG, Karlsruhe) at 23 °C. Uniformly 15N-labeled αL I domain was titrated with increasing amounts of ligand dissolved in Me2SO. The protein concentration was 100 μm, and the maximal ligand concentration varied between 200 and 600 μm depending on the ligand. The change in the15N resonance frequency for the cross-peak corresponding to the amide group of Thr291 was followed for a qualitative assessment of the binding affinity. For the assessment of compound binding to the αM I domain, one-dimensional1H spectra of the isolated Mac-1 I domain were recorded. The αM I domain (residues 131–321) was first cloned into a pET9a vector using standard molecular biology procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The protein was expressed as His-tagged fusion protein and purified using nitrilotriacetic acid and size exclusion chromatography. The N-terminal His tag was thereafter cleaved from the purified protein using thrombin. Table I summarizes the properties of small molecule LFA-1 inhibitors of two different chemical classes. Lovastatin and the optimized statin-derived LFA-1 inhibitors LFA703 and LFA451 blocked ICAM-1 binding to purified immobilized LFA-1 with IC50 values of 2.1, 0.2, and 0.04 μm, respectively (Table I). The inhibitors not only interfered with the LFA-1/ICAM-1 but also with the LFA-1/ICAM-2 and LFA-1/ICAM-3 interaction as shown in T cell adhesion assays (Table I). ICAM-3-mediated adhesion was more potently inhibited by the compounds than ICAM-1- and ICAM-2-mediated adhesion (Table I). This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that LFA-1 binds to ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 stronger than to ICAM-3 (26De Fougerolle A.R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The IC50 values determined for the LFA-1 inhibitors in the HUT78/ICAM-1 adhesion assay were found to be similar to IC50 values determined in an ICAM-1 adhesion assay utilizing the human lymphoma cell line Jurkat (data not shown). Jurkat/ICAM-2 or Jurkat/ICAM-3 adhesion assays were not performed. As shown by NMR spectroscopy, the inhibitors were able to interact with the L-site of the αL I domain (Table I). A close analogue of the statin-derived inhibitors, pravastatin, does not inhibit LFA-1 function and has only marginal affinity for the αL I domain (Table I). This compound was included in the study as a negative control (Table I).Table ICharacterization of LFA-1 inhibitors and a dual LFA-1/Mac-1 inhibitor in different assaysThe ELISA-type LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding assay (LFA-1/ICAM-1) measures the binding of purified immobilized LFA-1 to recombinant biotinylated ICAM-1. The adhesion assays (HUT78/ICAM-1, -2, -3) quantify the adhesion of the human T cell lymphoma cell line HUT78 to immobilized ICAM-1, -2, and -3. Binding of the compounds to the LFA-1 I domain was quantified by NMR.

A unique property of the statin-derived LFA-1 inhibitors is their specificity for LFA-1. The function of other integrins including the β2 integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) was not affected by the compounds (Table I). In contrast, a small molecule LFA-1 inhibitor recently described by others was less specific (32Fotouhi, N., Gillespie, P., Guthrie, R. W., Pietranico-Cole, S. L., and Yun, W. (2000) International Patent Application WO 00/21920Google Scholar). This inhibitor, which we term here XVA143, is a peptidomimetic with an unknown LFA-1 binding site (32Fotouhi, N., Gillespie, P., Guthrie, R. W., Pietranico-Cole, S. L., and Yun, W. (2000) International Patent Application WO 00/21920Google Scholar). XVA143 inhibited LFA-1 and Mac-1 with IC50 values of <20 nm (Table I). Based on the presence of a carboxylic acid function in the structure of XVA143 (Table I), it could be speculated that the inhibitor binds to the MIDAS pocket of the I domain of LFA-1 and Mac-1. Thus, the binding of XVA143 to both the LFA-1 and Mac-1 I domain was qualitatively assessed using NMR. In general, I domain binding of lovastatin and some close derivatives are associated with large chemical shift changes in protein spectra of the αLI domain (21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These changes are observed for many residues of the central β-sheet as well as helices α7 and α1, indicating ligand-induced structural rearrangements in solution (21Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The same was observed for the statin-derived inhibitors LFA703 (Fig. 1 A) and LFA451 (not shown) at equimolar concentrations of protein and ligand. In contrast, XVA143 influenced the protein spectra to a lesser extent even at high concentrations (Fig. 1 B). We note that none of the residues associated with the LFA-1 MIDAS motif was affected by XVA143, ruling out the possibility that inhibition of LFA-1 is mediated by competitive bi"

To find new cis-elements for this induction, transient expression assays were performed using a reporter gene driven by serially truncated gp91phox promoters in U937 cells. The results suggest that a critical cis-element for induction exists in the region from bp −115 to −96 of the promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that a γ-activated sequence (GAS) element at bp −100 (−100GAS) of the gp91phox promoter plays a pivotal role for the IFN-γ-dependent activity of the bp −115 to +12 region of the gp91phox promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using several GAS competitors and specific antibodies indicated that phosphorylated STAT-1α specifically binds to the −100GAS. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) at bp −88 (−88ISRE) mediates the induction of the gene by IFN-γ in cooperation with −100GAS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that IRF-1 dominantly binds to −88ISRE in an IFN-γ-dependent fashion.

Borregaard N. Simons E. Wright J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1983; 62: 286-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The gp91phox gene is expressed almost uniquely in differentiated myeloid cells (5Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Baehner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The human gp91phox promoter from bp −450 to +12 directs the transcription of a reporter gene in a subset of mouse monocytes/macrophages in transgenic mice (6Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Eosinophils, in particular, express gp91phox in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (7Kuribayashi F. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Nakamura M. Matsumoto T. Tsuji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the expression of the gp91phox gene is both lineage- and differentiation stage-specific. Transcription of the gp91phoxgene is also modulated by inflammatory mediators such as interferon (IFN)-γ,1 tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide in myeloid cells (8Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A. Whitney C. Wright J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Cassatella M.A. Hartman L. Perussia B. Trinchieri G. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although enhancer elements for the expression of gp91phox gene in mature myeloid cells have been suggested to be in a 50-kbp region located upstream of a transcription start site of the gene (10Lien L.L. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), principalcis-regulatory elements are clustered in a 450-bp proximal promoter region of the gene. Several transcription factors regulate gp91phox gene expression through these cis-elements. A transcriptional repressor, CCAAT displacement protein (CDP/cut), binds to multiple sites in the proximal promoter in immature myeloid cells (11Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol.

Coincident with induction of gp91phox gene expression, the binding activity of CDP to these binding sites decreases during differentiation of the cells (11Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J.

Blood. 1999; 93: 519-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the induction of the gp91phox gene is prevented by the constitutive overexpression of CDP in a myeloid cell line (13Lievens P.M. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, CDP itself disappears in the maturation course to peripheral monocytes and macrophages (14Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Coccia E.M. Mantovani R. Testa U. Battistini A. Blood. 1999; 93: 519-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although general transcriptional activators such as those with increased binding during differentiation, like (BID)/YY1, CCAAT box-binding factors, CP1, and NF-Y, bind to the promoter, these factors can work only after CDP has been released because their binding sites overlap those for CDP (12Luo W.

Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-2 also activates the gp91phox promoter through two interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the absence of CDP binding (15Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G.

PU.1 works as a pivotal transcription factor of the gp91phox gene by binding a PU.1/hematopoietic-associated factor (HAF)-1-binding element centered at bp −53 in human neutrophils, monocytes, and B-lymphocytes (18Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HAF-1 is a multiprotein complex, and its components are still not defined, but PU.1, IRF-1, ICSBP, and Elf-1 are picked out as candidates (19Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). IFN-γ is a cytokine that plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immunities (23Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). IFN-γ binds to the specific cell surface receptor and activates the receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. The kinases phosphorylate and activate a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, STAT-1α, which is then translocated to the nucleus as a transcriptionally active homodimer (γ-interferon activation factor) and binds to the γ-activated sequence (GAS) element of IFN-γ-responsive genes resulting in their activation (24Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). IFN-γ also induces gp91phox gene expression, coinciding with monocytic differentiation of committed progenitors (9Cassatella M.A. Hartman L. Perussia B. Trinchieri G. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and increases gp91phox transcription in mature monocytes ex vivo(8Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A. Whitney C. Wright J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Two positive regulation mechanisms for the IFN-γ-induced transcription of the gp91phox gene have been proposed. One mechanism is the binding of BID/YY1 to the four binding sites that are scattered in a region from bp −90 to −355 of the promoter after dissociation of CDP from the gene (15Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jacobsen B.M. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29984-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other is the binding of an undefined multiprotein complex of HAF-1 to the PU.1/HAF-1-binding element centered at −53 of the promoter (19Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that STAT-1α bound to the GAS element at bp −100 of the gp91phox gene has an unequivocal role in IFN-γ-induced transcription of the gene. We further show that IRF-1 participates in the STAT-1-mediated transcription through binding to the ISRE at bp −88 of the gene. These results suggest a new mechanism for IFN-γ-induced transcription of the gp91phox gene in which STAT-1α and IRF-1 cooperate with each other. U937 cells (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, Tokyo) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. The cells were either untreated or treated with 100 units/ml human IFN-γ (kindly provided by Shionogi Corp., Osaka, Japan) for the indicated periods. Total RNA was prepared from cells with Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA (5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-containing 0.9% agarose gels, transferred to HybondTM-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences Inc.), and fixed by ultraviolet light. A probe of 2.9 kb of human gp91phox cDNA (2Faizunnessa N.N. Tsuchiya T. Kumatori A. Kurozumi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kanegasaki S. Nakamura M. Hum.

Messenger RNAs were hybridized with these labeled probes. The hybridization patterns were visualized, and the relative radioactivity of each band was estimated on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Constructs p−487/Luc and p−301/Luc were prepared by the exonuclease III deletion method (27Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) from pGV-5635/Luc, which had the fragment of the gp91phox gene extending from its initiation codon to upstream bp −5635. Constructs p−267/Luc, p−115/Luc, p−95/Luc, and p−84/Luc were prepared using the PCR method using pGV-267/Luc which had the fragment of the gene extending from its initiation codon to upstream bp −267 as the template as described previously in detail (21Yang D.

A mutant of GAS (p−115GASm/Luc) with a two-point mutation (TC to AG) from the bp −103 to −102 and a mutant of ISRE (p−115IRFm/Luc) with a five-point mutation (AGGG to TCCC) from bp −87 to −84 were prepared from p−115/Luc by PCR using a mutated primer. U937 cells (5 × 106) were electroporated at 950 microfarads and 280 V in a 4-mm gap cuvette containing 10 μg of gp91phoxpromoter/firefly luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter/Renilla luciferase plasmid in 0.25 ml of 20 mm Hepes/RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7.2) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). After a 15-min incubation on ice, the cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2, 95% air for 5 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum with or without 100 units/ml IFN-γ. Reporter activities were measured as described previously (18Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were swollen in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol/CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I and II (Sigma)). After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were lysed in 0.6% Nonidet P-40 by vigorous vortexing for 10 s. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm (1,700 × g) for 1 min, supernatants were discarded, and precipitated nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Mixture/Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I and II). Nuclear extracts were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (18,000 ×g) for 5 min at 4 °C and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Preparation of the double-stranded oligonucleotide probes and EMSAs were performed as described previously (18Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6085-6090Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In competition assays, a 100-molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added prior to the addition of the probe to the mixture, which was then preincubated on ice for 15 min. For the inhibition assay with antibodies, an aliquot of nuclear extracts was incubated on ice with 2–4 μg of the indicated antibody for 1 h before the addition of the probe. Bound and free DNA were separated by electrophoresis in a native 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.4× TBE buffer (36 mmTris, 36 mm boric acid, and 8 mm EDTA (pH 8.3)) at 4 °C. Sequences of the upper strands of double-strand oligonucleotides are as follows. Mutated bases are underlined and names used in the text are indicated in bold: W-107A (−107 to −85), 5′-AATTTCTGATAAAAGAAAAGGAA-3′; W-107B (−107 to −65), 5′-AATTTCTGATAAAAGAAAAGGAAACCGATTGCCCCAGGGCTGC-3′;W-115 (−115 to −90), 5′-TATTAGCCAATTTCTGATAAAAGAAA-3′;GASmut (−115 to −90), 5′-TATTAGCCAATTGATGATAAAAGAAA-3′; W-102A (−102 to −65), 5′-CTGATAAAAGAAAAGGAAACCGATTGCCCCAGGGCTGC-3′;W-102B (−102 to −73), 5′-CTGATAAAAGAAAAGGAAACCGATTGCCCC-3′; IRFmut (−102 to −73), 5′-CTGATAAAAGAAAAGTCCCCCGATTGCCCC-3′;BIDmut (−102 to −73), 5′-CTGATAAAAGAAACTGAAACCGATTGCCCC-3′; W-95 (−95 to −65), 5′-AAGAAAAGGAAACCGATTGCCCCAGGGCTGC-3′. The following four oligonucleotides are GAS elements used as competitors (28Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar):GAS/IFP (GAS site from the IFP53/tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase promoter), 5′-TCACCCAGATTCTCAGAAACACTT-3′;GAS/GBP (GAS site from the guanylate-binding protein promoter), 5′-AGTTTCATATTACTCTAAATC-3′; GAS/SIE (GAS site in the c-fos cis-inducible element), 5′-ATTCAGCAGTTCCCGTCAATCCCT-3′; GAS/GRR (GAS site from the Fcγ receptor I promoter), 5′-GATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAGG-3′. Additional oligonucleotides as competitors used in this study are as follows: a heterogeneous competitor (Hetero), 5′-CACAACCACATTCAACCTCTGCCACC-3′; IRF-1 cons (IRF-1 consensus binding site), 5′-ACGGATCCGGCATATTCAAAACCGAAACCAAGTCCCTCGAGAC-3′ (29Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) were used in immunoassays as follows: murine monoclonal antibodies against STAT-1p84/p91 (C-136), STAT1αp91 (C-111), and Tyr-701-phosphorylated STAT-1 (A-2), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IRF-1 (C-20), IRF-2 (C-19), and ISGF-3γ/p48 (C-20), and goat polyclonal antibodies against ICSAT that is also designated PU.1 interaction partner, lymphoid-specific IRF (ISIRF), or IRF-4 (M-17), and ICSBP (C-19). Western blot analysis was carried out using standard methods (30Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tokita K. Ochiai H. Nakamura M. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (24 μg of protein) were mixed with an equal volume of 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 4.6% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gel were transferred onto an ImmobilonTM polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry type electroblotting apparatus (model BE-300, Bio-Craft, Tokyo, Japan). The protein-blotted polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, photographed, and destained with methanol. The membranes were pretreated with Block Ace (Yukijirushi Co., Sapporo, Japan) containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with TBS (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween) and then incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-IRF-1 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or nonimmunized rabbit IgG in TBS/Tween containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the membrane was washed with TBS/Tween and incubated with 1/2500 diluted anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed extensively with TBS/Tween and then rinsed with TBS. The antigen antibody complexes were detected using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done on data from at least three independent experiments by Student's t test. We analyzed the time course of gp91phoxmRNA levels in human promonocytic U937 cells after addition of 100 units/ml IFN-γ by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the amount of gp91phoxmRNA increased ∼4.5-fold within 5 h and reached its maximal level (∼7.5-fold) at 48 h after the addition of IFN-γ as demonstrated in previous studies (8Newburger P.E.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429PubMed Google Scholar, 25Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Eklund E.A. Kakar R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for IFN-γ induction of the gp91phox gene were focused on the later phase of induction (at 24–48 h after the addition of IFN-γ). In this study, we focused on the early phase of IFN-γ induction of the gp91phox gene because the changes in this phase are the most pronounced. The bp −450 to +12 fragment of the gp91phox promoter directs IFN-γ-inducible transcription in a stably transfected PLB-985 myeloid cell line (25Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initially prepared a p−487/Luc construct that contains the gp91phox gene fragment from bp −487 to +12 in front of a luciferase reporter gene and transiently transfected it with the reference plasmid pRL-TK into promonocytic U937 cells. The reporter activity of the cells was assessed following treatment with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 5 h and was compared with that of untreated transfectants (Fig. 2). Reporter activity of the p−487/Luc was induced 8.2 (±0.6)-fold by IFN-γ treatment and reached levels 12 times higher than that of the control, untreated wild-type p−115/Luc, indicating that the bp −487 to +12 region of the gp91phox promoter directs transcriptional induction of the gene by IFN-γ in U937 cells. To determine regions responsible for the IFN-γ induction in the bp −487 to +12 fragment of the gp91phox promoter, five serial deletion constructs were generated from the p−487/Luc construct. Progressive 5′ deletions from bp −487 to −116 still retained both a high inducibility and high relative promoter activity in response to IFN-γ treatment (compare p−301/Luc, p−267/Luc, and p−115/Luc with p−487/Luc). The removal of an additional 20-bp fragment from bp −115 to −96 remarkably reduced the IFN-γ-dependent inducibility and the activity of the promoter (compare p−95/Luc with p−115/Luc), suggesting that a pivotalcis-element(s) for IFN-γ induction lies within the region from bp −115 to −96 of the gp91phox promoter. Although bp −95/Luc and bp −84/Luc showed significantly higher activity than that of pXP2N, their inducibilities were not significantly different from that of pXP2N. Therefore, further deleted constructs were not analyzed.Figure 2Identification of a region for IFN -γ-induced activation of the gp91phox promoter in U937 cells. Luciferase reporter constructs containing serially truncated gp91phox promoter are illustrated on the left. These constructs were transfected into U937 cells incubated with (I) or without (N) IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 5 h. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized by accompanied activities of the co-transfectedRenilla luciferase reporter gene (see “Materials and Methods”). Each column and bar in thecenter graph are the relative means of three or four independent data sets and S.E., respectively. The activity ofp−115/Luc N was set to 1. Fold induction was calculated as the ratio of relative luciferase activity of IFN-γ-treated samples to that of the untreated sample and is shown as the mean ± S.E. on the right. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze binding of protein complexes to the bp −115 to −96 region, we prepared nuclear extracts from U937 cells at various times after the addition of 100 units/ml IFN-γ, and we performed EMSAs with the fragment from bp −107 to −85 (W-107A in Fig.3) as a probe. As shown in Fig.4, binding of a protein complex (shown by an arrow) to the probe was induced within 1 h of stimulation with IFN-γ (Fig. 4 A) and could be continuously detected over the entire 48 h after the IFN-γ addition (Fig.4 B). The binding of this protein complex to the probe was specific because the binding was abolished by an excess of homologous competitor (Ho), with a sequence identical to that of the probe, but not by an excess of heterogeneous competitor (He), with a sequence completely different from that of the probe (Fig. 4 B). To identify the DNA-binding protein complex, we searched for an element possibly recruiting a certain transcription factor in the region from bp −107 to −85 of the gp91phox promoter. As shown in Fig. 3, the bp −104 to −96 region of the gene (5′-TTCTGATAA-3′, −100GAS) perfectly conforms to the GAS element at bp −137 of the human MHC-II transactivator CIIA (5′-TTCTGATAA-3′) (31Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Otten L.A. Steimle V. Mach B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and was present in the region from bp −115 to −96, which was shown to be important for the IFN-γ-induced gp91phox promoter activity in the functional assay (Fig. 2). Therefore, we focused on GAS-binding proteins and did further experiments. We examined the effect of mutations in the −100GAS element for the binding of this protein complex to the W-107A probe using a fragment from bp −115 to −90 (W-115 in Fig. 3) and a −100GAS mutant version of W-115 (GASmut in Fig. 3) as competitors. As shown in Fig. 5, the binding of this protein complex (shown by an arrow) was abolished by the W-115 competitor (lane 4) but not by the GASmut competitor (lane 5), indicating that the −100GAS element is essential for binding of the protein complex to the W-107A probe. Previous studies (32Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 33Lee Y.J. Benveniste E.N. J.

Differentiation-induced factor (DIF) also binds to GAS elements of several IFN-γ-induced genes such as the Fcγ receptor I (FcγR) in U937 cells after the addition of IFN-γ (28Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine whether either one or both factors bind to the −100GAS of the gp91phoxpromoter in the IFN-γ-treated U937 cells, we performed EMSAs using IFP GAS and GBP GAS as common competitors to both STAT-1α and DIF and FcγRI GAS and c-fos SIE GAS as specific competitors to STAT-1α (28Eilers A. Baccarini M. Horn F. Hipskind R.A. Schindler C. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1364-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, binding of the protein complex to the W-107A probe was abolished by all four GAS competitors (lanes 6–9), suggesting that this protein complex includes STAT-1α but not DIF. To confirm the binding of STAT-1α to the −100GAS, we performed gel shift immunoassays using three different anti-STAT-1 antibodies (Fig. 5) as follows: an anti-STAT-1 antibody specific for both STAT-1α and STAT-1β (l"

Operating in parallel with Sec-type systems in these membranes, the Tat system is completely different in both structural and mechanistic terms, and is uniquely able to catalyze the translocation of fully folded proteins across coupled membranes. TatC is an essential, multispanning component that has been proposed to form part of the binding site for substrate precursor proteins. In this study we have tested the importance of conserved residues on the periplasmic and cytoplasmic face of the Escherichia coliprotein. We find that many of the mutations on the cytoplasmic face have little or no effect. However, substitution at several positions in the extreme N-terminal cytoplasmic region or the predicted first cytoplasmic loop lead to a significant or complete loss of Tat-dependent export. The mutated strains are unable to grow anaerobically on trimethylamine N-oxide minimal media and are unable to export trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA). The same mutants are completely unable to export a chimeric protein, comprising the TorA signal peptide linked to green fluorescent protein, indicating that translocation is blocked rather than cofactor insertion into the TorA mature protein.

Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Working in parallel with the well characterized Sec pathway, the Tat system uses an entirely different mechanism and has the unique ability to transport fully folded proteins across coupled membranes (3Clark S.A.

In general, it appears to be used primarily for the transport of proteins that are either obliged to fold prior to translocation, or which fold too tightly or rapidly for the Sec system to handle. Prime examples of substrates in Escherichia coli are a range of periplasmic proteins that acquire redox cofactors in the cytoplasm before export, such as FeS and molybdopterin centers (5Berks B.C.

These proteins must fold to a large extent in the cytoplasm, precluding export by the Sec machinery which is known to translocate proteins in a largely unfolded state (reviewed in Ref. 7Manting E.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Of the latter two components, TatA is more important than TatE, possibly due to a much greater abundance (16Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Additional tat genes have not been identifed to date and a complex of 600 kDa comprising only TatA, -B, and -C has been recently purified from solubilized E. coli membranes (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, the activity of this complex has yet to be tested and the existence of further Tat subunits cannot be ruled out at this stage. Sequence analyses and biochemical analyses of the Tat subunits indicate that TatA, -B, and -E contain a single transmembrane span with a small C-terminal domain exposed on the cis face of the membrane (i.e. the cytoplasm in bacteria, or stroma in chloroplasts (11Settles M.A. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)), whereas TatC is predicted to contain 6 transmembrane regions with the N and C termini localized in the cytoplasm. There is convincing evidence that the N terminus of TatC is indeed in the cytoplasm since a TatBC fusion protein is active (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and the N terminus of the TatC domain is linked to the C terminus of TatB in this construct. The N-terminal domain of chloroplastic TatC is, furthermore, exposed on the stromal face of the thylakoid membrane (18Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We presently know little about the mechanism of the Tat system but the first details on the organization of the complex are starting to emerge. In E. coli, it was shown that TatB and TatC form a structural and functional unit in a 1:1 ratio within the Tat complex, and a translational fusion between the proteins was shown to be fully functional (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Studies on the thylakoidal homologs of these proteins, Hcf106 and cpTatC (19Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that these proteins likewise function together and it was also shown that these proteins are very likely to form the initial binding site for the docking of Tat-dependent precursor proteins. However, the important elements of the TatC protein have yet to be defined and in this study we have addressed this point through a mutagenesis study. We show that two cytoplasmic domains are highly important for the function ofE. coli TatC. E. coli strain MC4100 (20Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBAD-ABC has been described before (22Bolhuis A. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). E. coli was aerobically grown at 37 °C in modified low salt Luria broth (lsLB) (23Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown anaerobically in lsLB-GT medium, consisting of lsLB supplemented with glycerol (0.5%), trimethylamineN-oxide (TMAO; 0.4%), and ammonium molybdate (1 μm), or in minimal TMAO/glycerol medium (22Bolhuis A. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Media supplements were used at the following final concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG); 200 μm arabinose. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to generate a vector that encoded the tat operon within pBAD-ABC with point mutations in thetatC gene, using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis system (Strategene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For studies on the effects of these mutations on green fluorescent protein (GFP) export, these tatABC sequences were removed from pBAD-ABC using NheI and XbaI, and cloned into the pEXT22 vector (25Dykxhoorn D.M. St. Pierre R. Linn T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using the XbaI site, generating pEXT-ABC and mutant derivatives which are compatible with pJDT1 encoding TorA-GFP (see text below). Cells were grown aerobically (in lsLB) or anaerobically (in lsLB-GT) in medium in the presence or absence of IPTG or arabinose (as stated in the text), and periplasm and spheroplasts were prepared by the EDTA/lysozyme/cold osmoshock procedure (26Randall L.L. Hardy S.L.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 27Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Spheroplasts were lysed by sonication, and intact cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (5 min at 10,000 × g). Membranes were separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation (30 min at 25,0000 ×g). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA-linked assay (Pierce). Protein fractions were either separated on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed for TorA activity (6Santini C.-L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with specific antibodies to GFP (CLONTECH) and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG conjugates, using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). An alignment of several bacterial TatC proteins and the chloroplast TatC from Arabidopsis thaliana is shown in Fig. 1, with the predicted membrane-spanning regions shaded and identical residues denoted by asterisks. The figure also illustrates 9 residues (alsoshaded) that are conserved in at least 30 of the 31 bacterial and plastid TatC sequences available in the data base. The predicted topology of the protein is illustrated in Fig.2. Given that chloroplast TatC appears to play a role in binding of precursor proteins, we reasoned that a cytoplasmic domain(s) in TatC may mediate this process in E. coli.Figure 2Predicted topology of E. coliTatC. The diagram shows the 6-span topology of the E. coli TatC protein predicted using the TopPred II algorithm (32Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl.

A few conserved residues are present in the transmembrane spans, but these were not examined in this study. The extreme cytoplasmic N-terminal region and the (predicted) first cytoplasmic loop, in particular, contain a range of conserved charged residues; these are indicated as cytoplasmic domains 1 and 2 (CD1 and CD2) in Fig. 1. These are more highly conserved than is immediately apparent because Arg or Lys is present at the positions corresponding to Arg104 and Arg105 in every other bacterial/plastid TatC sequence, with the exception of Odontella sinensis and Staphylococcus aureus, which lack one of the basic residues in these positions. Plant mitochondrial TatC proteins likewise contain only a single basic residue at these positions in some cases. Arg is present at the position corresponding to Arg17 in all but four of the 31 TatC sequences, where Lys is present instead. The significance of these residues was tested using site-specific mutagenesis. As detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” we mutated the tatC gene within the tatABC operon in the arabinose-inducible pBAD24 plasmid (plasmid pBAD-ABC), and expressed this vector in a ΔtatABCDE background. The TatC protein encoded by this plasmid contains a C-terminal Strep II tag which does not affect activity, and expression of pBAD-ABC in this background leads to efficient Tat-dependent export (22Bolhuis A. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The targeted residues are shown in bold in the alignment in Fig. 1 and their predicted positions are illustrated in Fig. 2. Most of the mutations were to Ala but Glu15 and Glu103 were changed to Gln. The reason for this strategy was that these residues were considered as candidates for binding the positively charged twin-arginine signal peptide of TorA, and we sought to remove the negative charge but retain the side chain properties as far as possible. The mutant TatC proteins were expressed after induction with arabinose and their levels were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to TatA, TatB, and the Strep II tag on TatC. Fig.3 shows a representative immunoblot of cell extracts from approximately half of the mutants, which illustrates that the various strains all contain similar levels of Tat components, indicating that the tatABC operon is induced to similar extents. Similar findings were made using the other mutants (data not shown). When induced in this manner, the pBAD24 system leads to an about 10-fold overproduction of TatABC (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) which means that the Tat components are effectively present in excess. The effects of the mutations on Tat-dependent export were assessed using several criteria as explained below. A standard means of assaying for Tat-dependent export in E. coli is to test for anaerobic growth on TMAO minimal media (11Settles M.A. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 12Walker M.B. Roy L.M. Coleman E. Voelker R. Barkan A. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The periplasmic molybdopterin-containing protein TMAO-reductase (TorA) is a known Tat substrate (6Santini C.-L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11Settles M.A. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) andtat mutants are accordingly unable to grow using TMAO as an electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration. It should be emphasized, however, that this assay selects only for a complete lack of functional Tat system. Null mutations in tatAE, tatB, ortatC are completely unable to grow but we found that the pBAD-ABC plasmid in the ΔtatABCDE strain supported anaerobic growth even without induction, when levels of TatABC were almost undetectable (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Bolhuis A. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Clearly, even very low levels of the Tat apparatus are sufficient to support growth on TMAO minimal medium. Table I shows the results of this analysis, together with a summary of the export capabilities of these strains (see below). In fact, our results show that very few of these highly conserved residues are essential for Tat function, and the majority of these strains grow at normal rates. However, substitution of either Arg17 led to a complete loss of growth, suggesting an important function of this (predicted) cytoplasmically exposed region as shown in Fig. 2. In view of the apparent importance of the CD1 region we tested the effects of deleting Leu20to Asn22, and this mutant (Δ20–22) was again completely unable to grow under these conditions.Table IExport characteristics of E. coli TatC mutantsMutantAnaerobic growthTorA exportGFP exportWild-type++++++++++++H12A++++++++++++L13A++++++++++++E15Q++++++++++++L16A+++++++++R17ANoneNoneNoneR19A++++++++++++L20A+++++++Δ20–22None+NoneP48A+NoneNoneK73A+++++++++++P97A+++++++++++L99A++++++++++++E103Q++++++++++++R104A++++++++++R105A+++++++++Y154S+++++++++L178A++++++++++++G182A+++++++++++The Table details the effects of the TatC mutations on anaerobic growth on TMAO minimal media, and summarizes the data shown in Figs. 4 and 5on the localization of TorA and the export of TorA-GFP.

Open table in a new tab The Table details the effects of the TatC mutations on anaerobic growth on TMAO minimal media, and summarizes the data shown in Figs. 4 and 5on the localization of TorA and the export of TorA-GFP. Export/growth capabilities are shown on a scale of “none” to ++++ (wild-type levels) and +/++/+++ represent export abilities that approximate to 25/50/75% of wild-type. Perhaps surprisingly, a series of other highly conserved residues are not essential for Tat function. His12, Glu15, and Arg19, for example, are all present in cytoplasmic domain 1 and are essentially invariant throughout bacterial and plastid TatC sequences, yet their substitution by Ala (or Gln in the case of Glu15) has no detectable effect. In cytoplasmic domain 2, while substitution of Arg104 does inhibit growth, substitution of Arg105 by Ala has no detectable effect on growth even though a basic residue is present at this position in the vast majority of bacterial and plastid TatC sequences (although this mutant is affected in export of torA-GFP; see below). Even more surprisingly, Pro97 is one of the few invariant residues but its substitution again fails to impair anaerobic growth. Relatively few residues on the periplasmic side were targeted for mutagenesis in this study, but it is notable that substitution of Pro48blocks growth entirely, suggesting an important function for this residue. To analyze more directly the consequences of thetatC mutations, we next analyzed the distribution of a known Tat substrate, TorA, in cells expressing the various mutant forms. This was achieved using native gels in which the TorA activity is visualized directly in the polyacrylamide gel, using a methyl viologen-linked assay. Fig. 4 shows that the vast majority of active TorA is localized in the periplasm in wild-type cells expressing the pBAD-ABC vector (pBAD-ABC panel) as shown previously (22Bolhuis A. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results obtained with the mutant strains, in general, agree with the data from the anaerobic growth analysis. ThosetatC mutants that fail to grow anaerobically (R17A, Δ20–22, and P48A) are also unable to export TorA and the activity is found almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction. The cytoplasmic TorA has a reduced mobility in this gel system (denoted TorA*), possibly due to the presence of the presequence but more likely due to other effects on folding or binding to other factors, since the presequence is small compared with the 86-kDa mature protein. In the case of R17A, no activity whatsoever is evident in the periplasmic fraction, confirming the central importance of this residue. With Δ20–22, a very low proportion of the TorA activity is apparent in the periplasmic fraction but the vast majority of TorA is again present as the cytoplasmic species. In general, this assay should be more sensitive than the anaerobic growth test and Tat-dependent export defects are indeed more apparent in other cases. The L20A mutant, in particular, exhibited slow growth on TMAO miminal media but Fig. 4 shows that the TorA export is in fact drastically affected with most of the activity present in the cytoplasm. Accumulation of the cytoplasmic TorA* species is also evident with two other mutants, L16A and R105A. Both residues are in the conserved cytoplasmic domains and, in the case of R105A as discussed above, a charged residue is highly conserved among bacterial TatC proteins. These mutations do, therefore, affect TatC function. As a final test we examined the export of a chimeric protein comprising the presequence of TorA linked to GFP. Previous studies (23Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Santini C-L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have shown this construct to be exported exclusively by the Tat pathway and GFP represents a much simpler export substrate than TorA, because it does not acquire an additional cofactor before export. Another important point is that the export of this protein is examined over a much shorter time scale. One disadvantage of the TorA assay is that only steady-state levels can be analyzed, and this can mean that defects in the TatC operation can be masked because the cells have sufficient time to export the protein even when the Tat system is functioning suboptimally. In contrast, the TorA-GFP is rapidly induced at fairly high levels, after which the Tat system is expressed and the cells are fractionated within a few hours. Under these conditions, effects on export rates are more likely to be apparent. (Ideally, the GFP would be analyzed using pulse-chase techniques which give a much better picture of the export kinetics. However, we have been unable to apply this technique to GFP export because the immunoprecipitation is ineffective, for unknown reasons.) To examine the export of this construct, we used a growth regime in which expression of the TorA-GFP was induced by arabinose, after which the ΔtatABCDE cells were washed and incubated with IPTG to induce expression of the tatABC operon from the pEXT22 plasmid. The localization of the GFP was monitored by immunoblotting. Fig. 5 shows that expression of the wild-type tatABC operon (pEXT-ABC panel) results in export of the TorA-GFP and the vast majority of the GFP is found in the periplasmic fraction (lane P) as the mature form. Essentially no TorA-GFP is apparent in the membrane fraction (M) and very little mature-size GFP is apparent in the cytoplasmic fraction (C). Previous work on the export of this construct (23Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) also found that the cytoplasmic GFP was primarily mature-size, presumably due to proteolysis of the signal peptide. Otherwise, the results obtained using the tatC mutants closely resemble those obtained from the TorA analysis. Export of TorA-GFP in the R17A, Δ20–22, and P48A mutants is drastically affected and the majority of GFP is found in the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. Export is also affected in the R104A and R105A mutants, confirming the importance of this conserved domain. The one surprise is L20A, which exports torA-GFP with high efficiency, yet which fails to export TorA except at low levels. The reason for this finding is currently under study. These data are summarized in TableI. In this report we have aimed to provide a first dissection of theE. coli TatC protein to begin mapping the important regions. The TatC family is in fact remarkably poorly conserved in terms of primary sequence, and the actual sequence data provide very few clues as to its role in Tat-dependent protein export. This lack of sequence conservation is all the more surprising given the highly conserved nature of the translocation mechanism as well as the targeting signals that are recognized by this system. For example, chloroplast thylakoids can recognize and import E. coli Tat substrates as efficiently as those of their cognate substrates (29Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,30Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11405-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While the precise role of TatC still requires detailed study, the available data indicate that (a) it functions together with TatB (or Hcf106 in chloroplasts) and (b) it may form part of the initial binding site for precursor proteins (17Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Relatively few TatC residues are invariant even among eubacteria and in this study we have mutated the majority of conserved residues located in either the cytoplasmic or periplasmic loop regions. In fact, many of these mutations have no drastic effect on TatC function, although it must be stressed that kinetic analyses on export rates may reveal minor effects that are not evident from the types of analysis used here. However, it is notable that a high proportion of these highly conserved residues are located in the two cytoplasmic domains described in this report, and we have now shown that mutations in several of these residues lead to an absolute block in Tat function. None of the mutations affect Tat subunit stability to any detectable extent, and we therefore propose that these data point to the presence of two essential cytoplasmic domains in the TatC protein. Of course, it is possible that these two areas of the protein function together as a single functional domain. We emphasize that the data do not indicate how these domains function and, while they may well form a critical binding site for incoming precursor proteins, it is also possible that these mutations destabilize the TatABC complex and hence affect translocation in a more indirect manner. These data now pave the way for more detailed studies on the roles of the individual domains in TatC function. A recent report (31Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) has described an in vitro assay for Tat-dependent import into inverted E. coli inner membrane vesicles, and studies on the thylakoid system (19Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have shown that Tat substrates can bind to the Tat complex under appropriate conditions. It should therefore be possible to use such techniques to determine in detail the function of individual residues and domains in TatC, in terms of either substrate binding or the subsequent translocation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2089590188,"Reactive oxygen species are proposed to work as intracellular mediators. One of their target proteins is the α subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (Gαiand Gαo), leading to activation. H2O2 is one of the reactive oxygen species and activates purified Gαi2. However, the activation requires the presence of Fe2+, suggesting that H2O2 is converted to more reactive species such as ·OH. The analysis with mass spectrometry shows that seven cysteine residues (Cys66, Cys112, Cys140, Cys255, Cys287, Cys326, and Cys352) of Gαi2 are modified by the treatment with ·OH. Among these cysteine residues, Cys66, Cys112, Cys140, Cys255, and Cys352 are not involved in ·OH-induced activation of Gαi2. Although the modification of Cys287 but not Cys326 is required for subunit dissociation, the modification of both Cys287 and Cys326 is necessary for the activation of Gαi2 as determined by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, conformation-dependent change of trypsin digestion pattern or guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding. Wild type Gαi2 but not Cys287- or Cys326-substituted mutants are activated by UV light, singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and nitric oxide, indicating that these oxidative stresses activate Gαi2 by the mechanism similar to ·OH-induced activation.

O2⨪ is generated by NADPH oxidase of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and is then converted to H2O2 and O2 by superoxide dismutase. The resultant H2O2 is further converted to ·OH, a very reactive ROS, in the presence of Fe2+. Several groups report that the increase in H2O2 was observed by stimulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor or epidermal growth factor receptor as measured with a fluorescent probe 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (3Bae Y.S.

The increase in H2O2 by platelet-derived growth factor receptor stimulation requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and is possibly mediated by PI3K/Rac/NADPH oxidase pathway (3Bae Y.S.

The increase in H2O2 was also observed by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors such as angiotensin II (5Zafari A.M. Ushio-Fukai M. Akers M. Yin Q. Sha A. Harrison D.G. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (6Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol.

The generated H2O2 is found to inactivate protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) by modifying the cysteine residue located at catalytic moiety (8Lee S-R. Kwon K-S. Kim S-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). However, the analysis of PTP-1B from H2O2-treated cells revealed that the cysteine residue of PTP-1B is not sulfenic acid- but glutathione-conjugated cysteine (9Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34543-34546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cysteine residue of PTP-1B is at first modified by H2O2 and then reacts with glutathione. This modification of cysteine leads to the inactivation of phosphatase activity of PTP-1B. Thus, the increase in H2O2 indirectly changes the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation state on the tyrosine residue of proteins implicated in signal transduction (10Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). ROS can also be generated upon pathophysiological conditions. For instance, ROS are generated in a large amount on ischemia/reperfusion and can influence many intracellular signaling processes (11Cuzzocrea S. Riley D.P. Caputi A.P. Salvemini D. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 135-159PubMed Google Scholar). Because the inclusion of superoxide dismutase mimics or antioxidant attenuates the cellular injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion, the prevention and mechanism of ROS generation is critical for the understanding of ischemia/reperfusion injury. The treatment with H2O2 is frequently used for mimicking oxidative stress such as ischemia/reperfusion, since H2O2freely enters cells like H2O (1Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 2Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The treatment with H2O2 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) such as ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK and promotes or inhibits cellular injury (12Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the treatment of rat neonatal myocytes with H2O2 activates Gi and Go in a receptor-independent manner, leading to the increased activity of ERK (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of Gi and Go activation by H2O2 is still not clear, especially about the modified amino acids. We demonstrate in the present study that H2O2 is converted to more reactive species in the presence of Fe2+ and modifies specific cysteine residues that exist only in Gαi and Gαo. The modification of two cysteine residues results in subunit dissociation of Gi and increase in GTPγS binding. [35S]GTPγS, [32P]NAD, and [35S]methionine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen. Plasmid pTZ-18R and Mono Q column (HR5/5) were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system was from Promega. A O 2⨪generator (KO2) and PMSF were purchased from Sigma, and a singlet oxygen generator (EP-1) and a NO generator (NOC13) were synthesized as described (14Aubry J.M. Cazin B. Duprat F. J. Org. Chem. 1989; 54: 726-728Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Harbie J.A. Klose J.R. Wink D.A. Keefer L.K. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 1472-1476Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-specific ERK or Akt antibodies were from Promega or New England Biolabs, respectively. pTrcHisB was from Invitrogen. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) were from Millipore. PTX was from Invitrogen. Gαi2 was purified by a similar method to Lee et al. (16Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Six histidine residues were added to the amino terminus of rat Gαi2 by PCR and inserted into NheI andHindIII sites of pTrcHisB. The resulting Gαi2was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLys by induction of 30 μmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 16∼18 h at 30 °C. The Escherchia coli extract was prepared with freeze-thawing in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF. After centrifuging at 18,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin. The resin was sequentially washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. The Gαi2 was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 150 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. The fractions containing GTPγS binding activity were pooled, diluted, and applied to Mono Q column. After washing with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, Gαi2 was eluted with a linear gradient of 100∼300 mm NaCl. Although purified Gαi2 showed a single band on Coomassie staining, the final purity of Gαi2 was 20∼30% based on the comparison of protein content with [35S]GTPγS binding activity. This purity was almost the same as the value reported by Lee et al. (16Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Substitution of cysteine with serine residues was performed with QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis method with Pfu DNA polymerase. The resultant Gαi2 mutants (KpnI site at the 5′-end andHindIII site at the 3′-end) were inserted into pTZ-18R.In vitro transcription/translation was performed by the method of Shiina et al. (17Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using the TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system. TPCK-treated trypsin (50 μg) was added to each sample (2.5 μl of sample) in a final volume of 30 μl and incubated for 10 min at room temperature (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After that, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The purified Gαi2 was treated by 100 μmH2O2 in the presence of equimolar amount of FeSO4 for 10 min at 30 °C. The treated Gαi2 was precipitated by the addition of acetone and dried. The Gαi2 was digested by TPCK-treated trypsin using the method of McIntire et al. (18McIntire W.E. Dingus J. Schey K.L. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33135-33141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The separation and analysis of the digested Gαi2 were performed according to the method of McIntire et al. (18McIntire W.E. Dingus J. Schey K.L. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33135-33141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE) and high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (Finnigan LCQ) were performed on tryptic digests of unmodified and ·OH-treated Gαi2. Gαi2 (50 μg) was treated with trypsin (1:50 w/w) in ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5, overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were separated over a Zorbax C18 column (1 × 150 mm) with a linear gradient from 5% A (H2O, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) to 70% B (acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) over 90 min at a flow of 25 μl/min. One set of samples contained 2-mercaptoethanol (M r 78.1) during H2O2 treatment, and a second set of samples did not but were quenched with N-acetylcysteine (M r 163.2). Gαi2was first treated by one of ROS, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm N-acetylcysteine. UV light was irradiated 1 cm apart from the sample with a handheld UV lamp (wavelength of 365 nm) for 10 min on ice. Then, [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαi2 was performed in buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 nm [35S]GTPγS, 1 μm GDP. The reaction was stopped by dilution with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, collected on nitrocellulose filter, and the filters were washed three times with same solution. Gαi2 that bound [35S]GTPγS was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. The activation of Gαi2 was assessed by the conformation-dependent difference of digestion pattern of Gαi2 by TPCK-treated trypsin (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled in vitro translated WT- or Ser-substituted Gαi2 were treated with H2O2 in the presence or absence of FeSO4 and quenched by the addition ofN-acetylcysteine. H2O2-treated Gαi2 was digested for 10 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. Then the radioactive Gαi2was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and identified by an Image analyzer Fuji-BAS 2000. PTX (100 μg/ml) was preactivated by incubation with 1 mm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C. The purified Gαi2(50∼100 ng) was combined with 300 ng of Gβγ purified from bovine brain and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 7 μg/ml PTX and 0.3 μm [32P]NAD in the same solution as GTPγS binding reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS sample loading buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Neonatal myocytes were prepared from 0–1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats according to the method described by Nishida et al. (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Neonatal myocytes were plated at 1 × 106 cells per each of 6 wells, treated with deferoxamine at the concentration and length indicated in Fig.7, and then treated with H2O2. Activation of ERK and Akt was determined by Western blot with anti-phospho-specific ERK or Akt antibodies. The experiments were repeated at least three times and are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with t-test. Because H2O2 is easily converted to a more reactive species, ·OH, by the Fenton reaction in the presence of Fe2+, we first examined whether H2O2 directly or indirectly acts on Gαi. The addition of a Fe2+ chelator (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 1 μm) completely inhibited the activation of recombinant Gαi2 by H2O2 (Fig.1 A). In contrast, treatment with ·OH generated from H2O2 in the presence of Fe2+ increased [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαi2 in a concentration-dependent manner. This result indicates that H2O2 is converted to ·OH before it reacts with Gαi2. The enhanced GTPγS binding to Gαi by H2O2 in the previous report reflected contaminating Fe2+ in solution that helped generate ·OH from H2O2. Therefore, all buffers used in the subsequent experiments were deionized by passing through a Chelex column. The half-life of ·OH is very short (μs to ms). Therefore, ·OH may further convert to other radical species by reacting with H2O or some components in the solution. However, ·OH is used in the present report for simplicity. Many reports show that modification of proteins by ROS occurs largely on Cys and Met (19Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 20Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that the activation of Gαi2 with ·OH (1 μm) was almost completely reversed by treatment with dithiothreitol. This result suggests that the modification of Gαi2 by ·OH occurs on Cys. Furthermore, pretreatment for 20 min with dimethylthiourea (100 μm), an inhibitor of cysteine oxidation, completely inhibited the activation of Gαi2 by ·OH (data not shown). These results indicate that ·OH activates Gαi2 by modifying cysteine residues. When physiological sulfhydryl compound glutathione was used for quenching the reaction, glutathione also supported the ·OH-induced activation of Gαi2 (Fig. 1 C). This action of glutathione was specific for the ·OH-induced activation, since the activation of Gαi2 by mastoparan was not affected by the inclusion of glutathione. The extent of activation by ·OH in the presence of glutathione is essentially the same as that by ·OH in the presence ofN-acetylcysteine. To examine which cysteine residues were modified by ROS, we analyzed ·OH-treated Gαi2 with mass spectrometry (Fig.2). Mass spectrometric analysis showed that 7 cysteine residues were modified, Cys66, Cys112, Cys140, Cys255, Cys287, Cys326, and Cys352, as summarized in Table I and a supplemental table. The reaction was quenched by the addition ofN-acetylcysteine (Table I) or 2-mercaptoethanol (supplemental table), and the molecular weights of these sulfhydryl compounds are 163.2 or 78.1, respectively. Therefore, the molecular weight of ·OH-treated and trypsin-digested Gαi2 was increased by 161.1 or 76.1 when the fragment contained the modified cysteine residue (Table I and the supplemental table). Mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic products yielded 71% coverage of the Gαi2 sequence, all of which was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. The only peptides not observed were the large amino-terminal tryptic peptide, a large central peptide (residues 212–243), and several very small tryptic peptides. No other significant modifications were observed with the exception of oxidation of some methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide (supplemental table). The extent of methionine oxidation was very low (3–13%) during 300 μm H2O2 treatment in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and slightly higher (up to 50%) during 1 mm H2O2treatment in the presence of N-acetylcysteine. It should be noted that the extent of cysteine modification after these treatments was nearly stoichiometric (Table I and the supplemental table). The extents of modification were calculated from areas under the selected ion plots of modified and unmodified peptides. The alignment of Gα proteins shows that Cys255, Cys287, and Cys352 are conserved in the αi family and that Cys140 and Cys326 are found in αi, αq, and αs (Fig.3). In contrast to these cysteine residues, Cys66 and Cys112 exist only in αi.Table ISummary of Gαi2 modificationsObserved M r(Da)Predicted M r(Da)1-aAverage mass reported.SequenceModification% Modification1579.61579.755–671655.21655.755–67Cys-66 +7687.41740.21740.755–67+161872577.62578.0106–1291-bNo sequence data acquired.2653.42654.0106–129Cys-112 +761002738.62739.0106–1291-bNo sequence data acquired.+16176.41459.81459.7131–1431535.81535.7131–143Cys-140 +76941621.81620.7131–143+16185NO1615.8130–1431-bNo sequence data acquired.1691.61691.8130–143Cys-140 +76100NO1776.7130–1431-bNo sequence data acquired.+1611053.41053.2250–2581129.41129.2250–258Cys-255 +761001215.01214.2250–258+1611001982.81983.3279–2962058.82059.3279–296Cys-287 +761002143.72144.3279–296+1611003238.93239.6279–3073315.63315.6279–307Cys-287 +761003399.93400.6279–307+161831529.61529.7319–3311605.61605.7319–331Cys-326 +761001690.61690.7319–331+16176.3554.3554.6351–355630.4630.6351–355Cys-352 +76100715.3715.6351–3551-bNo sequence data acquired.+161100Measured molecular weights and modifications of tryptic peptides are listed as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, respectively.

NO, not observed. To determine which cysteine is responsible for the activation of Gαi2, each Cys was individually mutated to Ser. Cysteine at position 352 was excluded from mutational analysis, since H2O2 still activated Gαi2subjected to PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Using in vitro translated WT and mutated forms of Gαi2, the effect of the substitution on ·OH-induced activation was assessed by a change in the conformation-dependent trypsin digestion pattern. Mutants of Cys287 or Cys326, but not mutants of other cysteine residues, showed resistance to ·OH-induced activation (Fig. 4, A andB). This result demonstrates that Cys287 and Cys326 are possible candidates for ·OH-induced modification and consequent activation of Gαi2. To correlate the modification of Cys287 and Cys326with the functional activation of Gαi2, we expressed and purified Cys to Ser mutants of Gαi2 (C287S- and C326S-Gαi2). The C255S-Gαi2 mutant was also purified to demonstrate the functional integrity of the mutant after the substitution of Cys to Ser. Cys255 was chosen by the fact that Cys255 was also modified and located at the closest position of two cysteine residues. TableII shows that K dvalues of these mutants were essentially the same as the value of recombinant WT-Gαi2. These K d values were nearly the same as the K d value of Gαi purified from rabbit liver membranes (21Bokoch G.M. Katada T. Northup J.K. Ui M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3560-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, cysteine modification does not induce conformational changes in the guanine nucleotide binding pocket of Gαi2. The basal GTPγS binding activities of these mutants were similar to that of WT-Gαi2 (about 0.3–0.4 mol/mol of Gαi2). As expected, exposure of ·OH increased the binding of [35S]GTPγS to WT-Gαi2 and C255S-Gαi2 mutants but did not increase the binding of [35S]GTPγS to C287S- and C326S-Gαi2mutants (Fig. 5). This result clearly shows that the target amino acids of ·OH are cysteine residues at position 287 and 326, and the modification of these cysteine residues activates Gαi2.Table IIKd values of Gαi2 cysteine-substituted mutantsG proteinK d valuenMWT346 ± 57C255S345 ± 78C287S449 ± 127C326S247 ± 88Purified WT- and cysteine-substituted forms of Gαi2 were incubated with 0.38 nm ∼ 100 μm[35S]GTPγS, and the binding activities were determined.K d values were calculated with Origin software.

The experiments were repeated three times and shown as the mean ± SE. Our previous report indicated that the dissociation of Gβγ from Gi and Go by ROS is critical for generation of downstream signaling (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We next examined which cysteine is involved in the dissociation of Gi and Go into their respective subunits. Treatment of heterotrimeric Go with ·OH decreased PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the ·OH-induced subunit dissociation of Go(13). The subunit dissociation induced by ·OH was also observed in recombinant WT-Gαi2 in the presence of Gβγ (Fig. 6). However, the ·OH-induced subunit dissociation was almost completely inhibited in C287S-Gαi2 but not C326S-Gαi2 mutants. These results suggest that oxidation of Cys287 by ·OH is only required for the subunit dissociation of Gi, and oxidation of Cys326 does not contribute to the subunit dissociation. However, both modifications of Cys287 and Cys326 are necessary for the ·OH-induced activation of Gαi2. We previously reported that exposure of H2O2induces liberation of Gβγ from Gi, leading to the activation of ERK and Akt in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (13Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated in the present report that the species acting on Gαi was ·OH but not H2O2itself. This suggests that intracellular Fe2+ is involved in conversion of H2O2 to ·OH for the generation of downstream signaling. Therefore, we pretreated rat neonatal myocytes with a cell-permeable Fe2+ chelator deferoxamine and determined the effect on ERK and Akt activation. The treatment with deferoxamine significantly decreased H2O2 (1 mm)-induced activation of ERK and Akt in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.7). The maximum extent of inhibition is about 40%, consistent with the value reported in the previous study that sequestration of Gβγ by expressing the carboxyl-terminal region of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 inhibited H2O2-induced activation of ERK and Akt. These results clearly show that ·OH is generated from H2O2 in cells and liberates Gβγ, leading to the activation of ERK and Akt in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We next examined whether other ROS or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can activate Gi and Go. G protein activation was assessed by PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Go purified from bovine brain and [35S]GTPγS binding of recombinant Gαi2. The ADP-ribosylation of Go was decreased by the treatment with KO2 (a generator of superoxide anion, O 2⨪), EP-1 (a generator of singlet oxygen,1O2, NOC13 (a generator of nitric oxide (NO)), and UV light (wavelength 365 nm) (Fig.8 A). In contrast, treatment with H2O2 (in the absence of Fe2+) has no effect on PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Higher concentrations of EP-1 (200 μm), KO2 (100 μm), or NOC13 (300 μm) than H2O2 were required for the activation of Gi and Go. GTPγS binding to WT-Gαi2 was also increased by these ROS and UV light treatments (Fig. 8 B). Because UV light can generate ROS from O2 dissolved in the solution, these results indicate that free radicals are the likely species involved in the modification of Gi and Go, and the requirement of higher concentration to activate Gi and Go reflects differential reactivity of various ROS. To examine whether these treatments modify the same cysteine residues as ·OH treatment, the activation was determined with Gαi2mutants. K d values of GTPγS binding of these mutants were not different from the value of WT-Gαipurified from liver membranes (Table II and Ref. 21Bokoch G.M. Katada T. Northup J.K. Ui M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3560-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GTPγS binding to these mutants was increased to a similar extent to recombinant Gαi2 by mastoparan stimulation (data not shown). Thus, these mutants retain a conformation necessary for GTPγS binding in the resting and activated forms. The activation of Gαi2 by these ROS was inhibited in C326S- and C287S-Gαi2 mutants, indicating that same cysteine residues are modified irrespective of species of generating ROS (Fig.8 B). Therefore, these ROS and UV treatments modify and activate Gαi2 with a mechanism similar to the activation mechanism by ·OH treatment. The present study demonstrated that ROS activated Giand Go by modification of specific cysteine residues. The activation of Gi and Go by ROS consists of two steps. The first step is the modification of Cys287, leading to subunit dissociation. The second step is the modification of Cys326, resulting in the enhanced GTPγS binding that reflects the increased rate of GDP dissociation. However, Cys326 may be modified by ROS before subunit dissociation. Then modification of Cys287 simultaneously induces dissociation and activation. Cys287 and Cys326are located near the guanine nucleotide binding motif (N270KXD273), Cys287 at the αG/α4 loop and Cys326 at the β6/α5 loop (22Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar,23Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Iiri et al.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27400-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the mutation of three amino acids located in α5 helix of the transducin α subunit (Thr325, Val328, and Phe332) greatly increased the basal guanine nucleotide exchange rates. Therefore, it is possible that the modification of Cys326of Gαi2 by ·OH in the presence of sulfhydryl compounds increases the dissociation rate of GDP. In contrast to the role of Cys326, the role of Cys287 in activation is not apparent, since the αG/α4 loop that contains Cys287does not directly interact with Gβγ and the nucleotide binding pocket (22Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The analysis of crystal structure of ·OH-treated Gαi2 may be necessary for determining the detailed structural changes upon modification. However, it is expected that structural alteration of Gαi2 modified by ROS is subtle. Posner et al. (27Posner B.A. Mixon M.B. Wall M.K. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21753-21758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar) report that substitution of Ala326 of Gαi1 with a serine residue results in the mutant that shows the increased GDP dissociation in the absence of structural alteration. The position of Ala326 of Gαi1 is next to Cys325 of Gαi1that corresponds to Cys326 of Gαi2. However, it will be interesting to determine the structure of Cys287-modified Gαi2. It may provide structural information about subunit dissociation of G protein. Because ROS activates Gαi2, it is interesting to compare the mechanism of ROS-mediated G protein activation with the mechanism of receptor-mediated G protein activation. There are at least two hypotheses of G protein activation mechanism (26Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27400-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One is proposed by Bourne and co-workers (28Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). They proposed that the intracellular loops of the receptor move Gβγ away from Gα like a lever, resulting in the relief of the constraints on switch I and switch II. This relief allows Gα to dissociate GDP and facilitate the binding of GTP. The other hypothesis is proposed by Sakmar and co-workers (26Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27400-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They demonstrate that several mutations of the α5 helix of transducin drastically increase GDP dissociation without altering nucleotide binding properties. α5 helix locates between the carboxyl-terminal tail and the β6/α5 loop, and β6/α5 loop directly contacts the nucleotide binding pocket. Therefore, α5 helix interacting with the receptor distantly affects the β6/α5 loop to lead enhanced GDP dissociation. Our result showed that subunit dissociation by modification of Cys287 is not enough for full activation of G protein, and the modification of Cys326 locating near β6/α5 is also not enough for activation of G protein. The full activation of G protein requires modification of two amino acids (Cys287 and Cys326) that are involved in subunit dissociation or release of GDP. This result is consistent with the finding that receptor stimulation dissociates G protein into Gα and βγ subunits and also increases the GDP dissociation by interacting with the α5 helix. It is unknown whether Gαi2 modified by ROS is functionally active. The sites modified by ROS are assigned to one of effector interaction sites (29Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Therefore, the modification of Gαi2 by ROS may impair the functional interaction with effector molecules such as adenylyl cyclase. It also remains to be determined what modification occurs in intact cells. Lee et al. (8Lee S-R. Kwon K-S. Kim S-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) report that the treatment of cells with H2O2 decreased the phosphatase activity of PTP-1B by modifying the cysteine residue located at the catalytic site (8Lee S-R. Kwon K-S. Kim S-R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). However, mass spectrometric analysis of PTP-1B prepared from H2O2-treated cells revealed that cysteine is glutathiolated instead of hydroxylated (9Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34543-34546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that cysteine residues in Gαi and Gαo are modified by glutathione in a similar manner as PTP-1B. This raises the possibility that Gi and Go are reversibly oxidized and reduced in cells like PTP-1B. However, it remains to be determined whether Cys287 and Cys326 of Gαi2 are similarly modified by H2O2 treatment in cells. Cysteine and methionine residues are reported to be especially sensitive to oxidation by various ROS (19Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 20Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Shaker-type K+ channels contain the oxidation-sensitive methionine residue that localizes at the amino-terminal domain (31Ciobra M.A. Heinemann S.H. Weissbach H. Brot N. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9932-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide by ROS slowed the inactivation kinetics of the channel. This observation was confirmed by the evidence that the expression of methionine sulfoxide reductase abolishes the slow inactivation kinetics of the channel (31Ciobra M.A. Heinemann S.H. Weissbach H. Brot N. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9932-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ryanodine receptor contains free reduced cysteine residues in which NO nitrosylates one of the cysteine residues (32Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). When these cysteine residues are oxidized, ryanodine receptor is no longer modified by NO and loses the enhanced Ca2+-releasing activity from the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, Ca2+-releasing activity of ryanodine receptor is reversibly affected by cysteine oxidation and reduction. The present study showed that the cysteine residue of Gαi2 is only amino acid modified by ROS. Mass spectroscopic analysis did not detect any modification of the methionine residue. SinceN-acetylcysteine was added to quench the reaction with ROS, methionine sulfoxide may return to methionine. However, the result of mutational analysis is consistent with the idea that the cysteine residue of Gαi2 is the target amino acid for ROS. We consistently observed a slightly lower activation by ·OH treatment than mastoparan treatment. This may be explained by the fact that ·OH treatment induces unstability of Gαi2, since the modification by ·OH and subsequent binding of sulfhydryl compound increases the GTPγS binding (i.e. the increased dissociation of pre-bound GDP), and nucleotide-free Gαiis unstable. It may induce denaturation of Gαi2. López-Barneo et al. (33López-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Sáenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) mention that ion channels are acutely modified by ROS, and enzymes and transcription factors are modified by chronic exposure to reduced or oxidized conditions. Intracellular signaling proteins such as NADPH oxidase (34Fu X.W. Wang D. Nurse C.A. Dinauer M.C. Cutz E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptor (32Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and K+ channel (31Ciobra M.A. Heinemann S.H. Weissbach H. Brot N. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9932-9937Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) can work as redox sensors (33López-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Sáenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Our results add Gi and Go to the growing members of the redox-sensing protein family. These proteins, including Gi and Go, may be activated at different lengths and levels of the oxidized state in cells, and cells generate signals dependent on the severity of the intracellular oxidized state. Consequently, cells can adjust to the environmental changes. The present study reveals a novel mechanism of Giactivation by ROS. The activation of Gi requires oxidation of two cysteine residues (Cys287 and Cys326). Each cysteine residue contributes to different processes of G protein activation; oxidation of Cys287 of Gαi2 leads to dissociation into Gαi2 and Gβγ, whereas oxidation of Cys326 in addition to Cys287 leads to the activation of Gαi.

An analysis of rat liver enoyl-CoA isomerases revealed the presence of a monofunctional enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI) in addition to mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase (MECI) in mitochondria, whereas peroxisomes contain ECI and multifunctional enzyme 1 (MFE1). Thus ECI, which previously had been described as peroxisomal enoyl-CoA isomerase, was found to be present in both peroxisomes and mitochondria. This enzyme seems to be identical with mitochondrial long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase (Kilponen, J.M., Palosaari, P.M., and Hiltunen, J.K. 1990. Biochem. J. 269, 223–226). All three hepatic enoyl-CoA isomerases have broad chain length specificities but are distinguishable by their preferences for one of the three isomerization reactions. MECI is most active in catalyzing the 3-cis → 2-trans isomerization; ECI has a preference for the 3-trans → 2-trans isomerization, and MFE1 is the optimal isomerase for the 2,5 → 3,5 isomerization. A functional characterization based on substrate specificities and total enoyl-CoA isomerase activities in rat liver leads to the conclusion that the 3-cis → 2-trans and 2,5 → 3,5 isomerizations in mitochondria are catalyzed overwhelmingly by MECI, whereas ECI contributes significantly to the 3-trans → 2-trans isomerization. In peroxisomes, ECI is predicted to be the dominant enzyme for the 3-cis → 2-trans and 3-trans → 2-transisomerizations of long-chain intermediates, whereas MFE1 is the key enzyme in the 2,5 → 3,5 isomerization.

However, the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, in contrast to the breakdown of saturated fatty acids, requires the involvement of several auxiliary enzymes that catalyze the isomerization and reduction of double bonds (reviewed in Ref. 1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). During the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid with even-numbered double bonds, e.g. the 12-cis double bond of linoleic acid, a 3-trans → 2-trans double bond shift takes place, whereas three isomerizations, 3-cis → 2-trans, 3-trans → 2-trans, and 2,5 → 3,5 (see Scheme FS1) occur during the β-oxidation of fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds,e.g. the 9-cis double bond of oleic acid and linoleic acid. All of these positional and steric isomerizations of double bonds are catalyzed by Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) (ECI or enoyl-CoA isomerase).1Five mammalian enzymes with enoyl-CoA isomerase activities have been described. They are mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase (MECI) (2Stoffel W. Ecker W. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 99-105Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Palossari P.M. Kilponen J.M. Sormunen R.T. Hassinen I.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the available information, the first three enoyl-CoA isomerase activities are present in mitochondria, and the last two enzymes are associated with peroxisomes. Structural information about this group of enzymes has been growing rapidly as reflected by the recent publications of crystal structures for rat crotonase (9Engel C.K. Mathieeu M. Zeelen J.Ph. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and yeast PECI (10Mursula A.M. van Aalten D.M.F. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol.

These two enzymes are hexameric proteins with similar patterns of folding even though they exhibit low sequence homology and catalyze different reactions. The specific metabolic functions of enoyl-CoA isomerases are poorly defined, especially because it was demonstrated that more than one isomerase is present in either mitochondria or peroxisomes and that collectively these enzymes catalyze three distinct reactions in β-oxidation. Unanswered questions about the identity of enoyl-CoA isomerases, their subcellular localizations, and their substrate specificities have prompted the present investigation.

Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fatty acyl-CoA derivatives of all other fatty acids were prepared by the mixed anhydride method as described by Fong and Schulz (19Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All substrates for enoyl-CoA isomerase assays were purified by HPLC. A Waters μBondapak C18 column (30 × 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system was used for this purpose. The absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 254 nm. Separation was achieved by linearly increasing the acetonitrile/H2O (9:1, v/v) content of the 50 mm ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) from 10 to 40% (for C6 substrates), from 10 to 50% (for C8 substrates), or from 10 to 70% (for C14 substrates) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Desired fractions were collected, and the organic solvent was evaporated under vacuum on a rotatory evaporator. Sep-Pak C18 cartridges were used to concentrate the substrates after HPLC purification. After the substrates were absorbed onto the Sep-Pak columns, they were eluted with 3 ml of methanol. Methanol was evaporated under vacuum before the substrates were redissolved in H2O. Concentrations of acyl-CoAs were determined spectrophotometrically by quantifying CoASH with Ellman's reagent (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) after cleaving the thioester bonds with NH2OH at pH 7.0 (19Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Enoyl-CoA isomerases were assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance increase at either 263 or 280 nm on a Gilford recording spectrophotometer at 25 °C. A typical assay mixture contained 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0), 35 μm substrate, BSA (0.2 mg/ml), and enzyme. Extinction coefficients of 6,700 m−1cm−1 at 263 nm or 4,400 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm were used to calculate rates. Enoyl-CoA isomerase activities associated with multifunctional enzyme 1 or fractions obtained by separating mitochondrial, peroxisomal, or tissue extracts were assayed by a coupled assay (21Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in which the isomerization of 35 μm 3-enoyl-CoA to 2-enoyl-CoA was coupled to the hydration of the latter compound by crotonase, the NAD+-dependent dehydrogenation of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and the thiolytic cleavage of the resultant 3-ketoacyl-CoA by 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Formation of NADH (ε = 6,220m−1 cm−1) was the basis for calculating rates of isomerization. When 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA or 2,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA was used as substrate in the enoyl-CoA isomerase assay, dienoyl-CoA isomerase was added as a coupling enzyme. A typical assay mixture contained 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0), 35 μm substrate, dienoyl-CoA isomerase (0.25 units/ml), BSA (0.2 mg/ml), and an aliquot of enzyme. An extinction coefficient of 27,800 m−1 cm−1(22Yang S.-Y. Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15390-15395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to calculate rates.

Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 735-739Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar) activities were determined by established procedures. Enzymes were diluted with 50 mm KPi(pH 7.0) containing BSA (1 mg/ml). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. For the kinetic characterizations of ECI and MECI with 3-enoyl-CoAs as substrates, absorbance changes at 280 nm were recorded because the basal absorbance at 263 nm was too high at elevated substrate concentrations. Rates were measured at five or six substrate concentrations, and averages of three assays were used for each point. Preanalyses were performed to determine appropriate substrate and enzyme concentration ranges. Kinetic parameters (K mand V max) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting using the SigmaPlot 2000 program. Values ofk cat, the catalytic center activity, were calculated using the reported subunit molecular masses of 40.4 (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

Mitochondria and a light mitochondrial fraction were prepared from rat livers as described by Nedergaard and Cannon (27Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 69: 390-398Google Scholar) and de Duve et al. (28de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar), respectively. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (240–260 g) were used. They were kept on a standard chow and then fasted for 24 h before their livers were removed. Mitochondria and peroxisomes were separated by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation of a light mitochondrial fraction as described (29He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a 30% (w/v) solution of Nycodenz containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), and 0.1% ethanol was prepared, and 21 ml of this solution were placed in a 30-ml ultracentrifuge tube on top of 1.5 ml of a 60% sucrose cushion. A density gradient was generated by centrifugation at 60,000 × g in a T865 small angle rotor on a DuPont RC70 ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 24 h. A light mitochondrial fraction (∼15 mg of protein in 1.5 ml) was layered on top of the gradient followed by 1.5 ml of a cover solution of a 3-fold diluted isolation buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, and 10 mmTris (pH 7.4). This was followed by centrifugation at 76,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 1.6 ml each were collected from the bottom of the tube, diluted 2-fold with isolation buffer, and centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 20 min. Pellets from each fraction were redissolved in 100 μl of isolation buffer for further analysis. Peroxisomes were purified by centrifugation of a light mitochondrial fraction on a preformed continuous gradient of iodixanol (Optiprep) as described by van Veldhoven et al. (30Van Veldhoven P.P.

The gradient was prepared in 30-ml centrifuge tubes from equal volumes of iodixanol (20%, w/v) containing 0.41 m sucrose, 1.2 mm EDTA, 0.12% ethanol, and 6 mm Mops (pH 7.2) and iodixanol (40%, w/v) containing 0.14 m sucrose, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.08% ethanol, and 4 mm Mops (pH 7.2), by use of a gradient mixer and a peristaltic pump. After 20 ml of the gradient mixture had been placed in each tube, 2 ml of iodixanol (50%, w/v) containing 25 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% ethanol, and 2.5 mm Mops (pH 7.2) were delivered to the bottom of the tube by use of a long syringe needle. Three ml of light mitochondria (12 mg of protein/ml) were carefully layered on top of the gradient. The tubes were then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h in a T865 fixed angle rotor at 4 °C using the slow acceleration and deceleration mode. Fractions were collected from the bottom after slowly inserting a thin glass tube through the bottom of the tube. Marker enzyme activities for mitochondria and peroxisomes were assayed. Peroxisomal fractions were combined and diluted 2-fold with isolation buffer before they were harvested by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 20 min. Portions (4 g) of rat liver were homogenized in 16 ml of 10 mm KPi (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm DTT (buffer A). The homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were dialyzed against 20 mm KPi(pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm benzamidine and 0.5 mm DTT (buffer B). After dialysis, the samples were applied to hydroxylapatite columns (1.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 10 ml/h. The proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient made up of 200 ml each of 20 mm and 500 mm KPi (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm benzamidine and 0.5 mm DTT. Also enoyl-CoA isomerases present in peroxisomes (15 mg of protein) and mitochondria (130 mg of protein) were separated by this procedure after sonicating and centrifuging the organelle suspensions before the resultant soluble extracts were loaded onto hydroxylapatite columns and eluted by a KPi gradient from 20 to 500 mm. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were fed rodent chow containing 2% (w/w) di(ethylhexyl)phthalate for 2 weeks before being sacrificed. For the purification of MECI (3Palossari P.M. Kilponen J.M.

Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem.

The supernatant was applied to a Matrix Gel Red A column (2.5 × 12 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and then was developed with a gradient made up of 100 ml of buffer A and 100 ml of buffer A containing 1.2 m KCl. Fractions containing enoyl-CoA isomerase activity were combined. After dialysis overnight against 50 mm KPi (pH 6.0) containing 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 10% glycerol (buffer B), the sample was applied to a CM-cellulose column (1.5 × 6 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B. Mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase was eluted with a linear gradient made up of 25 ml of buffer B and 25 ml of buffer B containing 0.4 m KCl. For the purification of MFE1 (33Bjerrum O.J. Schafer-Nielson Dunn M.J. Electrophoresis 1986. VCH Publishers Inc., Deerfield Beach, FL1986: 315-327Google Scholar), a liver from a rat treated with di(ethylhexyl)phthalate was homogenized in 1:5 (w/v) of 10 mm K3PO4 containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with a Polytron tissue homogenizer. The suspension was sonicated 10 times for 20 s each at 4 °C before being centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 before being applied to a phosphocellulose column (2.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mm KPi (pH 7.0) 0.5 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm DTT (buffer C). The column was eluted with a linear gradient made up of 200 ml of 50 mmKPi in buffer C and 200 ml of 500 mmKPi in buffer C. Active fractions were combined and fractionated with (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate formed between 200 and 400 g/liter of (NH4)2SO4 was dialyzed overnight against buffer B before being applied to a CM-cellulose column (1.5 × 8 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml of 50 mmKPi in buffer B and 100 ml of 200 mmKPi in buffer B. Active fractions were combined and concentrated. Samples were treated with equal volumes of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on either gradient (4–20%) or 10% ready gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry blotting (33Bjerrum O.J. Schafer-Nielson Dunn M.J. Electrophoresis 1986. VCH Publishers Inc., Deerfield Beach, FL1986: 315-327Google Scholar) using the semi-dry transfer cell from Bio-Rad. Proteins remaining on the gel were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk for 1 h before being incubated with a 500-fold diluted rabbit antiserum for 1 h. After incubating the membrane with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 1.5 h, it was developed with a staining mixture containing the alkaline phosphatase substrate until the antigen bands were visible (34Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of recombinant peroxisomal enoyl-CoA isomerase was done as described in principle by Geisbrecht et al. (7Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the expression of His6-PECI, freshly transformed BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the pT7His-PECI plasmid were grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (225 rpm) for 12–14 h in 50 ml of LB media supplemented with kanamycin sulfate (25 μg/ml) and sterile 1% dextrose. After this incubation period, 7.5 ml of the preculture cell suspension were diluted into 500 ml of 2YT media containing kanamycin sulfate (25 μg/ml) and sterile 0.2% dextrose. This culture was grown with vigorous shaking at 18 °C until the A 600 reached 0.5, at which time the induction of protein expression was initiated by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Following growth of the induced culture for 18 h, cells were harvested and sonicated in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mmKPi (pH 7.8) containing 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted to a final volume of 200 ml with buffer A and was applied at a rate of 2 ml/min to a 5-ml bed of ProBond-agarose at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A and then with 20 volumes of buffer B (20 mm KPi (pH 6.0) containing 500 mmNaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Following these washing steps, the His6-PECI was eluted from the bed using an imidazole step gradient in buffer B. One column volume each of buffers containing 50, 250, 350, and 500 mm imidazole was applied sequentially to the resin bed. The eluants were collected, and each fraction was assayed for enoyl-CoA isomerase. Fractions containing high activities were pooled, and the His6-PECI present was precipitated slowly by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 0.4 g/ml. The aim of this study was the characterization of all enoyl-CoA isomerases that are present in rat liver and the determination of their contributions to the total enoyl-CoA isomerase activities in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. Mitochondrial long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase had been detected by Kilponen et al. (5Kilponen J.M. Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) who separated it from MECI and peroxisomal MFE1 by chromatography on hydroxylapatite. However, they did not purify it any further. Because this enoyl-CoA isomerase was more active with 3-trans-dodecenoyl-CoA than with 3-trans-hexenoyl-CoA as substrate, they named it long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase. They also concluded that it had a mitochondrial localization. We repeated the separation of a soluble extract from rat liver on hydroxylapatite, but we assayed each fraction with 3-trans-octenoyl-CoA and 3-cis- octenoyl-CoA because the ratio of activities obtained with these two substrates aids in the identification of different enoyl-CoA isomerases. Shown in Fig.1 is the result of this experiment. The activity pattern with 3-trans-octenoyl-CoA as substrate is similar to that observed by Kilponen et al. (5Kilponen J.M. Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) who concluded that the enoyl-CoA isomerase eluted first from the column was a novel isomerase, which they named long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase. The activity pattern obtained with 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA as substrate was quite different. The isomerase activity present in fractions 13–18 is easily missed, whereas the existence of two isomerase activities, presumably corresponding to MFE1 and MECI, in fractions 20–40 is more clearly revealed than with the 3-trans substrate. A trans/cis activity ratio of close to 2 determined for fractions 13–16 is similar to that of PECI, which has a trans/cis activity ratio of 2 in contrast to MECI and MFE1 with trans/cis activity ratios below 1. The presence of PECI in fractions 13–18 was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Thus, it seems that mitochondrial long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase is identical with PECI. If mitochondrial long-chain enoyl-CoA isomerase and PECI are the same enzyme, PECI must be present in both mitochondria and peroxisomes. To confirm this prediction, a light mitochondrial fraction was prepared from a rat liver homogenate and subjected to centrifugation on a Nycodenz density gradient. Fractions were assayed for catalase and malate dehydrogenase to localize peroxisomes and mitochondria, respectively. Fractions were also analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to MECI and PECI. The results shown in Fig.2 demonstrate that MECI was present only in mitochondria (fractions 7–11), whereas PECI was detected in both peroxisomes (fractions 1–5) and mitochondria (fractions 7–11). Because the dual localization of PECI contradicts the reported unique association of this enzyme with peroxisomes, further confirmation was sought. For this purpose, an extract from isolated rat liver mitochondria was subjected to chromatography on hydroxylapatite. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate the presence of at least two enoyl-CoA isomerases in mitochondria. The isomerase that was eluted first had a trans/cis activity ratio of ∼2 and was recognized by an antibody to PECI. Hence, this enoyl-CoA isomerase was PECI. The enoyl-CoA isomerase corresponding to the second peak was identified as MECI because it had atrans/cis activity ratio below 1 and was detected with antibodies raised against MECI. A similar experiment was also carried out with a soluble extract from rat liver peroxisomes, which had been purified by centrifugation on an iodixanol density gradient. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Again, two peaks of enoyl-CoA isomerase activity were detected. The isomerase that was eluted first from the column was PECI as indicated by itstrans/cis activity ratio of ∼2 and because of its recognition by antibodies to PECI. The second isomerase peak was due to MFE1 as demonstrated by immunoblotting and co-elution of enoyl-CoA isomerase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. The possibility that MFE1 may bind either MECI or PECI and thereby acquire enoyl-CoA isomerase activity prompted an experiment in whi"

Regulatory mechanisms are likely complex since 12 distinct human α1aAR carboxyl-terminal splice variants have been isolated. After determining the predominance of the α1a-1AR isoform in human heart and prostate, we stably expressed an epitope-tagged α1a-1AR cDNA in rat-1 fibroblasts and subsequently examined regulation of signaling, phosphorylation, and internalization of the receptor. Human α1aAR-mediated inositol phosphate signaling is acutely desensitized in response to both agonist and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) exposure. Concurrent with desensitization, α1aARs in32Pi-labeled cells are rapidly phosphorylated in response to both NE and PMA stimulation. Despite the ability of PKC to desensitize α1aARs when directly activated with PMA, inhibitors of PKC have no effect on agonist-mediated desensitization. In contrast, involvement of GRK kinases is suggested by the ability of GRK2 to desensitize α1aARs. Internalization of cell surface α1aARs also occurs in response to agonist stimulation (but not PKC activation), but is initiated more slowly than receptor desensitization. Significantly, deletion of the α1aAR carboxyl terminus has no effect on receptor internalization or either agonist-induced or GRK-mediated receptor desensitization.

Puceat M. Vassort G. Vogel S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 147-175PubMed Google Scholar). NE stimulation of α1ARs predominantly activates Gq and results in membrane polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis by activation of phospholipase Cβ; the resultant second messengers IP3 and DAG mobilize intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (2Graham R.M. Perez D.M. Hwa J. Piascik M.T. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Three α1AR subtypes (α1a, α1b, and α1d) have been cloned and pharmacologically characterized in several expression systems (for review, see Ref. 2Graham R.M. Perez D.M. Hwa J. Piascik M.T. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Clinically, activation of α1aARs has been implicated in the dynamic component of benign prostatic hyperplasia leading to bladder outlet obstruction and in the development of myocardial hypertrophy (3Marshall I.

Notwithstanding the importance of α1aARs in several pathophysiological states, surprising little is known about mechanisms underlying α1aAR expression and function. Transcriptional mechanisms unique to α1aARs have been shown to be important in maintaining full α1AR responsiveness to agonist in rat neonatal myocytes where long term (24–72 h) NE stimulation leads to up-regulation α1aAR mRNA and receptor protein expression, concurrent with down-regulation of α1b and α1dAR subtypes (5Rokosh D.G. Stewart A.F.R. Chang K.C. Bailey B.A. Karliner J.S. Camacho A. Long C.S. Simpson P.A. J. Biol.

Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1515-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). While important, such long-term studies do not examine acute regulation of α1aAR signaling in response to agonist stimulation, giving rise to the question whether α1aARs are subject to acute processes such as agonist-induced desensitization and receptor phosphorylation. Desensitization (dampening of receptor responsiveness to continued agonist exposure) is thought to involve a number of inter-related yet distinct mechanisms occurring at the receptor and more broadly in the signal transduction pathway (7Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization may occur within seconds to minutes of agonist stimulation, and is generally considered to result from receptor uncoupling from downstream effectors due to receptor phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of activated GPCRs by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) leads to increased binding of β-arrestin to the receptor complex, uncoupling receptors from G proteins and, in some cases, leading to internalization of the phosphorylated receptors. Phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation (decreased expression) of the α1bAR subtype in response to either agonist or PMA exposure have been extensively demonstrated in native and cell models (8Lattion A.L.

Truncation of its carboxyl terminus significantly decreases agonist- and PMA-mediated phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization of the α1bAR, and recent studies have pinpointed critical serine residues within that receptor region that are involved in each of these regulatory processes (8Lattion A.L.

One study of bovine α1aARs recently suggested that the α1aAR, similar to the α1b subtype, is subject to agonist-induced desensitization and phosphorylation (14Vazquez-Prado J. Medina L.C.

Mechanisms underlying regulation of α1aARs, however, are potentially more complex than those of the α1b subtype. Unlike α1b and α1dARs which are each expressed as a single isoform, several distinct α1a isoforms have been isolated in addition to the original “wild type” α1aAR, 12 in humans and 4 in rabbit (15Hirasawa A.

Although several of these variants give rise to non-functional truncated polypeptides with only six transmembrane domains, there are four fully functional α1aAR isoforms that exhibit ligand binding and signaling characteristics essentially identical to those of the wild type receptor (15Hirasawa A.

It is of particular interest that all functional α1aAR splice variants are identical except at the distal ends of their carboxyl termini, where each differs in sequence and length. The study of α1aAR regulation in endogenous systems may prove difficult, however, since several α1aAR carboxyl-terminal splice variants are concurrently expressed in every tissue studied thus far (15Hirasawa A.

Additionally, expression of severely truncated α1aAR isoforms can decrease signaling by full-length receptors, possibly through interference with trafficking and membrane localization of full-length receptors (17Coge F. Guenin S.P. Renouard-Try A. Rique H. Ouvry C. Fabry N. Beauverger P. Nicolas J.P. Galizzi J.P. Boutin J.A. Canet E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To accurately characterize acute agonist-mediated regulation of human α1aAR signaling, we directly profiled expression levels of functional full-length α1aAR splice variants in human heart and prostate and identified α1a-1 as the predominant α1aAR isoform in these tissues. We then stably expressed the α1a-1AR as an epitope-tagged fusion protein in rat-1 fibroblasts to examine effects of acute (≤30 min) NE and PMA stimulation on α1aAR signaling and to subsequently explore the roles of PKC and several GRK family members, receptor phosphorylation, and receptor internalization in acute regulation of α1aARs. In parallel we constructed, expressed, and tested a fully functional carboxyl-terminal truncated α1aAR (whose sequence is common to all functional α1aAR splice variants) to characterize any regulatory features that may be independent of carboxyl-terminal variation. Our findings suggest that acute agonist-mediated regulation of human α1aARs is primarily independent of the carboxyl terminus and could therefore be common to all functional α1aAR isoforms.

To profile α1aAR carboxyl-terminal splice variant expression in human heart and prostate, cDNA templates for isoform-specific RNase protection assay probes were constructed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used to amplify the 3′ cDNAs ends of each functional human α1aAR splice variant: α1a-1 (wild type), α1a-2, α1a-3, and α1a-4. A common 5′ amplification primer (containing the internal α1aAR EcoRV restriction site) located 322 bp upstream of the α1aAR carboxyl terminus splice site was used in conjunction with variant-specific downstream primers corresponding to distal 3′ end of coding sequence and containing introduced XbaI restriction sites. PCR products were digested with EcoRV and XbaI and subsequently ligated into a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) construct containing the wild type α1aAR to generate full-length α1aAR splice variant constructs. Digestion of each splice variant construct with EcoRV and ApaI provided isoform-specific fragments that were subsequently ligated into pGEM7Z+ (Promega, Madison, WI). Modified sequences of each PCR construct were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing using the fmol DNA Cycle Sequencing System (Promega). Total RNA was extracted from human tissues (prostate, heart) and SK-N-MC cells using RNA STAT-60 (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX). Each RNA sample was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm and stored at −70 °C until use. Radiolabeled antisense isoform-specific α1aAR probes were transcribed from linearized cDNA constructs using RNA polymerase T7, and [α-32P]UTP as previously described (19Razik M.A. Lee K. Price R.R. Williams M.R. Ongjoco R.R. Dole M.K. Rudner X.L. Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28237-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to probes for each α1aAR splice variant subtype, a control α1aAR probe (located upstream of carboxyl-terminal splice site in α1aAR second exon) and a human cyclophilin control probe (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) were used; RNase protection assays were conducted as previously described (19Razik M.A. Lee K. Price R.R. Williams M.R. Ongjoco R.R. Dole M.K. Rudner X.L. Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28237-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To facilitate phosphorylation studies, sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was added to the amino terminus of the human α1a-1AR cDNA using PCR mutagenesis. The 5′ (sense) 59-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AAAAGAATTCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCC GTGTTTCTCTCGGGAATG-3′) contained a synthetic EcoRI restriction site to facilitate cloning, sequence encoding the 9-residue HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA; bold italics) immediately downstream of the α1aAR start codon, and 19 bases corresponding to bp 4 to 22 of the α1aAR (underlined). The 3′ (antisense) primer was 5′-GAGCAGCCTCACTGAGAAGTGCGT-3′, corresponding to bases 796 to 763 of the α1aAR receptor (GenBankTM accession number 4501960). The resulting PCR product was digested withEcoRI and Eco47III and subcloned into the mammalian α1aAR expression vector pcDNA3:α1aAR; the final construct is called pcDNA3:HA-α1a. A carboxyl-terminal-truncated α1aAR mutant (pcDNA3:HA-T348) was generated by introducing a STOP codon after Arg348 of HA-α1a in pcDNA3:HAα1a using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Modified sequences of each construct were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing. Cells were grown in monolayers and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For stable expression of receptors, plasmids pcDNA3:HA-α1a and pcDNA3:HA-T348 were individually transfected into rat-1 fibroblasts by electroporation (Gene Pulsar II, Bio-Rad Inc.; optimal conditions were 250 mvolts and 950 μF capacity, resulting in a time constant of 12–15 ms). Clones resistant to G418 (800 μg/ml) were isolated and tested for receptor expression. Selection was maintained in clonal cell lines with 400 μg/ml G418. Saturation binding and competition analysis of transfected cell membranes was performed with the radiolabeled α1AR antagonist [125I]HEAT (300 and 120 pm for saturation and competition binding, respectively) as previously described (20Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). The α1AR agonists norepinephrine and oxymetazoline, and antagonists prazosin and 5-methylurapidil were utilized for competition analysis. Resultant curves were fit using noniterative regression analysis with PRISM software (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Ligand binding on intact cells was performed as described by Lattion (8Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cell monolayers grown in 12-well plates were washed once with DMEM and treated with drugs, washed once again with DMEM and then incubated with 2 nm[3H]prazosin in 0.5 ml of DMEM at either 4 °C for 12–15 h to determine cell surface binding or at 37 °C for 30 min to determine total cellular receptor content. Phentolamine (10−4m) was used to determine nonspecific prazosin binding. Following binding, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and scraped in 1 ml of water; 3H was counted in 7 ml of scintillation mixture using a Wallac 1409 Liquid Scintillation Counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Rat-1 cells stably expressing either HA-α1a or HA-T348 receptors were labeled with [3H]inositol for 20–24 h with 2.5 μCi/ml in DMEM supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). After labeling, cells were washed with PBS and when necessary incubated in PBS for various times at 37 °C; pretreated cells were exposed to various drugs during this incubation as indicated. Cells were then quickly washed with PBS, placed in PBS with 20 mm LiCl and immediately stimulated by NE addition for the indicated times. NE was added to the cells from ×100 stocks in 10 mm ascorbic acid while only ascorbic acid was added to unstimulated cells. Inositol phosphates were extracted as described by Martin (21Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated using Dowex AG1-X8 anion exchange (formate) columns. After washing the columns twice with water, total inositol phosphates were eluted in 1m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, and combined with 15 ml of scintillation mixture; 3H was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Final GRK-mediated desensitization assays were performed in transiently transfected cells, since GRK transfection in stable cell lines resulted in unexpected accelerated cell death (a condition not seen in any other assay). All final IP assays were normalized for α1aAR density and cell count at the time of assay. GRK overexpression was confirmed by Western analysis. Rat-1 or COS-7 cells were plated at 40,000 cells per well in 12-well plates, grown overnight, and transfected with 0.25 μg of pcDNA3 containing HA-α1aARs or HA-T348 with or without 0.25 μg of pcDNA1 containing GRK2 or GRK6; the total transfected DNA was kept at 0.75 μg (per 40,000 cells) by adding pcDNA3. Following 18 h of transfection, cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution, labeled with [3H]inositol in 10% fetal bovine serum, and assayed for total inositol phosphate production in DMEM essentially as described for stable cells. Membranes from cells expressing either HA-α1a or HA-T348 receptors, prepared for ligand binding as described above, were resuspended at a concentration of 1 μg of total protein/μl. 175 μg of total protein were incubated with 6 nm[125I]iodoazidoprazosin (200 μl total volume) in the dark at room temperature for 60 min in the presence or absence of prazosin (1 μm). Following incubation, samples were UV-irradiated for 10 min, centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min, and resuspended in 6 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Protogel, National Diagnostics). 125I-Labeled receptors were detected by exposure to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) for 24–48 h. Equal numbers of rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing either HA-α1a or HA-T348 receptors were grown to confluency in 6- or 12-well cluster plates. Cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-free DMEM, then incubated in the same medium containing 32Pi (0.2 mCi/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Different drugs were added during this incubation as indicated under “Results.” Following incubation, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To reduce background, solubilized proteins were incubated with protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of nonspecific precipitated material, the supernatant was incubated with 3F10 rat monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against the HA epitope tag at 4 °C. After 1 h, protein G-agarose beads were added to the sample mixture and incubation was continued overnight. Isolated immune complexes were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), and once with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). After removal of buffer, immune complexes were resuspended in 6 × SDS sample buffer and were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After autoradiography,32P was quantitated with a PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant gel image analysis software. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-factor ANOVA (where appropriate) followed by a two-tailed unpaired t test, withp < 0.05 considered to be significant. To focus our studies on the full-length functional α1aAR isoform that is predominantly expressed in human prostate and heart, we directly examined expression of the four full-length α1aAR splice variants in these tissues, as well as in SK-N-MC cells (the only currently available human cell line that endogenously expresses α1aARs, albeit at very low levels). RNase protection assays (without prior PCR amplification) were performed using α1aAR probes designed to contain both isoform-specific carboxyl-terminal sequences (WT α1a-1, α1a-2, α1a-3, and α1a-4) and sequences common to all functional α1aAR isoforms (Fig.1 A). With each probe, levels of individual isoform mRNA expression (isoform-specific fragment) were quantitated relative to all other functional α1aisoforms (common sequence fragment). As shown in Fig. 1, Band C, the α1a-1 (wild type α1a) predominates in human prostate (81 ± 2%), heart (89 ± 4%), and SK-N-MC cells (85 ± 1%). α1a-4 mRNA represents 6–11% of the remaining α1aAR mRNA pool, whereas α1a-2 and α1a-3 are rare in all tissues/cells studied (3–9% combined). Because of its overwhelmingly predominant expression, we subsequently focused our studies on regulation of the wild type α1a-1 receptor (hereafter referred to as α1aAR). To facilitate phosphorylation studies of the wild type human α1aAR, we constructed two specialized mutant α1aARs: 1) an amino terminus HA epitope-tagged α1aAR (HA-α1a), and 2) a mutated HA-α1a in which the carboxyl terminus was truncated after amino acid 348, eliminating the last 118 amino acids of the α1a-1AR (HA-T348). HA-T348 retains expression of the palmitoylated Cys345 (22Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but is truncated well upstream of the α1aAR carboxyl-terminal splice site present in all functional α1aAR splice variants just after Arg422. Thus, the truncated construct represents sequence common to all functional α1aAR isoforms, regardless of splice variant identity. HA-α1a and HA-T348 constructs were each stably transfected into rat-1 fibroblasts (cells lacking endogenous α1ARs), and several stable clones were isolated for each construct with receptor expression levels varying from 0.1 to 1.5 (HA-α1a) and 0.2 to 2.8 (HA-T348) pmol/mg of total protein. Receptor expression levels were routinely measured to ensure they did not change over time. Unless otherwise stated, clonal lines expressing similar levels of HA-α1a and HA-T348 (1.5 and 1.8 pmol/mg protein, respectively) were utilized in this study. However, assays performed on two additional clones of each cell type with lower levels of receptor expression (HA-α1a, 400 and 200 fmol/mg protein; HA-T348, 700 and 350 fmol/mg protein) demonstrated similar responses of α1aARs to agonist- and PMA-induced desensitization (data not shown). This suggests that these phenomena are, to a large degree, independent of receptor density in these cells. Ligand binding and IP signaling of HA-α1a and HA-T348 were characterized and compared with those of the wild type α1aAR (untagged, full-length) to determine potential effects of epitope tagging and carboxyl-terminal truncation on the receptor. Binding affinities of both HA-α1a and HA-T348 for agonists (NE and oxymetazoline) and α1AR antagonists (prazosin and 5-methylurapidil) are indistinguishable from those of the untagged wild type receptor (Table I). In cells labeled with [3H]inositol and stimulated with varying concentrations of NE, both HA-tagged receptors are capable of stimulating production of total inositol phosphates in a dose-dependent manner to the same extent as wild type α1aARs, with EC50 0.36 ± 0.03 and 0.24 ± 0.05 μm for HA-α1a and HA-T348, respectively, compared with 0.31 ± 0.09 μmfor the wild type α1aAR. The ∼100-fold difference between NE EC50 values and receptor affinities (pK i) at the α1aAR is not unique to this receptor. Similar differences between agonist potency over ligand affinity has been demonstrated for other GPCRs (e.g.2–3-fold increase for full agonists of the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (23Szekeres P.G. Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and a nearly 10,000-fold increase for isoproterenol at the β2AR (24Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Martenson C. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar)). The α1AR antagonist prazosin (1 μm) prevents NE-induced increases in IP production above basal values at wild type, HA-tagged, and truncated α1aARs (data not shown). Thus, addition of the HA epitope tag to the amino terminus and/or truncation of the α1aAR carboxyl terminus has little effect on ligand binding or second messenger production of the human α1aAR.Table IPharmacological characteristics of HA-α1a and HA-T348 compared to wild type α1aARCharacteristicHA-α1aHA-T348α1aAR WTCompetition analysis1-aCompetition binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± SEM; n = three to nine independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.(pK i)AgonistsNorepinephrine4.6"

Their unique substrate specificity compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommends the NAD+ ligases as targets for the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotics. A plausible strategy for drug discovery is to identify the structural components of bacterial DNA ligase that interact with NAD+ and then to isolate small molecules that recognize these components and thereby block the binding of NAD+ to the ligase. The limitation to this strategy is that the structural determinants of NAD+specificity are not known. Here we show that reactivity ofEscherichia coli DNA ligase (LigA) with NAD+requires N-terminal domain Ia, which is unique to, and conserved among, NAD+ ligases but absent from ATP-dependent ligases. Deletion of domain Ia abolished the sealing of 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nicks and the reaction with NAD+to form ligase-adenylate but had no effect on phosphodiester formation at a preadenylated nick. Alanine substitutions at conserved residues within domain Ia either reduced (His-23, Tyr-35) or abolished (Tyr-22, Asp-32, Asp-36) sealing of a 5′-PO4 nick and adenylyl transfer from NAD+ without affecting ligation of pre-formed DNA-adenylate. We suggest that these five side chains comprise a binding site for the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety of NAD+. Structure-activity relationships were clarified by conservative substitutions.

Structure-activity relationships were clarified by conservative substitutions. nicotinamide mononucleotide DNA-adenylate oligomer-binding helix-hairpin-helix dithiothreitol wild-type DNA ligases are grouped into two families, ATP-dependent ligases and NAD+-dependent ligases, according to the cofactor required for ligase-adenylate formation (1Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Both types of DNA ligases catalyze the sealing of 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini at nicks in duplex DNA by means of three sequential nucleotidyl transfer reactions. In the first step, attack on the α phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ by ligase results in release of pyrophosphate or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)1 and formation of a covalent intermediate (ligase-adenylate) in which AMP is linked via a phosphoamide bond to lysine. In the second step, the AMP is transferred to the 5′ end of the 5′-phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form DNA-adenylate (AppDNA). In the third step, ligase catalyzes attack by the 3′-OH of the nick on DNA-adenylate to join the two polynucleotides and release AMP. At least one NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (referred to as LigA) is found in every bacterial species (2Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The bacterial LigA enzymes are of fairly uniform size (647–841 amino acids), and they display extensive amino acid sequence conservation throughout the entire lengths of the polypeptides. The atomic structures of the LigA enzymes from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Thermus filiformis have been determined by x-ray crystallography (3Singleton M.R. Håkansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TfiLigA contains a catalytic core composed of nucleotidyl transferase and oligomer-binding (OB)-fold domains, flanked by a 73-amino acid N-terminal domain (Ia) and three C-terminal domains: a tetracysteine domain that binds a single zinc atom, a helix-hairpin-helix domain (HhH), and a BRCT domain (named after the C terminus of the breast cancer gene product BRCA1) (Fig. 1 A). Escherichia coli encodes a second NAD+-dependent DNA ligase isozyme (LigB) in addition to LigA. The LigB protein contains the Ia, nucleotidyl transferase, OB-fold, and HhH domains, but lacks the tetracysteine zinc finger and the BRCT structural domains found in LigA (5Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4930-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The genomes of Yersinia pestis andSalmonella typhi also encode two NAD+-dependent ligases corresponding to LigA and LigB. The abbreviated domain structure of the bacterial LigB enzymes resembles that of the recently identified NAD+-dependent ligase of Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus (AmEPV), a eukaryotic poxvirus (6Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although there is scant primary structure similarity between NAD+-dependent and ATP-dependent ligases, the tertiary structures of the nucleotidyl transferase and OB-fold domains are conserved (3Singleton M.R.

The OB-fold domain of ATP-dependent ligases and GTP-dependent capping enzymes includes at its C terminus nucleotidyl transferase motif VI (RXDK), which contacts the β and γ phosphates of the NTP substrate and is required for the reactions with ATP or GTP to form the enzyme-NMP intermediate (10Håkansson K.

The NAD+ ligases lack a recognizable counterpart of motif VI within their OB-fold domains, which is sensible given that the NAD+ substrate does not contain a γ phosphate. Early genetic studies showed that the ligA gene is essential for growth of E. coli (17Gottesman M.M. Hicks M.L. Gellert M. J. Mol.

Genes encoding NAD+-dependent LigA are also essential inSalmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, andStaphylococcus aureus (19Park U.E. Olivera B.M. Hughes K.T. Roth J.R. Hillyard D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2173-2180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Petit M.A. Ehrlich S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4642-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Kaczmarek F.S.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3016-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to think that LigA will be essential for all bacteria. To date, there have been no reports of an NAD+-dependent DNA ligase in a eukaryotic species. Therefore, bacterial LigA presents an attractive target for broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy predicated on blocking the reaction of DNA ligase with NAD+. A rational strategy for drug discovery would entail the identification of the structural components of LigA that interact with NAD+ and the isolation of small molecules that recognize these components and thereby block the binding of NAD+ to bacterial ligase. The drug-binding site on the NAD+ ligase would ideally be unique to, and conserved among, NAD+ ligases but absent from ATP-dependent ligases and other essential NAD+-requiring enzymes. The limitation to this strategy is that the structural components of bacterial LigA that interact specifically with NAD+ are not known. N-terminal fragments of B. stearothermophilus, S. aureus, and Aquifex pyrophilus LigA composed solely of the Ia and nucleotidyl transferase domains retained full ligase adenylation activity although they were no longer active in the composite nick joining reaction (21Kaczmarek F.S. Zaniewski R.P. Gootz T.D. Danley D.E. Mansour M.N. Griffor M. Kamath A.V. Cronan M. Mueller J. Sun D. Martin P.K. Benton B. McDowell L. Biek D. Schmid M.B. J.

Similarly, an N-terminal fragment of entomopoxvirus ligase containing the Ia and nucleotidyl transferase domains sufficed for the reaction with NAD+ to form the ligase-AMP intermediate; said fragment was unable to catalyze phosphodiester formation at a standard 5′-PO4 nick or at a preadenylated nick (6Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An instructive finding was that deletion of domain Ia of entomopoxvirus DNA ligase abolished the reaction with NAD+ to form ligase-adenylate but had no effect on phosphodiester bond formation at a preadenylated nick (6Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); these results implicated domain Ia of AmEPV ligase in recognition of the NAD+ substrate. Here we show that domain Ia is essential for the reaction of E. coli DNA ligase with NAD+. We identify individual amino acids within domain Ia that are required for ligase adenylation but not for phosphodiester bond formation. The essential residues, which are conserved in all known NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, are located on the surface of the LigA protein where we posit that they interact with the NMN moiety of the NAD+substrate. We discuss the likely role of protein conformational changes in orchestrating the adenylyl transferase reaction. Missense mutations of domain Ia ofEcoLigA were introduced into the pET-EcoLig expression plasmid using the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method as described previously (14Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The entire ligA gene was sequenced in every case to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during PCR amplification and cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3). Mutant and wild-type ligases were purified from the soluble lysates of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21(DE3) cells by nickel-agarose chromatography as described (14Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the phosphocellulose enzyme preparations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. N-terminal deletion mutants NΔ38 and NΔ78 were purified as described previously (14Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm NAD+, 1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled nicked duplex DNA substrate (shown in Fig. 2 C), and aliquots of serial 2-fold dilutions of wild-type or mutant ligases were incubated at 22 °C for 10 min. The products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and the extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a FUJIX PhosphorImager. The specific activities of wild-type and mutant ligases were determined from the slopes of the titration curves in the linear range of enzyme dependence. The nicked DNA-adenylate substrate is shown in Fig. 3. The 5′-adenylated 32P-labeled 18-mer strand was synthesized and gel-purified as described (24Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9679-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-adenylate ligation reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, nicked DNA-adenylate substrate, and wild-type or mutant EcoLigA proteins as specified. The mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C. The products were resolved by denaturing PAGE, and the extents of ligation were determined by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager. For kinetic analysis, reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 200 fmol of nicked DNA-adenylate substrate, 2 pmol of ligase, and other components as specified above were incubated at 22 °C. The sealing reactions were initiated by adding ligase. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately with EDTA and formamide (12Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prior studies had shown that N-terminal deletions NΔ78 and NΔ38 of E. coli DNA ligase (EcoLigA), which eliminate all or part of domain Ia, resulted in complete loss of nick joining activity (14Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To probe the essential role of domain Ia in the ligase reaction, we examined the effects of the NΔ78 and NΔ38 mutations on individual steps in the reaction pathway. The first step in DNA ligation involves formation of a covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate. Whereas incubation of wild-type EcoLigA with [32P]AMP-labeled NAD+ and magnesium resulted in the formation of a32P-labeled covalent nucleotidyl protein adduct that comigrated with the full-sized ligase polypeptide during SDS-PAGE, the NΔ78 and NΔ38 mutants were inert in ligase adenylation (Fig.2 B). The third step of the ligation pathway entails attack of the 3′-OH of the nick on the 5′-PO4 of the DNA-adenylate to form a phosphodiester and release AMP. We assayed step 3 of the ligation reaction using a preadenylated nicked DNA substrate labeled with32P on the 5′-PO4 of the DNA-adenylate strand (Fig. 3). Reaction of wild-type EcoLigA with the nicked DNA-adenylate in the presence of magnesium without added NAD+ resulted in strand closure, evinced by formation of a radiolabeled 36-mer product. NΔ78 and NΔ38 were also capable of forming a phosphodiester bond at the preadenylated nick (Fig. 3). The latter finding underscores that the abrogation of the overall nick joining reaction by the NΔ78 and NΔ38 deletions cannot be ascribed to a global folding defect but instead reflects a specific requirement for domain Ia in the reaction of E. coli ligase with NAD+. To further probe the role of domain Ia in NAD+ recognition and nucleotidyl transfer, single alanine substitutions were introduced at six positions in the Ia domain of EcoLigA. The six mutated residues, Glu-10, Tyr-22, His-23, Asp-32, Tyr-51, and Asp-52, are denoted bydots in Fig. 1 B. Five of the six positions (Tyr-22, His-23, Asp-32, Tyr-51, and Asp-52) are conserved in the NAD+-dependent ligases (LigA homologs) from 30 other bacterial species and in entomopoxvirus NAD+-dependent DNA ligase. The recombinant EcoLigA mutants E10A, Y22A, H23A, D32A, Y35A, and D36A were purified by nickel-agarose chromatography in parallel with wild-type ligase (Fig.2 A). The extent of ligation of singly nicked 3′-OH/5′-PO4 DNA by wild-typeEcoLigA was proportional to input protein, and ∼80% of the input nicked substrate was sealed at saturating levels of enzyme (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). The specific activity of the E10A protein was 90% that of the wild-type ligase; however, the other alanine mutations elicited significant defects in nick joining (Fig.2 C). The specific activities of the mutants relative to wild-type ligase were as follows: Y22A (0.1%), H23A (10%), D32A (0.2%), Y35A (2%), and D36A (0.2%) (TableI). The defects in nick sealing were accompanied by defects in the reactions of the mutant proteins with NAD+ to form the covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate (Fig. 2 B). In particular, the Y22A, D32A, and D36A mutants were virtually inert in both nick ligation and ligase adenylation. H23A and Y35A, which were less active than wild-type ligase in nick joining, were also less active in ligase-AMP formation. The E10A mutation, which had no effect on nick joining, also did not affect the yield of ligase-AMP adduct (Fig. 2 B and data not shown).Table IEffects of domain Ia mutations on the nick joining activity of E. coli LigALigA mutantNick joining activity% of WTE10A90Y22A0.1Y22F9Y22S0.2H23A10H23Y88D32A0.2D32E0.4D32N9Y35A2Y35F23Y35S<0.1D36A0.2D36E4D36N12 Open table in a new tab Control experiments confirmed that all of the domain Ia mutants (E10A, Y22A, H23A, D32A, Y35A, and D36A) were catalytically active in phosphodiester formation with the nicked DNA-adenylate substrate (Fig.3). A kinetic analysis of the sealing of nicked DNA-adenylate by wild-type ligase, the domain Ia deletion mutants, and two of the Ala mutants is presented in Fig.4. The Y22A and D36A mutations, which suppressed the catalysis of nick joining and ligase adenylation, had no effect on the rate or the extent of phosphodiester formation at a preadenylated nick (Fig. 4 B). A deletion of the N-terminal 38 amino acids of domain Ia also had no effect on the rate or yield of the isolated step 3 reaction, and the more extensive NΔ78 deletion had only a modest (2-fold) effect on the rate of approach to the end point (Fig. 4 A). These experiments show that specific functional groups within domain Ia of E. coli DNA ligase are important for the reaction of ligase with NAD+ but are not required for catalysis when the AMP pocket of the nucleotidyl transferase domain is filled by the adenylated DNA intermediate. To evaluate the roles of charge, hydrogen bonding potential, and steric constraints in the functions of the domain Ia residues implicated in the step 1 reaction with NAD+, we tested the effects of conservative substitutions. Tyr-22 and Tyr-35 were replaced by Phe and Ser, His-23 was changed to Tyr, and Asp-32 and Asp-36 were mutated to Glu and Asn. The recombinant mutant ligases were purified from soluble bacterial extracts by nickel-agarose chromatography (Fig.5 A). The specific activity of each mutant was determined under steady-state conditions by protein titration and normalized to the specific activity of wild-type ligase; the results are summarized in Table I. The salient findings were that the Y22F and Y35F changes partially restored ligase activity (to 9 and 23% of wild-type, respectively), whereas serine substitutions had no salutary effect. We conclude that aromatic groups at positions 22 and 35 are important for strand joining and that activity is optimal when tyrosine is present. All NAD+-dependent ligases have a tyrosine at the position equivalent to Tyr-22 ofEcoLigA; position 35 is predominantly tyrosine and rarely phenylalanine in other NAD+-dependent enzymes (Fig. 1 B). Replacing His-23 of EcoLigA by tyrosine restored activity to near-wild-type level (88%). Note that most NAD+-dependent ligases naturally contain tyrosine at this position and only a minority of the bacterial enzymes have histidine in its place (Fig. 1 B). Introduction of asparagine in place of Asp-32 or Asp-36 partially restored ligase activity to 9 and 12% of the wild-type level, respectively. This represents a significant gain of function compared with the D32A and D36A mutants (0.2% activity). Changing aspartate to glutamate was of no benefit at position 32 and conferred a lesser restoration of function at position 36 than did asparagine (Table I). Thus, whereas aspartates at positions 32 and 36 confer optimal strand joining activity, the isosteric amide functional groups are tolerated with a significant, but not catastrophic, activity decrement. We infer that hydrogen-bonding interactions of the Asp-32 and Asp-36 functional groups are critical for activity and that the ligase does not tolerate lengthening of the distance from the main chain to the carboxylates, presumably because of steric clashes. Positions 32 and 36 are strictly conserved as aspartate in all NAD+-dependent ligases. (Fig. 1 B). The effects of the conservative domain Ia mutations on the reactions of the recombinant ligases with NAD+ to form the covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate paralleled the effects on the composite nick joining reaction (Fig. 5 B). The Y22F mutant was weakly active in ligase adenylation, whereas the Y22S protein was virtually inert. Y35F restored adenylation activity, but the Y35S mutant was apparently unreactive with NAD+. The H23Y change restored the yield of ligase-AMP adduct to the wild-type level. The D32N and D36N proteins were partially active, while the D32E and D36E ligases were more severely affected (Fig.6 B). A kinetic analysis of the reaction of EcoLigA with 1 μm [32P]AMP-labeled NAD+ is shown in Fig. 6. Wild-type ligase attained its reaction end point in ≤ 15 s (the earliest time tested) with ∼24% of the input ligase molecules being labeled with [23P]AMP. Mutational effects on the rates of ligase adenylation were generally consistent with the hierarchy of effects on the steady-state nick joining reaction. H23Y, which had the highest nick joining activity (88%) of the conservative domain Ia mutants, displayed a kinetic pattern similar to wild-type ligase, whereas catalytically impaired mutants H23A and Y22F (9–10% activity) reacted slowly (Fig.6 A). Y35F was adenylated faster than Y35A (Fig.6 A); D32N was faster than D32E, and D36N was faster than D36E (Fig. 6 B). We infer from these results that the conserved Tyr-22, His-23, Asp-32, Tyr-35, and Asp-36 side chains are constituents of the NAD+ binding site of bacterial DNA ligase. The selective effects of deletions and mutations in domain Ia ofEcoLigA on the nucleotidyl transferase reaction with NAD+ extend our findings for entomopoxvirus DNA ligase (6Sriskanda V. Moyer R.W. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36100-36109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and provide evidence for common structural determinants of substrate specificity for the NAD+ ligase family, which are located within domain Ia. Domain Ia is unique to NAD+-dependent ligases, and there is no discernable counterpart in ATP-dependent ligases. Thus, it is sensible that domain Ia is involved in NAD+recognition. Our results suggest a model whereby ligase substrate specificity at the step of ligase-adenylate formation is determined by the interactions of domain Ia of the NAD+-dependent enzymes with the NMN moiety of NAD+ (Fig.7). The crystal structures of NAD+ ligase, ATP ligases, and mRNA capping enzyme in various functional states all indicate that contacts of the enzymes with the AMP or GMP moieties are confined to the nucleotidyl transferase domain (3Singleton M.R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The nucleoside portion is buried within a pocket while the α phosphate is exposed on the surface of the domain. The first step in ligation and capping entails the attack of the motif I lysine on the nucleoside triphosphate or NAD+ substrates to form enzyme-adenylate or enzyme-guanylate. The reaction is believed to proceed through a pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state in which the attacking lysine nucleophile is apical to the pyrophosphate or NMN leaving group. We propose that the proper orientation of NAD+ is achieved by closure of domain Ia over the nucleotide binding pocket, resulting in contacts between the side chains of domain Ia and the nicotinamide nucleoside (Fig. 7). The breaking of the α-β phosphoanhydride bond of NAD+ upon enzyme-adenylate formation would release the tether of domain Ia to the nucleotidyl transferase domain and allow the domains to spring apart to adopt the conformation observed in the crystal structure of the Tfi ligase-adenylate intermediate (4Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The domain movement would then allow the binding of the nicked DNA substrate immediately above the AMP phosphate on the surface of the nucleotidyl transferase domain. Domain Ia is apparently dispensable once the ligase adenylation reaction is completed or when it can be bypassed, i.e. deletions and point mutations of domain Ia do not affect recognition of the nicked DNA-adenylate intermediate and the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation. There is as yet no reported crystal structure of an NAD+ligase bound to NAD+. However, the analysis of the effects of single alanine mutations in domain Ia of AmEPV ligase andEcoLigA ligases identifies five residues (Y22A, H23A, D32A, Y35A, and D36A in EcoLigA) that are involved specifically in adenylate transfer from NAD+. These five residues are conserved in the NAD+ ligases from 30 other bacterial species (shown in Fig. 1 B) and in additional bacterial NAD+ ligases that are not shown. Indeed, the five side chains are tightly clustered on the same surface of domain Ia in theTfi ligase and Bst ligase crystal structures (3Singleton M.R. Håkansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,4Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculate that these residues are constituents of an NMN binding site. The structures of domain Ia of Tfi and Bstligases consist principally of two antiparallel α helices and an intervening loop (Fig. 1 B). In the Tfi andBst ligases, the essential aspartates (Asp-34 and Asp-38, corresponding to EcoLigA residues Asp-32 an Asp-36) are located on the enzyme surface with their Oδ atoms separated by 3.5–5.6 Å (3Singleton M.R. Håkansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We speculate that this pair of surface Asp residues may coordinate the vicinal ribose oxygens of the nicotinamide nucleoside via hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, the aspartates may interact with the nicotinamide base. A role for the surface aspartates in coordinating a divalent cation seems less attractive, insofar as their replacement by asparagine results in partial recovery of activity, but glutamate substitutions are ineffective. Tyr-24 inTfi and Bst ligases (corresponding to essential Tyr-22 in EcoLigA) is positioned with its phenolic hydroxyl 3.2–4.0 Å from Oδ of Asp-34 (essential Asp-32 inEcoLigA). The Asp-Tyr contact may be functionally important, insofar as the Tyr is invariant and its replacement by Phe results in an order of magnitude decrement in ligase activity. Loss of the aromatic ring of Tyr-22 in EcoLigA abolishes ligase function, which could reflect an interaction of the tyrosine with the nicotinamide ring. Tyr-25 of Tfi and Bst ligases (His-23 in EcoLigA) is located on the enzyme surface, and its phenolic hydroxyl is not within hydrogen-bonding distance of other constituents of the protein. We speculate that the tyrosine/histidine side chain interacts via a hydrogen bond with NAD+. Inhibitors of bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligases would, in principle, be outstanding candidates for antibiotic development because of the following reasons. (i) NAD+-dependent ligases are present in all bacteria and are essential for bacterial growth. (ii) They are structurally conserved among bacteria but display unique substrate specificity compared with the ATP-dependent ligases of humans and other mammals. The present discoveries concerning the function of domain Ia in E. coli LigA raise the prospects for identifying small molecules that either compete for the predicted NMN site on domain Ia (said site being absent from ATP ligases) or else interfere with the conformational movements of domain Ia that are postulated to orchestrate the adenylate transfer reaction from NAD+. Candidate ligands can be screened for binding to the conserved and functionally important surface of domain Ia of bacterial LigA using as specificity controls the mutated versions of domain Ia that are defective in the adenylation reaction."

Angiostatin was originally identified in the urine of mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma as a 38-kDa proteolytically derived fragment of plasminogen which encompassed the first four kringle domains (Lys78-Ala440). Angiostatin was shown to be a potent antiangiogenic protein that inhibited the growth of human and murine carcinomas and also induced dormancy in their metastases. Angiostatin was also characterized as a specific antiangiogenic protein that blocked microvascular endothelial cell proliferation but not the proliferation of nonendothelial cells (1.O'Reilly M.S.

Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or the cancer cells themselves. For example, the conversion of plasminogen to angiostatin by macrophages is dependent on the release of metalloelastase from these cells. In comparison, Lewis lung carcinoma cells release matrix metalloproteinase-2, which also cleaves plasminogen to angiostatin (12.O'Reilly M.S. Wiederschain D. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Folkman J.

Second, AAPFs are also generated by a three-step mechanism that involves the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), the autoproteolytic cleavage of plasmin, and the release of the resultant plasmin fragment by cleavage of disulfide bonds. The cleavage of the plasmin disulfide bonds can be accomplished by free sulfhydryl group donors such as glutathione or by hydroxyl ions at alkaline pH (4.Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M.

Alternatively, the plasmin disulfide bonds can be cleaved enzymatically by a plasmin reductase such as phosphoglycerate kinase (15.Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J.

Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that the primary AAPF present in mouse and human blood has a molecular mass of 61 kDa (14.Kassam G. Kwon M. Yoon C.-S. Graham K.S. Young M.K. Gluck S. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8924-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have produced this AAPF, called A61, in a cell-free system consisting of u-PA and plasminogen. A61 was shown to be a novel four-kringle-containing plasminogen fragment consisting of the amino acid sequence Lys78-Lys468 (14.Kassam G. Kwon M. Yoon C.-S. Graham K.S. Young M.K. Gluck S. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8924-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The release of A61 from plasmin required cleavage of the Lys468-Gly469 bond by plasmin autoproteolysis and also cleavage of the Cys462-Cys541disulfide. Because A61 was generated in our cell-free system from plasmin at alkaline pH in the absence of sulfhydryl donors, we concluded that cleavage of the Cys462-Cys541disulfide was catalyzed by hydroxyl ions in vitro. In contrast, at physiological pH, we observed that the conversion of plasminogen to A61 was very slow. These results contrasted with our observation that at physiological pH, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and bovine capillary endothelial cells stimulated the rapid formation of A61. The mechanism by which these cells stimulated plasmin reduction and the release of A61 from plasmin was unclear, but it was reasonable to suspect that the cells utilized a plasminogen-binding protein on the cell surface to facilitate the formation of A61. Annexin II tetramer (AIIt) is a Ca2+-binding protein that binds plasminogen and plasmin and stimulates both the formation and autoproteolysis of plasmin at the cell surface (17–19; for review see Ref. 20.Kang H.M. Choi K.S. Kassam G. Fitzpatrick S.L. Kwon M. Waisman D.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protein consists of two copies of a 36-kDa subunit (p36) called annexin II and two copies of a 11-kDa subunit (p11) called S100A10. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the carboxyl-terminal lysines of the p11 subunit play a key role in plasminogen binding and activation (18.Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that AIIt stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to A61 in vitro. We also report for the first time that AIIt possesses an intrinsic plasmin reductase activity and that the cysteinyl residues of both subunits of AIIt participate in the reduction of plasmin. Among the seven annexins tested, only annexin II (p36) and AIIt act as plasmin reductase. Additionally, the antisense nucleotide-directed down-regulation of AIIt on the surface of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells greatly diminishes A61 production by these cancer cells. Our results therefore show for the first time that AIIt may play a role in angiogenesis by regulating the cellular release of an antiangiogenic protein. Two-chain u-PA was a generous gift from Dr. H. Stack (Abbott Laboratories). Glu-plasminogen and plasmin were purchased from American Diagnostica. A61 was purified as outlined previously (14.Kassam G. Kwon M. Yoon C.-S. Graham K.S. Young M.K.

IODO-BEADS were purchased from Pierce. Phosphoglycerate kinase was a generous gift from Dr. P. J. Hogg (Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia). Stably transfected HeLa cells expressing p11 antisense or sense mRNA were a generous gift from Dr. J. H. Shelhamer (Critical Care Medicine Department, National Institutes of Health). HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Bacterial expression vectors containing the wild-type sequence for annexin II (pAED4.91-annexin II) and p11 (pAED4.91-p11) were mutated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, mutagenic primers were synthesized which introduced Cys → Ser mutations at positions 8 and 334 of annexin II and at positions 61 and 82 of p11. All of the mutations introduced were verified by DNA sequence analysis. These various plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and grown as described previously (22.Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After a 4-h induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacteria were collected by low speed centrifugation. The cells were subsequently sonicated in lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol + protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Both mutant annexin II proteins were purified in the same manner as wild-type annexin II via hydroxyapatite, heparin-Sepharose affinity, and gel permeation chromatography as reported previously (22.Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The elution profiles of the recombinant wild-type and mutant annexin II on hydroxyapatite, heparin affinity, and gel permeation chromatography were indistinguishable. In addition, the circular dichroism spectra of each of the proteins were very similar, indicating little secondary structure perturbation. After 4 h of induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacteria were collected by low speed centrifugation. The cells were subsequently sonicated in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol + protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Both p11 mutants were purified in the same manner as wild-type p11 (23.Ayala-Sanmartin J. Vincent M. Sopkova J. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15179-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysis supernatant was precipitated with 50% (NH4)2SO4, and the supernatant was applied to a butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 50% (NH4)2SO4. The p11 was eluted with a linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 from 50 to 0%, and peak fractions containing p11 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed fractions were subsequently applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. The p11 was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient, concentrated to 4 ml, and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. A single protein peak was recovered at the expected molecular weight based on gel filtration standards. Sense and antisense p11 expression vector were produced by cloning the full-length human p11 cDNA into the pLin retroviral vector in the sense (pLin-p11S) or antisense orientation (pLin-p11AS) as reported (24.Ghahary A. Tredget E.E. Chang L.J. Scott P.G. Shen Q. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 800-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Control cells transduced with the vector alone (pLin-V) were also established. The pLin vector carries the Moloney murine leukemia virus 5′-long terminal repeat enhancer/promoter region to promote strong, constitutive expression of the cloned p11 inserts and neomycin phosphotransferase gene in mammalian cells. The pLin constructs were propagated in a PA317 retroviral packaging cell line. Packaging cells were selected in 300 μg/ml neomycin, and conditioned media that contained high titers of the virus were used to transduce the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. After viral transduction the neomycin-resistant HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells were cloned and permanent cell lines established. 2K. S. Choi, D. K. Fogg, and D. M. Waisman, manuscript in preparation. After purification or reconstitution, AIIt, p11, p36 (annexin II), other annexins, thioredoxin, protein disulfide isomerase, and phosphoglycerate kinase were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 140 mm NaCl under argon gas to prevent possible oxidation. 4 μm Glu-plasminogen was incubated with 0.075 μm u-PA and a candidate plasmin reductase protein (4 μm, unless described) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 140 mm NaCl at 37 °C for 2 h. A portion of reaction mixture was diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. To label any free thiol groups of produced protein(s), the reaction mixture was incubated with 100 μm MPB at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then treated with 200 μm reduced glutathione at room temperature for 10 min to quench the unreacted MPB. The unreacted glutathione and other free thiols in the reaction mixture were blocked with 400 μm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was incubated withl-Lys-Sepharose at room temperature for 30 min to purify the kringle-containing, plasminogen-derived proteins. The matrix was washed extensively with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 8.0), and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the resin with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each sample was subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (streptavidin-HRP) as indicated below. 2 μm AIIt, p11, or p36 was incubated with 100 μm MPB in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 140 mm NaCl at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation, 200 μmreduced glutathione and 400 μm iodoacetamide were added sequentially, and the reaction mixture was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot with streptavidin-HRP as indicated below. Transduced HT1080 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μmstreptomycin sulfate, and 300 μg/ml neomycin. Approximately 1 × 105 cells were added to each well of 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cell monolayers were then washed three times with DMEM, and 2 μmGlu-plasminogen, plasmin, or diisopropylfluorophosphate-treated plasmin in DMEM was added to each well. The conditioned medium was removed at indicated times, diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with monoclonal anti-human plasminogen kringle 1–3 antibody as indicated below. Samples were diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size) at 4 °C for 1 h. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TPBS) (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h and incubated at 4 °C overnight with a 0.4 μg/ml monoclonal anti-human plasminogen kringle 1–3 antibody in TPBS with 5% skim milk. The blot was washed extensively with TPBS at room temperature and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a 0.16 μg/ml HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in TPBS with 5% skim milk. In the case of MPB-reacted protein samples, the membrane was blocked and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a 0.1 μg/ml streptavidin-HRP in TPBS with 5% skim milk. The membrane was washed extensively with TPBS and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The purified A61 was iodinated according to manufacturer's procedures. Iodinated A61 retained biological activity as determined by the endothelial cell proliferation assay (14.Kassam G. Kwon M. Yoon C.-S. Graham K.S. Young M.K. Gluck S. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8924-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 96-well Immulon-1 Removawell strips (Dynex Technologies) were coated with a phospholipid mixture containing a 3:1 ratio of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylcholine and air dried. The coated strips were blocked with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) at room temperature for 2 h. The strips were washed with buffer A and incubated with 1 μm AIIt in buffer A at room temperature for 4 h. The strips were then washed and incubated with 0.008–5 μmiodinated A61 with or without 30-fold molar excess of cold A61 or bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, the strips were washed five times with PBS, and individual wells were detached and measured for radioactivity with a γ-counter. The data shown (n = 6) are the average of two separate experiments. Transduced HT1080 cells were harvested, and 1 × 106 cells in PBS were divided into each tube. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then incubated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-annexin II or anti-annexin II light chain antibody at room temperature for 30 min. For the control staining, 1 μg of mouse Ig G was used. The cells were washed and incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed and subjected to flow cytometric analysis using FACScan (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed by the FlowJo program. The data shown are a representative of three separate experiments. A61 is an internal fragment of plasminogen which encompasses the sequence Lys78-Lys468. For A61 to be released from plasmin, the Cys462-Cys541disulfide of plasmin must be reduced. The release of A61will therefore result in the generation of a free sulfhydryl residue at Cys462. Because plasminogen and plasmin contain only disulfides, A61 can be discriminated from these proteins on the basis of its reactivity with free sulfhydryl-reactive reagents such as MPB. The reaction of free sulfhydryl-containing proteins with MPB results in the biotinylation of the protein, which allows easy detection with streptavidin-HRP. As shown in Fig. 1A, lane 2, the incubation of u-PA with plasminogen resulted in the generation of plasmin. As expected, the plasmin generated by this reaction did not contain a free cysteinyl residue and therefore did not react with MPB (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, the addition of AIIt to the u-PA-plasminogen reaction resulted in the appearance of A61 (which displays a single major band and two minor bands of about 50 kDa on nonreduced SDS-PAGE) and disappearance of plasmin (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the A61 generated in these reactions reacted with MPB, confirming the presence of a free sulfhydryl in A61 (Fig. 1B). AIIt stimulated the dose- and time-dependent conversion of plasminogen to A61 (Fig. 1, A–D). The maximal conversion of plasminogen to A61 occurred at approximately equimolar concentrations of AIIt and plasminogen (Fig. 1, A and B). At equimolar concentrations the half-maximal conversion of plasminogen to A61 occurred between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1, C and D). Because AIIt stimulated the generation of A61 in the absence of sulfhydryl donors, our data suggest that AIIt promoted the cleavage of a plasmin disulfide, presumably the Cys462-Cys541disulfide, resulting in the release of A61 from plasmin and the generation of a free cysteine (Cys462) in A61. Interestingly, because AIIt loses reactivity to MPB during the reaction (data not shown) it is likely that AIIt becomes oxidized during plasmin reduction. AIIt is composed of two copies of a p36 and two copies of a p11 subunit. The p11 subunit plays a key role in plasminogen binding and stimulation of the plasminogen activator-catalyzed conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (18.Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to identify which subunit of AIIt was responsible for the plasmin reductase activity of AIIt. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the incubation of either the p36 or p11 subunit with u-PA and plasminogen stimulated the formation of A61. However, AIIt was a more potent plasmin reductase than either subunit, suggesting that the interaction of the subunits potentiated the plasmin reductase activity of either subunit. Theoretically, either the disulfides or cysteinyl residues of AIIt could participate in the reduction of plasmin. It is possible that upon plasmin(ogen) binding the disulfide of annexin II is reduced by the thiols of annexin II, and the newly formed thiols participate in reduction of plasmin. Because the p11 subunit does not contain disulfides we suspected that the thiols of this subunit were important for its plasmin reductase activity. p11 contains two cysteinyl residues: Cys61, which plays a critical role in the binding of p36, and Cys82, which is a free thiol (25.Johnsson N. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14464-14468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We prepared two recombinant forms of this subunit in which individual cysteinyl residues were mutated to serine. This conservative mutation results in the substitution of a thiol group for a hydroxyl group. As shown in Fig. 2B, substitution of either of these cysteine residues resulted in a loss of plasmin reductase activity of the p11 subunit. This suggests that both cysteinyl residues of p11 are required to sustain the plasmin reductase activity of the protein. Human p36 contains two thiol-containing cysteines, Cys8 and Cys334. As shown in Fig. 2B, substitution of Cys334, but not Cys8, with serine blocked the plasmin reductase activity of p36. This result suggests that the Cys334 thiol is critical for plasmin reductase activity of the p36 subunit. To identify the reactive thiols of AIIt we incubated AIIt and its individual subunits with MPB and resolved the mixture with SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3A) or Western blot with streptavidin-HRP (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, the p11 subunit and both C61S and C82S p11 mutants were labeled with MBP. In contrast, although p36 and the C334S p36 mutant were labeled with MPB, the C8S mutant was not labeled. This suggests that the thiols of the isolated p11 are accessible to MPB, whereas the Cys334 of p36 is not accessible. Interestingly, both the p36 and p11 subunits within AIIt were labeled with MPB. However, preincubation of AIIt with iodoacetic acid or MPB resulted in only a small decrease in the plasmin reductase activity of AIIt (Fig. 3C). This suggests that the Cys334 thiol of the p36 subunit of AIIt is inaccessible to the solvent. The Cys334 residue is highly conserved among many of the annexins. Because our data suggested that this residue participated in the plasmin reductase activity of p36, we suspected that other annexins that possess this cysteine might also have plasmin reductase activity. We therefore examined seven different annexins for plasmin reductase activity. As shown in Fig. 4, only annexin II (p36) and AIIt possessed plasmin reductase activity. This result establishes that plasmin reductase activity is not a common feature of the annexins. Previous data from our laboratory have established that AIIt binds both plasminogen and plasmin and is present at discrete regions of the extracellular surface (17.Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J.

In this investigation we demonstrated by high performance thin layer chromatography, gas chromatographic, and mass spectrometric analyses that GM3 is the main ganglioside constituent of these microdomains in human lymphocytes. Then we analyzed GM3 distribution and its interaction with the phosphorylation protein Zap-70. Human T lymphocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis revealed a clustered GM3 distribution over the cell surface and an intracellular localization resembling specific cytoplasmic compartment(s). Scanning confocal microscopy showed that T cell activation induced a significant association between GM3 and Zap-70, as revealed by nearly complete colocalization areas; very few colocalization areas were detected in unstimulated cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that GM3 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Zap-70 only after co-stimulation through CD3 and CD28 as detected by both thin layer chromatography and immunoblotting. Therefore, T cell activation does not promote a redistribution of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains but induces Zap-70 translocation in selective membrane domains in which Zap-70 may interact with GM3.

Immunol. 1996; 173: 131-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Previous immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopic studies revealed a clustered distribution of GM3 molecules on the cell surface of human PBL, clearly indicating the presence of glycosphingolipid (GM3)-enriched microdomains (GEM) (4.Sorice M.

They are involved in modulating signal transduction by GSL-GSL interaction, binding with specific antibodies, or assembly with signal transducer molecules (6.Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The variety of proteins detected in these domains isolated from different cell types is extremely wide (7.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). The presence of tyrosine kinase receptors, mono (Ras, Rap)- and heterotrimeric G proteins, Src-like tyrosine kinases (LCK, LYN, FYN), protein kinase C isozymes, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (8.Parolini I.

Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that, in lymphocytes, not only GM3 and cholesterol but also CD4 and p56lck are selectively recovered in GEM (4.Sorice M. Parolini I. Sansolini T. Garofalo T. Dolo V. Sargiacomo M. Tai T. Peschle C. Torrisi M.R. Pavan A. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 969-980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD4-p56lck complex represents one of the most important receptor systems in the T cell function, and CD4 is considered the TCR co-receptor in thymic selection, T cell activation, and cellular response (10.Blue M.L. Hafter D.A. Craig K.A. Levine H. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3949-3954PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Gay D. Buus S. Pasternak J. Kappler J. Marrak P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5629-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most of the CD4 functions are due to CD4 interaction with p56lck (12.Veillette A. Bookman N.A. Horak E.N. Samelson L.E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1989; 338: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in human T lymphocytes exogenous GM3 induces CD4 phosphorylation (13.Garofalo T. Sorice M. Misasi R. Cinque B. Giammatteo M. Pontieri G.M. Cifone M.G. Pavan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35153-35160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), dissociation from p56lck, and internalization via endocytic pits and vesicles (14.Sorice M. Pavan A.

Immunol. 1995; 41: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The role of GEM in lymphocyte activation became obvious after the demonstration that T cell activation by co-stimulation through CD28 led to the redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular kinase-rich microdomains at the site of TCR engagements (15.Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The hypothesis for the role of GEM in initiating TCR signaling has gained further support from the identification in them of two other crucial molecules, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (16.Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) (a substrate of phospholipase Cγ) and LAT (17.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

Immunol. 1999; 36: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (one of the earliest and major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins found following TCR triggering). LAT phosphorylated following Zap-70 activation. Zap-70, a Syk family kinase, is activated via both a self- and a Lck-dependent phosphorylation mechanism (19.Quian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and translocate from cytoplasmic compartment to the cell surface. It phosphorylates substrates, which in turn leads to the subsequent docking and activation of other Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing molecules involved in the amplification and diversification of TCR-initiated signaling. Zap-70 becomes GEM-associated (20.Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), taking advantage of its capability to bind monosialoganglioside GM1. However, this molecule has been shown to be virtually undetectable (1.Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or present at very low levels (2 × 10−18 g/cell) in resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes (27.Tuosto L. Parolini I. Schroeder S. Sargiacomo M. Lanzavecchia A. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, in this investigation we preliminarily analyzed the ganglioside pattern and composition of GEM and then focused on the distribution of the main ganglioside constituent of these domains and its interaction with the phosphorylation protein Zap-70 after T cell activation by CD3 and CD28 engagements.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsHuman PBL were isolated from fresh heparinized blood by Lymphoprep (Nycomed AS Pharma Diagnostic Div., Oslo, Norway) density gradient centrifugation and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Human T lymphocytes were stimulated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ) and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml, PharMingen, La Jolla, CA) antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C.Isolation and Analysis of Glycosphingolipid-enriched Microdomain FractionGEM fraction from human PBL were isolated as described previously (29.Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 108 cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, and 75 units of aprotinin and allowed to stand for 20 min. The cell suspension was mechanically disrupted by Dounce homogenization (10 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1300 × g to remove nuclei and large cellular debris. The supernatant fraction (postnuclear fraction) was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, i.e. the fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v) in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The resulting diluent was placed at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in the same buffer and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16–18 h at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated, and 11 fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. All steps were done at 0–4 °C. The amount of protein in each fraction was first quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The amount of cholesterol was evaluated as described previously (30.Huber L.A. Xu Q. Jurgens G. Bock G. Buhler E. Gey K.F. Schonitzer D. Trall K.N. Wick G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Free cholesterol was quantitated from TLC plates by densitometric scanning and comparison with the standard. The density of the bands used to quantitate cholesterol concentration fell within the linear range of compound concentration versus absorbance.Finally, the GEM fraction was subjected to ganglioside extraction according to the method of Svennerholm and Fredman (31.Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the GEM fraction was extracted twice in chloroform:methanol:water (4:8:3, v:v:v) and subjected to Folch partition by the addition of water resulting in a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 1:2:1.4. The upper phase, containing polar glycosphingolipids, was purified of salts and low molecular weight contaminants using Supelclean LC-18 columns, 3 ml (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA) according to the method of Williams and McCluer (32.Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The eluted glycosphingolipids were dried and separated by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) using silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck). Chromatography was performed in chloroform:methanol:0.25% aqueous KCl (5:4:1, v:v:v). Plates were then air-dried, and gangliosides were visualized with resorcinol (33.Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar).Isolation and Gas Chromatographic Analysis of GM3 from GEMGM3 was isolated by HPTLC from the GEM fraction ganglioside extract. After exposure to iodide vapors, the band comigrating with standard GM3 was scraped, eluted from silica with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v), and dried under nitrogen.The identification of carbohydrates was carried out by methanolysis with 3 n methanolic HCl as reported (34.Esselman W.J. Laine R.A. Sweeley C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 149-163Google Scholar). Trimethylsilylmethylglycosides were injected into a SPB-5 fused silica capillary column programmed at 5 °C/min from 150 to 210 °C, maintained isothermally for 5 min, and programmed at 5 °C/min from 210 to 280 °C. As standards, p-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) were used.The identification of sialic acid was performed as described (35.Schauer R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 50: 83-84Google Scholar) after methanolysis in 0.05 n methanolic-HCl. The thoroughly dried products were converted to trimethylsilyl ester derivatives with 50 μl of trimethylsilylimidazole (Supelchem) at 70 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were injected into a SPB-5 fused silica capillary column programmed at 3 °C/min from 220 to 280 °C. As standard, 2-O-(p-nitrophenyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma) was used.The types and the percentages of fatty acids were determined as methyl esters after vigorous methanolysis with 0.5 n anhydrous HCl at 80 °C for 18 h. After cooling, the solution was extracted four times with hexane. The hexane phases containing the fatty acids methyl esters were collected, dried, and injected (0.5 μl in CH2Cl2) into an SPB-2380 fused silica capillary column programmed at 5 °C/min from 140 to 170 °C.Dry ganglioside was hydrolyzed using 5 n aqueous HCl:methanol:1:4, as described (36.Barenholz Y. Gatt S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 529-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The sphingosine bases were derivatized and analyzed as trimethylsilyl esters under the same conditions reported for the identification of carbohydrates.Purification and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of GM3 from GEMGM3 was isolated from the GEM fraction ganglioside extract by HPLC on amino silica columns, as already reported (37.Previti M Dotta F. Di Pontieri G.M. Mario U. Lenti L. J. Chromatogr.aphy. 1992; 605: 221-225Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The use of an on-line variable wavelength diode array detector allows the identification and quantitative determination of GM3 on the basis of its UV spectrum and accurately acquired analytical data. The GM3 peak was collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) using an Applied Biosystems Sciex API III tandem mass spectrometer (Applera Italia, Monza, Italy), equipped with articulated ion spray source. Mass calibration and resolution were checked with a polypropylene glycol solution. The MS experiments were run with a resolution better than 0.8 atomic mass unit; for the MS/MSMS runs, resolution for both quadrupoles was set at 1 atomic mass unit. All of the instrumental operating parameters were standard except the orifice voltage, which was operated at 50 V. MS/MSMS gas collision fragmentation was run at a collision energy of 50 eV with argon at a thickness of 280 × 1012 molecules/cm2. Sample was dissolved in an aqueous solution of 50% ethanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 2 mm ammonium acetate. The introduction was operated by a Harvard infusion pump at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. MS and MSMS spectra were collected at a rate of 10 ms/atomic mass unit with a step size of 0.1 atomic mass unit for MS and 1 atomic mass unit for MSMS experiments. Acquired data were processed by MacSpec software; the Hypermass option was used to handle data concerning multiply charged ions.TLC Immunostaining AnalysisImmunostaining was performed using as antigen about 2 μg of the ganglioside extract from either untreated or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-treated lymphocytes. Gangliosides were separated by TLC using HPTLC aluminum-backed silica gel 60 plates (Merck). Plates were soaked in a 0.2% solution of polyisobutylmethacrylate in hexane for 90 s, air-dried, and incubated in the blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The blocking solution was removed and replaced by washing buffer (TBS). The plates were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-GD3 mAb (R24, Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) in 1% bovine serum albumin-TBS. The antibody was removed, and plates were washed three times for 10 min with TBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in 1% bovine serum albumin-TBS was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The color reaction was obtained by adding 200 mg of sodium nitroprusside (Sigma) and 80 mg of o-dianisidine (Sigma) dissolved in 100 ml of H20 containing 35 μl of 30% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by washing in distilled water. As a control for nonspecific reactivity, parallel blots were performed as described above using an anti-mouse IgG3 (Sigma).Immunofluorescence AnalysisHuman PBL were incubated with GMR6 anti-GM3 mAb (38.Kotani M. Ozawa H. Kawashima I. Ando S. Tai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. T. Tai, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by three washes in PBS and the addition (30 min at 4 °C) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma). Cells were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In parallel experiments, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature before incubation with anti-GM3 mAb.Analysis of GM3-Zap-70 Colocalization on the Cell Surface by Scanning Confocal MicroscopyHuman PBL were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and labeled with anti-Zap-70 mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition (30 min at 4 °C) of Texas red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with GMR6 anti-GM3 mAb (38.Kotani M. Ozawa H. Kawashima I. Ando S. Tai T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by three washes in PBS and the addition (30 min at 4 °C) of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma). In parallel experiments, cells were stained with anti-GM3 mAb before fixing the cells. Cells were finally washed three times in PBS and resuspended in glycerol/Tris-HCl, pH 9.2. The images were acquired through a confocal laser scanning microscope (Sarastro 2000, Molecular Dynamics) equipped with a Nikon Optiphot microscope and an argon ion laser. Simultaneously, the green (FITC) and the red (Texas red, which reduces greatly overlapping) fluorophores were excited at 488 and 518 nm. Acquisition of single FITC-stained samples in dual fluorescence scanning configuration did not show overlapping. Images were collected at 512 × 512 pixels.Co-immunoprecipitation of GM3 and Zap-70Co-immunoprecipitation of GM3 and Zap-70 was performed according to Iwabuchi et al. (39.Iwabuchi K. Handa K. Hakomori S.I. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 448-494Google Scholar). Briefly, human PBL were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml). Cell-free lysates (containing 20–25 μg of protein) were mixed with protein G-acrylic beads and stirred by a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear nonspecific binding. After centrifugation (500 ×g for 1 min), the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-Zap-70 mAb (Upstate Biotechnology) plus protein G-acrylic beads. A mouse IgG isotypic control (Sigma) was employed.The immunoprecipitates were split into two aliquots. A portion was then subjected to ganglioside extraction as reported above. Another portion of the immunoprecipitates was electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) after 10% SDS-PAGE and then probed with polyclonal anti-Zap-70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or, alternatively, with GMR6 anti-GM3 mAb. The bound antibodies were then visualized with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgM (Sigma), respectively. Immunoreactivity was assessed by chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL Western blocking detection system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSGanglioside Pattern and Composition of GEM in Human PBLWe investigated the ganglioside composition of GEM fraction of lymphocyte plasma membrane. Gangliosides were extracted in chloroform:methanol:water and separated in HPTLC as reported above. Three main resorcinol-positive bands were shown: (a) comigrating with GM3, (b) between GM3 and GM1, and (c) between GM1 and GD1a. The GM3 content, determined as lipid-bound sialic acid, was 17.5 ± 1.4 μg/mg of protein in the GEM fraction as compared with 0.864 ± 0.1 μg/mg of protein in total lymphocytes (Table I). The two other main bands, migrating between GM1 and GD1a (4.375 ± 0.3versus 0.168 ± 0.02 μg/mg of protein) and between GM3 and GM1 (1.2 ± 0.1 versus 0.084 ± 0.01 μg/mg of protein) also revealed a significant enrichment in the GEM fraction as compared with the total cell lysate.Table IGanglioside composition of GEMGlycosphingolipidsGEMTotal lymphocytesμg/mg of proteinμg/mg of proteinGM317.5 ± 1.40.864 ± 0.1Band x4.375 ± 0.30.168 ± 0.02Band y1.2 ± 0.10.084 ± 0.01Cholesterol/total cell phospholipid ratio7.75 ± 2.400.35 ± 0.17Quantitative analysis of ganglioside scraped bands was performed by measuring the lipid-bound sialic acid. Cholesterol was quantified according to the method described by Huber et al. (30.Huber L.A. Xu Q. Jurgens G. Bock G. Buhler E. Gey K.F. Schonitzer D. Trall K.N. Wick G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2761-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Band x, migrating between GM1 and GD1a, was immunostained by anti-GD3 mAb. It does not exclude the presence of sialosyl paragloboside, as described (1.Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40.Sekine M. Ariga T. Miyatake T. Kuroda Y. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Band y, migrating between GM3 and GM1, was characterized as sialosyl lactohexaosyl ceramide, as reported (1.Kiguchi K. Henning-Chubb B.C. Huberman E. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40.Sekine M. Ariga T. Miyatake T. Kuroda Y. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The identity of the GM3 comigrating band was verified by gas liquid chromatographic (GLC) analysis as reported previously (2.Misasi R. Sorice M. Griggi T. d'Agostino F. Garofalo T. Masala C. Pontieri G.M. Lenti L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 67: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the hydrophilic head galactose, glucose (Fig. 1a), and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 1:1:1 were found. Lymphocytic GM3 showed the same retention time peaks (α and β anomers of methylketosides of sialic acid) as those of standard N-acetylneuraminic acid (Fig. 1b); in the hydrophobic part, the main fatty acids were C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C15:0 (Fig. 1c). Long-chain bases were analyzed by GLC as O-trimethysilyl derivatives. GM3 exclusively gave n-C18-sphingenine, which accounted for more than 95% of the long-chain bases.The MS analysis of GM3 from GEM fraction ganglioside extract confirmed the identity of the molecule (Fig. 2a). The linkage of sialic acid and sugars was analyzed both by GM3 fragmentation after mild alkaline hydrolysis at pH 7 (Fig. 2b) and by GM3 fragmentation under acidic conditions (Fig. 2c).Figure 2MS analysis of GM3 from lymphocytic GEM fraction ganglioside extract. a, MS spectrum of GM3 from HPLC containing phospholipids contaminants. b, MSMS spectrum of GM3 fragmented after mild alkaline hydrolysis at pH 7 (M+Na)+ 1204. c, MSMS spectrum of GM3 fragmented under acidic conditions (M+H)+ 1182.

Gangliosides were extracted in chloroform:methanol:water and separated in HPTLC as reported above. Again, three main resorcinol-positive bands were shown: (a) comigrating with GM3, (b) between GM3 and GM1, and (c) between GM1 and GD1a (Fig. 3a). In both cell types, the GM3 double band is due to the heterogeneity of fatty acid composition as described (40.Sekine M. Ariga T. Miyatake T. Kuroda Y. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). No significant differences in the amount of single gangliosides were observed (Fig. 3a).Figure 3a, HPTLC analysis of the ganglioside pattern of anti-CD3- and CD28-treated and untreated human PBL.

https://openalex.org/W2050916798,"The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is a nuclear protein that regulates alternative splicing. In addition, it plays a role in the cytoplasm during infection by some viruses and functions as a positive effector of hepatitis B virus RNA export. Thus, it presumably contains a nuclear export signal (NES). Using a heterokaryon export assay in transfected cultured cells, we have shown that the N-terminal 25 amino acid residues of PTB function as an autonomous NES, with residues 11–16 being important for its activity. Unlike the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 NES, this NES is separable from the nuclear localization signal, which spans the entire N-terminal 60 residues of PTB. The PTB NES cannot be shown to bind to CAS or Crm1, cellular receptors known to export proteins from the nucleus, and it functions in the presence of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of Crm1-dependent export. PTB deleted of its NES, unlike wild type PTB, does not stimulate the export of hepatitis B virus RNA. Therefore, the PTB NES is a functionally important domain of this multifunctional protein that utilizes an unknown export receptor. The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is a nuclear protein that regulates alternative splicing. In addition, it plays a role in the cytoplasm during infection by some viruses and functions as a positive effector of hepatitis B virus RNA export. Thus, it presumably contains a nuclear export signal (NES). Using a heterokaryon export assay in transfected cultured cells, we have shown that the N-terminal 25 amino acid residues of PTB function as an autonomous NES, with residues 11–16 being important for its activity. Unlike the heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 NES, this NES is separable from the nuclear localization signal, which spans the entire N-terminal 60 residues of PTB. The PTB NES cannot be shown to bind to CAS or Crm1, cellular receptors known to export proteins from the nucleus, and it functions in the presence of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of Crm1-dependent export. PTB deleted of its NES, unlike wild type PTB, does not stimulate the export of hepatitis B virus RNA. Therefore, the PTB NES is a functionally important domain of this multifunctional protein that utilizes an unknown export receptor. nuclear localization signal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole human immunodeficiency virus nuclear export signal phosphate-buffered saline polypyrimidine tract-binding protein Ran-binding protein 1 posttranscriptional regulatory element heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein nucleoplasmin core region cytomegalovirus fluorescein isothiocyanate The presence of a nucleus physically separated from the remainder of the cell by the nuclear envelope is the defining characteristic of eukaryotes. This compartmentalization is thought to allow greater cellular complexity. However, it also presents a challenge in requiring the controlled trafficking of various macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. All such movement takes place through nuclear pores that are protein-lined aqueous channels penetrating the double membranes of the nuclear envelope (1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 3Weis K.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Because of the size of the pores, large macromolecules must be actively transported through them, and even many small macromolecules appear to cross the nuclear envelope by active transport rather than simple diffusion. In recent years the molecular details of the import and export processes have been partly elucidated. It is now clear that most cargoes (proteins and RNA) are ferried across nuclear pores by a family of receptor proteins (for simplicity hereon collectively called the transportins, although many other names are used in the literature, including importins, exportins, karyopherins, and Ran-binding proteins) (see Refs. 1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, and references therein). These receptors bind to their cargoes via motifs on the cargo proteins known as nuclear localization signals (NLS)1 or nuclear export signals (NES). These receptors also interact with components of the nuclear pore complex, thereby accounting for their ability to carry cargoes across the pore. To provide directionality to cargo movement, transportins also bind to a small GTPase called Ran. Because of the cytosolic localization of proteins that activate the GTPase activity of Ran but the nuclear localization of proteins that stimulate exchange of GDP for GTP on Ran, Ran is thought to exist largely in the GDP-bound state in the cytosol but in the GTP-bound state in the nucleus. Export receptors such as Crm1 bind to their cargoes only as a ternary complex with RanGTP, i.e. in the nucleus. When the complex reaches the cytosol, the presence of GTPase stimulating factors causes the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP and the subsequent release of both cargo and Crm1 from Ran. The transportin-type receptors are responsible for the import and export of most RNA and protein molecules in the cell. However, a few non-transportin family proteins apparently interact directly with nuclear pore proteins to cross the nuclear envelope. Examples include NTF2, which reimports RanGDP into the nucleus (5Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 6Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TAP, which exports simian retroviral mRNA and probably other cargoes out of the nucleus (7Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The export receptors responsible for the nuclear export of some proteins are now known. Most are exported by Crm1 (1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), which recognizes a small leucine-rich NES such as the one present in the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV I) Rev protein (8Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 9Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), although at least one protein with a large NES spread over 150 residues also binds to Crm1 (12Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartmann E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Another receptor known to export proteins is CAS, which is a transportin family member that binds to a large NES in the importin α family of proteins (13Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 14Hood J.K. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35142-35146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, the export receptors for many other proteins, including hnRNP proteins and SR proteins, remain unknown, although NES have been localized in some of these proteins. The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB, also called hnRNP I) is an RNA-binding protein that is involved in regulation of splicing and is nuclear in localization at steady state (15Valcarcel J. Gebauer F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R705-R708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it also appears to be an accessory factor in the cap-independent translation of some RNA viruses (16Gosert R. Chang K.H. Rijnbrand R. Yi M. Sangar D.V. Lemon S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which takes place in the cytoplasm. PTB has been shown to shuttle rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm and thus has also been postulated to be involved in mRNA export (17Michael W.M. Siomi H. Choi M. Pinol-Roma S. Nakielny S. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown that PTB binds to the RNA export element of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and acts as a positive effector of HBV RNA export (18Zang W.Q. Li B. Huang P.Y. Lai M.M.C. Yen T.S.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10779-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, because PTB shows avid RNA binding, it is also possible that PTB exits the nucleus passively by “piggy-backing” on RNA molecules that are exported by other protein factors. To resolve this issue, we have analyzed PTB to look for a putative NES. Our results show that PTB has an autonomous NES distinct from its RNA binding domains. This NES is relatively short and contains two critical basic residues. Yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that the PTB NES does not bind to either Crm1 or CAS, two transportin family members known to export proteins from the nucleus, nor is its NES function blocked by leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of Crm1-mediated export. Deletion of the NES renders PTB incapable of activating the export of HBV RNA. Therefore, the PTB NES is a functionally important domain of PTB that apparently utilizes an export receptor other than Crm1 or CAS. The human PTB cDNA plasmid pG15 was kindly provided by P. Sharp and P. McCaw (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) (19Gil A. Sharp P.A. Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). TheXenopus laevis nucleoplasmin cDNA plasmid was kindly provided by I. Mattaj and L. Englmeier (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). PTB codons 1–60 were made by PCR amplification of pG15 to generate a 208-bp DNA fragment, which had a NcoI site at the start codon and aXhoI site right after the 60th codon, using primers PTB001 and PTB002 (see Table I for primer sequences). The nucleoplasmin core region (NPc) was made by PCR amplification of the nucleoplasmin cDNA with a XhoI site just before the 2nd codon and a NotI site right after the 150th codon (primers NPC001 and NPC002, respectively). The PTB1–60 fragment digested with NcoI and XhoI and the NPc fragment digested with XhoI and NotI were simultaneously subcloned between the NcoI andNotI sites of pCMV/myc/cyto (Invitrogen) to make pCMV/PTB1–60/NPc/myc. The DNA encoding the SV-40 large T antigen NLS (amino acid sequence PKKKRKVEDP) was made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides with a XhoI site at one end and aNotI site at the other end (oligonucleotides NLS001 and NLS002). This DNA fragment was digested with XhoI andNotI and subcloned between the XhoI andNotI sites of pCMV/myc/cyto to make pCMV/NLS/myc. A NPc DNA fragment with a SalI site just before the 2nd codon and aXhoI site right after the 150th codon was amplified by PCR from the cDNA clone using primers NPC003 and NPC004, digested withSalI and XhoI, and subcloned between theSalI and XhoI sites of pCMV/NLS/myc to make pCMV/NPc/NLS/myc. To fuse portions of PTB with the NPc coding region, PTB cDNA fragments were generated by PCR from pG15, digested withNcoI and SalI, and subcloned between theNcoI and SalI sites of pCMV/NPc/NLS/myc. Primers used were as follows: for PTB codons 1–25, PTB001 and PTB009; for PTB codons 18–42, PTB007 and PTB008; for PTB codons 35–60, PTB005 and PTB006; for codons PTB1–20, CMV001 and PTB015; for PTB codons 1–15, CMV001 and PTB016; for PTB codons 5–25, PTB013 and NPC004; for PTB codons 10–25, PTB014 and NPC004.Table IList of oligonucleotidesNameSequence (5′ to 3′)CAS01CGCGGCGGCCGCTGGAACTCAGCGATGCAAATCCAS02CGCGGCGGCCGCAAGCAGTGTCACACTGGCTGCCMV001ATAGGGGTTCCGCGCACATTTCCCCGNLS001CGCGCTCGAGCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAGAAGACCCCG CGGCCGCCGCGNLS002CGCGGCGGCCGCGGGGTCTTCTACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGCTCGAGCGCGNSF01CATGGCGGGCCGGAGTATGCAAGCTGCGAGGTGCGGTACAAAGCGGGGATCTTTAAGCAACTGTGCAGTTGTGAGCGNSF02TCGACGCTCACAACTGCACAGTTCGTTAAAGATCCCCGCTTTGTACCGCACCTCGCAGCTTGCATACTCCGGCCCGCNSF03GTCGCGAGGTGCCCTACAGATGAGTTATCTTTAAGCNSF04GCTTAAAGATAACTCATCTGTAGGGCACCTCGCAGCNPC001CGCGCTCGAGGCCTCTACAGTGAGCNPC002CGGCGGCCGCTGGAGATTCTTGATCTTCNPC003CGCGGTCGACGCCTCTACAGTGAGCAACNPC004CGCGCTCGAGTGGAGATTCTTGATCTTCPKI01AATTCAATGAATTAGCCTTGAAATTAGCAGGTCTTGATATCAACAAGACAGGPKI02TCGACCTGTCTTGTTGATATCAAGACCTGCTAATTTCAAGGCTAATTCATTGPTB001CGGTCTGCTCTGTGTGCCATPTB002CGCGCTCGAGCACTCTAGAGGGGACGPTB005CGCGCCATGGCTTCTGCAGCAAACGGPTB006CGCCGTCGACCACTCTAGAGGGGACGPTB007CGCGCCATGGAGCTTTTCTCTACTTGPTB008CGCGGTCGACATTTCCGTTTGCTGCAGPTB009CGCGGTCGACAGTGACACAAGTAGAGPTB013CGCGCCATGGTCCCAGATATAGCCGTTGGPTB014CGCGCCATGGTTGGTACAAAGCGGGGPTB015CGCGGTCGACGAAAAGCTCGTCAGATCCPTB016CGCGGTCGACTCCCCGCTTTGTACCAACPTB023CTGTGGATCCTGGACGGCATTGTCCCPTB024CGCGAGATCTTGATAAACGGTCCGTTAGPTB025GCCACCATGGCCGCCGCTGTCCCAGATPTB026ATCTGGGACAGCGGCGGCCATGGTGGCPTB027GACGGCATTGCCGCAGCTATAGCCGTTPTB028AACGGCTATAGCTGCGGCAATGCCGTCPTB029GTCCCAGATGCAGCCGCTGGTACAAAGPTB030CTTTGTACCAGCGGCTGCATCTGGGACPTB031ATAGCCGTTGCTGCAGCGCGGGGATCTPTB032AGATCCCCGCGCTGCAGCAACGGCTATPTB033GGTACAAAGGCGGCAGCTGACGAGCTTPTB034AAGCTCGTCAGCTGCCGCCTTTGTACCPTB035CGGGGATCTGCCGCGGCTTTCTCTACTPTB036AGTAGAGAAAGCCGCGGCAGATCCCCGPTB037TGACGAGCTTGCCGCTGCTTGTGTCACPTB038GTGACACAAGCAGCGGCAAGCTCGTCAPTB039TTTCTCTACTGCTGCCGCTGTCGACGCPTB040GCGTCGACAGCGGCAGCAGTAGAGAAAPTB041ATAGCCGTTGGTGCAAAGCGGGGATCTPTB042AGATCCCCGCTTTGCACCAACGGCTATPTB043GCCGTTGGTACAGCGCGGGGATCTGACPTB044GTCAGATCCCCGCGCTGTACCAACGGCPTB045GTTGGTACAAAGGCGGGATCTGACGAGPTB046CTCGTCAGATCCCGCCTTTGTACCAACPTB047ACAAAGCGGGGAGCTGACGAGCTTTTCPTB048GAAAAGCTCGTCAGCTCCCCGCTTTGTPTB050ATAGCCGTTGCTACAAAGCGGGGATCTPTB051AGATCCCCGCTTTGTAGCAACGGCTATPTB052GGTACAAAGCGGGCATCTGACGAGCTTPTB053AAGCTCGTCAGATGCCCGCTTTGTACCPTB054ATAGCCGTTGGTGATAAGCGGGGATCTPTB055AGATCCCCGCTTATCACCAACGGCTATPTB056GGTACAAAGCGGGGAGATGACGAGCTTPTB057AAGCTCGTCATCTCCCCGCTTTGTACCPTB058CGCGCTCGAGAACGGACCGTTTATCATGPTB061CGCGCTCGAGGATGGTGGACTTGGAGAAGGAGPTB062CGCGGAATTCATGGACGGCATTGTCCCAGATPTB063CGCGGTCGACCTAGATGGTGGACTTGGAGAAGGAGSRP01CGCGGGATTCTGTCCACCAACGAGAATGCSRP02CGCGAGATCTGAAAGTTAAAGGTCCCAGGAGCXP001CGCGGCGGCCGCTGGAAGGAATTTTGGATTTTTCTXP002CGCGGCGGCCGCATCATCAAGTTCGGAAGGTTT Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis of pCMV/PTB1–25/NPc/myc was done with the PCR-based QuikChange kit from Stratagene following the protocol in the instruction manual.

The plasmid pCMV-PTB-myc/cyto expresses human PTB with a Myc epitope tag at the C terminus and was constructed by using PCR to generate the entire human PTB cDNA and inserting this fragment between theXhoI and NotI sites of the plasmid pCMV-myc/cyto (Invitrogen). The plasmid pCMV-PTBΔNES-myc/cyto expresses PTB with codons 2–25 deleted. The partial PTB cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of pG15 with primers PTB058 and PTB061. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and cloned into the XhoI site of pCMV/NLS/myc. All of the PCR-generated regions of the above plasmids were sequenced at the University of California San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center, to confirm the lack of unintended mutations. The bait and prey plasmids (BTM116 and pVP16, respectively) (20Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by S. Hollenberg (Oregon Health Sciences University) via E. Huang (University of California, San Francisco, CA). PTB codons 1–30 were made by PCR amplification of pG15 with primers PTB023 and PTB024. This fragment was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BamHI site in BTM116 to make plexPTB1–30; orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Full-length PTB was amplified by PCR with pG15 as a template and primers PTB062 and PTB063. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and SalI and cloned into pBTM116 to make plexPTB-FL. Two complementary oligonucleotides PKI01 and PKI02, which encode the protein kinase inhibitor NES (21Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), were annealed to each other and cloned between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBTM116 to make plexNES. The human importin α cDNA plasmid pRSET-hSRP1α was kindly provided by K. Weis (University of California, Berkeley, CA) (22Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The whole coding region of hSRP1α was amplified from this plasmid by PCR using primers SRP01 and SRP02. This DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and BglII and subcloned into the BamHI site in BTM116 to make plexSRP; orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The human Crm1 cDNA plasmid pKW466 was kindly provided by Karsten Weis (9Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

The PCR product was digested withNotI and cloned into the NotI site of pVP16 to make pVP16/Xpo; orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The CAS cDNA plasmid pcDNA3-CAS was kindly provided by I. Pastan (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (23Brinkmann U. Brinkmann E. Gallo M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The whole coding region of CAS was amplified from this plasmid by PCR using primers CAS01 and CAS02 and subcloned into theNotI site of the prey plasmid pVP16 to make pVP16/CAS; orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. All of the PCR-generated regions of the above plasmids were sequenced at the University of California San Francisco Biomolecular Resource Center, to confirm the lack of unintended mutations. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid pDM138 was kindly provided by T. Parslow (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and contains the SV40 enhancer/early promoter driving the expression of a chimeric CAT/HIV-1 mRNA that is not highly expressed unless an export element is present within the transcribed region (24Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pDM138-PRE contains the entire HBV export element (PRE) inserted downstream of the CAT gene in the transcribed region of pDM138 (25Huang Z.M. Yen T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HuH-7 human hepatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of HuH-7 cells was done with the calcium phosphate method in 60-mm dishes (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) (26Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 2. IRL, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Each dish was transfected with 2.5 μg of the CAT plasmid and 1.5 μg of the PTB-expressing plasmid or the empty vector. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested for CAT assay, as described previously (25Huang Z.M. Yen T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3864-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To look for nuclear export of PTB derivatives, the human-mouse heterokaryon assay was used (17Michael W.M. Siomi H. Choi M. Pinol-Roma S. Nakielny S. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). HuH-7 human hepatoma cells and mouse NIH 3T3 cells were separately cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of HuH-7 cells was done with the calcium phosphate method in 60-mm dishes (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) (26Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 2. IRL, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). At 30 h after transfection, the transfected HuH-7 cells were mixed with an equal number of NIH 3T3 cells and seeded onto a two-well chamber slide. After overnight incubation, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the culture medium to inhibit protein synthesis. After 45 min, the cocultured cells were fused with 50% polyethylene glycol 8000 in serum-free medium for 1 min (27Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), washed once with medium containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and incubated in medium containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for another 1 h before fixation and immunostaining. The effect of a mutant Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1) with a mutated NES on export mediated by the PTB NES was determined by co-transfection, as described previously (18Zang W.Q. Li B. Huang P.Y. Lai M.M.C. Yen T.S.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10779-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 48Zolotukhin A.S. Felber B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11356-11360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because a small but significant portion of Rev can be present in the cytoplasm at steady state (28Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the heterokaryon assay is not suitable for examining nuclear export of Rev. Instead, we examined the subcellular localization of Rev following actinomycin D treatment, which decreases the relative rate of Rev import versusexport and hence causes Rev to localize to the cytoplasm at steady state (28Soros V. Cochrane A. Virology. 2001; 280: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Stauber R. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, HuH-7 cells were transfected with pDM121 (courtesy of T. Parslow), which expresses HIV-1 Rev (24Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 days, the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 45 min, followed by 1 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h and processed for immunostaining. In some experiments, 2.5 ng/ml leptomycin B was added 1 h before addition of cycloheximide. The cells were fixed and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min. Immunostaining with primary antibody was done by incubating the cells with a mouse anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:100 dilution and a rabbit anti-β-galactosidase antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) at 1:250 dilution in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibody staining was done by incubating the cells with PBS containing FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) at 1:25 dilution, Cy3-labeled sheep anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) at 1:50 dilution, and PBS-saturated 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h. The stained cells were washed, coverslipped, and visualized with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. Staining for Rev was performed in the identical manner with a mouse anti-Rev antibody (Intracel Corp.). Yeast transformation of strain L40 was done with the CLONTECH Yeast Transformation System following the protocol provided. Filter-lift β-galactosidase assay and liquid β-galactosidase assay usingo-nitrophenylgalactoside were performed using standard protocols (30Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 13.6.2-13.6.6Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that, in a heterokaryon assay, PTB is rapidly exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (17Michael W.M. Siomi H. Choi M. Pinol-Roma S. Nakielny S. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed this observation (18Zang W.Q. Li B. Huang P.Y. Lai M.M.C. Yen T.S.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10779-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, because PTB binds RNA, it remained possible that PTB was leaving the nucleus by “piggy-backing” on RNA molecules being exported by other factors. To confirm that PTB has an autonomous NES, we utilized this assay to determine whether PTB without its RNA binding domains is a shuttle protein. The RNA binding domains of PTB have been mapped to be downstream of amino acid residue 60 (31, 32). We therefore fused the first 60 codons of the human PTB cDNA to the cDNA coding for NPc, which forms a large pentamer in the nucleus and hence cannot leave the nucleus without an exogenous NES (27Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The fusion gene also codes for the Myc epitope tag at the C terminus, to facilitate visualization of the expressed chimeric protein with fluorescence microscopy; it should be noted that all other chimeric proteins used in this study also contain this epitope. The fusion gene was placed under the control of the CMV promoter in a mammalian expression plasmid, which was transfected into HuH-7 human hepatoma cells. After 2 days, the cells were fixed and stained for the chimeric protein by immunofluorescence and for DNA with DAPI. Most of the human cells showed no immunostaining, because only a minority of cells are transfected with our protocol. Scattered cells showed staining that was restricted to the nucleus (see example in Fig.1 A; compare with nuclear staining in Fig. 1 B), confirming previous data showing that the N-terminal 60 residues of PTB comprise its NLS (32Perez I.

Cell Res. 1997; 235: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The experiment was then repeated, but, before being fixed, the cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide, fused to murine 3T3 cells, and then incubated for 1 h in the presence of cycloheximide. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed staining not only of human nuclei but also of murine nuclei, identified by the presence of distinctive nuclear granules (Fig. 1, C and D,arrow identifies one murine nucleus) (27Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 34Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heterokaryon formation was confirmed by staining for β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 E), which was expressed from a plasmid co-transfected into the human cells. The human nuclei from the cell(s) that had been transfected could be identified by the presence of more intense staining for the chimeric protein (Fig. 1 C,chevrons; note the lack of nuclear granules in Fig.1 D). Because the murine cells were not transfected with any plasmids, the only manner by which their nuclei could contain the chimeric protein is by the protein being rapidly exported out of the transfected human nuclei and then imported into the murine nuclei of heterokaryons. As negative control, we used NPc fused to the SV40 T antigen NLS. In this case, scattered human nuclei showed staining for the chimeric protein (chevrons, Fig. 1, F andG), whereas no staining was seen in any murine nuclei. The formation of heterokaryons was confirmed by the presence of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase expressed from a co-transfected plasmid (Fig.1 H). The lack of export was not caused by interference from the T antigen NLS, because we could demonstrate export of another chimera comprising the N-terminal 60 residues of PTB, NPc, and the T antigen NLS (Fig. 1, I–K). Therefore, the N-terminal 60 residues of PTB can function as both NLS and NES. The M9 NES of hnRNPA1 shows both NLS and NES activity, which cannot be separated from each other by extensive mutagenesis or deletion analysis (27Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G.

https://openalex.org/W1964566400,"We previously reported that enhanced transcriptional activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) contributed to [12Val]K-Ras-mediated NIH3T3 cell transformation. Functional inactivation of ERα by a dominant negative mutant of ERα (DNER) in the presence of activated K-Ras 4B mutant arrested the cell cycle at G0/G1, subsequently provoking replicative cell senescence, finally abrogating tumorigenic potential. p53-dependent up-regulation of p21 was implicated in this cell senescence induction. Alterations in the MDM2 protein in response to DNER accounted for this p21-mediated cell senescence induction. An oncogenic K-Ras 4B mutant significantly increased MDM2 proteins coprecipitated with p53, and suppressed p53 transcriptional activity. In turn, DNER exerted its function to decrease MDM2 proteins coprecipitated with p53, followed by the stimulation of p53 activity in the presence of the oncogenic K-Ras 4B mutant. In addition, overexpression of wild type ERα in NIH3T3 cells resulted in the significant increase in the MDM2 protein level and the resultant suppression of p53 transcriptional activity. Finally, we demonstrated that c-Jun expression overcame the suppression and resultant enhancement of p21 protein level in response to DNER. The data imply that the ERα-AP1 pathway activated by oncogenic K-Ras 4B mutant contributes to the NIH3T3 cells' transformation by modulating p53 transcriptional activity through MDM2. We previously reported that enhanced transcriptional activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) contributed to [12Val]K-Ras-mediated NIH3T3 cell transformation.

The prevalence of Ras mutations in human cancer reaches ∼30% of all cancers and is thus the most frequently activated oncogene overall (1.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Ras is a point of convergence for most mitogenic extracellular stimuli. Ras activation occurs by recruitment to the membrane, followed by recognition of specific tyrosine phosphorylated sites in growth factor receptors. As extracellular signals converge on Ras, a number of intracellular signals are sprayed from it. In this manner, Ras activates signaling routes that have been implicated in cellular proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal changes, and so on (2.Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In particular, the MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseERestrogen receptorDNERdominant negative estrogen receptorEREestrogen response elementE217-β-estradiolAFactivation functionDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferaseSAsenescence-associatedwtwild typeAbantibodyCDKcyclin dependent kinaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinaseERestrogen receptorDNERdominant negative estrogen receptorEREestrogen response elementE217-β-estradiolAFactivation functionDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCATchloramphenicol acetyl transferaseSAsenescence-associatedwtwild typeAbantibodyCDKcyclin dependent kinaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast cascade formed by the kinases Raf/MEK/ERK is essential for cell proliferation. The role of Ras in cell-cycle progression is not only circumscribed to the transition from quiescence to proliferation, but also during subsequent steps of the cell cycle. The most important effect of Ras activity in the late G1 phase seems to be the phosphorylation of pRb (3.Lloyd A.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5096) Google Scholar).The estrogen signal, which is potently mitogenic, is transmitted to the nucleus by binding with the estrogen receptor (ER). The dimerized E2·ER complex tightly binds to estrogen response element (ERE) acting as a transcription factor that can regulate gene expression, a phenomenon that depends on the presence of E2. Although the mechanism by which the ER mediates its biological activities is not entirely clear, recent studies have shown that the action of ER is not only regulated by ligands but also by interactions with an array of signaling molecules and cofactors. One of these is the functional activation of ER through ER-AF1 by MAPK (5.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). ER has two transcriptional activation domains, AF1 and AF2, which are located in the N-terminal A/B region and in the ligand-binding region E, respectively (6.Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The signal through membrane-associated receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/Raf/MAPK enhances the activity of ER-AF1 by stimulating phosphorylation of the serine residue at 118 (5.Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Thus, two independently transmitted signals, E2·ER binding and the ER-AF1 activation, are necessary for the dominant activation of ER that is involved in Ras-mediated NIH3T3 cell transformation (7.Kato K. Ueoka Y. Hachiya T. Nishida J. Wake N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ras proteins regulate multiple and/or branching signal transduction pathways involving the Ras-ER pathway. Each distinct pathway may be associated with various transformed cell properties, implying in vitro cell growth, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. However, it remains unclear how the Ras-ER signal transduction pathway contributes to the NIH3T3 cell transformation mediated by mutant Ras.Normal fibroblasts are refractory to neoplastic transformation by oncogenic Ras whereas the tumorigenic effect of Ras on some murine cell lines, including NIH3T3, are well established. The reasons for this resistance to the transforming effects of Ras have been addressed recently with the discovery that oncogenic Ras triggers premature cell senescence (8.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar). Specifically, although the initial effect of oncogenic Ras in normal fibroblasts is to trigger proliferation, this aberrant stimulation is not sustained and after a few doublings, cells enter into replicative cell senescence. This Ras-induced senescence is accompanied by overexpression of both p16INK4a and p19ARF, and the consequent activation of pRb and p53 (8.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar, 9.Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M.

In turn, oncogenic Ras has the potential to manifest neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3 cells carrying a homozygous deletion at the INK4a/ARF locus and primary murine fibroblasts genetically deficient in p16INK4a/p19ARF, p19ARF alone, or p53 with no apparent need for additional genetic alterations (8.Serrano M.

Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8292-8297Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). mdm2 is involved in this neoplastic transformation by oncogenic Ras. A recent report explored how the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway was responsible for induction of mdm2 through its promoter (13.Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). mdm2 induced by the Ras signaling pathway degrades p53 in the absence of p19ARF, facilitating cell proliferation and survival.In the present study, we investigated the effect of activated [12Val]K-Ras 4B on NIH3T3 cell transformation in the absence or presence of dominant negative ER that inhibited its AF2 function. The dominant negative ER mutant is the ER mutant containing a frameshift substitution at 554 codon Ser (S554fs ER), which was generated by random chemical mutagenesis (14.Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previous report demonstrated that S554fs ER suppressed the activity of wild type ER by 80% when equal amounts of the plasmid encoding the ER mutant and the wild type ER were used (14.Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated K-Ras 4B significantly enhanced the ERα expression level and its transcriptional activity (7.Kato K. Ueoka Y. Hachiya T. Nishida J. Wake N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As expected, the DNER expression in the presence of activated K-Ras 4B resulted in the abrogation of transcriptional activity by ER, resulting in G0/G1 arrest followed by cell senescence through p53-dependent up-regulation of p21. Alteration in MDM2 function accounted for this p21 up-regulation. Oncogenic K-Ras 4B expression significantly increased MDM2 proteins coprecipitated with p53 and suppressed p53 transcriptional activity. In turn, DNER decreased MDM2 proteins coprecipitated with p53 sharply, followed by the stimulation of p53 activity in the presence of oncogenic K-Ras 4B. In addition, overexpression of wt ERα in NIH3T3 cells corresponded to a significant increase in mdm2 mRNA and protein, and the resultant suppression of p53 transcriptional activity. Finally, we demonstrated that c-Jun overcame the down-regulation of MDM2 expression by DNER. These results suggested that ERα contributes to oncogenic K-Ras 4B-mediated NIH3T3 cell transformation by p53-independent modulation of MDM2 functions and its suppressive effect on p53 transcriptional activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidspZIP-Neo SV(X)1 retrovirus vector and constructs containing cDNA sequences encoding [12 Val]K-Ras 4B were gifts from Dr. Channing J. Der. The pSG5 eukaryotic expression vector containing a cDNA sequence encoding human ER was given by Dr. Pierre Chambon (CNRS). The pCAT reporter vector was purchased from Promega Corp. p53-luc was purchased from Invitrogen. pCMV-p53mt135 vector was purchased form CLONTECH. pcDEB delta vector containing c-jun cDNA was used as a c-Jun expressing vector as described previously (15.Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Site-directed MutagenesisDominant negative ER (S554fs) DNA was generated by using a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used pSG5 human ER as a template DNA and CAT GCG CCC ACT GCC GTG GAG GGG as mutant oligos. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing.Cell CultureNIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with the pZIP-Neo SV(X) retrovirus vector, which contained a neo marker for selection and a pSG5 eukaryotic expression vector to produce various reconstituted cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Thus, control mock cells contained these two empty vectors. NIH3T3 cells harboring either wild type ER or dominant negative ER were established by cotransfection with an empty pZIP-Neo SV(X) vector and pSG5-human ER (ER cells) or human DNER (S554fs) cDNA (DNER cells). NIH3T3 cells harboring mutant versions of [12Val]K-Ras 4B were established by transfection with pZIP-Neo SV(X)1 containing a cDNA sequence encoding [12Val]K-Ras 4B and empty pSG5 (K12V cells) or pSG5-human DNER (S554fs) (K12V DNER cells). Stably transfected cells were selected and isolated in growth medium containing G418 at 400 μg/ml (Geneticin, Invitrogen). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Seiha) supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone).Retroviral Gene Transfer and ExpressionEcopack2–293 cells were purchased from CLONTECH and used as packaging cells. Retroviral gene transfer and expression were performed as described previously (16.Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). To rescue recombinant SV(X) virus, ∼5 × 105 Ecopack2–293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pZIPneoSV(X) vector containing Kras12V or empty vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 2 days after transfection, culture media was collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm Nalgene filter. To infect cells, 1 ml of the supernatant was added to 3 × 104 mock or DNER cells in a 60-mm dish and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma Chemical Co.). Complete media was added, the cultures were incubated for 2–3 days, and cells were used for analysis.Western BlotTo detect each protein expression, subconfluent cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). For analysis of phosphorylated proteins, cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing freshly added protease inhibitor. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris, 100 μg of the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The blots were incubated with diluted primary antibodies. Primary antibodies, including anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (C-19), anti-p16 polyclonal antibody (M-156), and anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody (SMP-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1 or Ab-3) and anti-MAPK monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-ER monoclonal antibody (AER314) was purchased from Neomarkers. Anti-phosphospecific MAPK antibody and p53 (Ser20) antibody were from Promega and Cell signaling, respectively. After incubation with each primary antibody, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked, anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit antibodies and analyzed with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The amount of each protein was quantitated using NIH3T3 image software.Analysis of Interaction between p53 and MDM2Interaction between p53 and MDM2 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-p53 Ab followed by Western blotting with an anti-MDM2 antibody. Briefly, 500 μg of the proteins was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Calbiochem). The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and then analyzed by Western blot with an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody (SMP-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Ab-3, Calbiochem).Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescent StainER expression or K-Ras expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using an avidin-biotinylated immunoperoxidase technique (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were plated at ∼1 × 104 cells per two-well chamber (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After 2 days, cells were permeabilized and fixed by treatment with 10% formalin and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-ER antibody (AER314, Neomarkers) or anti-K-Ras antibody (F234, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and an avidin·biotin complex linked to horseradish peroxidase followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the substrate. In immunofluorescence stain, bound ER antibodies were visualized by green fluorescence from secondary antibody staining with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). The cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole to visualize the nuclei (Vectashield, Vector).Immunoprecipitation Analysis of RasCells were labeled overnight in growth medium supplemented with [35S]methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, 400 μCi/ml, ICN, Irvine, CA). Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated using the Y13–259 rat anti-Ras monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to fluorographic analysis.Luciferase AssayTransient transfection of 1 μg of a luciferase reporter (p53-Luc) plasmid was performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10% calf serum. Luciferase assays were performed using a Luciferase assay kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase assays using β-galactosidase staining kits (Invitrogen).CAT AssayVitellogenin A2 ERE (5′-GATCTAGGTCACAGTGACCTA-3′) were inserted into the pCAT-Enhancer Vector, which contained an SV40 enhancer element (Promega). Each cell was transfected with the pCAT vector containing vitellogenin A2 ERE. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 72 h with phenol-red free DMEM containing 10% charcoal-dextran-treated calf serum. The medium was then replaced overnight with phenol red-free DMEM containing 1% charcoal-dextran-treated calf serum in the presence or absence of 10−7m 17β-estradiol (Sigma). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were suspended in 0.25m Tris-Cl, pH 7.8 and lysed by five cycles of freezing and thawing. A CAT assay of 10 μg of cell extract was performed as described previously (17.Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Teng C.T. Ross K.A. Parker M.G. Korach K.S. McLachlan J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-gal) StainingCells cultured on chamber slides (Nalge, Nunc International) were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde. SA-β-galactosidase staining was performed as described before (18.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar).Semiquantitative RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcriptase and amplification of mouse mdm2 and a control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene sequence. The primers used for PCR were as follows: 5′-CTGCTGGGCGAGCGGGAGAC-3′ (mdm2 exon 2 sense); 5′-TCCAGGCAATCACCAGAATG-3′ (mdm2 exon 3 antisense); 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTGGG-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense); 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenaseantisense).The conditions for PCR reactions of mdm2 were denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s.The PCR exponential phase was determined on 20–30 cycles to allow comparison among cDNAs developed from identical reactions. After electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining, the photographs were analyzed by FAS II (TOYOBO) and Digital Image File DF-20 (FUJI Film). The amount of each PCR product was quantitated using IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health). The optimal number of PCR cycles was found to be 25.RESULTSEstablishment and Characterization of Reconstituted Cells Expressing DNER Generated by the Cotransfection SystemWe established four kinds of reconstituted NIH3T3 cells that expressed dominant negative ER (DNER) and/or constitutively activated [12Val]K-Ras 4B proteins: mock cell cotransfection of an empty pZIP-Neo(X)1 retrovirus vector and an empty pSG5 eukaryotic expression vector, DNER cell cotransfection of an empty pZIP vector and a pSG5 vector containing ER cDNA with a frameshift substitution (S554fs), K12V cell cotransfection of a pZIP vector containing [12Val]K-Ras 4B cDNA and an empty pSG5 vector, and K12V DNER cell cotransfection of a pZIP containing [12Val]K-Ras 4B and pSG5 vector containing ER cDNA with an S554fs mutation, respectively. S554fs DNER cDNA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis.We determined the ER protein levels in these reconstituted cells by Western blots using ER monoclonal antibodies that failed to recognize a DNER form differentially from endogenous ER protein. As shown in previous reports (7.Kato K. Ueoka Y. Hachiya T. Nishida J. Wake N. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), an ∼2-fold increase in ER protein levels was observed in K12V cells compared with that in mock cells (Fig. 1A). This protein level of ER was almost equal to that in DNER and K12V DNER cells. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining showed the preferential localization of ER in nuclei of K12V cells, in contrast with the cytoplasmic localization in DNER cells (Fig. 1A). ER was colocalized both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in K12V DNER cells. Similar levels of exogenous K-Ras 4B protein and phosphorylated MAPK protein were detectable both in K12V and K12V DNER cells (Fig. 1B).To investigate the alterations in transcriptional activity by ERα in these reconstituted cells, we transiently transfected them with pCAT-enhancer vector, which contained an SV40 enhancer element and vitellogenin A2 ERE (Fig. 1C). The transfection efficiency of each cell line was normalized by a β-galactosidase assay. In the charcoal-treated, low serum (1%) condition, E2 stimulated the pCAT activity 8-fold in mock cells and 50-fold in K12V cells, respectively. In contrast, DNER expression completely abrogated the activation of ER transcriptional activity in response to E2(1.2-fold in DNER cells and 1.0-fold in K12V DNER cells, respectively). These results implied that the dominant negative effect of S554fs ER was powerful and were compatible with a previous report (14.Ince B.A. Zhuang Y. Wrenn C.K. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Senescence Induction by DNER in the Presence of Activated K-Ras 4B in NIH3T3 CellsAlthough mock cells displayed spindle-shaped morphology, K12V cells grew as rounded, refractile cells and had the potential to form tumors in nude mice. In response to DNER expression in K12V cells, we observed profound alterations in both cell proliferation and morphology, whereas none of these alterations was detectable by DNER expression in mock cells (Fig. 2A). To characterize these effects, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells per well, and cell numbers were obtained as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 2B, K12V cell proliferation was markedly inhibited by DNER expression, despite no alterations in mock cell proliferation. In addition, DNER expression inhibited the colony-forming ability of K12V cells in soft agar (data not shown). There were also dramatic alterations in cell morphology. DNER expression caused cells to exhibit increased size and flattened morphology, as well as enlarged nuclei in all three individual clones from K12V DNER cells. A significant increase in the proportion of enlarged cells with multinuclei was detectable in these cells (6-fold) compared with those in mock, DNER, and K12V cells (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Induction of senescence by coexpression of [12Val]K-Ras and dominant negative ER. A, morphology of each reconstituted cell line (magnification ×200). K12V DNER cells acquired flat and enlarged morphology. B, anchorage-dependent cell growth was investigated in each cell line. Cells were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells per well of 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Viable cells were counted on days 2, 4, 6, and 9. Marked suppression of K12V cell growth was noticeable in response to DNER. C, FACS with propidium iodide staining was analyzed. DNER expression exhibited a significant reduction in the S-phase population declining from 13.2% to 5.0% in K12V cells. The percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased from 65% to 81%. D, the senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity at pH 6.0 was investigated in each cell line. SA-β-galactosidase activities are shown in the K12VDNER cells. Very strong SA-β-galactosidase activities in enlarged K12VDNER cells with multinuclei are shown. E, mock cells or DNER cells were infected with the virus expressing either empty vector or [12Val]K-Ras, respectively. Vector or [12Val]K-Ras-infected mock cells (a, d) and vector-infected DNER (b) cells displayed no remarkable change in morphology. Significant population of enlarged cells with multinuclei were observed in only [12Val]K-Ras infected DNER cells (e). K-Ras protein expression in [12Val]K-Ras-infected DNER cells was determined by immunohistochemistry using anti-K-Ras monoclonal antibody (F234) (f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Therefore, we analyzed K12V cells for changes in cell cycle progression in the absence or presence of DNER by FACS with propidium iodide staining. DNER expression exhibited a marked reduction in the S-phase population declining from 13.2% to 5.0% in K12V cells. Conversely, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase population increased from 65% to 81%, indicating the correlation of DNER expression with the arrest of K12V cells in the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2C). Of note, there was no evidence indicating the accumulation of a sub-G1 population as seen in apoptosis. Senescent, but not presenescent, quiescent cells express a senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, which can be detected by incubating cells at pH 6.0 (18.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G.

A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar). Because coexpressing DNER and [12Val]K-Ras proteins exhibited a striking feature characteristic of senescent cells, we examined whether these cells expressed this senescence-specific marker (Fig. 2D). SA-β-galactosidase-positive mock, DNER, and K12V cells were undetectable. In contrast, almost 30–50% of K12V DNER cells were SA-β-galactosidase-positive. Very strong SA-β-galactosidase activities were shown in enlarged K12V DNER cells with multinuclei. These results indicated that DNER expression was able to induce replicative cell senescence in NIH3T3 cells transformed by the activated K-Ras 4B, but not in untransformed mock cells. To validate the DNER effect on K12V cells by using the [12Val]K-Ras retroviral construct as a retrovirus, mock cells or DNER cells were infected with the virus expressing either empty vector or [12Val]K-Ras, respectively. Vector or [12Val]K-Ras-infected mock cells and vector-infected DNER cells (Fig. 2E, panels a, b, d) displayed no remarkable change in morphology. In contrast, in response to [12Val]K-Ras infection, a significant proportion of enlarged cells with multinuclei were observed in DNER cells (Fig. 2E, panel e). These enlarged cells were SA-β-galactosidase-positive (data not shown). The proportion of senescent cells was higher in [12Val]K-Ras-infected DNER cells (70–80%) than that in the stable K12VDNER transfectants (30–50%). These results demonstrated that coexpression of activated K-Ras and DNER induced senescence in NIH3T3 cells.Induction of the p21 CDK Inhibitor through a p53-dependent Pathway in Senescent K12V DNER CellsDuring the replicative senescence of normal diploid human fibroblasts, the expression of both p21 and p16 CDK inhibitors increases dramatically. The increase is sequential; p21 expression increases when the majority of cells have lost their growth potential, whereas p16 expression increases in the terminal"

J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518–35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs ΔCys235, Δ179–182, and Δ241–246. Cys235is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val179 and Leu245 and Arg246, were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.

[2-(Trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide high pressure liquid chromatography The superfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors is remarkable for its size and diversity, having the largest number of receptors and the greatest variation in natural ligands. These receptors have been organized into classes that share major structural themes, and into smaller groups called families that share a finer level of structural similarities (2Kolakowski L.F. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that receptors in a single family often also have natural ligands that share structural similarities with each other as well. It has been assumed that these ligands bind to the receptors in their family with similar themes.It was recently established that the motilin receptor and growth hormone secretagogue receptors comprise a new family within class I G protein-coupled receptors (3Feighner S.D.

Genomics. 1997; 46: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As might be expected, when a natural ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor was subsequently identified as ghrelin, it had significant primary sequence homology with the motilin peptide (6Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar, 7Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, both motilin and ghrelin have unique structural features that make the molecular basis of receptor binding and activation of these receptors particularly interesting.This relates to the requirement in ghrelin for the novel post-translational modification of N-octanoylation of the Ser residue in its third position (6Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). No analogous modification of motilin peptides has been reported. Further, motilin has an unusual structure-activity relationship for a peptide receptor in the class I family of G protein-coupled receptors, having amino-terminal rather than the predominantly carboxyl-terminal sequence determinants for its selectivity of binding and action (3Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D. MacNeil D. Cascieri M.A. Nargund R. Bakshi R. Abramovitz M. Stocco R. Kargman S. O'Neill G. Van der Ploeg L.H. Evans J.

Commun. 1992; 183: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Despite the clear sequence homology between motilin and growth hormone secretagogue receptor sequences, particularly in their predicted transmembrane segments (86%), there is a prominent difference in the region predicted to represent the second extracellular loop domain (Fig. 1). This 67-amino acid loop within the motilin receptor is 40 residues longer than the analogous loop in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. However, whether these additional residues are functionally significant is not yet clear.In the current work, we focused on the second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor and used site-directed mutagenesis with sequential deletion of segments and alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify functionally important residues. Of note, both ends of this loop, representing domains that are conserved throughout this family, were found to be functionally important for the binding and action of the natural peptide agonist, motilin, whereas the nonconserved residues in the mid-region of the loop were not necessary. Additionally, those regions that were important for peptide responses were not critical for responses to a non-peptidyl agonist known to act at this receptor, erythromycin, supporting distinct receptor structural determinants for action of these two chemically distinct agonist ligands. Although disruption of the conserved disulfide bond that links this extracellular loop to the first extracellular loop domain of this receptor by deletion of a component cysteine (Cys235) completely eliminated calcium signaling in response to the natural peptide agonist, motilin, erythromycin continued to elicit a response in this construct. This finding further supported the distinct structural basis for the action of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands of this receptor.DISCUSSIONThe motilin-growth hormone secretagogue family of receptors may follow unique and interesting molecular themes for binding and being activated by their natural ligands. This relates to the location of critical determinants for binding and biological activity at the amino-terminal ends of both motilin (3Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D. MacNeil D. Cascieri M.A. Nargund R. Bakshi R. Abramovitz M. Stocco R. Kargman S. O'Neill G. Van der Ploeg L.H. Evans J. Patchett A.A. Smith R.G. Howard A.D.

Commun. 1992; 183: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and ghrelin (6Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar) rather than at the carboxyl terminus, which is most typical of peptide receptors within the class I G protein-coupled receptors (2Kolakowski L.F. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the members of this receptor family follow themes that are distinct even among themselves. This relates to the novel and functionally critical post-translational modification of ghrelin, N-octanoylation of Ser3 (6Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar), which is apparently absent in motilin. Such a modification could establish an association with the lipid bilayer that orients ghrelin in a unique manner prior to its receptor binding.To explore the possibility of distinct modes of binding for members of this receptor family, we focused our efforts on a domain of substantial difference between the motilin and growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the second extracellular loop domain. This region includes a 40-amino acid insertion in the motilin receptor that is absent in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. The potential importance of this unique region was further emphasized by the recent report of the first photoaffinity labeling of a motilin receptor domain that included this loop (1Coulie B.J. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35518-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).We followed the classical experimental approaches of deletional and alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The results of these efforts focused interest on three regions within the second extracellular loop. A key amino acid is Cys235, a highly conserved residue that contributes to a conserved disulfide bond linking the first and second extracellular loop domains of essentially every member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Deletions on both sides of this residue had no negative impact, whereas deletion of only this residue had a profound negative effect on receptor biosynthesis and its ability to bind and signal in response to motilin. Even micromolar concentrations of motilin elicited no intracellular calcium response from cells expressing this construct. In contrast, and of particular interest, cells expressing this construct were still able to respond to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. This represented a clear indication that non-peptidyl agonist had receptor structural determinants for binding and action that were clearly distinct from those for the natural peptide agonist ligand.The second region of interest represented the amino-terminal perimembranous domain of the second loop. Here, Val179 was shown to be responsible for the negative impact of the mutants on motilin responses. There was evidence that the V179A construct is synthesized normally and undergoes normal trafficking to the cell surface, because there was a small biological response to the cell-impermeant peptide ligand, motilin, even though its affinity was too low to detect by radioligand binding assay. This negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity could be either direct, interacting with the bound peptide ligand, or indirect, acting via an allosteric effect on receptor conformation. Because this hydrophobic amino acid is predicted to reside at or near the interface with the lipid bilayer, many potentially important allosteric effects can be proposed. An important control demonstrated normal responsiveness to erythromycin. This likely reflects the different receptor domains necessary for the action of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands.The third region of interest represented the carboxyl-terminal perimembranous domain of the second loop. Here, both Leu245 and Arg246 appear to contribute to the negative impact of the mutants. Here, too, there was adequate evidence for normal biosynthesis and trafficking to the cell surface, where both binding and signaling were markedly affected. This negative effect may also be either direct or indirect. Here, too, the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin, elicited entirely normal biological responses.The same types of considerations described above for the amino-terminal perimembranous domain are relevant here as well. Both of these domains would be expected to be spatially approximated with each other in the intact, fully folded receptor molecule. At the present time, there is no credible model to illustrate this, although the constraint contributed by the current support for the disulfide bond linking the first and second loop domains will provide a starting point for developing such a model.These observations indeed support the functional importance of the motilin receptor second extracellular loop region for binding and activation by the natural peptide ligand. Perhaps surprisingly, the structural feature of this loop that was most responsible for focusing our attention in these studies, the 40-amino acid residue insertion not present in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, appears to play no functional role. Instead, the functionally important domains within this extracellular loop are all conserved in the other structurally related G protein-coupled receptors. These include the highly conserved disulfide bond that almost certainly has a global architectural role in the superfamily and also both extreme perimembranous regions of this loop. The precise functional roles for peptide binding and action for the identified key residues remain to be defined. The superfamily of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors is remarkable for its size and diversity, having the largest number of receptors and the greatest variation in natural ligands.

At the present time, there is no credible model to illustrate this, although the constraint contributed by the current support for the disulfide bond linking the first and second loop domains will provide a starting point for developing such a model.These observations indeed support the functional importance of the motilin receptor second extracellular loop region for binding and activation by the natural peptide ligand. Perhaps surprisingly, the structural feature of this loop that was most responsible for focusing our attention in these studies, the 40-amino acid residue insertion not present in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, appears to play no functional role. Instead, the functionally important domains within this extracellular loop are all conserved in the other structurally related G protein-coupled receptors. These include the highly conserved disulfide bond that almost certainly has a global architectural role in the superfamily and also both extreme perimembranous regions of this loop. The precise functional roles for peptide binding and action for the identified key residues remain to be defined. The motilin-growth hormone secretagogue family of receptors may follow unique and interesting molecular themes for binding and being activated by their natural ligands. This relates to the location of critical determinants for binding and biological activity at the amino-terminal ends of both motilin (3Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L.

Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar) rather than at the carboxyl terminus, which is most typical of peptide receptors within the class I G protein-coupled receptors (2Kolakowski L.F. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that the members of this receptor family follow themes that are distinct even among themselves. This relates to the novel and functionally critical post-translational modification of ghrelin, N-octanoylation of Ser3 (6Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar), which is apparently absent in motilin. Such a modification could establish an association with the lipid bilayer that orients ghrelin in a unique manner prior to its receptor binding. To explore the possibility of distinct modes of binding for members of this receptor family, we focused our efforts on a domain of substantial difference between the motilin and growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the second extracellular loop domain. This region includes a 40-amino acid insertion in the motilin receptor that is absent in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. The potential importance of this unique region was further emphasized by the recent report of the first photoaffinity labeling of a motilin receptor domain that included this loop (1Coulie B.J. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35518-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We followed the classical experimental approaches of deletional and alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The results of these efforts focused interest on three regions within the second extracellular loop. A key amino acid is Cys235, a highly conserved residue that contributes to a conserved disulfide bond linking the first and second extracellular loop domains of essentially every member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Deletions on both sides of this residue had no negative impact, whereas deletion of only this residue had a profound negative effect on receptor biosynthesis and its ability to bind and signal in response to motilin. Even micromolar concentrations of motilin elicited no intracellular calcium response from cells expressing this construct. In contrast, and of particular interest, cells expressing this construct were still able to respond to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. This represented a clear indication that non-peptidyl agonist had receptor structural determinants for binding and action that were clearly distinct from those for the natural peptide agonist ligand. The second region of interest represented the amino-terminal perimembranous domain of the second loop. Here, Val179 was shown to be responsible for the negative impact of the mutants on motilin responses. There was evidence that the V179A construct is synthesized normally and undergoes normal trafficking to the cell surface, because there was a small biological response to the cell-impermeant peptide ligand, motilin, even though its affinity was too low to detect by radioligand binding assay. This negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity could be either direct, interacting with the bound peptide ligand, or indirect, acting via an allosteric effect on receptor conformation. Because this hydrophobic amino acid is predicted to reside at or near the interface with the lipid bilayer, many potentially important allosteric effects can be proposed. An important control demonstrated normal responsiveness to erythromycin. This likely reflects the different receptor domains necessary for the action of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands. The third region of interest represented the carboxyl-terminal perimembranous domain of the second loop. Here, both Leu245 and Arg246 appear to contribute to the negative impact of the mutants. Here, too, there was adequate evidence for normal biosynthesis and trafficking to the cell surface, where both binding and signaling were markedly affected. This negative effect may also be either direct or indirect. Here, too, the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin, elicited entirely normal biological responses. The same types of considerations described above for the amino-terminal perimembranous domain are relevant here as well. Both of these domains would be expected to be spatially approximated with each other in the intact, fully folded receptor molecule. At the present time, there is no credible model to illustrate this, although the constraint contributed by the current support for the disulfide bond linking the first and second loop domains will provide a starting point for developing such a model.

Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Thereafter, nucleocapsids containing replicative intermediates are converted into mature virions and shuttled out of the cell. Transcripts essential for HBV replication in vitro are unspliced and share an identical 3′-region, which contains a posttranscriptional response element (PRE) (2Huang J. Liang T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7476-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Huang Z.M. Yen T.S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schaller H. Fischer M. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Worldwide, more than 300 million people are chronically infected with HBV (6Yen T.S.B. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 319-326Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Treatment with interferon-α (IFNα) is one of the few effective therapies for chronic HBV carriers. However, it results in efficient reduction of the viral load only in 10–30% of treated patients and rarely, if at all, in complete elimination of the virus. So far, the mechanisms responsible for the IFNα-mediated reduction of the viremia in responding patients are elusive. IFNα treatment of cells is known to induce an antiviral state, which prevents productive infection by several viruses (8Foster G.R. Semin.

The antiviral state is established by induction of the expression of a wide pattern of different genes and the functional activation of a variety of cellular proteins. Among others, the IFNα-inducible human MxA protein is per se known to confer antiviral activity against several RNA viruses (10Staeheli P. Adv. Virus Res. 1990; 38: 147-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Haller O. Frese M. Kochs G. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Landis H.

Rosmorduc O. Peltekian C. Garreau F. Brechot C. Kremsdorf D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Compared with control cells, in cells stably expressing ectopic MxA the levels of cytoplasmic HBV-RNA and replicative DNA intermediates were reduced. Furthermore, the reduced levels of the cytoplasmic RNA were associated with down-regulation of the PRE activity. From these and other published data, the authors conclude that it is likely that MxA protein plays a key role in the antiviral action of IFNα against HBV, since IFNα and MxA have comparable inhibitory effects on HBV (14Gordien E. Rosmorduc O. Peltekian C. Garreau F. Brechot C. Kremsdorf D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). So far, in vitro studies of drug-induced intracellular antiviral mechanisms against HBV are restricted to liver-derived cell lines, since activity of the pregenomic promoter depends on liver-specific transcription factors (24Raney A.K. Eggers C.M. Kline E.F. Guidotti L.G. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. McLachlan A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2900-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether MxA is required for IFNα-induced suppression of HBV, we established a HBV expression system, which allows expression of replicative DNA intermediates even in non-hepatic cell lines and used a non-hepatic cell line, which does not express endogenous MxA (HEp2) (22Landis H. Simon-Jodicke A. Di Kloti A. Paolo C. Schnorr J.J. Schneider-Schaulies S. Hefti H.P. Pavlovic J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1516-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this experimental system, we demonstrate that IFNα-induced suppression of HBV replication is not restricted to hepatoma cells and that MxA is dispensable for this activity. Plasmid pHBV-dimer contains the HBV-DNA of subtypeayw (25Galibert F. Mandart E. Fitoussi F. Tiollais P. Charnay P. Nature. 1979; 281: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) as head to tail linked dimer cloned via theEcoRI site (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCMV-HBV is a CMV promoter-controlled HBV expression construct (kindly provided by Heinz Schaller, containing a 1.3-fold overlength HBV genome, the HBV pregenomic RNA synthesized from this construct is driven by the immediate early promoter of CMV). Plasmid pCMV-SEAP contains the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under control of the same CMV promoter. Expression of SEAP was used to standardize efficiency of transfection and to monitor potential IFNα-mediated cytotoxic effects. The human hepatoma (Huh7) and the human cervix carcinoma (HEp2) cell lines were grown as monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified by ion exchange chromatography and transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) according to the protocol supplied. Cells (1.3 × 106 cells per 5-cm plate) were transfected with 2 μg of the corresponding HBV expression plasmids and 0.25 μg of pCMV/SEAP. Sixteen hours after transfection cells were treated with human IFNα-2b (1,000 IU/ml, Intron A, Essex Pharma, Munich, Germany) for 48 h and harvested for analysis afterward. The amount of SEAP activity secreted into the medium of transfected cells was determined by quantification of the SEAP activity as increase of the optical density nm × 10−3 at 405 (mOD) per min (mOD/min) as described previously (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Isolation of HBV-DNA from cytoplasmic core particles was performed as described recently (18Rang A. Heise T. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3531-3535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled full-length HBV-DNA fragment. Blots were exposed to Fuji imaging screens and signals were quantified by a Fujix BAS 2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) and by TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Extracts were separated by use of a 5–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After incubation of the lower part of the membrane with core-specific (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the upper part with an MxA-specific rabbit antiserum (kindly provided by Peter Stäheli) and a rabbit-specific horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany, 1:50,000), the signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) visualized by exposure to x-ray films. We have established a transient HBV expression system in Huh7 cells that allows determination of IFNα-induced antiviral activities against HBV (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Rang A. Heise T. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3531-3535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After transient transfection with the plasmid pHBV dimer into Huh7 cells, addition of IFNα induces specific posttranscriptional suppression of the viral transcripts, proteins, and encapsidated DNA intermediates (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether MxA is necessary for IFNα-mediated suppression of HBV we adapted the established test system for HEp2 cells, which do not express MxA and are not liver-derived cells (22Landis H. Simon-Jodicke A. Di Kloti A. Paolo C. Schnorr J.J. Schneider-Schaulies S. Hefti H.P. Pavlovic J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1516-1522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because transcription of the HBV promoter that controls expression of the pregenomic RNA requires liver-specific factors (24Raney A.K. Eggers C.M. Kline E.F. Guidotti L.G. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. McLachlan A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2900-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is therefore not supported in the HeLa-derived HEp2 cells (data not shown), a CMV-controlled HBV expression construct (pCMV-HBV) was used for the study. HEp2 or Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-HBV or pHBV-dimer, respectively, and pCMV-SEAP. Afterward, cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFNα and harvested for analysis 48 h later. As shown in Fig.1, transfection of pCMV-HBV into HEp2 cells resulted in production of intracellular replicative DNA intermediates, indicating that the pregenomic RNA expressed under control of the CMV promoter is identical to the one expressed from the authentic pregenomic promoter. In samples from cells treated with IFNα the amount of replicative DNA intermediates was reduced to 36% in HEp2 and to 47% in Huh7 cells, compared with untreated controls. These values reflect quantified signal intensities standardized with the expression levels of the control gene SEAP (Fig. 1). The expression levels of the cotransfected control gene SEAP were not affected by the IFNα-treatment (Fig. 1), indicating that the activities induced specifically suppress HBV in HEp2 and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, these data suggest that IFNα induces antiviral activities against HBV that act on a posttranscriptional level, since expression of the control gene SEAP and of the pregenomic RNA are controlled by the same CMV promoter. The effect of IFNα on the levels of viral core protein in MxA-negative HEp2 and in MxA-positive Huh7 cells was analyzed by Western blotting. The top panel of Fig.2 demonstrates IFNα-induced MxA expression in Huh7 but not in HEp2 cells. Irrespective of the presence of MxA, the IFNα treatment reduced the amount of core protein to a similar extent in both cell types compared with untreated controls. After Western blot analysis the membrane was stained with Amido Black (Fig. 2), demonstrating that equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto the gel. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that IFNα induces suppression of HBV replication in vitro in the absence of MxA, indicating that MxA is dispensable for the antiviral activity in HEp2 cells. Whether these mechanisms differ from that exerted by MxA reported previously (14Gordien E. Rosmorduc O. Peltekian C. Garreau F. Brechot C. Kremsdorf D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) remains to be studied. Gordien et al. (14Gordien E. Rosmorduc O. Peltekian C. Garreau F. Brechot C. Kremsdorf D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that IFNα-induced depletion of cytoplasmic HBV-RNA is associated with suppression of the PRE-activity as determined by reporter gene analysis and suggested that this inhibition is, at least in part, responsible for IFNα-induced HBV suppression. However, data published previously indicate that the activity of the PRE is not required for IFNα-induced suppression of the viral RNA, because RNA synthesized from a subgenomic region (nucleotide position 1–1,306, pRK-HBs/Eco) that lacks a functional PRE is also efficiently degraded in response to IFNα (17Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the PRE is a major target for the antiviral activity mediating IFNα-induced degradation of the viral RNA. At least as important, the results demonstrate for the first time that IFNα-induced posttranscriptional suppression of HBV replication can be studied not only in liver-derived cell lines but also in different non-hepatic cell lines (Vero, data not shown), and probably in all cell lines that support the function of the CMV promoter or similar promoters that can replace that of the pregenomic HBV RNA. Thus, the experimental approach presented can be adapted to established cell lines, which are deficient in parts of the IFNα-signal transduction pathway or that lack certain genes induced downstream of this pathway (11Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 26Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2108339183,"Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a homodimeric protein, which is activated by cAMP binding to function as a transcriptional regulator of many genes in prokaryotes. Until now, the actual number of cAMP molecules that can be bound by CRP in solution has been ambiguous. In this work, we performed a nuclear magnetic resonance study on CRP to investigate the stoichiometry of cyclic nucleotide binding to CRP. A series of1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the protein in the absence and in the presence of cAMP or cGMP were analyzed. The addition of cAMP to CRP induced a biphasic spectral change up to 4 equivalents, whereas the cGMP addition made a monophasic change up to 2 equivalents. Altogether, the results not only established for the first time that CRP possesses two cyclic AMP-binding sites in each monomer, even in a solution without DNA, but also suggest that the syn-cAMP binding sites of the CRP dimer can be formed by an allosteric conformational change of the protein upon the binding of two anti-cAMPs at the N-terminal domain. In addition, a residue-specific inspection of the spectral changes provides some new structural information about the cAMP-induced allosteric activation of CRP."

We found that LMP1 is a potent inhibitor of TGFβ signaling and Smad-dependent activation of transcription in 293 epithelial cells and COS-7 fibroblasts. LMP1 strongly inhibited the uninduced and the Smad-inducible activity of the promoters of the humanp21/WAF1/Cip1 gene and the mouse Smad7 gene. Inhibition of TGFβ signaling and Smad-dependent activation of transcription by LMP1 was greatly reduced by deletion of both C-terminal activating regions 1 and 2 of LMP1 as well as by overexpression of a non-degradable form of IκB. In contrast, specific inhibitors of p38 kinase or MEK kinase did not reverse the inhibitory activity of LMP1. TGFβ signaling was enhanced by overexpression of dominant negative forms of the LMP1 effectors TRAF2, NIK, and IKKβ and was abolished by overexpression of p65/RelA or a p50/p65 fusion protein. Deletion of the transactivation domain of p65 abolished its inhibitory activity. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that suppression of TGFβ signaling and Smad transcriptional activity by LMP1 was not due to Smad degradation or cytoplasmic retention suggesting that LMP1 affects the nuclear function of Smad proteins.

Our data are consistent with an essential role of NF-κB activation by LMP1 in the inhibition of TGFβ signaling and Smad-mediated transcriptional responses.

Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2496Google Scholar). LMP1 can transform rodent fibroblasts by causing loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth, and it plays an essential role in B lymphocyte growth transformation by EBV in vitro (2Wang D.

Transgenic mice expressing LMP1 in B-lymphocytes develop lymphomas at a much greater frequency than non-transgenic littermates (5Kulwichit W. Edwards R.H. Davenport E.M. Baskar J.F. Godfrey V. Raab-Traub N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Finally, LMP1 expression is tightly linked with the development of most human malignancies associated with EBV, including Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoproliferative disease (6Rickinson A.B. Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1996: 2397-2446Google Scholar). LMP1 is a 386-amino acid integral membrane protein that consists of a 24-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, six transmembrane domains connected by short reverse turns, and a 200-amino acid cytoplasmic C terminus (see Fig. 1 A). The six transmembrane domains enable the protein to aggregate in plasma membrane patches, whereas the cytoplasmic C terminus plays an essential role in the communication of the protein with intracellular signaling modules. LMP1 resembles a constitutively active member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, and its function overlaps significantly with that of CD40 (7Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R.

The domains of LMP1 (CTAR1 and CTAR2) that lead to NF-κB and AP1 activation have been mapped in the cytoplasmic C terminus. CTAR1 spans amino acids 187 and 231, and CTAR2 is located between amino acids 351 and 386 (Fig. 1 A). In the case of CTAR1, alteration of amino acids proline 204, glutamine 206, and threonine 208 to alanine results in severe impairment of NF-κB activation (15Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M.

CTAR1 and CTAR2 overlap with transformation effector sites 1 and 2 (TES1, TES2), which have been characterized on the basis of B lymphocyte transformation in vitro by EBV strains carrying mutations in these sites (21Izumi K.M.

Virol. 1995; 69: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB by CTAR1/TES1 is likely to be mediated by a heterodimer of TRAF1 and TRAF2, which interacts directly with CTAR1/TES1 (15Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7098-7108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF2 is also implicated in NF-κB and AP1 activation by CTAR2/TES2 where it is presumably anchored by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated death domain protein (23Kaye K.M. Devergne O.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12592-12597Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation by LMP1 is mediated by NIK or a related MAP kinase kinase kinase and the subsequent activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (25Sylla B.S. Hung S.C. Davidson D.M. Hatzivassiliou E.

AP1 activation by CTAR2/TES2 is mediated through the activation of JNK and p38 (13Eliopoulos A.G. Gallagher N.J. Blake S.M. Dawson C.W. Young L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16085-16096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), whereas CTAR1/TES1 activates AP1 through p38 (14Eliopoulos A.G. Blake S.M. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Young L.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Kieser A. Kaiser C. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2511-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). LMP1 induces multiple cellular genes involved in B lymphocyte and epithelial cell activation and survival (1Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2496Google Scholar). Many of these genes are induced at the transcriptional level through the activity of NF-κB and AP1. In this report we examined the effect of LMP1 on TGFβ signaling. TGFβ is a cytokine that affects gene expression by binding to type I and type II TGFβ receptors (26Masague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). Following TGFβ stimulation, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, and the latter binds to and phosphorylates the pathway-restricted Smads 2 and 3. The phosphorylated Smad 2 or 3 proteins subsequently bind to the common partner Smad 4 and translocate to the nucleus where they affect the transcription of target genes that are involved in important biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, development, apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory activity (26Masague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar). Smad proteins have been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of various TGFβ-responsive genes such as the collagen (28Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J.

Eptein-Barr virus interferes with the growth-suppressive pathway of TGFβ, and it has been reported that the primary effector of this antagonism in B-lymphocytes is LMP1 (33Arvanitakis L. Yaseen N. Sharma S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1046-1056Google Scholar). However, a more recent report has cast doubt on the critical role of LMP1 in preventing TGFβ-mediated growth in B lymphocytes (34Inman G.J. Allday M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1567-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study we wished to determine whether the LMP1 and TGFβ signaling pathways interact at the molecular level and to identify the mechanism of interference of LMP1 in TGFβ-mediated functions in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. All reagents for cell culture (DMEM, fetal bovine serum, Trypsin-EDTA, phosphate-buffered saline,l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin) were purchased from Invitrogen. O-Nitrophenyl-galactopyranoside and the anti-myc antibody 9E10 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. The luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega Corp. The Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (0.45 μm) was purchased from S & S. ECL reagent was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.. All other chemicals were obtained from the usual commercial sources at the purest grade available. The expression plasmids pSG5-FLAG-LMP1, pcDNA3-FLAG-LMP1-(1–231), pcDNA3-FLAG-LMP1(Δ188–351), pCMV-IκB-ND, pcDNA3-FLAG-NIK, pcDNA3-NIK-DN, pcDNA3-FLAG-IKKβΔ9 (expresses wt IKKβ), pcDNA3-FLAG-IKKβΔ34 (expresses dominant negative IKKβ), and pcDNA3-FLAG-TRAF2 have been described previously (15Devergne O.

Plasmid pSG5-LMP1-(1–187) has been described previously (20Floettmann JE Eliopoulos A.G Jones M. Young LS Rowe M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The expression vector pRC/CMV-p65 was kindly offered by Dr. D. Thanos (Columbia University, New York, NY). Vectors for the constitutively active p50 subunit (pSG5-p50) and the mutant p65 subunit with a deletion of the transactivation domain (pCMV-p65ΔC) were a gift from Dr. G. Mavrothalassitis (University of Crete, Heraklion). The reporter plasmid p(CAGA)12-E1B-luc and the plasmid pEGFP-Smad3 were kind gifts of Dr. Aris Moustakas (LICR-Uppsala, Sweden). The p(3XκB-L) homopolymeric promoter construct as well as the pCMV-p50/p65 vector have been described previously (35Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pBXG1-Smad3, expressing the human Smad3 protein fused at its N terminus with the DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) of the yeast transactivator GAL4, was constructed by cloning the Smad3 cDNA excised from plasmid pCDNA1-amp-6myc-Smad3 byEcoRI/NotI into the corresponding sites of vector pBX-G1, which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain under the control of the CMV promoter. The reporter plasmid (−2.300/+8) p21-luc has been described previously (31Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid (−4.200/+110) Smad7-luc was a generous gift of Dr. R. Heuchel (LICR-Uppsala, Sweden). HEK-293, COS-7, and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin-streptomycin in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator in a humidified atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed by the Ca3(PO4)2 co-precipitation method (36Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates or at 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish the day before transfection, while HepG2 were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and at 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish, respectively, the day before transfection. Cells were measured with a Neubauer hemocytometer (Hauser Scientific). The total amount of DNA that was used in each transactivation experiment (6-well plates) was 6 μg. The total amount of DNA that was used in protein expression experiments (10-cm dishes) was 17 μg. Forty hours following transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and collected in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corp). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (37Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase assay kit from Promega Corp. according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blotting analysis, protein extracts were resolved by 8.5% or 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed in 500 ml of 1× TGS (1 liter of 10× TGS: 30.3 g of Tris, 144.2 g of glycine, 10 g of SDS, pH 8.3), using the Bio-Rad Protean electroblotting apparatus. Proteins on the membrane were visualized by Ponceau S staining. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed with TBS-T (TBS + 0.05% Tween-20) for 10 min, at room temperature. Nonspecific sites were blocked by washing with TBB buffer (1× TBS + 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20) three times, for 10 min, at room temperature. Western blotting was performed with a 1:5000 dilution in TBB of the mouse monoclonal antibody anti-myc (9E10) or mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the C terminus (S12) or N terminus (EBV.OT22CN) of LMP1, for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T, for 10 min, at room temperature. As a secondary antibody we used goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated in a 1:10,000 dilution in TBS-T, for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes of 10 min with TBS-T at room temperature, bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL Western blotting kit, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using ECL-hyperfilm. For the indirect immunofluorescence experiments, transfected COS-7 cells were plated on gelatin-coated coverslips and incubated for 16–18 h. Cells were washed three times on a slow rotating platform with PBS+/+ (PBS plus 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mmMgCl2) and fixed with 3% p-formaldehyde in PBS+/+ for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS+/+ three times and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in buffer 1 (buffer 1 (10×): 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 4 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MES, pH 6.0–6.5) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS+/+ and blocked with PBS+/+/1.5% FBS two times. Cells were incubated with the first antibody (anti-FLAG, 1:200 dilution in PBS+/+/1.5% FBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS+/+/1.5% FBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG Texas Red-conjugated, 1:50 dilution in PBS+/+/1.5% FBS) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed three times with PBS+/+ in the dark and mounted on glass slides using mounting solution (1:1 glycerol/PBS). Cells were observed using a Leica SP confocal fluorescent microscopy. To determine whether the LMP1 and the TGFβ signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk, we performed a series of transient transfection experiments in human embryonic kidney epithelial 293 cells and COS-7 fibroblasts. In these experiments, TGFβ signaling and Smad transcriptional activity was monitored by using the TGFβ-inducible reporter plasmid p(CAGA)12-E1B-luc (Fig.1 E and Ref. 38Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the activity of this promoter in 293 cells was strongly induced (17.4-fold) by the addition of 200 pm of TGFβ. However, the TGFβ inducibility of this promoter was reduced to 3-fold by LMP1 (83% reduction). The inhibition of TGFβ signaling by LMP1 in 293 cells was also confirmed using a constitutively active type I TGFβ receptor (CA-ALK5) or human Smad3 and Smad4 proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the CA-ALK5 receptor transactivated the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter by 13.7-fold, and this transactivation was reduced to 1.8-fold by co-transfection of LMP1 (87% reduction). Similarly, the Smad3/Smad4 proteins transactivated the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter by 17.9-fold, and this transactivation was reduced to 4.6-fold by co-transfection of LMP1 (75% reduction). LMP1 also suppressed TGFβ signaling in COS-7 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the ∼18-fold induction of the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter by the CA-ALK5 receptor and the Smad3 and Smad4 proteins was strongly inhibited to 2.4-fold by LMP1 (greater than 85% reduction in both cases). Furthermore, the inhibition of Smad3/Smad4-mediated transactivation of the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter by LMP1 in COS-7 cells was dose-dependent and had reached a plateau at 25 ng of the LMP1 expression vector (Fig.1 D). LMP1 had a minimal effect on the activity of the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter in both 293 and COS-7 cells (data not shown). The findings of Fig. 1 clearly indicate that the expression of LMP1 protein in epithelial cells or in fibroblasts drastically impairs TGFβ signaling and Smad-mediated activation of transcription suggesting that the cross-talk of the two signaling pathways is antagonistic. The effect of LMP1 on TGFβ signaling was investigated further by using two natural TGFβ-inducible promoters: the promoter of the human cell cycle inhibitor p21/WAF1/Cip-1 gene and the promoter of the mouse Smad7 gene. Both of these promoters were shown previously to be induced by TGFβ and Smad proteins (31Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 32Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. Dijke P.T. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, Smad3/Smad4 proteins transactivated the human −2300/+8 p21 promoter by 2.2-fold. LMP1 inhibited the Smad3/Smad4 transactivation of the p21 promoter by 91% and the basal activity of this promoter by 60% (Fig.2 A). Overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4 proteins in COS-7 cells transactivated strongly (7.2-fold) the mouse −4200/+110 Smad7 promoter (Fig. 2 B). However, the transactivation of the Smad7 promoter by Smads was totally abolished in the presence of LMP1. As in the case of the p21 promoter, LMP1 inhibited the Smad3/Smad4-mediated transactivation of the Smad7 promoter by 94% and the basal activity of this promoter by 50%. Taken together, the data of Fig. 2 indicate that LMP1 is a strong inhibitor of the activity of the p21/WAF1/Cip-1 and Smad7 promoters and that the induction of these promoters by Smad proteins is abolished by LMP1. To evaluate the contribution of NF-κB to the mechanism of inhibition of TGFβ signaling by LMP1, cells were co-transfected with the (CAGA)12-E1B-luc reporter construct along with expression vectors for CA-ALK5, LMP1, and a non-degradable form of IκB (IκB-ND) shown previously to block the NF-κB pathway by sequestering NF-κB into the cytoplasm (40Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 (A and B), the inhibition of CA-ALK5 signaling to the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter by LMP1 was totally reversed by overexpression of the IκB-ND mutant in 293 (panel A) or COS-7 (panel B) cells. The effectiveness of the IκB-ND mutant in blocking NF-κB activity in COS-7 cells was evaluated using the NF-κB-responsive reporter construct p(3XκB-L) (35Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, this NF-κB-responsive promoter was strongly induced by LMP1 (8.6-fold), and the LMP1-mediated transactivation was totally abolished by the IκB-ND mutant (0.5-fold). In contrast, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase (SB 203580) or the MEK kinase (PD 98059) could not counteract the suppression of TGFβ signaling by LMP1 (Fig. 3 D). The combined data of Fig. 3 (A–D) indicate that the inhibition of TGFβ signaling by LMP1 is mediated by a signaling cascade leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. To determine the relative contribution of each of the CTAR/TES domains in the mechanism of inhibition of TGFβ signaling by LMP1, three truncated forms of LMP1 were utilized in transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells (Fig.4 A). Mutant LMP1-(1–187) has a C-terminal truncation of the 188–386 region that contains both CTAR1/TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 domains. Mutant LMP1-(1–231) lacks the 232–386 region that contains the CTAR2/TES2 domain but retains the CTAR1/TES1 domain. Mutant LMP1(Δ188–351) contains an internal deletion between amino acids 188 and 351, which removes the CTAR1/TES1 domain but leaves intact the CTAR2/TES2 domain. These truncated LMP1 forms were expressed in COS-7 cells to levels comparable with or higher than those of the wt LMP1 protein (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 C, LMP1-(1–187) was very ineffective in inhibiting CA-ALK5 receptor signaling (22% inhibition relative to 100% inhibition by the wt LMP1 protein). In contrast, both LMP1-(1–231) and LMP1(Δ188–351) inhibited CA-ALK5 signaling. Importantly, the inhibition of CA-ALK5 signaling by the wt and the 1–281 and Δ188–351 LMP1 forms was totally reversed by co-expression of the IκB-ND mutant (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained using an LMP1 mutant (LMP1-AAA) containing a triple-amino acid substitution in the CTAR1/TES1 domain (P204A,Q206A,T208A) as well as an LMP1 mutant (Y384G) containing a replacement of threonine at position 384 by glycine in the core of CTAR2 (15Devergne O.

Both the LMP1-AAA and the LMP1-Y384G mutants inhibited the Smad3/Smad4-mediated transactivation of the (CAGA)12-E1B reporter in COS-7 cells (data not shown). In a parallel control experiment, the effectiveness of the truncated LMP1 forms to activate NF-κB in COS-7 cells was evaluated by using the p(3XκB-L) reporter construct in the presence and absence of the IκB-ND mutant. As shown in Fig. 4 D, wt LMP1 transactivated the 3XκB-L promoter by 8.7-fold. Deletion of CTAR2/TES2 (in LMP1 1–231) decreased NF-κB transactivation to 4.2-fold (52% reduction) and deletion of CTAR1/TES1 (in LMP1 Δ188–351) decreased the transactivation to 6.5-fold (25% reduction). Finally, deletion of both CTAR1/TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 reduced the transactivation of the 3XκB-L promoter by LMP1 to 1.9-fold (78% reduction). In all cases, co-transfection of the IκB-ND mutant abolished the transactivation of the 3XκB-L promoter by the wild type or mutant forms of LMP1 (Fig.4 D). The combined data of Fig. 4 (A–D) indicate that at least one of the NF-κB-activating domains in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of LMP1 (CTAR1/TES1 or CTAR2/TES2) is sufficient for induction of 3XκB-L promoter activity and inhibition of TGFβ signaling. As discussed in the introduction, NF-κB activation by the CTAR1/TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 domains of LMP1 is likely to be mediated by the binding of TRAF2 directly or indirectly to both the CTAR1/TES1 and CTAR2/TES2 domains and the subsequent activation of the NIK or a related MAP kinase kinase kinase and the IκB kinase (IKKβ) complex. As shown in Fig.5 A, overexpression of TRAF2, NIK, and IKKβ in COS-7 cells along with Smad3/Smad4 resulted in a dramatic inhibition (92–97%) of the transactivation of the (CAGA)12-E1B promoter. In agreement with this finding, overexpression of dominant negative forms of these proteins in HepG2 cells resulted in an marked enha"

In the present study, we investigated whether HIV-1 replication cycle was affected by neuraminidase (NA) derived from the human influenza (flu) virus. We first demonstrate that the level of HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation was greatly enhanced in the presence of purified flu NA. Pretreatment of established monocytic and lymphocytic cell lines as well as primary mononuclear cells with purified flu NA augmented also the process of virus infection. A comparable up-regulating effect was observed when using several strains of UV-inactivated whole flu virus, thereby suggesting that virus-anchored NA enzymes positively modulate the HIV-1 life cycle. Furthermore, flu NA-mediated positive effect on HIV-1 biology was abrogated with zanamivir, a specific flu NA inhibitor. Our results provide a new model allowing the investigation of the potential benefit of using NA inhibitors in the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients suffering from coinfection with NA-bearing pathogens.

Nature. 1997; 387: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, HIV-1 attachment to host cells often occurs under suboptimal conditions because of a low frequency of gp120/CD4 interaction events (6Moore J.P. Ho D.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 9: S117-S136Google Scholar, 7Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fouts T.R. Binley J.M. Trkola A. Robinson J.E. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2779-2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. First, most cell types that are permissive for HIV-1 infection express little CD4 (9Sonza S. Maerz A. Uren S. Violo A. Hunter S. Boyle W. Crowe S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Dick A.D. Pell M. Brew B.J. Foulcher E. Sedgwick J.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 11: 1699-1708Google Scholar). Second, the weak association between gp120 and gp41 results in a rapid gp120 shedding and, consequently, a loss of virus infectivity (11Gelderblom H.R. Reupke H. Pauli G. Lancet. 1985; 2: 1016-1017Abstract PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Gelderblom H.R. Hausmann E.H. Ozel M. Pauli G. Koch M.A. Virology. 1987; 156: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Third, the efficient attachment of circulating virions to target cells has to take place despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies that are directed predominantly against gp120 (13Sattentau Q.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, the electrostatic repulsive forces that result from net negative charges present on the surface of both virion and target cell represent an obstacle to the initial virus attachment process (14Fenouillet E. Gluckman J.C. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that other interactions between the virus and the cell surface are necessary to overcome the various factors that might jeopardize the first step in the life cycle of an intracellular parasite such as HIV-1. Accumulating evidence suggest that the activity of bacterially derived neuraminidase (NA, also termed sialidase) can also modulate replication of this retrovirus, including the attachment process, by reducing the level of sialylation of glycoconjugates expressed on the surface of viruses and target cells (15Hu H.

Virology. 2001; 284: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Sialic acids are monosaccharides transferred onto glycolipids and glycoproteins which travel through the secretory pathway (18Keppler O.T.

Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One of the distinct features of sialic acid is its outermost cellular location and its negative charge that increases the net negative charge present on the cell surface. In animals, NAs have been found in several tissues, where the enzymes play various roles in regulation of the surface sialic acid profile of cells. Thus, the balance between sialic acid content and sialidase activity is often found to affect many biological phenomena in animal cells, such as T and B cell activation, hematopoietic cell differentiation, apoptosis, and particularly the regulation of various cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions (20Powell L.D.

As the surface of both HIV-1 and its natural target cells contain highly sialylated glycoconjugates, previous works have scrutinized the potential implication of sialic acid and neuraminidase activity in the HIV-1 life cycle. For example, Hu et al.(15Hu H. Shioda T. Moriya C. Xin X. Hasan M.K. Miyake K. Shimada T. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that desialylation of HIV-1 increases virus infectivity, whereas others have reported that desialylation of freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) creates a cellular environment more suitable for virus growth (16Stamatos N.M. Gomatos P.J. Cox J. Fowler A. Dow N. Wohlhieter J.A. Cross A.S. Virology. 1997; 228: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Xin X. Shioda T. Fukushima M. Hu H. Oka S. Iwamoto A. Nagai Y. Arch. Virol. 1998; 143: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that Arthrobacter-derived NA augmented HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and the initial steps in the virus life cycle (i.e. binding and entry) (17Sun J. Barbeau B. Sato S. Tremblay M.J. Virology. 2001; 284: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Human influenza (flu) virus represents a pathogen that bears NA activity. Indeed, the outer surface of flu virus consists of a lipid envelope from which project prominent glycoprotein spikes of two types,i.e. hemagglutinin and NA. Because flu hemagglutinin binds sialic acid on cellular and viral glycoproteins, the presence of enzymatically active NA is required for the release of virus particles from infected cells and to prevent aggregation of virus particles (27Air G.M. Laver W.G. Proteins. 1989; 6: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 28Zambon M.C. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1999; 44: B3-B9Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Prog. Med. Chem. 1999; 36: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During the process of infection with flu, it is most likely that the membrane-bound NA removes sialic acid from both cellular and viral glycoconjugates to halt self-agglutination of viruses (30Els M.C. Laver W.G. Air G.M. Virology. 1989; 170: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human flu virus has the capacity to interact with and infect human macrophages and lymphocytes, two mononuclear cell types known to harbor HIV-1 (31Mock D.J. Domurat F. Roberts Jr., N.J. Walsh E.E. Licht M.R. Keng P. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In patients infected with flu virus, viral replication is occurring on the mucosal surface of respiratory tracts and virions are also found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue that is also one of the natural reservoir of HIV-1 (32Doherty P.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1023-1027PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mestecky J. Czerkinsky C. Russell M.W. Brown T.A. Prince S.J. Moldoveanu Z. Jackson S. Michalek S.M. McGhee J.R. Ann.

Pathol. 1997; 151: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar), therefore suggesting the possible co-localization of both pathogens at the same site. Although previous studies have indicated that influenza vaccination could increase HIV-1 viral loads (35Ho D.D. Lancet. 1992; 3391549Abstract PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Rosok B. Voltersvik P. Bjerknes R. Axelsson M. Haaheim L.R. Asjo B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 104: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a recent study has indicated that influenza infection did not alter HIV-1 viral load or the rate of CD4+ T cell decline or clinical progression (37Golden M.P. Sajjad Z. Elgart L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, no study has directly addressed the role of flu-derived NA on the HIV-1 replicative cycle. In the present work, we provide evidence suggesting that flu NA either as purified enzymes or as virus-associated augments the processes of HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and virus infection.DISCUSSIONThe effect of endogenous NA on the process of HIV-1 infection has been difficult to dissect because modification of NA activity is always accompanied by other simultaneous biological processes. Given that NAs from different species share the same substrates (e.g.glycoproteins, glycolipids, and oligosaccharides) (48Faillard H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), exogenous NAs derived from few microorganisms (mostly of bacterial origin) have been used to deduce the role played by NAs with respect to the life cycle of HIV-1. Interestingly, several bacteria and viruses produce NA as virulence factors either on their surface or in a secreted form (19Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Some of these microbial pathogens are recognized as opportunistic agents in the course of AIDS (49Ray P.K. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1977; 21: 227-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 50Roggentin P. Gutschker-Gdaniec G.H. Hobrecht R. Schauer R. Clin. Chim.

Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 271-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Considering that secondary lymphoid organs are the preferential sites where microbial agents are concentrated during the normal immune response and where concomitantly high level of HIV-1 replication is thought to occur (53Pantaleo G. Graziosi C. Butini L. Pizzo P.A. Schnittman S.M. Kotler D.P. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9838-9842Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 54Poli G. Pantaleo G.

Retroviruses. 1998; 14: S135-S142PubMed Google Scholar), it is therefore of high importance to delineate the role of pathogen-derived NA in the biology of HIV-1.In this report, we have initially tested the modulatory role of purified flu NA on HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and cell-free virus infection. We showed that treating cells with flu-derived NAs remarkably augmented the initial cell-cell interaction and thereby promoted HIV-1-mediated cytopathic effect (i.e. syncytium formation). We have also noticed that desialylation of target cells increased susceptibility of target cells to infection with cell-free HIV-1 particles. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that virion-associated flu NA exhibits a similar enhancing effect on HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation and cell-free virus infection.In our in vitro experimental systems, studied target cells, including freshly isolated PBMCs, were more prone to HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation in the presence of either purified flu NA enzyme or different strains of UV-inactivated flu virus that bear NA activity. The flu NA-dependent up-regulating effect on HIV-1-induced syncytium formation is likely to occur through a mechanism involving the removal of sialic acids from the cell surface as zanamivir, a specific flu NA inhibitor, suppressed the observed up-regulation. Sialic acid content is one of the key elements regulating cell-to-cell contact (56Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and desialylation caused by flu NA enzymatic activity results most likely in a higher rate of intercellular interaction, which eventually increases HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation. Given that our results demonstrate that flu NA treatment increases the intercellular interaction of a number of cells including PBMCs and T cells, the presence of NA-producing microorganisms in local lymph tissues could increase the stability of cell-cell interactions, thereby promoting transmission of HIV-1 between susceptible cells.Besides HIV-1-mediated syncytium formation, purified flu NA was also found to affect the process of cell-free HIV-1 infection in several different cell source, an increase in infection which was zanamivir-sensitive. Because transcriptional activity of HIV-1 LTR region in 1G5 cells was not modulated by purified NA, it can be postulated that NA is primarily affecting the early steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Experiments conducted with single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses supports the idea that flu NA is most likely affecting the initial events in HIV-1 life cycle. It should be noted that desialylation by bacterial-derived NA has also been observed to promote HIV-1 attachment and entry (15Hu H. Shioda T. Moriya C. Xin X. Hasan M.K. Miyake K. Shimada T. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sun J. Barbeau B. Sato S. Tremblay M.J. Virology. 2001; 284: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such a modified interaction between target cells and HIV-1 particles in the presence of secreted NA by surrounding NA-producing pathogens might have a profound impact on HIV-1 spreading and infection. For example, a more rapid and stable binding of virions to susceptible cells under in vivoconditions will likely positively affect the HIV-1 attachment process.Most studies, which were aimed at defining the effect of NA on HIV-1 biology, were using purified soluble NA derived from various pathogens of bacterial origin. It can therefore be questioned whether the amount of NA released by or associated with such microorganisms are in the same order of magnitude as the concentrations of purified NA used in these experimental studies. Besides, NAs of several pathogens, including human flu virus A and B, are membrane-associated. Thus, the validity of the data obtained with purified soluble NA remains questionable and might not be representative enough to deduce the exact role played by membrane-bound NA on the biology of HIV-1 in patients dually infected with HIV-1 and NA-bearing pathogens. We therefore assessed whether flu-anchored NA would exhibit a similar positive effect on HIV-1 replication. This specific issue was addressed by using several flu virus isolates that were inactivated by UV treatment to eliminate possible expression of flu-encoded protein(s) within studied cells. This is founded on a previous report showing that expression of flu virus hemagglutinin in mammalian cells induces activation of NF-κB (57Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transcription factor recognized as a powerful activator of HIV-1 transcription (58Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Whole UV-inactivated flu viruses were first confirmed to harbor NA enzymatic activity on their surface but importantly were also capable of potentiating HIV-1-dependent giant cell formation and HIV-1 replication in both T cell lines and PBMCs. Both of these events were furthermore positively modulated by flu viruses in a zanamivir-sensitive fashion.On the basis of these latter results, it could be postulated that an effective treatment against flu infection in HIV-1-positive individuals might be beneficial for such patients. However, previous observations have reported that flu infection in HIV-1-positive individuals did not alter HIV-1 viral load or clinical progression (37Golden M.P. Sajjad Z. Elgart L. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In fact, because the flu virus is mainly localized in the upper respiratory tract, such interaction between this virus and HIV-1 target cells might not be sufficiently predominant. However, one important related issue concerns the safety and risk-benefit ratio of flu vaccination of HIV-1-infected adults, which is still a matter of debate because of the controversy surrounding putative changes in plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA following vaccination of HIV-1-infected patients against flu (35Ho D.D. Lancet. 1992; 3391549Abstract PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Rosok B. Voltersvik P. Bjerknes R. Axelsson M. Haaheim L.R. Asjo B. Clin. Exp.

Dis. 1999; 28: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is plausible that this risk could be even higher with the use of live-attenuated flu vaccines in light of our results.Our results thus offer a model by which the interactions of NA-bearing pathogens with HIV-1 can be studied. Although in vivo, such interactions between flu viruses and HIV-1 are less likely to occur, other pathogens, which represent opportunistic infectious agents and which are NA-positive, could be tested in our cell lines model for their effect on HIV-1 replication and virus-mediated syncytium formation. In addition, the in vitro activity of zanamivir against flu NA-mediated positive modulation of the HIV-1 life cycle in our system calls for discovery and potential use of NA inhibitors of other NA-producing pathogens known to be frequently detected in HIV-1-infected individuals.In summary, our findings indicate that human flu virus through the enzymatic activity of NA, one of the two surface glycoproteins of this virus, accentuates syncytium formation and infection by HIV-1. A specific inhibitor of flu NA (i.e. zanamivir) was used to successfully block flu NA-mediated enhancing effect on HIV-1 life cycle. These findings should provide a new model, which has direct physiological relevance because microbial pathogens that produce NAs as virulence factors may affect HIV-1 pathogenesis via desialylating effect of these enzymes. In addition, we are presently studying the use of the ex vivo tonsil fragment model to study the impact of NA-bearing pathogens on HIV-1 replication. Through the results from the presented flu virus model, potent specific inhibitors of NA might be considered for the treatment of patients suffering from infection with HIV-1 and NA-encoding pathogens.

Nature. 1997; 387: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, HIV-1 attachment to host cells often occurs under suboptimal conditions because of a low frequency of gp120/CD4 interaction events (6Moore J.P. Ho D.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 9: S117-S136Google Scholar, 7Sattentau Q.J. Moore J.P. Vignaux F. Traincard F. Poignard P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7383-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fouts T.R. Binley J.M. Trkola A. Robinson J.E. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2779-2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. First, most cell types that are permissive for HIV-1 infection express little CD4 (9Sonza S. Maerz A. Uren S. Violo A. Hunter S. Boyle W. Crowe S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Dick A.D. Pell M. Brew B.J. Foulcher E. Sedgwick J.D. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 11: 1699-1708Google Scholar). Second, the weak association between gp120 and gp41 results in a rapid gp120 shedding and, consequently, a loss of virus infectivity (11Gelderblom H.R. Reupke H. Pauli G. Lancet. 1985; 2: 1016-1017Abstract PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Gelderblom H.R. Hausmann E.H. Ozel M. Pauli G. Koch M.A. Virology. 1987; 156: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Third, the efficient attachment of circulating virions to target cells has to take place despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies that are directed predominantly against gp120 (13Sattentau Q.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, the electrostatic repulsive forces that result from net negative charges present on the surface of both virion and target cell represent an obstacle to the initial virus attachment process (14Fenouillet E. Gluckman J.C. Bahraoui E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that other interactions between the virus and the cell surface are necessary to overcome the various factors that might jeopardize the first step in the life cycle of an intracellular parasite such as HIV-1. Accumulating evidence suggest that the activity of bacterially derived neuraminidase (NA, also termed sialidase) can also modulate replication of this retrovirus, including the attachment process, by reducing the level of sialylation of glycoconjugates expressed on the surface of viruses and target cells (15Hu H. Shioda T. Moriya C. Xin X. Hasan M.K. Miyake K. Shimada T. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stamatos N.M. Gomatos P.J. Cox J. Fowler A. Dow N. Wohlhieter J.A.

Sialic acids are monosaccharides transferred onto glycolipids and glycoproteins which travel through the secretory pathway (18Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Science. 1999; 284: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 19Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). One of the distinct features of sialic acid is its outermost cellular location and its negative charge that increases the net negative charge present on the cell surface. In animals, NAs have been found in several tissues, where the enzymes play various roles in regulation of the surface sialic acid profile of cells. Thus, the balance between sialic acid content and sialidase activity is often found to affect many biological phenomena in animal cells, such as T and B cell activation, hematopoietic cell differentiation, apoptosis, and particularly the regulation of various cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions (20Powell L.D.

As the surface of both HIV-1 and its natural target cells contain highly sialylated glycoconjugates, previous works have scrutinized the potential implication of sialic acid and neuraminidase activity in the HIV-1 life cycle. For example, Hu et al.(15Hu H. Shioda T. Moriya C. Xin X. Hasan M.K. Miyake K. Shimada T. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7462-7470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that desialylation of HIV-1 increases virus infectivity, whereas others have reported that desialylation of freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) creates a cellular environment more suitable for virus growth (16Stamatos N.M.

Probably as a consequence of these ligand-induced changes, the effect of a mutation in the active site is not easily anticipated from structural information alone. Asn38, for instance, hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. However, the mutation of Asn38 to alanine has no effect on the K mfor IMP, but reduces k cat by 3 orders of magnitude (21Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

The mutation of Arg143, which hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP, not only elevates the K m for IMP by 100-fold, but also the K m for GTP by 10-fold (23Wang W. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation among adenylosuccinate synthetases implicate Thr128, Thr129, Val273, Thr300, and Thr301 in important functional roles. All of the above residues, except Val273, belong to flexible loops, which undergo significant conformational change in response to the binding of IMP (loop 120−131) orl-aspartate (loop 298−304). Thr128 and Thr129 interact with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP and Thr301 hydrogen bonds directly to the carboxyl group of hadacidin (N-formyl N-hydroxyglycine; an analogue of l-aspartate). The roles of these residues in substrate recognition can be anticipated on the basis of their interactions in ligated crystal structures. Reasons for sequence conservation at positions 273 and 300, however, are not immediately apparent from crystal structures. Studies here confirm the anticipated roles of Thr128 and Thr129 in the recognition of IMP and of Thr301 in the recognition of l-aspartate. Thr300 supports the recognition of l-aspartate most likely through the influence of its β-branched side chain on the conformation of loop 298−304. Most surprising, however, is the significance of Val273 to the recognition ofl-aspartate. Its mutation to alanine, threonine, or asparagine causes 15–40-fold increases in the K mfor l-aspartate, while reducing K ivalues for analogues of l-aspartate by up to 40-fold. Evidently, Val273 is essential in the selection of a catalytically productive conformation of l-aspartate from an ensemble of four-carbon dicarboxylic acids, present at appreciable concentrations in vivo.

Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and multiple sequence alignments (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). Sequences of adenylosuccinate synthetases were identified initially by their match to the 9-residue P-loop of the synthetase (single-letter amino acid sequence: QWGDEGKGK). Positions 129 and 273 are threonine and valine, respectively, in all sequences of adenylosuccinate synthetases extracted from the Protein Information Resource data base (a total of 45 entries), whereas positions 128 and 301 are threonine in 44 sequences (serine was the alternative residue). In 32 of 45 sequences, position 300 is threonine, the alternative residue types being valine (10 instances), serine (2 instances), and asparagine (1 instance). Sequences within the adenylosuccinate synthetase family exhibit at least 40% identity for any pairwise alignment. The mutant and wild-type enzymes migrate comparably on phenyl-Sepharose and DEAE columns. All proteins were at least 95% pure on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Circular dichroism spectra of all enzymes were identical from 200 to 260 nm (data not shown), indicating no major changes in secondary structure. K mAspand k cat values for the wild-type, Thr128 → Ala, and Thr129 → Ala enzymes are comparable (Table I). In contrast, the mutation of Thr128 to alanine increases K mIMP and K mGTP by 10- and 2-fold, respectively, and the mutation of Thr129 to alanine increases K mIMP and K mGTP by 30- and 80-fold, respectively. Mutations of position 273 have little effect on K mGTP and K mIMP, but increase K mAsp by 30-, 40-, and 15-fold for the alanine, asparagine, and threonine mutations, respectively. Values of k cat for the Val273 → Ala and Val273 → Thr enzymes are similar (2-fold less and 3-fold greater than, respectively) to that of the wild-type enzyme, but the mutation of Val273 to asparagine causes a 20-fold reduction in k cat. The mutation of Thr300 to alanine elevates K mGTP by 5-fold and K mAsp by 30-fold. In contrast, K mGTP and K mIMP increase by 2-fold or less as a result of the mutation of Thr300 to valine, andk cat and K mAsp increase by only 3-fold. The mutation of Thr301 to alanine results in the complete loss of activity under conditions employed here (20 mmHepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm GTP, 500 μm IMP, 6 mm Mg2+, 25 mml-aspartate, 200 μg/ml protein).Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant adenylosuccinate synthetasesEnzyme1-aObserved no catalytic activity for the Thr301 → Ala enzyme under conditions specified in the text.k catK mGTPK mIMPK mAspk cat/K mGTPk cat/K mIMPk cat/K mAsps−1μmμmmms−1mm−1s−1mm−1s−1 mm−1Wild-type1.00 ± 0.0526 ± 228 ± 10.23 ± 0.0438 ± 436 ± 34.4 ± 0.8Thr128 → Ala1-bEmployed fixed concentrations of 0.25 mm IMP and 0.45 mm GTP.0.46 ± 0.0354 ± 6310 ± 500.17 ± 0.029 ± 11.5 ± 0.32.7 ± 0.4Thr129 → Ala1-cEmployed fixed concentrations of 6 mm IMP and 0.60 mm GTP.0.42 ± 0.011700 ± 60890 ± 700.24 ± 0.010.25 ± 0.010.47 ± 0.041.75 ± 0.08Thr300 → Ala1-dEmployed fixed concentration of 25 mm l-aspartate.0.64 ± 0.04170 ± 1019 ± 16.2 ± 0.73.9 ± 0.434 ± 30.10 ± 0.01Thr300 → Val3.3 ± 0.256 ± 633 ± 30.82 ± 0.0260 ± 7100 ± 104.1 ± 0.2Val273 → Ala1-dEmployed fixed concentration of 25 mm l-aspartate.1-eAssayed with 25 mmmagnesium chloride while varying the concentration ofl-aspartate.1.00 ± 0.131 ± 317 ± 27 ± 132 ± 559 ± 90.14 ± 0.03Val273 → Asn1-dEmployed fixed concentration of 25 mm l-aspartate.1-eAssayed with 25 mmmagnesium chloride while varying the concentration ofl-aspartate.0.050 ± 0.00121 ± 224 ± 29 ± 22.4 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.20.006 ± 0.001Val273 → Thr1-dEmployed fixed concentration of 25 mm l-aspartate.1-eAssayed with 25 mmmagnesium chloride while varying the concentration ofl-aspartate.1.99 ± 0.0245 ± 743 ± 43.4 ± 0.244 ± 146 ± 60.61 ± 0.07See text for conditions of assay.K mGTP,K mIMP, andK mAsp are the Michaelis constants for GTP, IMP, and l-aspartate, respectively.1-a Observed no catalytic activity for the Thr301 → Ala enzyme under conditions specified in the text.1-b Employed fixed concentrations of 0.25 mm IMP and 0.45 mm GTP.1-c Employed fixed concentrations of 6 mm IMP and 0.60 mm GTP.1-d Employed fixed concentration of 25 mm l-aspartate.1-e Assayed with 25 mmmagnesium chloride while varying the concentration ofl-aspartate.

Ala301, Ala273, Thr273, Asn273, and wild-type enzymes exhibit similar kinetic parameters when assayed with hydroxylamine (Table III). K mhydroxylamine, K mGTP, and K mIMP vary over a 3-fold range, whereas k cat varies 6-fold among the enzymes of Table III.

The side chain of Thr128hydrogen bonds with Asp114, facilitating hydrogen bonds between the side chain and backbone amide of Thr129 with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. The side chain of Thr300approaches and may hydrogen bond weakly with backbone carbonyl 38 and the side chain of His53. The backbone amide and side chain of Thr301 hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of hadacidin (an analogue of l-aspartate). The conformation of bound hadacidin in crystallographic complexes is consistent with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the β-carboxyl and α-amino groups of l-aspartate (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The β-carboxyl group may then abstract a proton from the α-amino group ofl-aspartate in catalyzing the second step of the synthetase reaction. The side chain of Val273 makes nonbonded contacts with hadacidin and with the aliphatic methylene carbons of the side chain of Arg305. Although side chains larger than an isopropyl group at position 273 could come into steric conflict withl-aspartate, there are no steric conflicts in the substitution of side chains of smaller or similar size. The backbone carbonyl of Val273 hydrogen bonds with the 2′-hydroxyl group of IMP, but this interaction may not be important as 2′-deoxy-IMP is a good substrate for the synthetase (31Spector T. Miller R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The side-chain conformation of Val273 is unfavorable (χ1 ∼ 240°, an eclipsed conformation; Fig.2). Efforts to build and refine (by simulated annealing), the side chain in a staggered conformation (χ1 ∼ 60°, 180°, or 300°) return the unfavorable torsion angle. 2Z. Hou and R. B. Honzatko, unpublished results. Staggered conformations for Val273 cause unacceptable contacts with backbone carbonyl 273 and/or the CG atom of Arg305.Figure 2Interactions of amino acid residue 273.Val273 makes allowable nonbonded contacts with Arg305 at the cost of an unfavorable χ1torsion angle in the GDP·IMP·NO 3−·Mg2+·hadacidin complex (Protein Data Base accession code 1cib; left). Thr273 makes allowable nonbonded contacts with Arg303 and Arg305, while adopting a favorable χ1 torsion angle in the GDP·IMP·Mg2+·succinate complex, but Arg303 may not hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of succinate (right). Donor-acceptor interactions and selected nonbonded contacts are indicated by dashed lines. This drawing was done with MOLSCRIPT (38Kraulis J. J. Appl.

Presumably, the hydrogen bond between Thr128 and Asp114 stabilizes the ligand-bound conformation of loop 120−131, and facilitates interactions between Thr129 and the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. Evidently, interactions involving Thr128 and Thr129 do little to stabilize the transition state (k cat falls only 2-fold because of these mutations). In this regard, the effects of mutations at positions 128 and 129 and at Arg143 are similar. The side chain of Arg143 from a symmetry-related monomer of the synthetase dimer hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. The mutation of Arg143 to leucine or lysine results in a 100-fold increase in K mIMP and no change in k cat (6Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutation of Asn38, which also hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP, has no effect on K mIMP, but causes a 1000-fold decrease in k cat (21Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16000-16004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 60-fold increase in K mGTPrelative to the wild-type enzyme for the Thr129 → Ala mutant must come from an indirect mechanism, as Thr129 and GTP are separated by more than 10 Å. A 10-fold increase in K mGTP was observed for the Arg143 → Leu synthetase (6Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Correlated changes in K mIMP and K mGTP probably stem from binding synergism between IMP and GTP, which may originate from the interaction of Asn38 with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. In a crystal structure of an IMP-synthetase complex (32Hou Z. Wang W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (in press)Google Scholar), loop 40−53 adopts the conformation of the GDP-bound synthetase in the absence of guanine nucleotide. IMP alone, through its interaction with Asn38, can stabilize the GDP-bound conformation of loop 40−53. Correlated changes in K mIMP and K mGTP because of mutations at positions 129 and 143, then, may stem from a perturbation of the Asn38-IMP interaction and a concomitant loss in the ability of IMP to drive conformational changes in loop 40–53. The significant effects on K mAspand/or k cat resulting from mutations of threonines 300 and 301 to alanine are in harmony with those observed in mutations of Arg303, and Arg304 and Arg305 to leucine (33Wang W. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13160-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structures implicate loop 298−304 in the recognition of the β-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 30-fold increase in K mAsp for the Thr300→ Ala synthetase may arise in part from the loss of weak hydrogen bonds involving the side chain of Thr300, but other factors are involved here as well. The β-branched side chain at position 300 limits allowable main-chain torsion angles relative to the methyl group of alanine. The Thr300 → Val enzyme retains the conformational restraints because of the β-branched side chain, but eliminates side-chain hydrogen bonds. The consequence is only a 3-fold increase in K mAsp and an increase in k cat of 300%. The modest effects of the Thr300 → Val mutation are consistent with the presence of valine at position 300 in 25% of known sequences for the synthetase. The 5-fold increase in K mGTP resulting from the mutation of Thr300 to alanine may reflect binding synergism betweenl-aspartate and GTP. GTP/l-aspartate binding synergism may stem in part from the coordination of each ligand to a common Mg2+. In addition, a series of crystal structures (14Choe J.Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6953-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrate enhanced interactions between Arg305(which putatively binds to the α-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate) and the α-phosphoryl group of the guanine nucleotide in the presence of hadacidin (thel-aspartate analogue). As the Thr301 → Ala synthetase is inactive in assays using l-aspartate, we are unable to determine whether the loss of activity is the result of an effect onk cat or to a large increase in K mAsp. If the mutation of Thr301 to alanine eliminates critical hydrogen bonds with the β-carboxyl group of l-aspartate, as inferred by crystal structures and model building (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), then the Thr301 → Ala mutant enzyme and the wild-type enzyme should respond comparably to hydroxylamine as an alternative substrate. Indeed, kinetic parameters for the Thr301 → Ala mutant are similar to those of the wild-type enzyme when hydroxylamine is used in place of l-aspartate (Table III). The apparent saturation effect, observed with increasing concentrations of hydroxylamine, may be a consequence then of reduced specific activity of the synthetase at high ionic strength. So, in fact, the reaction involving hydroxylamine may be diffusion-controlled. The reduced Hill coefficients in reactions that employ hydroxylamine reaffirm the correlated binding of l-aspartate and a second Mg2+ in the kinetic mechanism of the synthetase (34Kang C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15539-15544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Evidently, only one Mg2+ participates in the hydroxylamine reaction, whereas two are involved in the l-aspartate reaction. Kang and Fromm (34Kang C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15539-15544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggest that a second Mg2+binds to the carboxyl groups of l-aspartate, to reduce the pK a of its α-amino group. An alternative model puts the second Mg2+ between the α-carboxyl group ofl-aspartate and the side chain of Asp13, to offset the effects of an unacceptable nonbonded contact between these groups (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both models are consistent with the reduced Hill coefficient observed in the presence of hydroxylamine. Mg2+may not coordinate hydroxylamine effectively, but its pK a (8.0) is low enough to support catalysis at pH 7.7 (pH of optimal activity) without the influence of a second Mg2+. Although only nonbonded contacts are evident in crystal structures between Val273 and hadacidin, the mutation of Val273 to alanine causes a 30-fold increase in K mAsp. As the mutation puts a small side chain in place of a larger one, unfavorable steric interactions with the substrate are unlikely. Furthermore, the productive binding of l-aspartate to the Ala273mutant and wild-type enzymes must be nearly identical, as K mGTP (which reflectsl-aspartate/GTP-binding synergism) andk cat are unchanged. Mutation to a larger side chain (Val273 → Asn) causes a 40-fold increase in K mAsp and a 20-fold reduction ink cat, suggesting a perturbation in the productive binding of l-aspartate, resulting perhaps from the steric effects from a side chain with increased size. The isosteric mutation Val273 → Thr, however, still causes a 15-fold increase in K mAsp, whereask cat actually increases 200%. Inhibition of position 273 mutants by dicarboxylic acids provides a measure of insight as to how Val273 functions in substrate recognition. Fumarate is a potent inhibitor of the Ala273and Asn273 mutant enzymes, but has no effect on the wild-type enzyme, and similarly succinate and maleate become potent inhibitors of the Thr273 mutant enzyme. The active sites of position 273 enzymes generally recognize a more diverse set of dicarboxylic acids than does the wild-type active site. This broadened recognition for dicarboxylic acids may allow l-aspartate to bind in different modes to the active sites of the position 273 mutants. Productive binding for l-aspartate is retained in the Thr273 and Ala273 mutant enzymes, but other, nonproductive binding modes may be important. These nonproductive binding modes may include, for instance, the ligation of the β-carboxyl group of l-aspartate to the active site Mg2+ (backward binding) and/or the binding ofl-aspartate in a conformation that does not permit the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between its β-carboxyl and α-amino groups. Hence, the K mAsp may increase for position 273 mutants enzymes because of competition between productive and nonproductive binding modes of the substrate. The kinetic properties of the above mutations are clearly consistent with the absolute sequence conservation of valine at position 273. In fact, the selective pressures that retain position 273 as valine are now evident. In vivo concentrations of fumarate, succinate, and l-aspartate in E. coli are ∼0.4, 0.4, and 2 mm (35Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Siegel W.H. Donohue T. Bernlohr R.W. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1977; 34: 512-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations at position 273, presented here, are relatively conservative, yet each generates an enzyme that has a K mAsp at least 5-fold higher than intracellular concentrations of l-aspartate and vastly improved binding affinities for succinate and fumarate. Under physiological conditions, then, the position 273 mutant enzymes are inactive. In preliminary crystal structures of the Thr273 synthetase in complexes with succinate·IMP·GDP·Mg2+ and maleate·IMP· GDP·Mg2+ at 2-Å resolution, 3C. Iancu, E. Underbakke, and R. B. Honzatko, unpublished results. the active site is not substantially altered by the mutation. Succinate and maleate coordinate to Mg2+ and hydrogen bond to loop 298−304, as observed in the hadacidin-ligated active site of the wild-type enzyme. Thr273 has a χ1 angle of 300°, a rotation of 60° relative to the χ1 angle for the side chain of Val273 of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2). The side chain of Thr273 now makes nonbonded contacts with both Arg303 and Arg305, but no hydrogen bonds. Arg303 approaches, but may not hydrogen bond with, succinate. These subtle differences in conformation may be caused by the mutation at position 273 or to the replacement of hadacidin with succinate/maleate. Information from the hadacidin complex of the Thr273 enzyme is necessary before definitive conclusions are possible. Nonetheless, the functional consequences of the mutation of Val273 to threonine are not the result of gross conformational changes at the active site and/or hydrogen bonding of the threonine hydroxyl group OG1."
