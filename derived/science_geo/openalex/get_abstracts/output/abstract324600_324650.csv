https://openalex.org/W2080988955,"A novel concept for performing stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations has been developed that is based on the limited miscibility of partially or fully fluorinated compounds with nonfluorinated compounds. A fluorous biphase system (FBS) consists of a fluorous phase containing a dissolved reagent or catalyst and another phase, which could be any common organic or nonorganic solvent with limited or no solubility in the fluorous phase. The fluorous phase is defined as the fluorocarbon (mostly perfluorinated alkanes, ethers, and tertiary amines)-rich phase of a biphase system. An FBS compatible reagent or catalyst contains enough fluorous moieties that it will be soluble only or preferentially in the fluorous phase. The most effective fluorous moieties are linear or branched perfluoroalkyl chains with high carbon number; they may also contain heteroatoms. The chemical transformation may occur either in the fluorous phase or at the interface of the two phases. The application of FBS has been demonstrated for the extraction of rhodium from toluene and for the hydroformylation of olefins. The ability to separate a catalyst or a reagent from the products completely at mild conditions could lead to industrial application of homogeneous catalysts or reagents and to the development of more environmentally benign processes."
https://openalex.org/W2033986938,"Performance of enzymes and whole cells in commercial applications can often be dramatically improved by immobilization of the biocatalysts, for instance, by their covalent attachment to or adsorption on solid supports, entrapment in polymeric gels, encapsulation, and cross-linking. The effect of immobilization on enzymatic properties and stability of biocatalysts is considered. Applications of immobilized enzymes and cells in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, in clinical and chemical analyses, and in medicine, as well as probable future trends in enzyme technology are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2109555295,"Within a relatively short geological time frame, Neolithic man, or more probably woman, domesticated all the major cereal grains, legumes, and root crops that the world's people depend on for most of their calories and protein. Until very recently, crop improvement was in the hands of farmers. The cornerstones of modern plant breeding were laid by Darwin and Mendel in the late 19th century. As the knowledge of genetics, plant pathology, and entomology have grown during the 20th century, plant breeders have made enormous contributions to increased food production throughout the world. There have been major plant breeding break-throughs for maize and wheat, and promising research activities to raise yields in marginal production environments are ongoing. Since it is doubtful that significant production benefits will soon be forthcoming from the use of genetic engineering techniques with higher plants, especially polyploid species, most research funds for crop improvement should continue to be allocated for conventional plant breeding research."
https://openalex.org/W2056392653,"Analyses of historical ocean temperature data at a depth of 125 meters in the North Atlantic Ocean indicate that from 1950 to 1990 the subtropical and subarctic gyres exhibited linear trends that were opposite in phase. In addition, multivariate analyses of yearly mean temperature anomaly fields between 20°N and 70°N in the North Atlantic show a characteristic space-time temperature oscillation from 1947 to 1990. A quasidecadal oscillation, first identified at Ocean Weather Station C, is part of a basin-wide feature. Gyre and basin-scale variations such as these provide the observational basis for climate diagnostic and modeling studies."
https://openalex.org/W2010699225,An atomic structure model for a 25 degrees [001] symmetric tilt grain boundary in SrTiO(3) has been determined directly from experimental data with the use of high-resolution Z-contrast imaging coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy. The derived model of the grain boundary was refined by bond-valence sum calculations and reveals candidate sites for dopant atoms in the boundary plane. These results show how the combined techniques can be used to deduce the atomic structure of defects and interfaces without recourse to preconceived structural models or image simulations.
https://openalex.org/W2006351245,"The interface between a two-dimensional (2D) molecular gas and a 2D molecular solid has been imaged with a low-temperature, ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscope. The solid consists of benzene molecules strongly bound to step edges on a Cu{111} surface. Benzene molecules on the Cu{111} terraces move freely as a 2D gas at 77 kelvin. Benzene molecules transiently occupy well-defined adsorption sites at the 1D edge of the 2D solid. Diffusion of molecules between these sites and exchange between the two phases at the interface are observed. On raised terraces of the copper surface, the 2D gas is held in a cage of the solid as in a 2D nanometer-scale gas bulb."
https://openalex.org/W1986481098,"Protoplasts of sexually incompatible species have been fused and in some combinations have given rise to somatic hybrid plants. Partial elimination of parental chromosomes from either species is common in such hybrids, but total chromosome loss has generally occurred only with phylogenetically unrelated pairings. Genetic function of one parent may be retained despite a complete loss of its chromosomes, suggesting that genetic introgression is possible in the absence of complete donor chromosomes. A model interspecific combination for such studies is the potato-tomato somatic hybrid for which numerous phenotypes and karyotypes are encountered at the outset, with a broader range observed in the second somatic generation."
https://openalex.org/W2030145223,"Enormous genetic variability is accumulated by plant cells proliferating in culture. Additional variability can be induced in cultured cell populations by exposure to mutagens. This pool of genetic diversity can be examined for agronomically desirable traits at two levels of differentiation. Populations of plants regenerated from callus cultures can be screened by conventional methods. Alternatively, selective culture conditions favoring growth of specific mutant types can be applied at the cellular level. The several characteristics that have been introduced by these methods to date are a harbinger of future contributions to be made by cell culture to the genetic improvement of crops."
https://openalex.org/W1997967110,"Silvicultural and genetic manipulation of Douglas fir and loblolly pine plantations have increased their productivity 70 and 300 percent, respectively, over natural forests on the same sites. Yet these intensively managed plantations are achieving less than 50 percent of their potential productivity. Future increases in yield will result from optimization of nutritional treatments, control of noncrop vegetation, and advances in tree breeding and tissue culture techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2066361114,"Thorium-230 ages of emergent marine deposits on Oahu, Hawaii, have a uniform distribution of ages from approximately 114,000 to approximately 131,000 years, indicating a duration for the last interglacial sea-level high stand of approximately 17,000 years, in contrast to a duration of approximately 8000 years inferred from the orbitally tuned marine oxygen isotope record. Sea level on Oahu rose to >/=1 to 2 meters higher than present by 131,000 years ago or approximately 6000 years earlier than inferred from the marine record. Although the latter record suggests a shift back to glacial conditions beginning at approximately 119,000 years ago, the Oahu coral ages indicate a near present sea level until approximately 114,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2076803783,"Both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic microorganisms, grown on various carbon and energy sources, are used in fermentation processes for the production of single-cell proteins. Commercial-scale production has been limited to two algal processes, one bacterial process, and several yeast and fungal processes. High capital and operating costs and the need for extensive nutritional and toxicological assessments have limited the development and commercialization of new processes. Any increase in commercial-scale production appears to be limited to those regions of the world where low-cost carbon and energy sources are available and conventional animal feedstuff proteins, such as soybean meal or fish meal, are in short supply."
https://openalex.org/W2012631237,"Renewable raw materials may be converted by biological means to feedstocks for the chemical industry. Glucose from cornstarch is the current choice as a substrate, although advances may enable the use of less expensive lignocellulosic materals. The production of oxychemicals and their derivatives from renewable resources could amount to about 100 billion pounds annually, or about half of the U.S. production of organic chemicals. Ethanol produced by fermentation is now cost-competitive with industral ethanol produced from fossil fuel. Biological routes to other oxychemicals exist and are expected to be important in the future. Several product recovery methods may be used, but new energy-conserving methods will be needed to make the engineering-biology combinations economical."
https://openalex.org/W2023761517,"The bioreactor provides a central link between the starting feedstock and the product. The reaction yield and selectivity are determined by the biocatalyst, but productivity is often determined by the process technology; as a consequence, biochemical reaction engineering becomes the interface for the biologist and engineer. Developments in bioreactor design, including whole cell immobilization, immobilized enzymes, continuous reaction, and process control, will increasingly reflect the need for cross-disciplinary interaction in the biochemical process industry."
