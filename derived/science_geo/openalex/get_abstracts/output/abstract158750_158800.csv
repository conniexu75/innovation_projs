https://openalex.org/W1498929362,"Myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APC) are known to cross-present exogenous antigen on major histocompatibility class I molecules to CD8+ T cells and thereby induce protective immunity against infecting microorganisms. Here we report that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are organ-resident, non-myeloid APC capable of cross-presenting soluble exogenous antigen to CD8+ T cells. Though LSEC employ similar molecular mechanisms for cross-presentation as dendritic cells, the outcome of cross-presentation by LSEC is CD8+ T cell tolerance rather than immunity. As uptake of circulating antigens into LSEC occurs efficiently in vivo, it is likely that cross-presentation by LSEC contributes to CD8+ T cell tolerance observed in situations where soluble antigen is present in the circulation."

When subjects were deprived of sleep for 30 hours after training and then tested after two full nights of recovery sleep, they showed no significant improvement, despite normal levels of alertness. Together with previous findings11 that subjects show no improvement when retested the same day as training, this demonstrates that sleep within 30 hours of training is absolutely required for improved performance."

https://openalex.org/W2171863507,"A previously unrecognized passive transport for pyridine dinucleotides has been described recently in the plasmamembrane of several mammalian cells. Despite elucidation of some functional and kinetic properties of this transport system, it is still undefined at the molecular level. Therefore, we have addressed the molecular characterization of the NAD+ transporter and identified it as connexin 43 (Cx43). This is a structural component of hexameric hemichannels that, when juxtaposed on adjacent cells, builds up intercellular gap junctions and mediates exchange of molecules between cells. However, the role of connexin hemichannels as potential pores in individual, noncoupled cells remains elusive. Bidirectional NAD+ transport in isolated Cx43-expressing mur ine 3T3 fibroblasts was affected by known modulators of connexin-mediated intercellular coupling and was completely inhibited by treatment of the cells with a Cx43-antisense oligonucleotide. NAD+ transport in proteoliposomes reconstituted with 3T3 membrane proteins was inhibited in the presence of a monoclonal anti-Cx43 antibody. Finally, Cx43 immunopurified to homogeneity was reconstituted in unilamellar proteoliposomes, which displayed full NAD+-transporting activity. This finding is the first evidence that connexin hemichannels can mediate transmembrane fluxes of a nucleotide in whole cells: The pleiotropy of NAD+-dependent cellular events, including redox reactions, signaling, and DNA repair, implicates Cx43 hemichannels in intercellular NAD+ trafficking, which suggests new paracrine functions of NAD."

Because molecular processes such as apical sorting, internalization, or subsequent degradation might be assisted by associated proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen against the C-terminal, cytosolic tail of type IIa cotransporter was designed. Most of the potential proteins found belonged to proteins with multiple PDZ modules and were either identical/related to PDZK1 or identical to NHERF-1. Yeast trap truncation assays confined the peptide-protein association to the C-terminal amino acid residues TRL of type IIa cotransporter and to single PDZ domains of each identified protein, respectively. The specificity of these interactions were confirmed in yeast by testing other apical localized transmembraneous proteins. Moreover, the type IIa protein was recovered in vitro by glutathioneS-transferase-fused PDZ proteins from isolated renal brush border membranes or from type IIa-expressing oocytes. Further, these PDZ proteins are immunohistochemically detected either in the microvilli or in the subapical compartment of proximal tubular cells.

Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Three structurally unrelated sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransporter families have been identified (1Knox F.G. Haramati A. Seldin G.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, New York1985: 1351-1396Google Scholar, 3Werner A. Dehmelt L. Nalbant P. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By immunohistochemistry, it was apparent that members of the type I and the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporters are located in the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells (4Biber J. Custer M. Werner A. Kaissling B. Murer H. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 424: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Custer M. Lötscher M. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter gene (npt2) provided strong evidence that ∼70% of Na-dependent Pi transport across the brush border membrane is mediated by the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter (6Beck L. Karaplis A.C. Amizuka N. Hewson A.S. Ozawa H. Tenenhouse H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5372-5377Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the type IIa cotransporter represents the major target for the many factors described to regulate proximal tubular Pi reabsorption (2Murer H. Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Additionally, reduced proximal Pi-reabsorption, as observed in X-linked hypophosphatemia, is due to a decreased abundance of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter (7Tenenhouse H.S. Nephrol. Dialysis Transplant. 1999; 14: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). According to the current mechanistic view, inhibition of proximal tubular Pi-reabsorption, such as by PTH or by a diet of high Pi content (acutely given), is achieved by a removal of type IIa cotransporters (2Murer H. Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) from the apical membrane. Results obtained from in vivo (rats) and in vitro (OK cells) studies indicated that internalized type IIa Na/Picotransporters are subjected to degradation in the lysosomes (8Keusch I. Traebert M. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Murer H. Biber J. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1224-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Pfister M.F. Ruf I. Stange G. Ziegler U. Lederer E. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 45: 1909-1914Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Besides Na/Pi cotransport, the activity of the brush border Na/H exchanger, NHE-3, is regulated by PTH as well; however, internalization of NHE-3 seems to occur after a delay and not immediately after binding of PTH to its receptor (10Fan L. Wiederkehr M.R. Collazo R. Wang H. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11289-11295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This kinetic difference of PTH action on the type IIa protein and on the NHE-3 exchanger, respectively, points to a regulatory mechanism specific for the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter. Not much is known about the molecular reactions that underlie the internalization of the type IIa cotransporter. Although protein kinases are activated upon the binding of PTH to its receptor (2Murer H. Hernando N. Forster I. Biber J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1373-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), the target(s) for activated kinases relevant for the internalization of the type IIa protein has(have) not yet been identified. The microvillar localization of the type IIa protein and its physiologically controlled abundance in the apical membrane suggest specific interactions of the type IIa protein with other microvillar/subapical proteins. Such interactions may be necessary for the correct apical positioning or may be involved in the signaling pathway that leads to internalization. To identify such candidate proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed. As a bait, we used the C-terminal 75 amino acid residues (563) of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter for the following reasons: (a) based on the current model of the secondary structure, the C terminus is located at the cytoplasmic surface (11Lambert G. Traebert M. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); (b) by truncation studies, evidence was obtained that the C terminus is important for apical expression of the type IIa protein. 2N. Hernando, J. Biber, and H. Murer, unpublished results. We found that the C terminus of the type IIa Na/Picotransporter is a strong interactor to various PDZ proteins. Some of these PDZ proteins were localized in the brush border or in the subapical compartment of proximal tubular cells and thus may be of importance for the polar distribution and/or regulation of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter. EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were introduced by PCR into cDNA fragments encoding the N- or C-terminal tails of the following proteins: mouse type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter (aa 1–109 and 563–637, accession no. AAC52361), mouse type I Na/Pi cotransporter (aa 1–23 and 443–465, accession no. CAA54459), rat Na/H exchanger NHE-3 (aa 1–53 and 447–831, accession no. AAA41702), mouse glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporter bo,+AT (aa 1–34 and 451–487, accession no. AJ249198), rat sulfate/oxalate/bicarbonate anion exchanger Sat-1 (aa 1–73 and 628–703, accession no. AAA17545), rabbit sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT-1 (aa 1–31 and 545–662, accession no. CAA29727), rat sodium/sulfate cotransporter NaSi-1 (aa 1–17 and 569–595, accession no. AAA41677), mouse peptide transporter Pept-2 (aa 1–51 and 705–740, accession no. AAF42470), and rat calcium receptor CaR (aa 861–1079, accession no. AAC52149). To generate LexA DNA binding domain (DNA-BD) fusions, the fragments were inserted in-frame into the vector pBTM116 carrying the TRP1 selection marker (12Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). All cDNA fragments encoding for N termini were subcloned into the vector pFBL23 (13Béranger F. Aresta S. de Gunzburg J. Camonis J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2035-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), where the inserts had reverted orientation relative to LexA. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene) was applied to generate truncations (−3; −46; −56 and −67) of the C terminus from the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter by introducing stop codons at the respective positions. As a control bait, the subunit of the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus (1RTp51) in pBTM116 was used (generously provided by Prof. U. Hübscher; see Ref. 14Tasara T. Amacker M. Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All bait constructs were verified by sequencing with lower and upper primers annealing to either the LexA DNA-BD (pBTM116: lexA_upper = 5′-CCAATTGTCGTTGACTTCGTC-3′; pFBL23: lex-N_lower = 5′-CGCGTCGGCGGCATACCTG) or to the ADH promoter (pBTM116: ADH_lower = 5′-GCATGCCGGTAGAGGTGT-3′; pFBL23: ADH-Pro-LV_upper = 5′-TCGTCATTGTTCTCGTTCCC) from the plasmids. Deletion constructs in pACT2 used for PDZ interaction trap assays in yeast were produced by PCR. cDNA fragments encoding single or multiple PDZ domains (listed below) were obtained by either site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) inserting stop codons downstream of PDZ domain 1, 2, and 3, or by standard amplification, using primers harboring NcoI orXhoI restriction sites: mouse NaPi-Cap1 (accession no.AF220100, aa 1–110 for PDZ1, aa 108–240 for PDZ2, aa 217–359 for PDZ3, aa 348–472 for PDZ4, aa 1–229 for PDZ1–2, aa 1–350 for PDZ1–3); mouse NaPi-Cap2 (accession no. AF334612, aa 1–145 for PDZ1, aa 125–270 for PDZ2, aa 243–377 for PDZ3, aa 370–498 for PDZ4, aa 1–254 for PDZ1–2 and aa 1–373 for PDZ1–3); mouse NHERF-1 (accession no. U74079, aa 1–129 for PDZ1). cDNA fragments, corresponding to the cytosolic N (aa 1–107) or C terminus (aa 563–637) of type IIa mouse Na/Pi cotransporter, were also PCR-amplified by means of adapter oligonucleotides carryingEcoRI as well as XhoI restriction sites and a stop codon in the N-terminal prey for proper termination. All fragments were ligated to the C terminus of the GAL4 activation domain in vector pACT2, which delivers the LEU2 nutritional gene for complementation. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using an upper primer GAL855 (5′-TGTTTAATACCACTACAATG-3′). Bait vectors were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain L40) containing the genotype MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::LexA-LacZ (15Ullrich S.J. Robinson E.A. Law L.W. Willingham M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3121-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPDA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Difco peptone, 2% glucose, 0.003% adenine hemisulfate) or the synthetic minimal Trp dropout medium (SD-Trp) complemented with 0.003% adenine hemisulfate (16Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For transformation, a YPDA culture from L40 (20 ml) grown to anA600 of ∼1 (18 h) was centrifuged at 1200 × g for 3 min, washed with 40 ml of distilled H2O, and resuspended in 1 ml of distilled H2O. Aliquots of 50 μl were treated with 240 μl of polyethylene glycol (50% w/v), 36 μl of 1 m LiAc, 25 μl of single-stranded DNA (2.0 mg/ml), 50 μl of distilled H2O, and 1 μg of plasmid, according to Gietz and Schiestl (17Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Proper expression of the baits was confirmed by Western blotting of total cell lysates (18Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with antibodies raised against the C- and N-terminal part of type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter (5Custer M. Lötscher M. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar) or against LexA. In control experiments (data not shown), an autonomous activation of the L40 reporter genes by the baits was verified. A cDNA library of whole adult mouse kidneys (MATCHMAKER, CLONTECH) was used. A 100-ml culture in SD-Trp medium was set up with four single colonies, grown toA546 > 2 (∼ 36 h) at 30 °C (260 rpm) and used to inoculate 1 liter of YPDA to 0.2A600. The culture was propagated to ∼0.8 A600, splitted up in quarters and washed with a total of 400 ml of sterile distilled H2O after centrifugation at 4200 × g (4 °C) for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in a total of 160 ml of distilled H2O, transferred to 50-ml tubes, and repelleted at 1300 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Each pellet was transfected separately according to Gietz and Schiestl (17Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar), using a reaction mixture with a scaling-up of 50 times from above and with 50 μl of cDNA (1 μg/μl). After an incubation at 30 °C followed by a heat shock at 42 °C (30 min at 220 rpm), cells were harvested at 1900 × gfor 3 min, washed with 80 ml of distilled H2O, recombined in 20 ml of distilled H2O and plated onto 100 14-cm Petri dishes. After 5 days, 4.4 × 106 Trp/Leu/His prototrophies were tested for LacZ expression by a colony-lift assay (19Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), where the permeabilized cells transferred onto Whatman filters were overlaid with 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Alexis), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.8% agarose. Putative positive colonies were restreaked on selective medium and rescreened by colony-lift assay. Yeast DNA of true positives was isolated (21Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar), and prey plasmids were rescued by transformation into KC8 cells, which carries trpC,leuB, and hisB mutations (22Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions of purified prey plasmids were reconfirmed in yeast. Insert sizes were checked by BglII digestion and subjected to dideoxy sequencing (Microsynth, Switzerland). Identical sequences were grouped via ClustalW at Pôle Bio-Informatique (Lyonnais) or via Pileup from Genetics Computer Group (Oxford) and overlaps connected (Contig assembly program; Baylor College of Medicine). Searches for protein relationships were performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) using BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The modular architecture of proteins was determined by SMART (24Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Interactions of single proteins and constructs thereof were determined by a liquid assay for β-galactosidase from permeabilized cells in the presence ofo-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG, Sigma) (25Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The activity of β-galactosidase (A420) was normalized to 1.0 × 107 cells assayed (1 A600 = 1.0 × 107 cells/ml). The following GST fusion constructs were made in vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using EcoRI/XhoI orBamHI/XhoI restriction sites: mouse NaPi-Cap1 (aa 1–519), mouse NaPi-Cap2 (aa 1–498), mouse NHERF-1 (aa 1–355), mouse C2PA (aa 195–375 of C2PA plus 17 N-terminal and 19 C-terminal nonannealing aa), mouse zetin 1 (262 aa), mouse FHL-2 (aa 6–279) and mouse 54TMp (aa 1–281). Mouse NHERF-2 was digested withEcoRI/XhoI and the fragment corresponding to aa 1–289 directly cloned in pGEX-6P-1. Since the full-length mouse MAST205 (1734 aa) was not expressed in Escherichia coli, a known interacting fragment enclosed by SmaI/XhoI restriction sites (aa 905–1830) was subcloned in pGEX-6P-1. Finally, the C-terminal SmaI/XhoI fragment of mouse HSP84 (aa 394–724) was also in pGEX-6P-1. All constructs were checked by sequencing using primers Gex5′ (5′-CCAGCAAGTATATAGCATGG-3′) and Gex3′rev (5′-GCTTACAGACAAGCTGTGAC). Plasmids were transformed in XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). 50-ml overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 in 500 ml of LB/Amp and grown to 0.8 A600 at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside (Axon Lab), and the incubation was continued for 5 h at 28 °C. Cells were pelleted at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 120 mmNaCl, 0.5% Igepal (Sigma CA-630), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml lysozyme), and immersed on ice for 15 min. The cells were subjected three times to pulsed sonication for 30 s on ice. Aliquots were cleared at 12,000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 15 min (4 °C) and frozen at −80 °C. Lysates were thawed at 37 °C and spun for 3 min as above to remove insoluble debris. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (∼2 μg) were incubated with 25 μl of preequilibrated glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma; 50% slurry) in a total volume of 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 5 mm dithiothreitol) by rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. After absorption, beads were collected by brief centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 s (4 °C) and gently washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer containing 0.075% SDS. Pull-down experiments were performed either with isolated proximal tubular brush border membranes (BBMV) from mice or with Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with type IIa cRNA. Purified BBMVs (27Biber J. Stieger B. Haase W. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) were solubilized in binding buffer (see above) for 5 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Extracts of oocytes injected with IIa cRNA (for details, see Ref. 28Forster I. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were obtained as described (29Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein-loaded beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with solubilizates corresponding to 0.05 mg of BBMV protein or 1–2 oocytes, washed three times with binding buffer and used for gel-electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed with a polyclonal anti-IIa cotransporter antibody directed against the N terminus (5Custer M. Lötscher M. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F767-F774PubMed Google Scholar), and immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL using a secondary HRP-coupled IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tissue distribution of mRNA expression of identified gene products was studied by Northern blotting using poly(A)+ RNAs of adult mice either purchased fromCLONTECH or isolated by standard procedures. Full-length inserts were randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP (oligolabeling kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as probes. After hybridization, all blots were washed sequentially with 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.5× SSC (containing 0.1% SDS) at temperatures up to 55 °C. Immunohistochemical distribution of NaPi-Cap1 and NaPi-Cap2 in mouse kidney was essentially performed as described (30Traebert M. Roth J. Biber J. Murer H. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F148-F154PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera were raised against synthetic peptides derived from the N termini of mouse NaPi-Cap1 and mouse NaPi-Cap2, respectively. β-Actin was visualized by phalloidin-Texas Red. Anti MAST205 antibody was kindly provided by P. Walden (31Walden P.D. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7625-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and an anti-HSP86 antibody was purchased from Affinity Purified Reagents. An adult mouse kidney cDNA library was screened in yeast against the C-terminal tail (aa 563–637) of the murine type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter. Initially, based on selection for growth on synthetic media and on LacZexpression, 138 positive colonies were obtained from 4.4 × 106 Leu/Trp/His prototrophs. To confirm the initial positives, plasmids from 104 clones were isolated and used for retransformation of L40 cells harboring the following bait constructs: (a) the C terminus or (b) the N terminus of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporter; and, as controls, (c) a subunit of the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus (1RTp51) or (d) the empty vector pBTM116. 93 prey plasmids reappeared blue when cotransformed with the original C-terminal bait, but did not show any interactions with the other baits used; notably no interaction occurred with the N terminus of the IIa Na/Pi cotransporter which has been predicted to be located intracellularly as well (11Lambert G. Traebert M. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Inserts (on average around 2 kilobase pairs) from all clones were partially sequenced, grouped according to their alignments, and compared with GenBank™ entries (Table I).Table ICompilation of all proteins identified by the two-hybrid screen as putative associaters to the C terminus of the type IIa Na/Pi cotransporterNo. of positivesSimilarities/identities1-aOverall similarities/identities of above amino acid sequences were obtained using the Blast or ClustalW algorithm.Clone name2575% to rat diphor-1 or human PDZK1Mouse NaPi-Cap11-bAbbreviation forNa/Pi cotransporterC-terminal-associated protein.3528% to rat diphor-1Mouse NaPi-Cap21-bAbbreviation forNa/Pi cotransporterC-terminal-associated protein.7100% to mouse NHERF-1Mouse NHERF-1190% to human NHERF-2Mouse NHERF-2225% to human NHERF-2?178% to mouse C2PA1-cThis identified protein is merely identical to the PDZ domain of mouse C2PA (aa 195–375) and probably represents an alternative spliced variant of mouse C2PA.?186% to rat zetin 1Mouse zetin 17100% to mouse HSP84Mouse HSP847100% to mouse HSP86Mouse HSP865100% to mouse MAST205Mouse MAST2051100% to mouse FHL-21-dAbbreviation for “four and a half lim domains 2.”Mouse FHL-2153% to human 54TMpMouse 54TMp1-a Overall similarities/identities of above amino acid sequences were obtained using the Blast or ClustalW algorithm.1-b Abbreviation forNa/Pi cotransporterC-terminal-associated protein.1-c This identified protein is merely identical to the PDZ domain of mouse C2PA (aa 195–375) and probably represents an alternative spliced variant of mouse C2PA.1-d Abbreviation for “four and a half lim domains 2.” Open table in a new tab As listed, most of the clones (71 out of 93) coded for PDZ proteins.

Besides, several clones were identical to the heat shock proteins HSP84 and HSP86 (38Hoffmann T. Hovemann B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or to MAST205, a microtubulin-associated serine/threonine kinase (31Walden P.D. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7625-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Others were found only once, such as the mouse protein FHL-2 having four and half LIM domains (39Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or as the mouse homologues of rat zetin 1 (accession no. AF245225) and of the human putative transmembrane protein 54TMp (accession no. AF004876). Differences in the representation of these clones could be explained by either the low abundance of corresponding mRNAs or by the presence of diverse truncations of inserts existing in the library. To evaluate the specificity of the identified clones for binding the C terminus of the type IIa cotransporter, various baits derived from a number of proximal tubular, apically localized membrane proteins were constructed and tested in yeast for possible interactions with some of the proteins obtained by the screen (TableII). Most of the baits used did not activate the reporter genes in the presence of the different proteins exhibiting binding capacity for the type IIa cotransporter. Exceptional was the C terminus of the type I Na/Pi cotransporter (40Chong S.S. Kozak C.A. Liu L. Kristjansson K. Dunn S.T. Bourdeau J.E. Hughes M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar), which was found to associate with all the PDZ proteins listed as well as weakly with MAST205. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of the Na/H exchanger, NHE-3, bound NHERF-1, as shown previously (35Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J.

Whether GSH level is elevated in liver cancer is unknown. GSH levels and expression of GSH synthetic enzymes were measured in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal liver. GSH levels doubled in HCC. The mRNA levels of g-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit (GCS-HS) and GSH synthetase (GS) doubled, whereas the expression of GCS light subunit was unchanged. Nuclear run-on assay showed that the rate of gene transcription doubled for both GCS-HS and GS. In HCC, there is increased binding to anti-oxidant response, AP-1 and NF-kB, three cis-acting elements in the 5'-flanking region of the human GCS-HS important for its transcriptional regulation. The role of GSH in cell growth was examined by using HepG2 cells. Cell GSH level was varied by treating cells with cystine (0 to 0.2 mM) with or without GSH ester or buthionine sulfoximine. Cell GSH level correlated directly with growth rate. Finally, preventing the increase in GSH after two-thirds partial hepatectomy blunted liver regeneration. Thus, GSH level is increased during liver growth as a result of up-regulation of GCS-HS and GS. This increase, in turn, facilitates growth."

https://openalex.org/W2050088265,"The bacterial twin arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is capable of exporting cofactor-containing enzymes into the periplasm. To assess the capacity of the Tat pathway to export heterologous proteins and to gain information about the property of the periplasm, we fused the twin arginine signal peptide of the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase to the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP). Unlike the Sec pathway, the Tat system successfully exported correctly folded GFP into the periplasm ofEscherichia coli. Interestingly, GFP appeared as a halo in most cells and occasionally showed a polar localization in wild type strains. When subjected to a mild osmotic up-shock, GFP relocalized very quickly at the two poles of the cells. The conversion from the halo structure to a periplasmic gathering at particular locations was also observed with spherical cells of theΔrodA-pbpA mutant or of the wild type strain treated with lysozyme. Therefore, the periplasm is not a uniform compartment and the polarization of GFP is unlikely to be caused by simple invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane at the poles. Moreover, the polar gathering of GFP is reversible; the reversion was accelerated by glucose and inhibited by azide and carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, indicating an active adaptation of the bacteria to the osmolarity in the medium. These results strongly suggest a relocalization of periplasmic substances in response to environmental changes. The polar area might be the preferential zone where bacteria sense the change in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2015464799,"The X protein from a chronic strain of hepatitis B virus (HBx) was determined to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis and promote cell survival. Fas-mediated apoptosis is the major cause of hepatocyte damage during liver disease. Experiments demonstrated that cell death caused by anti-Fas antibodies was blocked by the expression of HBx in human primary hepatocytes and mouse embryo fibroblasts. This effect was also observed in mouse erythroleukemia cells that lacked p53, indicating that protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis was independent of p53. Components of the signal transduction pathways involved in this protection were studied. The SAPK/JNK pathway has previously been suggested to be a survival pathway for some cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis, and kinase assays showed that SAPK activity was highly up-regulated in cells expressing the HBx protein. Normal mouse fibroblasts expressing HBx were protected from death, whereas identical fibroblasts lacking the SEK1 component from the SAPK pathway succumbed to Fas-mediated apoptosis, whether HBx was present or not. Assays showed that caspase 3 and 8 activities and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria were inhibited, in the presence of HBx, following stimulation with anti-Fas antibodies. Coprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated that HBx localizes with a cytoplasmic complex containing MEKK1, SEK1, SAPK, and 14-3-3 proteins. Finally, mutational analysis of HBx demonstrated that a potential binding region for 14-3-3 proteins was essential for induction of SAPK/JNK activity and protection from Fas-mediated apoptosis.

Imperial College Press, River Edge, NJ1998Crossref Google Scholar), and currently more than 400 million people are chronically infected with this virus worldwide. Multiple factors including damage caused by inflammatory cytokines, mutations incurred during liver regeneration, defects in DNA repair, integration of viral DNA into the host cell genome, host genomic instability, activation of cellular oncogenes, and induction of cell survival pathways have been implicated as causes leading to liver cancer. However, the exact molecular events progressing to liver carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. The genome of HBV consists of a partially double-stranded circular DNA spanning 3200 nucleotides. Mammalian hepatitis viruses (human, woodchuck, and ground squirrel) encode 4 overlapping reading frames that code for surface glycoproteins (PreS1, PreS2, and S), core proteins (C and PreC), polymerase (P), and the X protein (HBx). Thex gene encodes a 17-kDa (154 amino acid) protein that has been attributed to a number of functions (reviewed in Refs. 2Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Urban P. Semin.

There appears to be a close correlation between expression of HBx and the development of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (9Diamantis I.D. McGandy C.E. Chen T.J. Liaw Y.F. Gudat F.

Removal of the x gene from woodchuck hepatitis viral DNA prevents the virus from establishing chronic infections and tumors in experimental animals (12Chen H.S. Kaneko S. Girones R. Anderson R.W.

Virol. 1994; 68: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBx is clearly a multifunctional protein, but its mechanism of action has been controversial (2Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Urban P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 333-347Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was initially described to be a “promiscuous transactivator” capable of stimulating a variety of viral and host gene promoters indirectly through its interaction with transcription factors. These included the proto-oncogenes (c-myc, N-myc, and c-jun), transcription factors (AP-1, NF-κB, ATF/CREB, ERCC3, and RPB5 of RNA polymerase), HBV enhancers, and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (see Refs.6Feitelson M.A. Duan L.X. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1141-1157PubMed Google Scholar, 7Feitelson M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Murakami S.

The X gene product has also been suggested to be a protease inhibitor due to the presence of serpin-like protease domains in its sequence (15Takada S. Kido H. Fukutomi A. Mori T. Koike K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). To support this hypothesis, HBx has been found to associate with proteosomes (16Huang J. Kwong J. Sun E.C. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sirma H. Weil R. Rosmorduc O. Urban S. Israel A. Kremsdorf D. Brechot C.

More recently it has been proposed that HBx inhibits caspase 3 activity (19Gottlob K. Fulco M. Levrero M. Graessmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33347-33353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the role of HBx as a protease inhibitor is still controversial since the existence of true serpin-like domains in the protein has been disputed (2Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Urban P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 333-347Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another intriguing property of HBx is its association with the DNA repair protein DDBP1/XPE, which could account for an accumulation of mutations in the liver over the long course of chronic hepatitis (20Becker S.A. Lee T.H. Butel J.S. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most DNA viruses such as simian virus 40, polyomavirus, papillomaviruses, poxviruses, retroviruses, baculoviruses, and herpesviruses contain gene products that block and reduce apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 21Miller L.K. Kaiser W.J. Seshagiri S. Semin. Virol. 1998; 18: 445-452Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Hardwick J.M. Semin. Cell Dev.

These viral proteins can block cell death in a variety of ways including interaction with p53, degradation of p53, subversion of components from the TNF or Fas pathways, inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, or reduction of caspase activity. Several laboratories (24Feitelson M.A. Zhu M. Duan L.X. London W.T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1109-1117PubMed Google Scholar, 25Truant R. Antunovic J. Greenblatt J. Prives C. Cromlish J.A. J.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HBx is able to interact with p53 and can interfere with p53-mediated transcriptional activation of other genes. However, both inhibition and activation of p53-mediated apoptosis by HBx has been reported, causing many investigators (2Hildt E. Hofschneider P.H. Urban P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 333-347Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) to question the significance of this interaction in vivo. In addition, many of the viral anti-apoptotic proteins are multifunctional and can bind p53 but are also able to block apoptosis in other ways. For example, the simian virus 40 large T antigen and the adenovirus E1B/19K protein were recently shown to protect cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis (29Rouquet N. Allemand I. Molina T. Bennoun M. Briand P. Joulin V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1061-1067PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rouquet N. Allemand I. Grimber G. Molina T. Briand P. Joulin V.

With these precedents, we were intrigued about the possible effects of HBx upon apoptotic pathways, particularly Fas-mediated apoptosis, within the infected cell. Many viral oncogenes have been shown to up-regulate the SAPK/JNK signal transduction pathway (reviewed in Ref. 32Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These include the E1B/19K protein of adenovirus (33See R.H. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4012-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the TAT protein of human immunodeficiency virus (34Kumar A. Manna S.K. Dhawan S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 776-781PubMed Google Scholar), the LMP1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus, the TAX protein of HTLV-1, the angiogenic G protein receptor of Kaposi sarcoma virus, and the HBx protein of HBV (35Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Henkler F. Lopes A.R. Jones M. Koshy R. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2737-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cellular oncogenes such asTPL2 (tumor progression locus 2 protein) andBCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and the HER2/NEU gene product associated with many breast tumors, epidermal growth factor-stimulated proliferation, the RET oncoprotein, the MAS gene product, and the MET protein increase SAPK levels (32Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Clearly up-regulation of SAPK activity, often in parallel with increased MAPK, appears to be associated with cellular transformation. Higher levels of SAPK have also been implicated in hepatocyte growth and regeneration (37Auer K.L. Contessa J. Brenz-Verca S. Pirola L. Rusconi S. Cooper G. Abo A. Wymann M.P. Davis R.J. Birrer M. Dent P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Mitsui H. Maruyama T. Kimura S. Takuwa Y. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and deletion of the upstream kinase, Sek1, has been shown to reduce SAPK activity and impair liver development in mice (39Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y. Perkins A. Ikeda T. Labow M.A. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently HBx protein has been implicated in the activation of signal transduction pathways that support the survival of the cell. Several reports have demonstrated that HBx in liver and fibroblast cell lines stimulates the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, activates c-FOS/c-JUN-mediated transcription, favors G0/S cell cycle transition, and protects cells from serum starvation (40Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 41Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Src kinases, but not Ras, are up-regulated in cells containing HBx and woodchuck hepatitis B x protein and that HBV genome replication is stimulated by the enhanced kinase activity (43Klein N.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25510-25515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggests it activates JAK1-STAT signaling, and more recently HBx has been shown (50Shih W.L. Kuo M.L.

Clearly HBx can modulate a number of signal pathways in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we explored the ability of HBx protein to inhibit apoptosis and dissected the signal transduction pathways involved in this protection. We were primarily interested in Fas-mediated apoptosis and cell death induced by serum starvation, since both Fas ligand and growth factors play important roles in liver damage and the regeneration of hepatocytes during hepatitis (51Galle P.R. Hofmann W.J. Walczak H. Schaller H. Otto G. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Runkel L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1223-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We first observed that HBx blocked Fas-mediated apoptosis in primary human hepatocytes and that it supported their survival in culture. The same effects were demonstrated in mouse erythroleukemia cells that lacked p53. Mouse fibroblasts that lacked the SEK1 component of the stress kinase pathway were also much more sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis than wild type cells. Normal fibroblasts that contained HBx were protected against cell death, whereas the SEK1-deficient cells underwent apoptosis whether the viral protein was present or not. The SAPK/JNK pathway has previously been suggested as a survival pathway for cells undergoing Fas-mediated apoptosis, and assays show that SAPK is highly up-regulated in cells containing HBx. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that HBx localizes with the SAPK-JNK complex. Up-regulation of SAPK by HBx may help rescue cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Chang liver cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human primary hepatocytes were supplied by Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA) and were grown in hepatocyte culture medium provided by the company. DP-16-1 mouse erythroleukemia cells were provided by Dr. S. Benchimol (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada), and the cells were propagated in minimum Eagle's medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. sek1−/− and sek1+/+ mouse fibroblasts came from Dr. J. Woodgett, and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The DNA coding regions of HBx and HBx deletion mutant flanked by engineered restriction enzyme sites were generated by polymerase chain reactions from the plasmid pAM6 (45020D) (American Type Culture Collection) harboring the wild type HBV and HBx open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number X51970). The expression vector pRBK-HBx was constructed by inserting HBx DNA fragments downstream of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter between theNheI and XhoI cloning sites of the pRBK vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression vectors containing N-terminal deletions in HBx were also made using the same insert sites. The bicistronic expression vector pIRES-EGFP-HBx was constructed by ligation of the HBx DNA fragments between theEcoRV-EcoRI cloning sites of vector pIRES-EGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Through use of the cytomegalovirus promoter, a bicistronic mRNA was transcribed that directs the synthesis of the HBx protein from its own AUG and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The pBMN retroviral expression vector was obtained from G. Nolan (Stanford University) and modified to contain an IRES-GFP element (J. Ruland, Amgen Institute, Toronto, Canada). Mutations in the HBx gene were generated with the QuickChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Erythroleukeima cells and Chang liver cells at 50–70% confluency were transfected or cotransfected with plasmids, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used in transfections of the primary human hepatocytes and mouse fibroblast cell lines. DNA transfections were performed with protocols supplied with the reagents. Transfection efficiencies ranged from 2 to 4% for primary hepatocytes and 60% for Chang liver cells but were as high as 80% for mouse fibroblast lines. Stable cell lines were selected by culturing DP-16 erythroleukemia cells, Chang liver cells, or mouse fibroblasts containing pRBK-HBx in the presence of hygromycin (270 μg/ml). Expression of HBx in the various cell lines was verified by RT-PCR, immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against HBx peptide (amino acids 50–88) were supplied by Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal antiserum directed against HBx protein was produced in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with a maltose-binding protein-HBx fusion generated in Escherichia coli. Protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Antibodies from this antiserum were purified using affinity chromatography with HBx-(His6) coupled to nickel-Sepharose. Rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against HBx peptide (amino acids 2–21) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was also generated in our laboratory. The antibodies specific for this HBx peptide were purified from these antisera by affinity chromatography using peptide-conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Other antibodies came from commercial sources as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody against 14-3-3β protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal antibody against MKK4/SEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal antibody against MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal antibody against SAPK1/JNK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), monoclonal antibody against the phospho-14-3-3 binding motif (New England Biolabs), anti-mouse Fas (PharMingen, San Diego), goat anti-mouse TRITC (Sigma), goat anti-rabbit FITC (Sigma), and anti-hamster Ig (PharMingen). Chang liver cells were grown to confluency in 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS prior to fixation. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and washed once with PBS. Subsequently the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Nonspecific protein binding to the cells was blocked by incubating the cells with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Primary antibody was diluted 1:50 in blocking solution, incubated with fixed cells for 3 h, and washed 3 times with PBS at room temperature. Cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibody consisting of either goat anti-mouse TRITC (Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit FITC (Sigma) that had been diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer. Incubations were performed at 37 oC for 1 h and washed 4 times with PBS. Finally, the chambers were removed, and the slides were mounted with coverslips using Fluorescent Mounting Solution (Dako, Hiroshima, Japan). Fluorescently labeled cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, and the images were analyzed by the LSM510 image browser software. Following induction of apoptosis, 104cells were lysed in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and RNase (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Lysates were subsequently treated with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for about 8 h. The entire lysate was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and subjected to electrophoresis for 2 h at 65 V. The DNA ladder was visualized by staining DNA fragments with ethidium bromide and examining the gel under UV light. Cells were plated and grown overnight until they were 80% confluent when they were treated as indicated with Fas antibodies. Subsequently, cell media containing detached cells were collected, and the remaining adherent cells were released by trypsinization (1 min) and combined with the detached cells. Collected cells were centrifuged and washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (PharMingen). Subsequently, 5 μl of Annexin V-PE and 5 μl of 7-AAD (PharMingen) were added to the cell suspension and mixed gently. The cells were stained at room temperature in the dark for 15 min and analyzed by on a Becton Dickinson fluorescence cytometer using CellQuest software (52Philpott N.J. Turner A.J. Scopes J. Westby M. Marsh J.C. Gordon-Smith E.C. Dalgleish A.G. Gibson F.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 2244-2251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A nonradioactive method of measuring SAPK/JNK activity was employed based on the SAPK/JNK Assay Kit provided by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were lysed, and 250 μg of total protein was used in each reaction. An N-terminal c-JUN fusion protein bound to Sepharose beads was used to pull down SAPK/JNK from cell lysates. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of ATP, and c-JUN phosphorylation was selectively measured using a phospho-c-JUN antibody and immunoblot analysis. Proteins associated with the c-JUN beads were also detected on the immunoblots using specific antibodies. For the radioactive kinase assay, specific antibodies to SAPK/JNK (New England Biolabs) were used to immunoprecipitate selectively SAPK/JNK from cell lysates overnight at 4 °C. Protein G was used to bind the immunocomplexes. The resulting immunoprecipitate was then incubated with c-JUN-(1–89) fusion protein (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1 mm cold ATP and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP and supplemented with kinase buffer as used for the nonradioactive kinase assay; immunoprecipitated active SAPK phosphorylated c-JUN at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated c-JUN was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The c-JUN bands were also cut out from the gel and quantitated by liquid scintillation assays. 6-Well microtiter plates containing 1 × 106 cells per chamber were grown to 80% confluency and treated with Fas antibodies. Cells were suspended by trypsin treatment and collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of cold cell lysis buffer provided in ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kits (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the supernatants were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates for detection of caspase 3 or caspase 8 activity. The remaining portions of the supernatants were assayed for protein concentration. Caspase 3 and caspase 8 activities were measured using fluorescent peptide substrates (DEVD-AFC and IETD-AFC, respectively) using a Wallac fluorimeter according to the ApoAlert kit instructions. Adherant cells were suspended by treatment with trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium and incubated with 5 μg/ml of protein G (Sigma) and either 5 μg/ml of hamster antibodies directed against Fas or hamster control IgG. The cells were gently shaken at 37 °C for 4 h and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 2 min. Mitochondria and cytosol fractions were prepared as described previously (53Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were suspended in cold buffer consisting of 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1%(w/v) bovine serum albumin, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), antipain (50 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were sedimented and removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to sediment the mitochondria. Proteins in the supernatants were denatured with 4× SDS sample buffer, and mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in 1× SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10–20% acrylamide/Tricine-buffered gels; proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies directed against cytochrome c. HBx was inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI of the retroviral expression vector, pBMN-IRES-GFP. Recombinant retrovirus was generated by introducing 10 μg of pBMN-HBx-IRES-GFP into 5 × 106 cells of the ecotropic packaging Phoenix cell line using the calcium phosphate transfection method (54Pear W.S., M. Nolan G.P. Robbins P.D. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Gene Therapy Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 41-57Google Scholar). Generation of high titer, helper-free retroviruses occurred following the transient transfection. Recombinant retrovirus was harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Mouse embryo fibroblasts and DP-16 mouse erythroleukemia cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in 6-well microtiter plates (5 × 105cells/chamber)"
https://openalex.org/W1998702692,"Excessive production of eicosanoids is characteristic of many inflammatory diseases. In this study we show that ceramide, which is an early messenger of inflammatory cytokine action, exerts a dual effect on the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), the rate-limiting enzyme in arachidonic acid release and subsequent eicosanoid formation. Stimulation of renal mesangial cells with exogenous short-chain ceramide analogs for 30 and 60 min leads to a concentration-dependent increase in arachidonic acid release that is not blocked by specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. This suggests that these established upstream activators of cPLA2 are not involved in ceramide-induced arachidonic acid release. By use of photoactivatable ceramide analogs, D- and L-[125I]3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-iodophenyl)diazirine-ceramides (TID-ceramides), we observed a direct interaction of ceramide with cPLA2. This interaction was independent of the absolute configuration as D- and L-TID-ceramide were equally effective in binding to cPLA2. Moreover, recombinant CaLB domain of cPLA2 as well as a mutant deficient in the connecting 'hinge' domain of cPLA2, efficiently bound D- and L-TID-ceramides, whereas the catalytic domain did not interact with TID-ceramides. In vitro binding assays reveal that stearoyl-arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (SAPC)-liposomes containing increasing mol% of ceramide lead to an increased association of recombinant cPLA2 to the liposomes. Furthermore, measurement of cPLA2 activity in vitro shows that the presence of SAPC-liposomes resulted in only weak cPLA2 activity. However, the activity dramatically increases by addition of ceramide to the liposomes. Furthermore, liposomes containing SAPC and sphingomyelin resulted in no better substrate than SAPC liposomes, unless bacterial sphingomyelinase was added to generate ceramide, which then causes a marked increase in cPLA2 activity. These results demonstrate that ceramide can interact directly with cPLA2 via the CaLB domain and thereby serves as a membrane-docking device that facilitates cPLA2 action in inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2171105241,"HIV-1 induces apoptosis and leads to CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion in humans. It is still unclear whether HIV-1 kills infected cells directly or indirectly. To elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-1-induced apoptosis, we infected human CD4+ T cells with HIV-1. Enzymatic analysis with fluorometric substrates showed that caspase 2, 3, and 9 were activated in CD4+ T cells with peak levels 48 h after infection. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the cleavage of pro-caspase 3 and 9, and of specific caspase substrates. Release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria was observed in HIV-infected cells. The cytochrome c and AIF release preceded the reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and nuclear chromatin condensation. H IV infection led to phosphorylation of p53 at the Ser15 residue, detectable as early as 24 h after infection. The p53 phosphorylation was followed by increased mRNA and protein expression of p21, Bax, HDM2, and p53. Up-regulation of surface FasL expression, accompanied by a down-regulation of Fas-associated proteins (FADD, DAXX, and RIP), was observed 72 h after infection. Our results suggest that HIV activates the p53 pathway, leading to cytochrome c and AIF release with ensuing caspase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2159785275,"Triiodothyronine (T3) increases mitochondrial respiration and promotes the uncoupling between oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. T3 effect is mediated partly through transcriptional control of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. We determined the effect of T3 on mRNA levels of uncoupling proteins (UCP) and proteins involved in the biogenesis of the respiratory chain in human skeletal muscle and on UCP2 mRNA expression in adipose tissue. Ten young, healthy males received 75 to 100 5g of T3 per day for 14 days. The increase in plasma-free T3 levels was associated with an increase of resting metabolic rate and a decrease of respiratory quotient. In skeletal muscle, treatment with T3 induced a twofold increase of both UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA levels (p c oxidase subunits 2 and 4, nuclear respiratory factor 1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and the co-activator PGC1 did not change during the treatment. In adipose tissue, UCP2 mRNA levels increased threefold. The direct effect of T3 on skeletal muscle an d adipose tissue UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA expression was demonstrated in vitro in human primary cultures. Our data show that T3 induces UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA expression in humans. In skeletal muscle, UCP regulation by T3 is not associated with the transcriptional regulation of respiratory chain proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2133454381,"Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation occurs during inflammation. We have studied the impact and the mechanisms of ONOO- action on expression of adhesion molecules on human neutrophils and coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and binding of neutrophils to HCAEC. Addition of ONOO- (0.1 to 200 5M) to isolated neutrophils resulted in a concentration-dependent down-regulation of L-selectin expression, and up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 expression. ONOO- stimulation of Erk activity was accompanied by activation of Ras, Raf-1 and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase), and was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD 98059. We have observed a tight association between Erk activation and changes in CD11b/CD18 expression. ONOO- also evoked activation of neutrophil p38 MAPK. Neither ONOO--induced up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 expression nor Erk activation was affected by SB 203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK. ONOO- by itself had little effect on expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin on HCAEC, whereas it markedly enhanced attachment of neutrophils to lipopolysaccharide-activated HCAEC only when it was added together with neutrophils. Increases in neutrophil adhesion evoked by ONOO- were blocked by an anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that ONOO- activates Erk in neutrophils via the Ras/Raf-1/MEK signal transduction pathway, leading to up-regulation of surface expression of CD11b/CD18 and consequently to increased neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2105584844,"Molecular scanning of human IRS-1 gene revealed a common polymorphism causing Gly-->Arg972 change. Diabetic and pre-diabetic carriers of Arg972 IRS-1 are characterized by low fasting levels of insulin and C-peptide. To investigate directly whether the Arg 972 IRS-1 affects human islet cells survival, we took advantage of the unique opportunity to analyze pancreatic islets isolated from three donors heterozygous for the Arg972 and six donors carrying wild-type IRS-1. Islets from carriers of Arg972 IRS-1 showed a two-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells as compared with wild-type. IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity was decreased in islets from carriers of Arg972 IRS-1. Same results were reproduced in RIN rat b-cell lines stably expressing wild-type IRS-1 or Arg972 IRS-1. Using these cells, we characterized the downstream pathway by which Arg972 IRS-1 impairs b-cell survival. RIN-Arg972 cells exhibited a marked impairment in the sequential activation of PI3-kinase, Akt, and BAD as compared with RI N-WT. Impaired BAD phosphorylation resulted in increased binding to Bcl-XL instead of 14-3-3 protein, thus sequestering the Bcl-XL antiapoptotic protein to promote survival. Both caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were increased in RIN-Arg972 cells. The results show that the common Arg972 polymorphism in IRS-1 impairs human b-cell survival and causes resistance to antiapoptotic effects of insulin by affecting the PI3-kinase/Akt survival pathway. These findings establish an important role for the insulin signaling in human b-cell survival and suggest that genetic defects in early steps of insulin signaling may contribute to b-cell failure."

https://openalex.org/W1966693902,"The endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) is an endothelial cell-specific transmembrane protein that binds both protein C and activated protein C (APC). EPCR regulates the protein C anticoagulant pathway by binding protein C and augmenting protein C activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. EPCR is homologous to the MHC class 1/CD1 family, members of which contain two α-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded β-sheet platform. In this study, we identified 10 residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160). Glutamine substitutions at the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites of EPCR have little affect on APC binding, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for ligand recognition. We then mapped the epitopes for four anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), two of which block EPCR/Fl-APC (APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein) interactions, whereas two do not. These epitopes were localized by generating human-mouse EPCR chimeric proteins, since the mAbs under investigation do not recognize mouse EPCR. We found that 5 of the 10 candidate residues for protein C/APC binding (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87) colocalize with the epitope for one of the blocking mAbs. Three-dimensional molecular modeling of EPCR indicates that the 10 protein C/APC binding candidate residues are clustered at the distal end of the two α-helical segments. Protein C activation studies on 293 cells that coexpress EPCR variants and thrombomodulin demonstrate that protein C binding to EPCR is necessary for the EPCR-dependent enhancement in protein activation by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. These studies indicate that EPCR has exploited the MHC class 1 fold for an alternative and possibly novel mode of ligand recognition.

A soluble form of EPCR is found in normal human plasma (17Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind to protein C and APC with an affinity similar to that of intact membrane-bound EPCR (15Fukudome K.

Interestingly, soluble EPCR alters the active site of APC, suggesting that the macromolecular specificity of APC may be altered by complex formation with soluble EPCR (19Liaw P.C.Y.

EPCR also appears to aid in the host response to sepsis since blocking EPCR-protein C interactions in baboons exacerbates the coagulation and inflammatory responses toEscherichia coli (20Taylor Jr., F.B.

Preliminary clinical studies suggest that protein C and APC supplementation is beneficial in sepsis or septic shock (21Bernard G.R. Hartman D.L. Helterbrand J.D. Fisher C.J. Crit.

EPCR has sequence homology to members of the MHC class I/CD1 family of molecules. MHC class I/CD1 molecules are organized into the α1, α2, and α3 domains followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. The α3 domain associates noncovalently with β-2 microglobulin, although in EPCR this domain is absent. The α1 and α2 domains form a ligand binding groove composed of two antiparallel α-helices that sit upon an 8-stranded β-sheet platform. Although most members of the MHC/CD1 family utilize this groove to bind short peptides, it should be noted that there are exceptions. For example, the neonatal Fc receptor, which shares the MHC fold, has a closed groove that is incapable of binding peptides (24Burmeister W.P. Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Instead, the ligand binding interface is on the side of the neonatal Fc receptor. In this study, we set out to identify the residues within EPCR that are involved in protein C/APC binding. Our approach was to combine data from loss-of-function alanine substitution studies with that obtained from gain-of-function epitope-mapping studies. Given that EPCR differs from other members of the MHC class 1/CD1 family in that (a) it lacks the α3 domain and (b) its ligands are 62-kDa proteins rather than short peptides, these studies will also provide insight into how the MHC structural motif may have evolved to serve different modes of ligand recognition. Human thrombin (25Miletich J.P. Jackson C.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6908-6916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human protein C and APC (26Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies Inc. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and G418 were from Life Technologies, Inc. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin UltraLink and Immobilized NeutrAvidin Plus resin were from Pierce. Effectene transfection reagent was from Qiagen, Inc.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) cDNAs were cloned as XhoI/NotI fragments into the multiple cloning site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). In vitromutagenesis to generate and select point mutations was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis system as described by the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA manipulations to generate deletion mutants or human-murine chimeric cDNA molecules were carried out using standard DNA cloning techniques (29Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA sequencing was used to verify the authenticity of the mutations. In the pcDNA3.1(−) vector, expression of EPCR cDNA is under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Transient transfection of 293T cells was performed in 6-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum using Qiagen-purified pcDNA3.1(−) constructs employing the Effectene transfection reagent as described by the supplier (Qiagen). 293 cells were transfected as described above. 48 h post-transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks of drug selection in which the medium was changed every 3 days, drug-resistant colonies were isolated, and the levels of cell surface EPCR expression were determined by flow cytometric analysis as described below. APC labeled at the active site with fluorescein (Fl-APC) was prepared as described by Bock (30Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6.5 ml of 0.2 mg/ml APC was incubated with 6-fold molar excess of N α-((acetylthio)acetyl)-FPR chloromethyl ketone (ATA-PPACK) (Molecular Innovations Inc., Royal Oak MI) in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA. The labeling reaction was allowed to proceed until the APC was 99% inactive as monitored by the loss of enzymatic activity using Spectrozyme PCa (typically 1 h at room temperature). Excess ATA-PPACK was removed by centrifuging the sample in a molecular mass 10-kDa cut-off Centricon 10 filter (Amicon Inc.) for 15 min at 6,000 × g. All subsequent steps were performed in the dark. A 10-fold molar excess of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and one-tenth volume of 1 m hydroxylamine (in 1 mHepes, pH 7.4) was added to the ATA-PPACK-APC and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Free fluorescein was removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the labeled APC was stored at −70 °C. Human protein C and four monoclonal antibodies against human EPCR (JRK 1535, JRK 1494, JRK 1500, and JRK 1513) were labeled with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate as described by Goding (31Goding J.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1976; 13: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Adherent transfected cells were harvested by incubation at room temperature for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) containing 0.02% EDTA. Cells were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mmMgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide (binding buffer). Cells (1 × 105) were incubated at room temperature with 30 nm Fl-APC or Fl-protein C or 5 μg/ml fluorescein-labeled monoclonal anti-EPCR antibodies for 15 min in the dark. After washing, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer. Bound Fl-APC, Fl-protein C, or fluorescein-labeled antibody was detected on the fluorescence-1 channel on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The fluorescence intensity of each sample was analyzed twice. Confluent transfected 293T cells in a 6-well dish were harvested as described above. The cells were lysed in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min. The levels of EPCR in the cell lysates were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described below. Confluent transfected 293T cells in a 6-well dish were harvested as described above and resuspended in 90 μl of HBSS. The cells were surface-biotinylated with 10 μl of 5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 10 min. After pelleting, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. To precipitate the biotinylated EPCR, 20 μl of UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin Plus resin (Pierce) was added to the lysate and mixed for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed 3 times with 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, then washed once with Tris-buffered saline. Cell surface levels of EPCR were analyzed by electrophoresis of the resin and immunoblotting as described below. Electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed using JRK 1513 anti-EPCR monoclonal antibody. The affinities of Fl-APC for EPCR mutants expressed on the surface of 293 cells were determined as follows. Briefly, cells were grown to confluency in T-75 flasks, detached with 0.53 mm EDTA, and suspended in 3 ml of complete HBSS buffer (HBSS containing 3 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mmMgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% NaN3). The cells were diluted 1:20 in complete HBSS buffer and incubated with increasing concentrations of Fl-APC at 4 °C for 15 min in the dark. Binding was analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Values of K d were determined by fitting binding isotherms with a hyperbolic equation using the TableCurve™ program (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Previous studies demonstrate that this approach yielded values similar to those obtained with direct radioligand measurement (12Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hEPCR model was constructed by homology modeling following the method of Greer (33Greer J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) using the graphics program MAIN (34Turk D. Weiterentwicklung Eines Programms für Molekülgraphik und elektronendichte-Manipulation und Seine Anwendung auf Verschiedene Protein-strukturaufklärungen. Ph.D. thesis.

Science. 1992; 257: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 1VAB), with which there was 51% amino acid similarity and 22% identity. The insertion loops present in EPCR between residues Ale-31 and Glu-42, Cys-101 and Glu-106, and Arg-156 and Leu-161 in EPCR were not modeled, and a turn was constructed between Arg-10 and Gln-15, where MHC-I has a 10-residue insert. Stably transfected 293 cells in 24-well plates were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with 0.5 ml of HBSS containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mmCaCl2, and 0.6 mm MgCl2 before the addition of 0.2 μm human protein C or 0.2 μm GDPC. Protein C or GDPC activation was initiated by the addition of 10 nm thrombin. In some cases, 0.5 μm anti-EPCR mAb JRK 1494 was added before protein C and preincubated with the cells for 10 min at room temperature. After 30 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1.66 mg/ml antithrombin containing 20 mmEDTA. 50 μl of the supernatant was transferred into a 96-well microplate, and amidolytic activities of APC were determined toward 0.2 mm Spectrozyme PCa substrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The rates of substrate cleavage were measured in aV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All determinations were performed in duplicate. Under the conditions employed in this assay, less than 10% of the protein C was activated during the assay, as determined by reference to a standard curve of fresh fully activated protein C versus absorbance units/min. hEPCR, bovine EPCR, and murine EPCR (mEPCR) are single-chain transmembrane glycoproteins containing 221, 222, and 225 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid comparisons of human, bovine, and murine EPCR are shown in Fig. 1. cDNAs encoding human and mouse EPCR were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) and expressed in 293 cells. The apparent molecular mass of wild-type hEPCR, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis (∼46 kDa), is approximately twice that of its predicted molecular mass (∼24 kDa), consistent with the presence of carbohydrate moieties on EPCR (Fig.2). Glutamine substitutions at the fourN-glycosylation consensus sites (Asn-30, Asn-47, Asn-119, Asn-155) result in EPCR variants with decreased molecular masses (Fig.2). The electrophoretic mobility of the mutant proteins increases proportionally with the number of N-glycosylation sites ablated. In contrast, hEPCR variant L1, which contains alanine substitutions at five residues (Ser-71, Gln-75, Thr-145, Arg-156, glu-163), exhibits the same electrophoretic mobility as wild-type hEPCR (Fig. 2).Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of cell surface proteins of 293 cells transfected with hEPCR variants. 293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type hEPCR (WT), hEPCR mutant L1, hEPCR mutant N47Q, hEPCR mutant N119Q, and hEPCR mutant N30Q/N155Q. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and cell surface proteins were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. The immunoblot was probed with JRK 1513, a monoclonal antibody against hEPCR. Molecular mass standards are on the left as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human, bovine, and murine EPCR all bind saturated and in a Ca2+-dependent manner to Fl-APC (28Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5571-5577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the locations of the residues in the extracellular domain of EPCR that we selected for individual or multiple mutations to alanine. Most of the alanine substitutions were directed at conserved residues, but some were also directed at nonconserved regions of EPCR. The affinities of EPCR variants for Fl-APC were first qualitatively assessed by flow cytometric analysis. The cDNAs of the variants were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and Fl-APC binding was monitored on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The analyses were performed in the presence of 30 nm Fl-APC, which is the dissociation constant for the interaction of hEPCR with APC (36Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties of the cell surface EPCR variants were compared with 293 cells transfected with hEPCR (positive control) and pcDNA3.1(−) vector (negative control). Western blotting analysis of whole cell lysates and cell surface proteins was performed in parallel to qualitatively monitor the EPCR antigen levels of the variants. The transiently transfected cells were also screened for the ability to bind fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies. Our laboratory has raised a panel of anti-human EPCR monoclonal antibodies, four of which are used in this study. These antibodies recognize human EPCR but not its mouse counterpart. As shown in Fig. 3, JRK 1494 and JRK 1535 mAbs block hEPCR/Fl-APC interactions, whereas JRK 1500 and JRK 1513 mAbs do not. As expected, protein C also blocks hEPCR/Fl-APC interactions, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that EPCR binds to the Gla domain of both protein C and APC (13Regan L.M. Mollica J.S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26279-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The effect of these four mAbs on the interaction between hEPCR and Fl-protein C is identical to that observed on the interaction between hEPCR and Fl-APC (data not shown). The results of the flow cytometric analyses and Western blotting analyses are summarized in Fig. 1. Residues enclosed in green circles are those that, when mutated to alanine, do not affect the binding of Fl-APC to the transfected cells. These residues include the four N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites at Asn-30, Asn-47, Asn-119, and Asn-115, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties of EPCR are not critical for protein C/APC interactions. The 10 residues marked with red asterisks (Arg-81, Leu-82, Val-83, Glu-86, Arg-87, Phe-146, Tyr-154, Thr-157, Arg-158, and Glu-160) are those that, when mutated to alanine, result in cell surface expression but no detectable Fl-APC binding, suggesting that these residues are involved in EPCR-APC interactions. As expected, these 10 mutants do not bind to Fl-protein C. Residues enclosed in blue circles are those that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of detectable intracellular and cell surface expression, suggesting that these residues are critical for secondary structure integrity of EPCR. Fig. 1also shows residues that, when mutated to alanine, result in the loss of binding to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-EPCR monoclonal antibodies (denoted by arrows). As mentioned above, the initial flow cytometric characterization of the variants was performed in the presence of 30 nm Fl-APC. Thus, to determine qualitatively the affinities of EPCR variants for Fl-APC, stably transfected 293 cells were generated. The affinities of 11 EPCR variants for Fl-APC were determined by monitoring the changes in cell fluorescence during Fl-APC titration. These variants were chosen to represent a wide range of ligand binding properties. Binding was analyzed by flow cytometry, andK d values were determined by fitting binding isotherms to a hyperbolic equation. To correct for nonspecific binding, 293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(−) vector alone were utilized. As shown in Table I, hEPCR, mEPCR, and clone 64-3 (a hEPCR-mEPCR chimera) all have similar binding affinities to Fl-APC (K d = 31 ± 28, 46 ± 15, and 51 ± 22 nm, respectively). Alanine substitutions that result in the removal of the epitope for JRK 1500 do not influence the binding of hEPCR to Fl-APC (K d = 55 ± 11 nm). Alanine substitution of 5 residues in the groove of hEPCR (clone L1) or removal of two N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (clone A/D sugar) result in a modest decrease in binding affinity to Fl-APC (K d = 161 ± 52 and 87 ± 4 nm, respectively). In contrast, the mutations E86A, R87A, F146A, Y154A, and R158A, all of which result in variants that do not bind Fl-APC as demonstrated in the initial qualitative screens (Fig. 1), decreased the affinity of hEPCR for Fl-APC greater than 30-fold (K d values of ≥1000 nm).Table IDissociation constants for the interaction of Fl-APC with EPCR variants expressed in 293 cellsName of cloneMutationPropertiesK dnmhEPCRNoneHuman EPCR31 ± 28mEPCRNoneMouse EPCR46 ± 1564-3Human (1–116), mouse (113–225)Human-mouse chimera51 ± 2220-3R127A, E129A, R130A in hEPCRDoes not bind JRK 150055 ± 11A/D sugarN30Q, N155Q in hEPCRLacks two N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites87 ± 4L-1T145A, R156A, E163A, S71A, Q75A in hEPCRContains 5 point mutations in the groove regions161 ± 52E86AE86A in hEPCRDoes not bind Fl-APC≥1000R87AR87A in hEPCRDoes not bind Fl-APC≥1000F146AF146A in hEPCRDoes not bind Fl-APC≥1000Y154AY154A in hEPCRDoes not bind Fl-APC≥1000R158AR158A in hEPCRDoes not bind Fl-APC≥1000The affinities of Fl-APC for EPCR variants were measured by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The experiments were performed in Hepes-buffered saline containing 3 mm CaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2.

We previously showed that the Na,K-ATPase partially unfolded when heated to 55 °C (Arystarkhova, E., Gibbons, D. L., and Sweadner, K. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8785–8796). The β subunit unfolded without leaving the membrane, but three transmembrane spans (M8-M10) and the C terminus of the α subunit were extruded, while the rest of α retained its normal topology with respect to the lipid bilayer. Here we investigated thermal denaturation further, with several salient results. First, trypsin sensitivity at both surfaces of α was increased, but not sensitivity to V8 protease, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domains and extruded domain were less tightly packed but still retained secondary structure. Second, thermal denaturation was accompanied by SDS-resistant aggregation of α subunits as dimers, trimers, and tetramers without β or γ subunits. This implies specific α-α contact. Third, the γ subunit, like the C-terminal spans of α, was selectively lost from the membrane. This suggests its association with M8-M10 rather than the more firmly anchored transmembrane spans. The picture that emerges is of a Na,K-ATPase complex of α, β, and γ subunits in which α can associate in assemblies as large as tetramers via its cytoplasmic domain, while β and γ subunits associate with α primarily in its C-terminal portion, which has a unique structure and thermal instability. Thermal denaturation can help elucidate protein domain substructure. We previously showed that the Na,K-ATPase partially unfolded when heated to 55 °C (Arystarkhova, E., Gibbons, D.

N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase The Na,K-ATPase has two obligatory subunits, α and β (reviewed in Ref. 1Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The α subunit (112 kDa) is a polytopic membrane protein homologous in structure to the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, which was recently determined to 2.6 Å (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The β subunit (34 kDa) is a single-span membrane protein with a large extracellular portion that is glycosylated and stabilized by disulfide bonds (reviewed in Ref. 3Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both α and β are required for the assembly and function of the enzyme, and once assembled, it has not been possible to separate them without irreversible loss of activity. In the renal medulla the Na,K-ATPase is also associated with a 64–70-amino acid single span membrane protein known as the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 4Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is not present in all Na,K-ATPase preparations, and in fact it is not even present in all segments of the mammalian nephron (5Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J.

Its association with α and β, when it occurs, is very stable, surviving extensive proteolytic degradation and detergent solubilization along with the ability to occlude K+ (8Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whether the Na,K-ATPase is normally a protomer (one copy of each subunit) or a dimer or tetramer of αβγ units in the membrane remains a controversial matter.Thermal denaturation of the Na,K-ATPase has produced some surprising results. From the literature, thermal denaturation of membrane proteins differs from that of soluble proteins in one important respect. Those segments of a membrane protein that are embedded in the lipid bilayer, whether α helices or β sheets such as in porins, are normally much more stable to thermal denaturation than the extramembranous portions (reviewed in Ref. 9Haltia T. Freire E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 295-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This is not because the lipid bilayer provides superior stabilization or a greater heat sink, but because of the absence of water, which provides the competing H-bond donor and acceptor groups that are instrumental for unfolding these internally bonded structures (10Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consequently much higher temperatures are required to denature the membrane domain. In this context, the observation that relatively mild heating (50 °C in β-mercaptoethanol or 55 °C without) caused a radical reorganization of part of the transmembrane domain of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit while unfolding the β subunit ectodomain was surprising (11Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated further the consequences of heat denaturation of the Na,K-ATPase. Our observations on the degree of denaturation of other portions of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit are in line with the literature, but some unexpected observations were made that are pertinent to the tertiary and quaternary structure of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme PreparationsPig and dog renal medulla Na,K-ATPase were purified by extraction of contaminating proteins with low concentrations of SDS followed by centrifugation on sucrose gradients by the method of Jørgensen (13Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme, which remains membrane-embedded throughout the procedure, was stored at −70 °C in 250 mm sucrose, 30 mm histidine, 1 mmEDTA (pH 7.2). Final specific activities were 600–2,000 μmol/h/mg of protein. Pig and dog α1 differ by only 21 amino acid substitutions; the β subunit antibody used works better on dog, necessitating the use of that species in a few experiments.HeatingPurified enzyme or crude microsomes were diluted to 0.5 mg of protein/ml in buffer containing 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose (pH 7.2 at room temperature) and incubated for 30 min at 55 °C in a thermal block incubator. Subsequently samples were kept on ice.ATPase Activity AssayNa,K-ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C in media containing 3 mm Tris-ATP, 3 mmMgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 30 mm histidine (pH 7.2 at room temperature). Na,K-ATPase activity is defined as the ouabain-sensitive difference in Pi released per mg of protein per hour. Pirelease was measured colorimetrically (14Esmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Gel ElectrophoresisGel electrophoresis was normally carried out with the buffer system of Laemmli on either 5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels (except for gradient 5–15% gels which were used to visualize the γ subunit of the Na,K-ATPase). Samples were reduced with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and sample preparation was at room temperature. For determination of the molecular weights of the aggregates, a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.2% SDS was used with the Weber and Osborn buffer system (15Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). This was necessary because the high molecular weight standards (cross-linked phosphorylase B, Sigma) run anomalously on Laemmli gels. A Tricine1 peptide gel system was used in some experiments for resolution of the γ subunit (16Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose was performed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 170 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 5% SDS at 100 mA overnight at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose was quenched with Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20, and stained in the same buffer with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Detection was by chemiluminescence, using luminol-based reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.).AntibodiesMouse antibody 6F, which binds near the N terminus of the α1 subunit isoform, is available from the Developmental Biology Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Rat antibody 2F12, which recognizes α1, α2, and α3 and binds in the intracellular L2–3 loop, 2C. Donnet and K. J. Sweadner, unpublished observations. was obtained from Dr. Melitta Schachner, (ETH Zurich, Switzerland). Mouse antibody 9A7, which recognizes α1, α2, and α3 and binds in the intracellular L4–5 loop near M5,2 was obtained from Dr. Maureen McEnery, Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH). Peptide-directed antibody ETYY against the α subunit C terminus was the gift of Dr. Jack Kyte, University of California, San Diego. Antibody 8A, which is specific for the β1 subunit, was obtained from Dr. Michael Caplan, Yale University Medical School (New Haven, CT). We thank all our colleagues for generous gifts of antibodies. Antibody RCT-G1, which recognizes the C terminus of the γ subunit, was described earlier (5Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).ProteolysisV8 ProteasePurified pig or dog enzyme (0.5 μg) was incubated with V8 protease (Sigma) (0.1 μg) in a buffer consisting of 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose, for 30 min at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by diluting with 1 volume of 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer acidified with 0.3% trichloroacetic acid, which was effective at preventing digestion during gel electrophoresis. The acidification of the sample lasts only until it penetrates the gel, but it appears to promote irreversible denaturation of the protease.TrypsinLimited trypsinolysis in K+ at the T1 and T2 sites was carried out based on established protocols (17Jørgensen P.L. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Purified Na,K-ATPase (100 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.5 μg of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) in a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA-Tris, and 15 mm KCl (pH 7.5), for 10 min at 37 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by addition of a 10-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and 1 volume of 2 × electrophoresis sample buffer with 0.4% trichloroacetic acid was added 5 min after the trypsin inhibitor. As shown previously, acidified sample buffer is more effective at preventing digestion by trypsin during gel electrophoresis than addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor alone because the inhibitor paradoxically stabilizes the activity of the protease in the detergent (18Sweadner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Trypsin Treatment of Right-side-out VesiclesRight-side-out pig renal medulla vesicles were prepared by centrifugation on metrizamide gradients as described (11Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The extent of sealing was assessed by determining how much the Na,K-ATPase activity was stimulated by addition of detergent to open the vesicles. In the vesicles used here the stimulation was 5.5-fold, indicating that the vesicles were ∼82% sealed. Vesicles were incubated with TPCK-trypsin at a ratio of 1:3, trypsin:vesicle protein, for 30 min. The buffer was 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm Tris-EDTA. In some experiments, vesicles were pre-equilibrated with 10 mm RbCl to verify the stabilization of structure by this K+ analog (data not shown). Proteolysis was at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of acidified sample buffer. Samples were then directly loaded on SDS gels. Enzyme in open vesicles is extensively digested and does not contribute to the results (11Arystarkhova E. Gibbons D.L. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8785-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase has two obligatory subunits, α and β (reviewed in Ref. 1Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The α subunit (112 kDa) is a polytopic membrane protein homologous in structure to the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, which was recently determined to 2.6 Å (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The β subunit (34 kDa) is a single-span membrane protein with a large extracellular portion that is glycosylated and stabilized by disulfide bonds (reviewed in Ref. 3Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both α and β are required for the assembly and function of the enzyme, and once assembled, it has not been possible to separate them without irreversible loss of activity. In the renal medulla the Na,K-ATPase is also associated with a 64–70-amino acid single span membrane protein known as the γ subunit (reviewed in Ref. 4Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is not present in all Na,K-ATPase preparations, and in fact it is not even present in all segments of the mammalian nephron (5Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2122712518,"We generated mutants of the transporter associated with antigen-processing subunits TAP1 and TAP2 that were altered at the conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motifs of the nucleotide binding domains (NBD). In other ATP binding cassette transporters, mutations of the lysine have been shown to reduce or abrogate the ATP hydrolysis activity and in some cases impair nucleotide binding. Mutants TAP1(K544M) and TAP2(K509M) were expressed in insect cells, and the effects of the mutations on nucleotide binding, peptide binding, and peptide translocation were assessed. The mutant TAP1 subunit is significantly impaired for nucleotide binding relative to wild type TAP1. The identical mutation in TAP2 does not significantly impair nucleotide binding relative to wild type TAP2. Using fluorescence quenching assays to measure the binding of fluorescent peptides, we show that both mutants, in combination with their wild type partners, can bind peptides. Since the mutant TAP1 is significantly impaired for nucleotide binding, these results indicate that nucleotide binding to TAP1 is not a requirement for peptide binding to TAP complexes. Peptide translocation is undetectable for TAP1·TAP2(K509M) complexes, but low levels of translocation are detectable with TAP1(K544M)·TAP2 complexes. These results suggest an impairment in nucleotide hydrolysis by TAP complexes containing either mutant TAP subunit and indicate that the presence of one intact TAP NBD is insufficient for efficient catalysis of peptide translocation.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TAP functions to translocate peptides from the cytosol to the ER. Binding of peptides to newly synthesized MHC class I molecules in the ER stabilizes the MHC class I heterodimer and allows transit of MHC class I-peptide complexes to the cell surface for immune surveillance by T cells (4Pamer E. Cresswell P. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Two structurally related subunits of the TAP transporter, TAP1 and TAP2, form a complex on the ER membrane that is necessary and sufficient for peptide translocation from the cytosol into the ER. The cytosolic face of TAP1·TAP2 complexes contains a binding site for peptides (5Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which can function in the sequestration of peptides derived from proteasomal proteolysis. A recently discovered protein called tapasin is associated with the TAP1·TAP2 complex (6Li S. Sjogren H. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,7Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampé R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Tapasin has been shown to enhance the expression level of TAP1 and increase peptide transport by TAP complexes (8Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Google Scholar). However, tapasin is not required for peptide binding by TAP1·TAP2 complexes or for translocation per se, since TAP1·TAP2 complexes expressed heterologously in insect cells can bind and transport peptides (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TAP is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transmembrane transport proteins (10Holland B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Members of this family transport various substrates across cellular membranes in an ATP-dependent manner. Known substrates of ABC transporters include amino acids, peptides, proteins, sugars, and lipids. The typical ABC transporter has two hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions with multiple membrane-spanning segments and two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBD). The NBD contains several conserved sequence motifs. These include the Walker A and Walker B sequence motifs, which are characteristic of nucleotide binding folds (11Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). The membrane-spanning segments and the NBD can occur in a single polypeptide as in the mammalian cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and P-glycoprotein, as two separate polypeptides as in the TAP transporters, or as four separate polypeptides as in many bacterial ABC transporters (10Holland B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). TAP1 and TAP2 each comprise one membrane-spanning region with several membrane-spanning segments and one cytosolic NBD. In vitroexperiments with intact TAP domains as well as with each truncated NBD have shown that both TAP1 and TAP2 bind ATP and ADP (12Müller K.M. Ebsensperger C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14032-14037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang K. Früh K. Peterson P. Yang Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Russ G.

Tampé R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6831-6840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence for the occurrence of ATP hydrolysis during translocation comes from observations that the addition of exogenous ATP is required for peptide translocation by TAP and that translocation is not supported by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs or ADP (16Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hämmerling C.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis by TAP complexes or either NBD remains to be directly demonstrated. It is not known whether ATP hydrolysis by TAP1, TAP2, or the complex is required for a completion of a catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the requirement for nucleotide binding to each TAP subunit upon substrate (peptide) interactions with the TAP complex also remains to be unambiguously defined. Peptide binding to TAP was initially suggested to be nucleotide binding-independent, based upon studies of peptide binding to microsomal membranes expressing wild type TAP1 and TAP2 in the presence or absence of apyrase, an enzyme that depletes ATP and ADP (5Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, based upon more recent studies using TAP1 and TAP2 mutants that both lacked nucleotide binding activity, it was suggested that peptide binding by TAP is dependent upon nucleotide interactions with one or both subunits of the TAP1·TAP2 complex (17Knittler M.R. Alberts P. Deverson E.V. Howard J.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 999-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further experiments are required to resolve this discrepancy and to establish whether nucleotide binding to TAP1, TAP2, or both subunits alters the affinity of TAP1·TAP2 complexes for peptides. Toward a definition of the requirement for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by each TAP subunit for peptide binding and translocation, we generated mutants of TAP1 (K544M) and TAP2 (K509M) that were altered at a conserved lysine residue of the Walker A motif (GXXGXGK(S/T)) of each protein. Based upon the crystal structure of the ATP binding subunit of histidine permease, a bacterial ABC transporter, the Walker A lysines of TAP1 and TAP2 are predicted to be located on the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) and form contacts with the β-phosphate of ATP (18Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Mutations of this lysine in other ABC transporters have been shown to impair nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis and impair substrate translocation (19Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We observe that the Walker A lysine mutations in TAP1 and TAP2 have distinct effects upon nucleotide binding to each subunit, with nucleotide binding being significantly impaired in the TAP1(K544M) mutant but not in the TAP2(K509M) mutant. The observation that the TAP1(K544M) mutation is significantly impaired for nucleotide binding by TAP1 also allowed us to determine the correlation between nucleotide binding by TAP1 and peptide binding to TAP1·TAP2 complexes. Additionally, assays of peptide translocation by each mutant allowed insights into the requirement for nucleotide hydrolysis by TAP2 during a translocation cycle. Taken together, these results allow for the refinement of a model for the mechanistic steps involved during a single peptide translocation cycle. The cDNAs for TAP1 and TAP2 were obtained from Dr. John Trowsdale. Polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a sequence encoding a His6 tag to the 3′-end of TAP1 for the TAP1-His construct, to introduce BamHI sites at both ends of the TAP1 cDNA, and to introduce BglII sites at both ends of the TAP2 cDNA. The modified cDNAs were subcloned into pPCR2.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the Kunkel method (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The mutated cDNAs were sequenced, excised from pPCR 2.1, and ligated into pAcUW51 transfer vector. The transfer vectors and BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) were cotransfected into insect cells as described in Ref.43Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System Manual.

Plaque assays were used to isolate pure viruses, which were used to reinfect cells for virus amplification. 2 × 107 Sf21 cells were infected with the appropriate baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5–20, depending on the expression level of the individual virus. After ∼72 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete mini-EDTA free tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were lysed on ice for 45 min, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. 0.5 ml of the lysate was then immunoprecipitated with 0.75 μl of anti-His ascites, 200 μl of anti-TAP1 (148.3) hybridoma supernatant (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M.

The samples were centrifuged again at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to an appropriate volume of protein A-Sepharose beads prewashed in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mmphosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were then washed three times in wash buffer before adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with 5 μl of anti-His ascites, 150 μl of anti-TAP1 hybridoma supernatant, or 250 μl of anti-TAP2 hybridoma supernatant overnight. The membranes were then incubated with 5 μl of goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (American Qualex) for 2 h and developed with the Bio-Rad alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit. Cells were infected and lysed in an identical manner for the ATP beads binding experiment. Cells were lysed using the lysis buffer described above, containing 5 mm MgCl2. 0.5 ml of each cleared lysate was incubated for 2 h with an appropriate amount of preswollen ATP-, ADP-, or AMP-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) or immunoprecipitated with antibodies as described above. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, run on gels, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted in the same manner as above.

Briefly, 1 × 108 SF21 cells were infected with the appropriate baculovirus at an multiplicity of infection of 5–20, depending on the expression level of the individual virus. After 72 h, the cells were harvested, washed once in ice-cold PBS, and then resuspended in 800 μl of ice-cold cavitation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm calcium acetate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed by repeatedly drawing the suspension through a 26-gauge needle. After centrifugation at ∼500 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was added to 5 ml of 2.5 m sucrose in gradient buffer (2.5 msucrose, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). This was then overlaid with 3 ml each of 2.0 m sucrose in gradient buffer, then 1.3 m sucrose in gradient buffer, and finally with 800 μl of cavitation buffer. This was centrifuged overnight at 80,000 × g, and the microsomal fraction at the interface of the 2.0 and 1.3 m sucrose layers was collected. This fraction was diluted into 5 ml of PBS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. The total protein content was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce). For the translocation assays, a peptide of the sequence RRYNASTEL was synthesized, and iodinated using the chloramine-T labeling chemistry to a specific activity of 100–150 μCi/μg. Microsome-based translocation assays were carried out as previously described (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 30 μg of insect cell microsomes containing wild type or mutant TAP1·TAP2 complexes or single subunits were added to 150 μl of assay buffer (PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3) containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm ATP (+ATP samples) or 0.03 units/μl of apyrase (−ATP) (Sigma). Radioiodinated RRYNASTEL peptide was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 8,800 ×g and washed once with 250 μl of the appropriate assay buffer. The pellets were then resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 8,800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed twice with the appropriate assay buffer, and the radioactivity was determined using a Beckman 5500 γ-counter. Results from microsome-based translocation assays were verified using Sf21 cell-based assays, as per previously described protocols (26Nijenhuis M. Schmitt S. Armandola E.A. Obst R. Brunner J. Hämmerling G.J. J. Immunology. 1996; 156: 2186-2195PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide binding assays were carried out using a recently described procedure (27Neumann L. Tampé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. For the binding experiments, a peptide was synthesized with the sequence RRYQKCTEL. For fluorochrome labeling, the peptide was dissolved in PBS, 33% N,N-dimethylformamide. 5-Iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was then added at a 1.2:1 molar ratio to peptide. The reaction was allowed to incubate in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. The modified peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Peptide concentrations were normalized between experiments by measuring the absorbance at 495 nm (A 495 = 0.28 for 0.01 mg/ml peptide). For the peptide binding assays, the fluorescence emission signal (λex/em = 470/515 nm) was recorded using a PTI fluorimeter equipped with a microstirring device. A 5-mm round quartz cuvette was filled with 180 μl of assay buffer (PBS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) at room temperature, and the fluorescent peptide RRYQKCTEL was added with vigorous stirring (2.5–80 nm final concentration). The fluorescence signal was then allowed to stabilize. 20 μl of insect cell microsomes treated either with 0.03 units/μl of apyrase or with 1 mm ADP or ATP (for at least 30 min on ice) were added to the cuvette. The decrease in fluorescence due to TAP-dependent quenching of peptide fluorescence was monitored until equilibrium was achieved (280 s). The time dependence of quenching was determined by fitting the data to an exponential function, y = Ff + ΔF*e −kt (whereF f is the fluorescence value at steady state, ΔF is the net change in fluorescence, and k is the rate constant) using nonlinear least squares analysis in the Prism software package (Graph Pad software). The total fluorescence quenching signal (ΔF) was plotted as a function of peptide concentration. The curve was fitted to the equation y = ΔF * [P]/(K d + [P]), andK d values were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis. After stabilization of fluorescence signals, unlabeled peptide was added at a concentration of ∼30 μm, and the fluorescence recovery was monitored over several seconds as bound fluorescent peptide dissociated. The dissociation rate constants,k d, were estimated by fitting the fluorescence recovery signal to a monoexponential function, y =F e + ΔF *e −kdt (where F e is the end point fluorescence value, ΔF is the net change in fluorescence, and k d is the dissociation rate constant). Each set of binding experiments included a control with microsomal membranes prepared from uninfected Sf21 cells. Fluorescence quenching signals were also sometimes observed with microsomes derived from uninfected cells, but recovery was typically not observed (Figs. 4and 5). At peptide concentrations below 80 nm, the quenching signals observed for the control microsome preparations (if any) were typically significantly lower than those observed with microsome preparations containing wild type or mutant TAP complexes (Fig. 5, A–C). Variations in the quenching signal observed for microsome preparations from uninfected cells (ranging from negative amplitudes to low positive amplitudes as shown in Fig. 5,A–C) might arise due to peptide degradation during storage. In general, the lowest background signals were observed for experiments conducted within 1 week of HPLC purification of peptide, when the purified peptide was stored at −20 °C under dessication.Figure 5Equilibrium binding curves for fluorescent peptide/TAP interactions. Microsomal vesicles expressing the indicated TAP complexes or microsomes prepared from uninfected Sf21 cells were assayed for their ability to bind fluorescein-labeled RRYQKCTEL over the indicated concentration range. At each peptide concentration, the steady state fluorescence quenching was determined and plotted as a function of peptide concentration, and the K d values were estimated. The averages of data points from two separate experiments with the same microsome preparation are indicated on each plot. Each set of binding experiments included a control with microsomal membranes prepared from uninfected cells, which are also indicated on each plot. For all of the TAP-containing microsomes indicated, the same microsome preparations were used as in the translocation assays indicated in Fig. 3. The total protein concentration on each microsome preparation was 0.7 mg/ml TAP1·TAP2 (A), 1.1 mg/ml TAP1(K544M)-His·TAP2 (B), and 1.3 mg/ml TAP1·TAP2(K509M) (C). For the uninfected microsomes, the total protein concentration was 1.3 mg/ml. Four independent sets of binding experiments comparing peptide interactions with TAP1(K544M)-His·TAP2 microsomes and uninfected microsomes verify that these mutant complexes are capable of binding peptides by the following criteria: (i) the overall fluorescence quenching and recovery profiles resemble those obtained with wild type TAP complexes rather than uninfected microsomes, and (ii) the amplitudes of the quenching signals are greater than those obtained for uninfected microsomes. By similar criteria, four separate sets of experiments comparing peptide binding by TAP1·TAP2(K509M) microsomes and uninfected microsomes verify that this mutant complex is also capable of binding peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We modified the TAP1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, to introduce a sequence encoding a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (TAP1-His), to facilitate the biochemical analyses of TAP1 expression and function. The TAP1-His sequence was further modified by site-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), in order to alter a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif (Lys544) to a methionine. A similar modification was introduced into the cDNA sequence encoding TAP2, in order to alter the Walker A lysine (Lys509) to a methionine. Mutant clones were sequenced and ligated into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW51. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated encoding histidine-tagged TAP1 (TAP1-His), the corresponding Walker A lysine mutant (TAP1(K544M)-His), and the TAP2 Walker A lysine mutant (TAP2(K509M)). The anti-His antibody (Covance Scientific) was used to screen for TAP1 expression, and the TAP2-specific antibody 435.3 (anti-TAP2) (25van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was used to screen for TAP2 expression. Baculoviruses encoding wild type TAP1 (TAP1) and TAP2 (TAP2) were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Robert Tampé (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For comparisons of nucleotide binding by each mutant or wild type TAP subunit, insect cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding TAP1-His, TAP1(K544M)-His, TAP2, or TAP2(K509M) for ∼72 h. Detergent lysates of cells from each infection were incubated with ATP, ADP, or AMP-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Subsequently, the beads were washed, and proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in the presence of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. Proteins associated with the beads were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-His or anti-TAP2 antibodies (Fig.1). Lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-His or anti-TAP2 antibodies to directly visualize the relative expression levels of mutant versus wild type proteins. At comparable expression levels of TAP1-His and TAP1(K544M)-His (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and8), strong binding of TAP1-His to ATP-Sepharose and ADP-Sepharose beads is visualized (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas TAP1(K544M)-His binding to ATP and ADP beads is barely detectable (Fig. 1 A,lanes 5 and 6). These observations indicate that the K544M mutation impairs nucleotide binding to TAP1. By contrast, TAP2(K509M) binding to ATP and ADP beads does not appear to be significantly impaired relative to wild type TAP2 (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2 compared with lanes 5 and 6).Figure 2Association of wild type and mutant TAP1 and TAP2. Insect cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding the indicated constructs. Detergent lysates of these cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the indicated monoclonal antibody, and immunoblotting analysis was carried out with an antibody directed against the same or a partner subunit. A, TAP1-His/TAP2 or TAP1(K544M)-His/TAP2 interactions. Immunoprecipitations with anti-His indicate the presence of TAP2, and immunoprecipitations with anti-TAP2 indicate the presence of TAP1.B, TAP1·TAP2, or TAP1·TAP2(K509M) interactions. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were done identically to those shown in Fig. 2 A, but an anti-TAP1 monoclonal antibody (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used instead of anti-His to detect the untagged wild type TAP1 protein. Immunoprecipitations with anti-TAP1 indicate the presence of TAP2, and immunoprecipitations with anti-TAP2 indicate the presence of TAP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has previously been shown TAP1 and TAP2 associate into stable complexes and that both subunits are required for peptide binding and translocation (28Androlewicz M.J.

Immunology. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to analysis of the peptide binding and translocation properties of the mutants, it was therefore necessary to demonstrate that each mutant could form TAP1·TAP2 complexes. To assay the formation of TAP1(K544M)-His·TAP2 complexes, cells were infected with viruses encoding TAP1(K544M)-His and TAP2, or with TAP1-His and TAP2 as the positive controls. Detergent lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-His or anti-TAP2 antibodies. The samples were subsequently separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were stained with anti-His or anti-TAP2. We observed that TAP1(K544M)-His associates with TAP2 as does TAP1-His (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, TAP2(K509M) associates with TAP1 as does wild type TAP2, as measured by coimmunoprecipitation analyses with the TAP1-specific antibody 148.3 (anti-TAP1) (9Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M.

LinA does not require any cofactor for its activity and therefore represents a distinct type of enzyme from the former two dehydrochlorinases. The linA gene encoding γ-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase was cloned by Imai et al. (5Imai R. Nagata Y. Fukuda M. Takagi M. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the linA did not show sequence similarity to any sequence deposited in the databases. Recently, a gene identical to linA was cloned by Thomas et al. (6Thomas J.-C. Berger F. Jacquier M. Bernillon D. Baud-Grasset F. Truffaout N. Normand P. Vogel T.M. Simonet P. J.

The G+C content oflinA (53%) is considerably lower than that of other genes and of the total DNA of Sp. paucimobilis strains, suggesting that linA originates from the genome of some other genus or organism. The linA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the translation product (γ-HCH dehydrochlorinase LinA) was purified to homogeneity by Nagata et al. (4Nagata Y. Hatta T. Imai R. Kimbara K.

Because β-HCH does not contain a 1,2-biaxial HCl group, it was proposed that LinA dehydrochlorinates stereoselectively at this pair of hydrogen and chlorine (7Nagasawa S. Kikuchi R. Nagata Y.

This paper presents stereochemical analysis of the reaction products of enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH by LinA. The absolute configuration and conformation of the reaction products is established, and the reaction mechanism of dehydrochlorination of LinA is proposed. γ-PCCH was synthesized by alkaline dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH (8Nakazima M. Okubo T. Katumura Y. Botyu-Kagaku. 1949; 14: 10-19Google Scholar). γ-HCH of more than 98% purity was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 50 mg of γ-HCH was dissolved in 5 ml of acetonitrile. The synthesis was started by addition of 2.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was heated for 20 min at 40 °C. The products of synthesis were extracted with hexane. γ-PCCH was purified by preparative liquid chromatography with a steel column (8 × 250 mm) packed by silica gel (7 μm). 20% dichloromethane in hexane was used as the mobile phase. Purified enzyme LinA was prepared as described previously (4Nagata Y. Hatta T. Imai R. Kimbara K. Fukuda M. Yano K. Takagi M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1993; 57: 1582-1583Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 10 mg of γ-HCH and 100 ml of phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, were equilibrated at 35 °C in a shaking water bath. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of LinA (protein concentration: 45 mg/l). The reaction was stopped after 5 min by extraction with hexane. The product γ-PCCH was purified using the same procedure as described above for chemically synthesized γ-PCCH. Synthesized γ-PCCH was dissolved in phosphate buffer (10 ml, pH 7.5) and equilibrated at 35 °C in a shaking water bath. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of LinA (protein concentration: 45 mg/l). The progress of the reaction was monitored in 1 ml of the reaction mixture at 5, 10, 20, 40 min, and 24 h. Samples from the reaction mixture were extracted with 0.3 ml of hexane and analyzed by GC-MS as described below. Reaction products were identified and quantified on GC-MS system (Hewlett Packard 6890) with helium as a carrier gas. The temperature of the DB-5MS capillary column (59.5 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, J&W Scientific) was kept at 50 °C for 2 min and then increased to 300 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min. The scan mode at 50–550 m/z was used for searching and for identification of products, whereas SIM mode was used for quantification. The enantiomerical purity of the reaction products was monitored on a GC system (Hewlett Packard 5890) equipped with ECD detector and CYCLODEX-B capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, J&W Scientific). The column temperature was increased from 80 to 220 °C at a rate 10 °C/min and then the temperature was kept for 10 min at 220 °C. NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient triple resonance1H/13C/BB probehead at 298.2 K.

Three bond proton-proton scalar coupling constants were obtained from standard high resoluted one-dimensional1H NMR spectrum. The acquisition parameters were: spectral width 5000 Hz, 12288 complex points, 2.2 s recycle delay, and 16 scans. The spectrum was zero-filled to 32 120 real points, and the resolution was enhanced using a 45o shifted-square sine bell apodization function. The CD spectra were measured in acetonitrile at 298.2 K using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-cm path length and a wavelength of 200–350 nm. Ab initio geometry optimizations were conducted with Gaussian 98 (Gaussian, Inc.) using density functional theory (DFT) method. These optimizations employed the Becke3P86 hybrid functional and 6-31G** basis set. The scalar couplings were calculated using the program deMon-NMR (MASTERS-CS, Universite de Montreal, Canada). The PERDEW functional and the basis set IGLO-III of Kutzelnigg et al. (12Kutzelnigg W. Fleischer U. Schindler M. NMR Basic Principles and Progress.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The numbering of the atoms in γ-HCH and γ-PCCH molecules used in the article is given in Fig. 1. The nomenclature of Izumi and Tai (18Izumi Y. Tai A. Stereo-differentiating Reactions: the Nature of Asymmetric Reactions. Kodansha, Tokyo1977Crossref Google Scholar) was used for classification of the stereochemical course of the reactions. The activity of LinA toward γ-PCCH, originating from the alkaline dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH, was tested, and the end products of the reaction were identified using GC-MS. These products were compared with the end products of the enzymatic transformation of γ-HCH (Fig.2, A and B). The same compound, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TCB), was identified as the product of dehydrochlorination of both synthetic and biosynthetic γ-PCCH. In addition to 1,2,4-TCB, 1,2,3-TCB was also found in the reaction mixture obtained from the dehydrochlorination of synthetic γ-PCCH by LinA. Chromatography of the γ-PCCH formed by enzymatic dehydrochlorination using chiral stationary phase confirmed the formation of a single enantiomer in the reaction mixture (Fig.2 A, inset). Alkaline dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH is known to proceed primarily by an E2(AxhDHDN according to IUPAC)anti elimination mechanism (19Cristol S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1946; 69: 338-342Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Cristol S.J. Hause N.L. Meek J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950; 73: 674-679Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) resulting in formation of the racemate of 1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)- and 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH. Consequently, one of the stereoisomers present in the racemate of γ-PCCH from alkaline dehydrochlorination is identical with the stereoisomer of γ-PCCH formed during enzymatic dehydrochlorination, whereas 1,2,3-TCB is the product formed by dehydrochlorination of the remaining enantiomer present in the racemate (Fig. 2 B,inset). The formation of the single enantiomer during enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH suggests that LinA enzyme specifically differentiates the enantiotopical pairs of the vicinal HCl.Figure 2GC-MS chromatograms of the reaction mixtures from dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH (A), synthetic γ-PCCH (B) and δ-HCH (C) by LinA enzyme. A single product (1,2,4-TCB) is produced by dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH, whereas two products (1,2,4-TCB and 1,2,3-TCB) are produced by dehydrochlorination of synthetic γ-PCCH. δ-HCH is dehydrochlorinated to δ-PCCH, which is not further transformed to TCB. The chromatograms presented in theinsets show separation of γ-PCCH on the chiral stationary phase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different rates of formation of 1,2,4-TCB and 1,2,3-TCB were observed in kinetic measurements of dehydrochlorination of synthetic γ-PCCH by LinA enzyme (Fig. 3). At the same time, different rates of consumption of the two enantiomers of synthetic γ-PCCH were observed by gas chromatographic analysis employing the column for chiral separations. The enzyme eventually transformed all compounds present in the racemate. The different rates of the consumption of the two enantiomers of the γ-PCCH as well as different rates of the creation of the 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-TCB suggests the enantiomerical differentiation of the γ-PCCH enantiomers by LinA. The activity of LinA toward δ-HCH was tested, and the end products of the reaction were identified to confirm specificity of LinA toward the 1,2-biaxial HCl pair during enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-PCCH. The δ-PCCH was identified by GC-MS as the only product of the reaction. No activity of LinA toward δ-PCCH was observed (Fig.2 C). NMR spectroscopy was used for the analysis of configuration and conformation of synthetic and biosynthetic PCCH. The NMR spectra of synthetic and biosynthetic PCCH were compared and found to be identical. This result confirmed that alkaline dehydrochlorination gives rise to a product with the same relative configuration as enzymatic dehydrochlorination. This observation is in agreement with GC-MS experiments. The configuration of the biosynthetic PCCH was independently established by quantitative analysis of the experimental three bond proton-proton scalar coupling constants, intensities, and line widths of the appropriate resonances. The NMR spectrum (Fig.4) corresponds to the enantiomorphic pair 1,3(R),4(S),5 (S),6(R)-PCCH/1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)-PCCH, which is the only possible product of anti elimination. Microwave spectroscopy and electron diffraction experiments showed the presence of only two possible conformations for the cyclohexene ring (21Scharpen L.H. Wollrab J.E. Ames D.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1968; 49: 2368-2372Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Chiang J.F. Bauer S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 1898-1901Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The conformational equilibrium of biosynthetic γ-PCCH (in CD3CN at 298.2 K) was determined by fitting the weighted averages of selected theoretical scalar couplings to the experimental data. The theoretical three bond interproton scalar coupling constants of 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH for conformation α (Fig. 1 B) are3JH2-H3 = 2.5 Hz,3JH3-H4 = 8.3 Hz,3JH4-H5 = 2.2 Hz,3JH5-H6 = 2.4 Hz and for conformation β (Fig.1 C) are 5.8 Hz, 2.4 Hz, 2.0 Hz, and 5.9 Hz. Experimentally derived scalar couplings were: 3JH2-H3 = 3.1 Hz, 3JH3-H4 = 7.8 Hz,3JH4-H5 < 3 Hz,3JH5-H6 < 3 Hz. For 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH, the α conformation was found to be populated in the range of 82–92%. The population of the α conformation of 1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)-PCCH was calculated to be 8–18%. The absolute configuration of the biosynthetic γ-PCCH was determined by comparison of experimental and theoretical CD spectra. The following assumptions were made prior to calculating the CD spectrum. (i) The biosynthetic γ-PCCH is a single enantiomer. (ii) The biosynthetic γ-PCCH is either 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH or its enantiomer 1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)-PCCH, and (iii) the major conformation is ∼87%. The theoretical and experimental CD spectra are compared on Fig.5. The experimental CD spectrum corresponds well to the theoretical CD spectrum for 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH enantiomer. The small difference in the excitation energy between the experimental and theoretical spectra (about 20 nm) is an artifact of DFT calculation and has been described previously by other authors (23Wiberg K., B. Stratmann R., E. Frisch M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1998; 297: 60-64Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar,24Bour P. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 5099-5104Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous sequence searches for evolutionary relatives of LinA did not result in any significant hits (5Imai R. Nagata Y. Fukuda M. Takagi M. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A PSI-BLAST (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), nuclear transport factor-2 (14Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol.

Summers M.F. Science. 1997; 276: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).2 The proteins in this superfamily have diverged beyond notable sequence similarity and have evolved different function, but retain the general design of the active site cavity (26Murzin A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This enabled us to construct a three-dimensional model of LinA by homology and dock the substrate molecule in its active site. A molecule of γ-HCH was manually docked into the LinA active site in a way that would allow efficient abstraction of a hydrogen from the 1,2-biaxial HCl pair of the substrate molecule by the general base His-73 (Fig.6 B). The theoretical model of LinA complexed with the substrate is compared with the crystal structure of scytalone dehydratase complexed with its inhibitor (Fig.6). The figure illustrates the common fold and conserved catalytic dyad His-73/Asp-25 of these enzymes. The essential role of the putative catalytic dyad for LinA activity was confirmed experimentally by site-directed mutagenesis.2 The following experimental observations have been taken into account for the proposed reaction mechanism of LinA. (i) γ-PCCH formed by the enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH is in the configuration corresponding to anti elimination. (ii) LinA exclusively dehydrochlorinates HCH substrates containing at least one 1,2-biaxial pair of hydrogen and chlorine. (iii) 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH is the exclusive product of enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH, and (iv) His-73 and Asp-25 form the catalytic dyad of LinA. The putative reaction mechanism for dehydrochlorination of γ-HCH by LinA enzyme is depicted in Fig. 7. Molecular modeling revealed that the most probable conformation of the γ-HCH in the active site is the chair conformation (see next paragraph). The HCl pair involved in the reaction is forced to adopt the 1,2-biaxial position in the enzyme active site. The requirement for the presence of a 1,2-biaxial HCl pair in the substrate molecules, the geometry of the active site as well as the kinetic measurements, indicate an E2-like dehydrochlorination mechanism (27Bartsch R. Zavada J. Chem. Rev. 1980; 6: 453-493Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We propose that His-73 acts as the base and attacks the hydrogen atom on C3, resulting in breaking of the C3–H bond based on the analogous role of catalytic histidine in the scytalone dehydratase (13Lundqvist T. Rice J. Hodge C.N. Basarab G.S. Pierce J. Lindqvist Y. Structure. 1994; 2: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Asp-25 assists in the catalysis by keeping His-73 in the proper orientation and by stabilizing the positive charge that develops on the histidine imidazole ring during the reaction. There are probably other residues, which stabilize the transition state and the reaction products, e.g. via nonbonding interactions with hydrogen and chlorine atoms on the ring. Possible candidates are Lys-20 and Arg-129, which were shown to be important for the catalytic activity of LinA by site-directed mutagenesis experiments.2 A dehydrochlorination of γ-PCCH is considered to proceed in two successive steps as shown in Reactions 1 and 2 (7Nagasawa S. Kikuchi R. Nagata Y. Takagi M. Matsuo M. Chemosphere. 1993; 26: 1187-1201Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Cristol S.J. J. Am. Chem.

C6H5Cl5→C6H4Cl4+HClEquation 1 C6H4Cl4→C6H3Cl3+HClEquation 2 We confirmed that LinA is specific toward 1,2-biaxialhydrogen and the chlorine pair in Reaction 1. Enzymatic dehydrochlorination of γ-PCCH proceeds by a 1,2-antidehydrochlorination reaction (Reaction 1), followed by 1,4-anti dehydrochlorination (Reaction 2). Because the enzymatic transformation of 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH results exclusively in the formation of 1,2,4-TCB, the reaction must proceed through 1,3(R),4,6(R)-tetrachlorocyclohexa-1,4-diene (TCDN) as an intermediate (Fig. 8). Biotransformation of 1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)-PCCH to 1,2,3-TCB then proceeds through 1,3,5,6-TCDN. The dehydrochlorination of the 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH by LinA starts on the H4Cl5 pair and proceeds analogously from a stereochemical and mechanistic point of view to γ-HCH dehydrochlorination (Fig. 8). Transformation of 1,3(R),4,6(R)-TCDN to 1,2,4-TCB has been proposed to proceed by a spontaneous nonenzymatic rearrangement, based on the assumption of an unstable diene-type structure (7Nagasawa S. Kikuchi R. Nagata Y. Takagi M. Matsuo M. Chemosphere. 1993; 26: 1187-1201Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 1,3(R),4,6(R)-TCDN has never been directly detected in the reaction mixture, suggesting that 1,4 elimination of HCl from TCDN proceeds by the same or higher rate than enzymatic 1,2 elimination of HCl from γ-PCCH. 1,2,3-TCB is the exclusive product of a 1,4 elimination reaction of 1,3,5,6-TCDN. The specific formation of 1,2,3-TCB seems to support the enzymatic nature of Reaction 2. LinA could specifically differentiate between 1,4 H6Cl3 and H3Cl6 groups of 1,3,5,6-TCDN, when only elimination of H6Cl3 results in formation of 1,2,3-TCB. In case of nonenzymatic elimination, the preference for 1,4 elimination of H6Cl3 over H3Cl6, and lack of 1,3,5-TCB product (28Orloff H. Kolka A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 5484-5490Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) could be caused by the higher activation barrier or unfavorable thermodynamics of H3Cl6 elimination. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of Reaction 2. The chair conformation of γ-HCH is expected to be the active conformation during its dehydrochlorination by LinA (Fig.6 B) for two reasons. One is that γ-PCCH is known to be both a LinA substrate and a competitive inhibitor of γ-HCH dehydrochlorination (7Nagasawa S. Kikuchi R. Nagata Y. Takagi M. Matsuo M. Chemosphere. 1993; 26: 1187-1201Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the chair conformation allows similar binding modes for both γ-HCH and γ-PCCH substrates. The other reason is that in a chair conformation there is at least oneaxial chlorine atom laying in the same plane as the abstracted proton. The fact that both γ-PCCH enantiomers are LinA substrates strongly suggests that there may be more than one substrate-binding mode. Based on the shape of the active site and conformational analogy with the active conformation of γ-HCH, the twist conformation of α is the expected active conformation for γ-PCCH. The production of 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH during the enzymatic transformation of γ-HCH proves differentiation of the enantiotopic H2Cl3/H5Cl6 and H3Cl2/H6Cl5 groups. The different rates of the consumption of the two enantiomers of the γ-PCCH as well as different rates of the creation of the 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-TCB confirm the enantiomerical differentiation of the γ-PCCH enantiomers by LinA. The production of the 1,2,4-TCB from 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH by enzymatic dehydrochlorination proves differentiation of the diastereotopical H4Cl5 and H5Cl4 groups. Both topological differentiations are consequences of sharing a common conformation on one side of the ring facing the catalytic residues, the enantiomerical differentiation of γ-PCCH enantiomers arises as a consequence of the opposite orientation of the hydrogen and chlorine atoms on the double bond at the active site. Whereas catalytic residues cause the topological differentiation, the enantiomerical differentiation is driven by the noncovalent interaction of the double bond substituents with noncatalytic residues in the active site of the LinA. The expected active conformations of 1,3(R),4(S),5(S),6(R)-PCCH and 1,3(S),4(R),5(R),6(S)-PCCH are depicted in Fig. 8.

https://openalex.org/W1986628548,"Eucaryotic cells contain at least two general classes of oxygen-regulated nuclear genes: aerobic genes and hypoxic genes. Hypoxic genes are induced upon exposure to anoxia while aerobic genes are down-regulated. Recently, it has been reported that induction of somehypoxic nuclear genes in mammals and yeast requires mitochondrial respiration and that cytochrome-c oxidase functions as an oxygen sensor during this process. In this study, we have examined the role of the mitochondrion and cytochrome-c oxidase in the expression of yeastaerobic nuclear COX genes. We have found that the down-regulation of these genes in anoxic cells is reflected in reduced levels of their subunit polypeptides and that cytochrome-c oxidase subunits I, II, III, Vb, VI, VII, and VIIa are present in promitochondria from anoxic cells. By using nuclearcox mutants and mitochondrial rho 0and mit − mutants, we have found that neither respiration nor cytochrome-c oxidase is required for the down-regulation of these genes in cells exposed to anoxia but that a mitochondrial genome is required for their full expression under both normoxic and anoxic conditions. This requirement for a mitochondrial genome is unrelated to the presence or absence of a functional holocytochrome-c oxidase. We have also found that the down-regulation of these genes in cells exposed to anoxia and the down-regulation that results from the absence of a mitochondrial genome are independent of one another. These findings indicate that the mitochondrial genome, acting independently of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, affects the expression of the aerobic nuclearCOX genes and suggest the existence of a signaling pathway from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus.

Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). This response is crucial to survival in most organisms and can range from an immediate change in energy metabolism to the activation of gene expression pathways that help the organism cope with a low oxygen environment (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 2Hochachka P, W. Buck L.T. Doll C. Land S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Currently, the effect of oxygen concentration on gene expression is being studied intensively in a number of different organisms (c.f. Ref.4Semenza G.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 303-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with each of these experimental systems have made it clear that some genes (hypoxic genes) are up-regulated by exposure to anoxic or hypoxic conditions while other genes (aerobicgenes) are down-regulated under these conditions. So far, most of the studies on the effects of hypoxia on gene expression have focused on the induction of hypoxic genes and have not addressed the down-regulation of aerobic genes. These studies on the induction of hypoxic genes have revealed that exposure to hypoxia can initiate a complex series of events, which begin with some sort of oxygen sensor and end with a signaling pathway that up-regulates hypoxic genes (1Bunn H.F.

Ref. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in understanding the transcriptional machinery involved in oxygen-regulated gene expression of eucaryotic genes, the underlying mechanisms of oxygen sensing and the signaling pathways that connect oxygen sensors to the transcriptional machinery in eucaryotes are poorly understood. However, there is growing evidence that the mitochondrial respiratory chain and cytochrome-c oxidase function in oxygen sensing and in the induction of somehypoxic genes in both yeast and mammalian cells (8Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Poyton R.O. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Early evidence for the involvement of cytochrome-c oxidase in oxygen sensing in mammalian cells has come from spectral studies (11Wilson D.F. Mokashi A. Chugh D. Vinogradov S. Osanai S. Lahiri S.

Xue D. New Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 211-216Google Scholar). More recently, it has been found that part of the hypoxic induction of some mammalian genes is sensitive to cyanide and that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is required for the hypoxic induction of a number of genes which are under the control of the HIF-1 transcription factor (10Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Chandel N.S. Maltepe, Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the induction of some hypoxic genes has also been reported for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide affects the induction of a subset of hypoxic genes in this organism. It completely inhibits the induction of OLE1(the gene for Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase) and CYC7 (the gene for iso-2 cytochrome c) and partially inhibits the induction of COX5b (the gene for cytochrome-coxidase subunit Vb) but has no effect on the induction of seven otherhypoxic genes (HEM13, HMG1, HMG2, ERG11, CPR1(NCP1), ANB1, and AAC3). This finding revealed two classes of yeast hypoxic genes: carbon monoxide-sensitive and carbon monoxide-insensitive. By using mutants deficient in the two major yeast carbon monoxide-binding hemeproteins (cytochrome-c oxidase and flavohemoglobin) it was found that cytochrome-c oxidase but not flavohemoglobin is required for the induction of the carbon monoxide-sensitive genes. These studies also revealed thatOLE1 and CYC7 are not induced in rho0strains (which lack a mitochondrial genome and respiration), in strains that are respiration deficient but retain a mitochondrial genome, and in the presence of respiratory inhibitors. Together, these findings indicate that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is involved in the expression of some hypoxic yeast genes and that cytochrome-c oxidase is a likely oxygen sensor. The above observations have increased interest in assessing how cytochrome-c oxidase functions in oxygen-regulated gene expression (c.f. Refs. 9Poyton R.O. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 10Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At present, little is known about the oxygen sensing function of this enzyme. However, it is clear that oxygen concentration has a profound affect on both its biosynthesis and catalytic functions (c.f. Ref. 17Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev.

This oligomeric protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane contains subunit polypeptides encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The three largest subunits (I, II, and III) are encoded by mitochondrial genes (COX1, COX2, and COX3); they form the catalytic core of the enzyme (17Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev.

The other polypeptide subunits are encoded by nuclear genes; some of them modulate catalysis, whereas others function in the assembly or stability of the holoenzyme. Active preparations of yeast cytochrome-c oxidase contain at least six subunit polypeptides (IV, Va or Vb, VI, VII, VIIa, and VIII) encoded by nuclearCOX genes (COX4, COX5a or COX5b,COX6, COX7, COX9, and COX8, respectively) (20Poyton R.O.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).COX5a and COX5b encode interchangeable isoforms, Va and Vb, of subunit V (21Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3520-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The other nuclear-encoded subunits are encoded by single-copy genes. Oxygen affects the levels of expression of all of these nuclear genes at the level of transcription. All of these genes except COX5b are aerobic genes;COX5b is a hypoxic gene. The inverse regulation of COX5a and COX5b by oxygen is especially interesting because the isoforms encoded by these genes have differential effects on holocytochrome-c oxidase activity. By altering an internal step in electron transport between heme a and the binuclear reaction center the “hypoxic” isoform, Vb, enhances the catalytic constant (TN) of the enzyme 3–4-fold (22Waterland R.A.

Hence, these isoforms allow cells to assemble functionally different types of holoenzyme in response to oxygen concentration. We are using S. cerevisiae as a model system to further explore the role of the mitochondrion and cytochrome-coxidase in adaptation to hypoxia. In this study, we focus on the role of anoxia and the mitochondrion on the expression of aerobic COX genes. Our findings provide support for the existence of a signaling pathway, which acts independently of respiration, from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. Two respiration-competent parental strains were used: D273-10B and JM43. Strain JM43 was constructed by crossing D273-10B with strain AB35-13D(MATa leu2-2, 112, ura3-52, his4-590, ade2), as described (24Cumsky M.G. Ko K. Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2235-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and then extensively backcrossed with D273-10B. These two strains are isogenic except for the auxotrophic markers that were introduced into JM43. Strain JM43ρ0 and D273-10Bρowere derived from their respective parent strains by treatment with acriflavine, for 18 h, and then selecting for rhoocolonies, as described (25Mattick J.S. Nagley P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 152: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absence of DNA was initially assessed by crossing to JM8, a rhoo tester strain and then verified by cesium chloride centrifugation in the presence of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (26Williamson D.H. Fennell D.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 12: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Strain JM43GD9 was produced as described previously (27Wright R.M. Dircks L.K. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17183-17191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain JM43GD6 was constructed as follows. The COX6 gene in JM43 was disrupted by use of the plasmid pVISt3 (28Wright R.M. Rosenzwieg B. Poyton R.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1103-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is derived from pUC19. The URA3gene was inserted into the HindIII site that is within theCOX6 coding region on pVISt3 and the resulting plasmid was used to transform JM43 by the lithium acetate procedure (29Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confirmation that the COX6 gene was disrupted was achieved by Southern blot analysis, Northern blot analysis, and Western immunoblotting of mitochondrial proteins. Strains aM10–150-4D, M9-3, DS-80, and aM17–162-4D were derived from strain D273-10B; they were kindly provided by Dr. Alexander Tzagoloff. The mitochondrial DNA in aM10–150-4D carries a 7.5-kilobase deletion that spans the region from 47.5 to 60 map units and that completely removes the cox1genetic locus (30Morimoto R. Lewin A. Rabinowitz M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 170: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Bonitz S.G. Coruzzi G. Thalenfeld B.E. Tzagoloff A. Macino G. J. Biol.

Miller D.H. Hanson D.K. Mahler H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2471-2479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain DS-80 is a rho− strain that has a mitochondrial genome consisting of a tandemly repeated segment of mtDNA that is 2.6 kilobase pairs in length. This 2.6-kilobase pair repeat spans the paromomycin-resistant locus and encodes the 15-s rRNA gene. Strain M9-3 carries amit − mutation in the cox3 gene (33Slonimski P.P. Tzagoloff A. Eur J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Strain VC36 carries a cox2 promoter mutation which prevents transcription of cox2 (34Cameron V.L. Fox T.D. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic complementation tests were routinely performed to be sure that the neither the nuclearcox mutants nor the mit − mutants used in this study were rhoo. The nuclear coxmutants, JM43GD6 and JM43GD9, were checked for their ability to complement the respiratory deficiency in JM6 and themit − mutants, aM10–150-4D, VC36, and aM-17–162-4D, were checked for their ability to complement the respiratory deficiency in M9-3. Plasmids were propagated inEscherichia coli HB101 or DH5α and purified by alkaline hydrolysis (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

To obtain a more uniform dispersion, the Tween 80, ergosterol, and silicon antifoam were sonicated in solution prior to autoclaving. Amino acids and nucleotides were added, as appropriate, at a concentration of 40 μg/liter. Cells were grown at 28–30 °C either in YPGal in Delong flasks on a shaker (200 rpm) or in semi-synthetic galactose medium in a New Brunswick Bioflo IIc fermentor, equipped with a gas-flow train that allows cells to be cultured at any desired oxygen concentration and to be shifted between oxygen concentrations (36Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Everts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fermentor was inoculated with precultures that were grown aerobically on a shaker at 28–30 °C to mid-exponential phase. The temperature, pH, and sparge rate were maintained as described (16Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermentor was monitored continuously and the oxygen concentration (μm) in the vessel was calculated from the measured dissolved oxygen level and based upon the oxygen solubility in the growth media at 28 °C, the ambient barometric pressure, and the pressure with the vessel (cf. Ref. 36Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Everts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anoxic and low-oxygen cultures (0–5 μm O2) were grown in the dark to prevent photoinhibition of growth (37Sulkowski E. Guerin B. Defaye J. Slonimski P.P. Nature. 1964; 202: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Nominally oxygen-free (anoxic) cultures were grown in O2-free N2 containing 2.5% CO2. To prevent trace O2 from entering the fermentor, the gas mixture was passed through an Oxyclear O2 absorber (LabClear, Oakland, CA). Cells were harvested at mid-exponential phase. During harvest cells were quick-chilled to −4 °C, washed twice with ice cold diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled water, and either processed for RNA immediately or frozen in liquid N2. Cycloheximide was added to anoxic cultures at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml prior to harvesting. Total RNA was isolated from washed cells as described previously (38Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). RNA samples were denatured and separated on 1.8% agarose gels containing MOPS1/formaldehyde buffer (20 mm MOPS, 40 mm sodium acetate, 8 mmEDTA, and 220 mm formaldehyde (cf. Ref. 39Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 380-381PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to Nytran Plus charged nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) or GeneScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and hybridized as described previously (40Burke P.V. Raitt D. Allen L.A. Kellogg E.A. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14705-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 μg of RNA was loaded per lane; loading was adjusted to give equal signals for hybridization to the ACT1 gene. DNA probes were prepared by random-primer labeling of double-stranded DNA fragments using [α-32P]dCTP or (DuPont NEN; cf. Ref. 35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989: 1-38Google Scholar) “All-In-One” random prime mixture (Sigma). Either plasmid-based probes or PCR fragments were used. The plasmid based probes were as follows: the probe for COX4 was an 800-bp XbaI fragment, derived from pUC-4SH (41Maarse A.C. VanLoon A.P.G.M. Riezman H. Gregor I. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); the probe for COX5a was a 500-bp PstI fragment from plasmid p5ap500 2C. Dagsgaard, and R. O. Poyton, unpublished data. ; the probe forCOX6 was a 500-bp StuI/BglII fragment from pVISt3 (28Wright R.M. Rosenzwieg B. Poyton R.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1103-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); the probe for COX8 was a 370-bpXbaI-StyI fragment from pUC-8XS (42Patterson T.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17192-17197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the probe for COX9 was a 240-bp ClaI-NheI fragment derived from pVIIaS3 (27Wright R.M. Dircks L.K. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17183-17191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the probe for ACT1was a 520-bp StyI fragment from pRB155 (43Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). A PCR fragment of each gene was obtained by amplifying genomic DNA. The sequence of the PCR primer pairs and their coordinates are as follows: theCOX4 fragment corresponded to bp 2 to 461 of the gene and was amplified with the primer pair 5′-GGATTCTGAGGTTGCTGCTTTGGTT-3′ and 5′-ACCGGCCAAATCGATTCTCA-3′; theCOX5a fragment corresponded to bp 10 to 454 of the gene and was amplified with the primer pair 5′-AACACTTTTACTAGAGCTGGTGGACT-3′ and 5′-ATTGGACCTGAGAATAACCACCCC-3′; the COX6 fragment corresponded to bp 8 to 444 of the gene and was amplified with the primer pair 5′-CAAGGGCCATATTCAGAAATCCAGT-3′ and 5′-AGAAGAGCTTGGAAATAGCTCTCC-3′; the COX8 fragment corresponded to bp 1 to 231 of the gene and was amplified with the primer pair 5′-ATGTTGTGCCAACAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTGACTTTTTCAATT-3′; the COX9 fragment corresponded to bp 11 to 165 and was amplified with the primer pair 5′-CTCCAATTACTGGTACGATCA-3′ and 5′-TTTCCTCTCAGCTAGCTCTG-3′; and the ACT1 fragment corresponded to bp 3 to 546 of the gene and was amplified by the primer pair 5′- GGATTCTGAGGTTGCTGCTTTGGTT-3′ and 5′-ACCGGCCAAATCGATTCTCA-3′. After amplification, PCR fragments were gel-purified on a 1% TAE-agarose gel (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989: 1-38Google Scholar). Stringency washes were performed as described previously (21Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3520-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Signal intensity was measured with either an AMBIS Radioanalytical Imaging System or a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. To quantify the transcripts, the relative signal strength was normalized to the level of ACT1 mRNA. To determine whether levels of actin mRNA are affected by mitochondrial genotype, we prepared total nucleic acids from JM43 and JM43ρo cells grown to mid-exponential phase in YPGal, chemically quantitated the amounts of RNA and DNA, and probed a Northern blot of the RNA with the 32P-labeledACT1 probe. When normalized to cellular DNA the amount of actin mRNA did not vary by more than 5%, indicating that the expression of ACT1 is unaffected by mitochondrial genotype. Whole cell extracts were prepared by shaking with glass beads (44McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckener-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase, harvested, and spheroplasted as described (23Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that cycloheximide was added to a concentration of 25 μg/ml to all buffers used prior to the production of spheroplasts from anoxic cells. All steps after spheroplasting were performed at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3,000 × g), washed gently in post-spheroplast buffer (1.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0), and sedimented at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Washed spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.6 mmannitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), lysed in a Sorvall Omnimixer at low speed for 3 s and at full speed for 45 s, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,900 × g to pellet unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,100 × g to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed by resuspension in mitochondrial lysis buffer minus bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0), homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,651 × gfor 5 min. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant, collected after the 12,100 ×g centrifugation, was used as the cytosol. Whole cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing 16% acrylamide, 10% glycerol, and 4.8 m urea (20Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A.

Immunoreactivity was detected either by 125I-protein A followed by autoradiography, or horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies followed by chemiluminescence using a chemiluminescence detection kit, as indicated in the figure legends. Immunoblots were quantitated digitally using Kodak 1-D software.

In the present study, we found that pertussis toxin blocks lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell spreading of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on fibronectin. This prevention of cell spreading was eliminated by the expression of constitutively active mutants of Rho family small GTP-binding proteins, Rac and Cdc42, but not by Rho. In addition, activation of the endogenous forms was suppressed by pertussis toxin, indicating that Gi-induced cell spreading is mediated through the Rac and Cdc42 pathway. Transfection of constitutively active mutants of Gαi and Gα11 and Gβγ subunits enhanced spreading of pertussis toxin-treated cells. Gβ1 with Gγ12, a major Gγ form in fibroblasts, was more effective for increasing cell spreading than Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1plus Gγ12S2A, a mutant in which Ser-2, a phosphorylation site for protein kinase C, is replaced with alanine. In addition, a protein kinase C inhibitor diminished Gβ1γ12-induced cell spreading, suggesting a role for phosphorylation of the protein.

The cell spreading is also regulated by soluble factors from serum such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1and platelet-derived growth factor, which then induce cell growth and migration (1Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 2Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The process is accomplished by complex dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and the dynamics appear to be coordinated in space and time by intracellular signaling pathways involving Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 4Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanisms are poorly understood. Rho family members such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are part of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that act as guanine nucleotide-regulated switches (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Their activity is regulated primarily by two groups of proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), which catalyze exchange of GDP for GTP; and GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Upon binding to GTP, Rho family GTP-binding proteins interact with and activate various downstream effector proteins such as Rho kinases and p21-activated kinases (PAK). Rho stimulates the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Cdc42 activation triggers the extension of filopodia and Rac controls growth factor-stimulated membrane ruffling and formation of lamellipodia (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). It has been defined how soluble extracellular factors induce the assembly of focal adhesions and actin filaments in serum-starved adherent fibroblasts through activation of Rho. However, there are several reports that Rho family small GTP-binding proteins are also involved in the generation of intracellular morphological structures during cell spreading on an extracellular matrix (5Price L.S.

With Rat1 cells, cell spreading was significantly reduced by expression of dominant negative mutants of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (6Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicited a transient inhibition of Rho activation, suggesting the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative feedback loop (7Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). LPA induces multiple cellular responses through a G protein-coupled receptor and activates Ras and Rho family GTP-binding proteins via different pathways (1Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, LPA stimulates cell growth and lowers cAMP levels in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner, suggesting coupling of the LPA receptor to Gi family G proteins (8van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). LPA-induced activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade also occurs in a PTX-sensitive fashion, and Gβγ subunits of G proteins transduce this effect (9van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In contrast, in a variety of cells, stimulation of phospholipase C by LPA was shown to be PTX-insensitive, so that LPA receptor coupling to Gq family G proteins may also be important (11Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPA induces the Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (12Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Gα12 and Gα13 probably mediate this action, because microinjection of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 into fibroblasts triggers actin polymerization in a Rho-dependent manner (12Buhl A.M.

It is well known that LPA induces cell migration, which is blocked by PTX, suggesting the involvement of Gi. However, regulation of Rho family GTP-binding proteins by Gi has not been clearly shown to date. In the present study, we found that PTX blocks LPA-induced cell spreading of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on fibronectin. We show here Gi stimulation via the LPA receptor leads to Rac and Cdc42 activation during cell spreading. pCMV5-Gαi2Q205L, pCMV5-Gα11Q209L, pCMV5-GαsQ227L, pCMV5-Gα12Q229L, pCMV5-Gγ2, pCMV5-Gγ12, pCMV5-Gγ12S2A, pCMV5-Gβ1, the pCMV5 carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARKct), pCMV5-FLAG-RhoAT19N, pCMV5-FLAG-Rac1T17N, pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42HsT17N, pCMV5-FLAG-RhoAG14V, pCMV5-FLAG-Rac1G12V, and pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42HsG12V were constructed as detailed previously (14Yamauchi J.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine, Gαq/11, Gαs, and Gα12 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human Rac1 and Cdc42 from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG and Myc epitopes were purchased from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probe, PTX from Seikagaku Kogyo, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., LPA from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor from Immunobiological Laboratories, glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and fibronectin from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. PAK1 cDNA was a generous gift from L. Lim (National University of Singapore). The Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain (CRIB) of PAK1 (amino acids 67–150) (25Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using PAK1 cDNA as a template, ligated into pCMV-Myc, and confirmed by DNA sequencing (20Yamauchi J. Kawano T. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7633-7640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cDNA of Myc-CRIB was cloned into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression and purification of GST fusion protein were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and published protocols (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with the GST-Myc-CRIB construct were grown at 37 °C, and expression of recombinant protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na2S2O3, 10‥ glycerol, 20‥ sucrose, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), then sonicated on ice, and mixed gently for 30 min after addition of 10‥ Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1‥. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at room temperature followed by further incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer A and once with phosphate-buffered saline. GST-Myc-CRIB fusion protein-bound beads were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50‥ and stored at −20 °C. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10‥ calf serum. For transient transfections, cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells/10-cm dish 24 h before transfection with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The final amount of the transfected DNA for a 10-cm dish was adjusted to 4 μg containing 3.6 μg of plasmid of interest or empty vector pCMV5 and 0.4 μg of pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). Medium replacement with serum-free medium was performed after 24 h, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h, in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml PTX for the last 16 h. They were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with trypsin-EDTA, and washed with Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 0.3 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, replated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips or dishes, and incubated for 1 h, unless otherwise specified, in the absence or presence of 10 μm LPA, 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 5 μm BIM. After incubation, cells were fixed in 4‥ paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for immunocytochemistry or lysed with 1‥ SDS in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA for immunoblot analyses. Untransfected cells were stained for F-actin with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin. To quantitate cell spreading, images of cells were obtained using a laser scanning microscope (Fluoview, Olympus), and the areas of fluorescence-positive or GFP-positive cells were measured using Fluoview image analysis software. For each experiment, the areas of 50 cells were quantitated. All results shown represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed by performing unpaired Student'st test. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) for immunoblotting with various antibodies. This was performed essentially as described previously (26Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). After replating on fibronectin-coated dishes, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 5 min at 0 °C in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10‥ glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) containing 1‥ Nonidet P-40, and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aliquots were taken from the supernatant to compare protein amounts. For this purpose, incubation with bacterially produced GST-Myc-CRIB fusion proteins bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C for 60 min was followed by washing three times in an excess of buffer B containing 0.5‥ Nonidet P-40. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then analyzed for bound Rac and Cdc42 by immunoblotting using monoclonal mouse antibodies against human Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively. Detection was with a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and densitometry analysis was performed using the LAS-1000 system (Fujifilm). To investigate the role of Gi signaling during cell spreading, serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated for 16 h in the absence or presence of PTX, replated on fibronectin-coated plastic dishes, then exposed to 10 μm LPA for various times, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to label F-actin (Fig.1). Cells incubated in the absence of PTX spread over a period of 60 min. This was markedly diminished with PTX treatment. To confirm that PTX abolishes only the function of Gi, we examined the effects of PTX with induction by other stimulants known to enhance cell spreading or cell migration. Fibronectin alone (none), platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor induced cell spreading, although the staining of F-actin in cell cortex was much weaker than that observed in LPA-stimulated cells, and this was not affected by PTX (Fig.2). These results suggest that PTX specifically blocks Gi activation via the LPA receptor. The apparently paradoxical result that spreading occurs equally on fibronectin in the presence or absence of LPA, but is inhibited by PTX only in the presence of LPA will be explained later (see “Discussion”).Figure 2Effects of PTX on cell spreading induced by LPA , platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor.NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in the absence (left) or presence (right) of 20 ng/ml PTX for 16 h, trypsinized, replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in the absence (none) or presence of 10 μm LPA, 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) and stained for F-actin after 60 min.Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine which subtypes of Rho family GTP-binding proteins contribute to cell spreading induced by LPA, we transfected plasmids with various Rho family mutants into NIH 3T3 cells. Cells expressing dominant negative mutants of Rac (RacT17N) and Cdc42 (Cdc42T17N) were rounded, whereas dominant negative Rho (RhoT19N) was without effect (Fig.3, A and B). On the other hand, constitutively active mutants of Rac (RacG12V) and Cdc42 (Cdc42G12V) enhanced spreading of PTX-treated cells (Fig. 3,A and C). In contrast, the expression of the constitutively active form of Rho (RhoG14V) rather caused rounding of both PTX-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 3). The LPA receptor activates not only Gi, but also other G proteins such as Gq/11 and G12/13, which are PTX-insensitive, and G12/13 is involved in Rho-dependent stress fiber formation (12Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Rho is also activated during spreading. In fact, transfection of a dominant negative mutant of Rho restored cell spreading when the cells were treated by PTX (Fig. 3 C). These observations suggest that the LPA receptor induces activation of Rac/Cdc42 and Rho through Gi and probably G12/13, respectively. Rho-mediated cell rounding appears with inhibition of Gipathway by PTX. To examine whether PTX indeed affected the activation of endogenous Rac and Cdc42 during cell spreading, we performed pull-down assays of Rac and Cdc42 using GST-Myc-CRIB-bound Sepharose beads. First, to confirm that GST-Myc-CRIB specifically binds to active forms of Rac and Cdc42 (29Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), GST-Myc-CRIB Sepharose beads were incubated with lysates from NIH 3T3 cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged mutants of Rho family GTP-binding proteins. GST-Myc-CRIB beads retained constitutively active forms of Rac and Cdc42 but not dominant negative forms of Rac and Cdc42, indicating a high specificity for the GTP-bound state. Neither constitutively active nor dominant negative mutants of Rho were retained by GST-Myc-CRIB beads, consistent with published data (29Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether Rac and Cdc42 were activated during LPA-stimulated cell spreading on fibronectin, cell lysates were incubated with GST-Myc-CRIB beads and the retained proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Rac and Cdc42 (Fig. 4,B and C). In the control cells, Rac activity was increased 1.9-fold (Fig. 4 B), and Cdc42 activity 1.7-fold (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, Rac and Cdc42 activities did not significantly increase within 120 min in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 4,B and C). These results also indicate that Rac and Cdc42 activation is mediated by the Gi pathway during LPA-induced cell spreading. To examine further the involvement of Rac and Cdc42 activation in LPA-induced cell spreading, we transfected Myc-CRIB into NIH 3T3 cells and replated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in the presence of LPA. Expression of Myc-CRIB strongly inhibited cell spreading (control, 1592 ± 156 μm2; Myc-CRIB, 461 ± 43 μm2). Next we determined which G protein subunit, Gα or Gβγ, is responsible for cell spreading. First we transfected plasmids with several constitutively active mutants of α subunits of G proteins and tested the restoration of spreading of PTX-treated cells in the presence of LPA (Fig. 5 B). Constitutively active mutants of Gαi2(Gαi2Q205L) and unexpectedly Gα11(Gα11Q209L) restored cell spreading to the levels observed in Mock cells in the absence of PTX. Other active mutants, Gα12 and Gαs (Gα12Q229L and GαsQ227L), were not effective in PTX-treated cells (Fig.5 B). These active mutants, however, decreased cell spreading in the absence of PTX (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that Gα12 and Gαs cause cell rounding in these conditions. Then, we cotransfected Gβ1 with various Gγ forms into NIH 3T3 cells. Gβγ expression also restored spreading of PTX-treated cells (Fig. 6). To further test its involvement, we transfected βARKct, which binds and sequesters free Gβγ, and showed this to reduce the LPA-induced cell spreading (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effects of expression of βγ subunits and βARKct on cell spreading. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-C3 and pCMV5 (Mock), Gβ1γ2, Gβ1γ12, Gβ1γ12S2A, or βARKct, incubated in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml PTX for 16 h, trypsinized, and replated on fibronectin-coated dishes or coverslips in the presence of 10 μm LPA. After 60 min, GFP-positive cells were fixed and quantified for spreading. Lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against Gβ, Gγ7 (γ), phospho-Gγ12 (p-γ12), and Myc. Because the antibody against Gγ7 reacts with Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ7 and Gγ12 (22Asano T. Morishita R. Ohashi K. Nagahama M. Miyake T. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it was used to detect Gγ2 and Gγ12 together.

Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 6. We have also demonstrated that phosphorylation of Gγ12enhances migration of NIH 3T3 cells (16Ueda H. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12124-12128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Expression of Gβ1γ12 was more effective at inducing cell spreading than that of Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1 with the mutant Gγ12S2A, in which a phosphorylation site is replaced with alanine (Fig. 6). To examine whether phosphorylation of Gγ12 by PKC is involved in cell spreading, we tested the effect of the PKC inhibitor BIM (30Yeo E.J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). It significantly decreased cell spreading induced by Gβ1γ12 as well as phosphorylation of Gγ12, while being essentially without effect on Gβ1γ2-induced cell spreading. It should be note that Gβ1γ12-induced cell spreading in the presence of BIM is comparable to Gβ1γ2-induced cell spreading. In PTX-untreated Mock cells, BIM suppressed LPA-induced cell spreading and phosphorylation of Gγ12. Gq/11 is known to stimulate phospholipase C, which produces diacylglycerol, then activates PKC. Expression of Gα11Q209L increased phosphorylation of Gγ12 in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 7), and the treatment with BIM diminished cell spreading induced by Gα11Q209L, but not by Gαi2Q205L (Fig. 7). Thus PKC-dependent phosphorylated Gγ12 may partially contribute to Gα11Q209L-induced cell spreading. To examine whether cell spreading with Gαi2Q205L, Gα11Q209L, and Gβγ is mediated through Rac and Cdc42 pathways, we cotransfected dominant negative mutants of Rac and Cdc42 with Gαi2Q205L, Gα11Q209L, and Gβγ into cells (Fig. 8). The dominant negative mutant of Rac inhibited cell spreading induced by Gαi2Q205L, Gα11Q209L, and Gβγ. However, the dominant negative form of Cdc42 appeared to be less effective, especially with Gα11Q209L-induced cell spreading. It has been reported that PTX blocks cell growth and migration induced by LPA (1Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 31Sakai T. de la Pena J.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15480-15486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that Gi mediates LPA-induced cell spreading, one of important steps of growth and migration processes. LPA receptor is coupled not only with Gi but also with Gq and G12 family G proteins. Gα12 and Gα13, which activate Rho, induce the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (12Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 13Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The present investigation indicated that Gi activates Rac and Cdc42 during cell spreading stimulated by LPA. The evidence that the dominant negative mutant of Rho enhanced spreading of PTX-treated cells (Fig.3 C) suggests that this signal protein is also activated with LPA stimulation. Previous reports indicated that Rac down-regulates Rho activity in NIH 3T3 cells (32Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), or Rac may counteract Rho (33Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In the latter case, PAK, which is activated by Rac and Cdc42, was found to block the phosphorylation of myosin light chain induced by Rho. Renet al. (7Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) have described that plating Swiss 3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated dishes elicits a transient inhibition of Rho, followed by an activation phase, suggesting the existence of an adhesion-dependent negative feedback loop. In addition, cell rounding observed by expression of Gα12Q229L (Fig.5 A) suggests that Gα12-mediated Rho activation caused cell rounding in these conditions. Taken together, the available information indicates that activation of Rac and Cdc42 by Gi promotes cell spreading and probably interferes with Rho-mediated cell rounding in LPA-stimulated cells (Fig.9). On the other hand, it has been shown that Rac, Cdc42, and Rho were activated during cell spreading on fibronectin (5Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 6Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 7Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), and cells also tend to spread probably due to the down-regulation of Rho by Rac activation (Fig. 9). The degree of spreading may be determined by a balance between Rac/Cdc42 activation and Rho activation. The evidence that blockage of Gi by PTX leads to cell rounding on fibronectin in the presence of LPA suggests that activation of Rho by G12/13 and fibronectin is much larger than activation of Rac/Cdc42 by fibronectin (Fig. 9). This scheme explains the apparently paradoxical result (Fig. 2) that spreading occurs equally on fibronectin in the presence or absence of LPA, but is inhibited by PTX only in the presence of LPA. It has been shown that Gαi and Gβγ released from Gi by receptor stimulation regulate adenylyl cyclase and potassium channels (34Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that they both contribute to LPA-induced cell spreading. The fact that expression of βARKct partially inhibited cell spreading (Fig. 6) supported an involvement of Gαi in addition to Gβγ. We have demonstrated previously that cotransfection of Gβ1 with various Gγ forms into NIH 3T3 cells increases cell migration (16Ueda H. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12124-12128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell motility of Gγ12-expressing cells was much greater than those of Gγ2-, Gγ5-, and Gγ7-expressed cells. Because the effect of Gγ12 was decreased by replacement of Ser2 by alanine, we concluded that protein phosphorylation enhances cell migration (16Ueda H. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Morishita R. Kaziro Y. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12124-12128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated Gβ1γ12 to be more efficient at stimulating cell spreading than Gβ1γ2 or Gβ1γ12S2A, consistent with results obtained for Gβγ-induced motility. In addition to Gαi2Q205L, the expression of Gα11Q209L restored cell spreading in PTX-treated cells (Fig. 5, 7, and 8). Since this was partially blocked by an PKC inhibitor, the existence of PKC-dependent and -independent pathways in Gα11-induced cell spreading can be speculated. Phosphorylation of Gγ12 in Gα11Q209L-expressing cells points to an involvement in a PKC-dependent pathway. Although PTX-insensitive Gq family G proteins would be expected to be activated by LPA in PTX-treated cells, cell spreading did not occur. The physiological significance of Gα11-induced cell spreading remains uncertain. A previous study demonstrated that increase of intracellular cAMP contents by forskolin or a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor blocked LPA-induced cell spreading and migration of carcinoma cells (35O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). High levels of intracellular cAMP induced by forskolin also block chemotaxis of human embryonic kidney cells expressing the interleukin-8 receptor (36Neptune E.R. Iiri T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and Gαi and Gβγ inhibit several types of adenylyl cyclase (34Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). It has, furthermore, been reported that LPA decreases cAMP levels in Swiss 3T3 cells in a PTX-sensitive manner (8van Corven E.J. Groenink A. Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Therefore, suppression of cAMP levels by Gi may be important in LPA-induced cell spreading. In fact, the expression of the constitutively active mutant GαsQ227L decreased cell spreading (Fig. 5 A). Small GTP-binding proteins are regulated by GEF and GTPase-activating proteins (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 37Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Gα13 but not Gα12 stimulates the GDP-GTP exchange reaction of p115-RhoGEF. Gβγ may also be associated with the NH2-terminal of Dbl, a kind of RhoGEF (41Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but its GEF activity toward Rho is not influenced by Gβγ binding. With respect to GTPase-activating proteins, Gαi specifically binds to that for Rap1, a member of the Ras family. Stimulation of the Gi-coupled m2-muscarinic receptor translocates rap1GAPII from cytosol to the membrane and decreases the amount of GTP-bound Rap1 (42Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our finding that Gαi and Gβγ induce cell spreading in a Rac/Cdc42-dependent manner suggests the existence of GEF or GTPase-activating proteins, which directly interact with Gαi or Gβγ subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2117141439,"The abnormal accumulation of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been implicated as an early and critical event in the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds that reduce Abeta accumulation may therefore be useful therapeutically. In cell-based screens we detected a significant reduction in Abeta concentration after treatment with the phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. To determine the effect of this class of compounds on in vivo Abeta accumulation, we administered wortmannin to the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Oral administration of wortmannin over four months resulted in a significant, non-overlapping 40%-50% reduction in the number of senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Sandwich ELISA analysis of formic acid extractable Abeta in the brain of treated animals indicates that both Abeta40 and the longer, more amyloidogenic form of the peptide, Abeta42, were significantly reduced. These data provide the first direct evidence that compounds identified by their ability to reduce Abeta concentration in vitro can reduce Abeta accumulation and deposition in the brain, thus establishing a basic paradigm for the identification and evaluation of additional compounds that lower Abeta accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2096755059,"In 1998 we reported that an L-peptide derived from H1 of c-Myc (Int-H1-S6A,F8A), linked to an internalization sequence from the third a-helix of Antennapedia, was endowed with an antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity toward a human mammary cancer cell line: The activity apparently depends upon the presence of the Myc motif. In the present work we have added new dimensions to our original findings. It is known that short retro-inverso (RI-) peptides can assume a 3D conformation very close to their corresponding L-forms and can be recognized by the same monoclonal antibody. We synthesized a RI-peptide form of our original L-peptide: It was much more resistant to serum peptidases than the original molecule (a half life of days rather than hours); in addition, the RI-form of the original Antennapedia internalization sequence was perfectly capable of carrying a D-peptide into human cells. We have studied three different potentially active peptides. L-peptides: Int-H1wt, Int-H1-S6A,F8A. D-peptides: RI-Int -H1-S6A,F8A. We have also studied three presumed control peptides: Int and RI-Int (no H1 motif), H1-S6A,F8A (no internalization sequence). Both 'active' and 'control' peptides have essentially confirmed our expectations, however, in cells treated with the higher concentration (10 mM) of the control peptide RI-Int, non-Myc related side effects could be detected. In order to investigate whether the antiproliferative activities displayed by some of our molecules were indeed related to an interference with the role of c-Myc (and molecules of the family), we chose an iso-amphipathic modified peptide of the H1 motif, with a proximity coefficient >50% and where the major change was at position 7 (F-->A). From a family of 73 H1 motifs belonging to (H1-Loop-H2) hu man sequences, the smallest evolutionary distance from our reference peptide was observed for the H1 of N-Myc, L-Myc, c-Myc, H1-S6A,F8A of c-Myc, and Max, in that order. Our reference peptide was therefore appropriate as a check of whether we were indeed observing activities related to Myc functions. Both Int-H1isoamph and the corresponding RI-Int-H1isoamph peptide were synthesized and studied. In terms of biological targets, we added to the human mammary cancer line of our previous work (MCF-7 cells) a colon cancer line (HCT-116 cells) and also a system of normal cells: human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) stimulated with phytohemoagglutinin (PHA). Peptides carrying an iso-amphipathic-modified H1 sequence were always very clearly (3-10 times) less active than the corresponding peptides carrying a conserved ""H1 of Myc"" motif. This finding was noted in five independent situations (all the cellular models considered at the present time): MCF-7 cells treated with L-peptides; MCF-7 cells treated with RI-peptides; HCT-116 cells treated with L-peptides; PBLs treated with L-peptides; PBLs treated with RI-peptides. Modulation of transcription levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), p53, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), in PBLs treated with our different molecules, was well compatible with an interference by our active peptides at the level of Myc transcriptional activity. We had already reported a similar observation in MCF-7 cells. On a molar basis, RI-peptides were about 5-10 times more potent and 30-35 times more stable in complete culture medium, than their corresponding L-forms. RI-Int can probably internalize longer peptido-mimetic molecules (for instance molecules mimetic of (H1-Loop-H2), or even more. These possibilities open the way to rodent studies and to more potent/selective Myc inhibitors-two steps closer to a potential drug."
https://openalex.org/W2171240656,"On the basis of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, an octadecapeptide was isolated from the skin extract of the Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens). This peptide was purified to homogeneity using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and found to have the following primary structure by Edman degradation and pyridylethylation: LVRGCWTKSYPPKPCFVR, in which Cys(5) and Cys(15) are disulfide bridged. The peptide was named peptide leucine-arginine (pLR), reflecting the N- and C-terminal residues. Molecular modeling predicted that pLR possessed a rigid tertiary loop structure with flexible end regions. pLR was synthesized and elicited rapid, noncytolytic histamine release that had a 2-fold greater potency when compared with one of the most active histamine-liberating peptides, namely melittin. pLR was able to permeabilize negatively charged unilamellar lipid vesicles but not neutral vesicles, a finding that was consistent with its nonhemolytic action. pLR inhibited the early development of granulocyte macrophage colonies from bone marrow stem cells but did not induce apoptosis of the end stage granulocytes, i.e. mature neutrophils. pLR therefore displays biological activity with both granulopoietic progenitor cells and mast cells and thus represents a novel bioactive peptide from frog skin."

Inhibition depends on an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) that is phosphorylated upon FcγRIIB coaggregation with ITAM-bearing receptors and recruits SH2 domain-containing phosphatases. Agarose bead-coated phosphorylated ITIM peptides (pITIMs) bind in vitro the single-SH2 inositol 5-phosphatases (SHIP1 and SHIP2) and the two-SH2 protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHP-1 and SHP-2). Phosphorylated FcγRIIB, however, recruit selectively SHIP1/2 in vivo. We aimed here at explaining this discordance. We found that beads coated with low amounts of pITIM bound in vitro SHIP1, but not SHP-1, i.e. behaved as phosphorylated FcγRIIB in vivo. The reason is that SHP-1 requires its two SH2 domains to bind on adjacent pITIMs. Consequently, the binding of SHP-1, but not of SHIP1, increased with pITIM density on beads. When trying to increase FcγRIIB phosphorylation in B cells and mast cells, we found that concentrations of ligands optimal for FcγRIIB phosphorylation failed to induce SHP-1 recruitment. SHP-1 was, however, recruited by FcγRIIB when hyperphosphorylated following cell treatment with pervanadate.

All murine and human FcγRIIB isoforms were shown to negatively regulate cell activation induced by all receptors bearing intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)1 (2Daëron M.

FcγRIIB isoforms contain a variable number of tyrosine residues in their intracytoplasmic domain, one of which proved to be critical (2Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S.

Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) for inhibition. Related sequences subsequently found in a large number of transmembrane molecules with negative regulatory properties provided the molecular basis for the definition of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) having the (I/V/L)xYxxL consensus sequence (16Burshtyn D.N.

Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).A general property of ITIMs is to have an affinity for cytoplasmic SH2 domain-containing phosphatases when tyrosyl- phosphorylated (17Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Phosphatases that are recruited to the membrane antagonize with activation signals transduced by ITAM-bearing receptors. ITIM-bearing receptors were found to recruit two classes of phosphatases which exert markedly different effects: protein-tyrosine phosphatases and inositol 5-phosphatases. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases are SHP-1 and SHP-2. They have two SH2 domains and their substrates are tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins (18Tamir I. Dal Porto J.M. Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is thought to dephosphorylate tyrosines in ITAMs (19Binstadt B.A. Brumbaugh K.M. Dick C.J. Scharenberg A.M. Williams B.L. Colonna M. Lanier L.L. Kinet J.-P. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. Immunity. 1996; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), protein tyrosine kinases and/or adapter proteins such as SLP-76 (20Binstadt B.A. Billadeau D.D. Jevremovic D. Williams B.L. Fang N. Yi T. Koretsky G.A. Abraham R.T. Leibson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27518-27523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) whose phosphorylation is critical for activation signals. SHP-1 thus stops the initial steps of transduction. The possible role of SHP-2 is not clear, as both positive and negative effects have been assigned to this phosphatase. Inositol 5-phosphatases are SHIP1 and SHIP2. They have a single SH2 domain and they remove 5′-phosphate groups in inositol phosphates and phosphatidylinositol phosphates that are 3′-phosphorylated (21Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). The preferred substrate of SHIP1 is phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate which enables the membrane translocation of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase via its pleckstrin homology domain (22Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Bruton's tyrosine kinase is mandatory for phospholipase Cγ to be activated and to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, which induces a Ca2+ response (23Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C. SHIP1 was recently shown to inhibit the Ras pathway by acting as an adapter molecule in B cells. When phosphorylated by Lyn, SHIP1 recruits Dok by its protein tyrosine-binding domain. Dok is phosphorylated and recruits RasGAP which inactivates Ras by exchanging GTP for GDP on the latter molecule (24Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). SHIP1 therefore arrests the propagation of intracellular signals leading to the Ca2+ response and to the activation of the Ras pathway. The possible role of SHIP2 is not yet known.The in vitro binding specificity of ITIMs was analyzed using phosphorylated synthetic peptides to precipitate phosphatases from cell lysates. Under these conditions, all known ITIMs, including the FcγRIIB ITIM, bound SHP-1 and SHP-2 (25Daëron M. Vivier E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 244: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the FcγRIIB ITIM also bound SHIP1 (26Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) and SHIP2 (27Muraille E. Bruhns P. Pesesse X. Daëron M. Erneux C. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 72: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We previously identified two hydrophobic residues, at positions Y-2 and Y+2, that determine the binding of SHPs (28Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron M. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and SHIPs (29Bruhns P. Vély F. Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daëron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 37357-37664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar), respectively. The in vivo recruitment of phosphatases by ITIM-bearing receptors was analyzed by co-precipitation, following their tyrosyl phosphorylation upon coaggregation with ITAM-bearing receptors. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated FcγRIIB were initially reported to recruit SHP-1 in B cells following their coaggregation with B cell receptors (BCR) (30D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.H. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 31Sato K. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIB, however, were found to recruit selectively SHIP1, when coaggregated with high-affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI) in mast cells (26Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V.

Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SHIP1, but not SHP-1, was subsequently demonstrated to be necessary for FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of cell activation in SHIP1-deficient DT40 B cells (33Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and in SHP-1-deficient mast cells derived from motheaten mice (26Ono M. Bolland S.

Depending on the answer, the following two issues may be addressed: 1) if they do, do they recruit SHP-1 exclusively in B cells or also in other cell types, and 2) if they do not, how can one reconcile the apparent discordance between thein vitro binding of phosphatases to ITIM peptides and thein vivo recruitment of phosphatases by FcγRIIB.In the present work, we aimed at clarifying these questions by analyzing the conditions required for SHP-1 to bind to phosphorylated ITIM-coated beads in vitro and to be recruited by phosphorylated FcγRIIB in mast cells and in B cells. We failed to detect SHP-1 recruitment by FcγRIIB in vivo when coaggregated either with FcεRI in mast cells, or with BCR in B cells. We found that the in vitro binding of SHP-1 required a higher level of FcγRIIB phosphorylation than SHIP1 binding. Indeed, the two SH2 domains of SHP-1 were required to bind phosphorylated ITIMs and, as a consequence, SHP-1 binding, but not SHIP1 binding, depended on the density of phosphorylated ITIMs. In vivo, SHP-1 recruitment also required a higher level of FcγRIIB phosphorylation than SHIP1 recruitment. The level of FcγRIIB phosphorylation that enabled the recruitment of SHP-1 was reached after treating cells with pervanadate, but not following coaggregation of FcγRIIB with BCR or FcεRI, in B cells and mast cells, respectively.DISCUSSIONWe show here that murine FcγRIIB recruit the inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP1, but not the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1in vivo, although the FcγRIIB ITIM has an affinity for both phosphatases in vitro, because the binding of SHP-1 requires a higher degree of FcγRIIB phosphorylation than the binding of SHIP1. The same phosphorylation-dependent preference for SHIP1 was observed 1) in vitro using beads coated with suboptimal concentrations of pITIM, 2) in vitro using GST-ICIIB1′ phosphorylated by Lyn for short periods of time, 3)in vivo using phosphorylated FcγRIIB precipitated from cells treated with low concentrations of pervanadate, and 4) in vivo, when FcγRIIB was phosphorylated following coaggregation with BCR or FcεRI, in B cells and in mast cells, respectively. Our results suggest that, depending on their level of phosphorylation, FcγRIIB could potentially use the two phosphatases, with different consequences.Evidence that, when tyrosyl phosphorylated, the FcγRIIB ITIM has an affinity for SH2 domain-containing phosphatases was first provided in 1995 by D'Ambrosio et al. (30D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.H. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C.

Other molecules precipitated by these peptides were subsequently shown to be SHP-2 (28Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron M. Vivier E. Eur. J.

Similar experiments confirmed D'Ambrosio's results (28Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron M. Vivier E. Eur. J.

SHIP2, a second SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase was recently found to bind also to phosphorylated FcγRIIB ITIM (27Muraille E. Bruhns P. Pesesse X. Daëron M. Erneux C. Immunol.

It follows that phosphorylated FcγRIIB ITIM peptides can bind all four known SH2 domain-containing phosphatases in vitro.In the same 1995 paper, D'Ambrosio et al. (30D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.H.

In 1996, Ono et al. (26Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) reported that SHIP1 co-precipitated with FcγRIIB following coaggregation with FcεRI in BMMCs or with BCR in A20 cells, and that FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of IgE-induced serotonin release was unaffected in BMMCs derived from motheaten mice. Fonget al. (32Fong D.C. Malbec O. Arock M. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that SHIP1, but not SHP-1 or SHP-2, co-precipitated with FcγRIIB following coaggregation with FcεRI in BMMCs. In 1997, Ono et al. (33Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) showed that FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of Ca2+responses and of NF-AT activity was abolished in SHIP1-deficient, but not in SHP-1-deficient, DT40 chicken B cells, and that SHIP1, but not SHP-1, was detectably co-precipitated with FcγRIIB following coaggregation with BCR in A20 cells. In 1998, however, Sato et al. (31Sato K. Ochi A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar) observed the co-precipitation of both SHIP1 and SHP-1 with FcγRIIB in A20 cells expressing an anti-TNP BCR following coaggregation with intact anti-idiotypic antibodies. Contrasting with the consensus that FcγRIIB recruit SHIP1 both in B cells and in mast cells, their ability to recruit SHP-1 in vivo therefore remains controversial.That SHP-1 was found by two groups to co-precipitate with FcγRIIB in B cells, but not in mast cells, suggested the possibility that some discrepancies might be accounted for by a cell type-specific differential in vivo recruitment. To address this issue, we examined the co-precipitation of SHP-1 with recombinant FcγRIIB1 stably expressed by transfecting the same cDNA into the rat mast cells RBL-2H3, and into the two FcγRIIB-deficient mouse lymphoma B cells IIA1.6 and K46μ. The coaggregation of FcγRIIB1 with FcεRI or with BCR induced a comparable tyrosyl phosphorylation of FcγRIIB1 and the co-precipitation of SHIP1, but not of SHP-1, in all three cells. The same result, observed at 5 min in the three cell lines, was also observed between 15 s and 15 min in RBL cells. Failure to detect SHP-1 co-precipitation cannot be accounted for an insufficient sensitivity of Western blotting because traces of SHP-1 could be seen on overexposed films, but in equal amounts in unstimulated and in stimulated cells (data not shown). Due to experimental conditions inherent to the co-precipitation technique, however, we cannot exclude that SHP-1, possibly recruited by FcγRIIB in vivo was lost. Whatever the explanation, we observed no difference between the three cells examined in which FcγRIIB preferentially, if not exclusively, recruited SHIP1. There is therefore a discrepancy between the ability of SHP-1 and SHIP1 to bind in vitro to FcγRIIB pITIM peptides and to co-precipitate with phosphorylated FcγRIIBin vivo.Due to the different experimental conditions used for the two assay systems many differences can possibly explain this discrepancy. One difference could bear on the level of ITIM phosphorylation. Indeed, all ITIMs are phosphorylated on beads used for in vitro binding assay whereas an unknown proportion of FcγRIIB are phosphorylated following coaggregation with ITAM-bearing receptors. To explore the possible role of quantitative differences in ITIM phosphorylation, we studied the binding of SHIP1 and SHP-1 to beads coated with FcγRIIB ITIMs phosphorylated in varying proportions and incubated in a cell lysate. We found that SHP-1 binding decreased more sharply with the proportion of pITIM than SHIP1 binding, so that beads coated with 12% pITIM bound selectively SHIP1. Comparable results were obtained when incubating beads coated with increasing concentrations of pITIM with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of SHIP1 or the two SH2 domains of SHP-1. The use of SH2 domains permitted comparison between the binding of the two molecules using the same anti-GST antibodies for blotting. It also excluded that phosphatase binding was mediated by unknown intermediates present in cell lysates. Supporting these results, the FcγRIIB pITIM was reported to have a higher affinity for the SH2 domain of SHIP1 than for the two SH2 domains of SHP-1, when measured by Biacore analysis (43Famiglietti S. Nakamura K. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Results obtained in these two sets of experiments are reminiscent of the selective in vivorecruitment of SHIP1 by FcγRIIB.Based on data previously reported by others (43Famiglietti S. Nakamura K. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 44Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the binding of SHP-1 is likely to involve the two tandem SH2 domains of this phosphatase. Compared with GST fusion proteins containing the two SH2 domains of SHP-1, no GST fusion proteins containing the N-terminal domain of SHP-1 and minute amounts of GST fusion proteins containing the C-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 bound to pITIM-coated beads, whatever the concentration of peptides on beads. This suggests that, since there is one tyrosine only in pITIM, GST fusion proteins containing the two SHP-1 SH2 domains bound to adjacent pITIMs on the same bead. The same holds for the binding of SHP-1 when incubating pITIM-coated beads with a cell lysate. If so, variations in the affinity of SHP-1 to beads coated with increasing amounts of pITIM might depend on the density of peptides coated to beads. To examine this possibility, we used a constant amount of pITIM to coat variable numbers of beads that were incubated in a cell lysate, and we compared the ability of these beads to bind SHIP1 and SHP-1. The binding of SHIP1 was proportional to the amount of pITIM on beads, and did not vary with the pITIM density. By contrast, the binding of SHP-1 depended not only on the amount of pITIM but also, critically, on the density of pITIM bound to beads. The in vitro binding of SHP-1 therefore requires a cooperative binding of its two SH2 domains to two adjacent pITIMs in trans, and this feature explains that pITIMs need to be closer to each other for enabling the binding of SHP-1 than for enabling the binding of SHIP1.Another difference that might explain the discrepancy between thein vitro binding and the in vivo recruitment of SHP-1 is that isolated ITIMs are used in vitro whereas whole receptors are used in vivo. One cannot exclude that the recruitment of SHP-1 might be hampered by non-ITIM sequences or by molecules that could possibly bind to these sequences. Supporting this possibility, the N-terminal KIR2DL3 ITIM that could recruit SHP-2in vivo, when kept in its original context, failed to recruit this phosphatase, when transposed in the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB1 (29Bruhns P. Vély F. Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Vivier E. Daëron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 37357-37664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To answer this question, we compared the ability of GST fusion proteins containing the FcγRIIB ITIM only or the whole intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB1′ to bind SHIP1 and SHP-1, when incubated with a cell lysate, following their phosphorylation with Lyn for various periods of time. No difference was observed between the two fusion proteins and, like the isolated ITIM, the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB could bind SHP-1 when high enough phosphorylated.Based on the latter result, we searched for experimental conditions that would induce a FcγRIIB phosphorylation sufficient to enable them to recruit SHP-1 in vivo. To this aim, we used several extracellular ligands including IgG immune complexes that are the physiological ligands of FcγRIIB, at various concentrations, in mast cells and in B cells. We found that indeed, the phosphorylation of FcγRIIB varied with the concentrations of antigen and antibody in immune complexes but that ligands which induced a maximal phosphorylation of FcγRIIB readily induced the recruitment of SHIP1 but failed to induce a detectable recruitment of SHP-1. Based on our results of in vitro binding with pITIM-coated beads, this suggests that a small proportion (less than 12%?) of FcγRIIB become tyrosyl phosphorylated in vivo upon coaggregation with ITAM-bearing receptors by physiological ligands. If so, we wondered whether FcγRIIB phosphorylation would reach a level high enough to enable the recruitment of SHP-1 following treatment of cells with pervanadate.In both mast cells and B cells, pervanadate treatment indeed induced a higher degree of FcγRIIB phosphorylation than coaggregation with FcεRI or BCR, respectively, and under these conditions, not only SHIP1 but also SHP-1 co-precipitated with phosphorylated FcγRIIB. This observation indicates that, in resting cells, FcγRIIB are tyrosyl phosphorylated but that protein-tyrosine phosphatases maintain this phosphorylation below the detection level. This implies that FcγRIIB are the substrates of both protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and that, under resting conditions, the effect of phosphatases is dominant over that of kinases. FcγRIIB phosphorylation observed following their coaggregation with ITAM-bearing receptors results from the additional effect of a Src kinase, brought by activating receptors (13Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J., C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1647-1658PubMed Google Scholar), leading to a displacement of the balance so that the effect of kinases becomes dominant over that of phosphatases. It should be emphasized that the higher intensity of FcγRIIB phosphorylation induced by pervanadate, compared with phosphorylation induced by coaggregation, may be due to the phosphorylation of a higher number of receptors and/or to the phosphorylation of a higher number of tyrosine residues in each receptor. The recruitment of SHP-1 by FcγRIIB phosphorylated after pervanadate treatment may indeed simply be explained by a quantitatively different phosphorylation, resulting in an increased density of phosphorylated ITIMs that might permit the binding intrans of the two SHP-1 SH2 domains. Supporting this interpretation, the recruitment of SHP-1 was lost before that of SHIP1 when pervanadate-induced FcγRIIB phosphorylation decreased following treatment of cells with decreasing concentrations of pervanadate. Alternatively, the recruitment of SHP-1 after pervanadate treatment may"

Shiraishi T. Asada K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Takahashi Y. Nakane H. Kojima H. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 273-280Google Scholar) or Ala↓Ser (15Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The interaction between enzyme and substrate is rather complicated in this system in terms of topographical organization. The substrate is a hydrophobic membrane-spanning protein integrated into the thylakoid (2Satoh K. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 193-211Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme is a soluble protein loosely attached to the internal membrane surface (8Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Fujita S. Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between the enzyme and its protein substrate is substantially restricted by the integration of components compared with the conventional proteolytic system in cytosolic solution. In previous studies, we analyzed the mechanism of the C-terminal processing of pD1 by utilizing partially purified protease from spinach chloroplasts and two types of substrate in solution: 1) synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of pD1 (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and 2) in vitro transcribed/translated full-length pD1 (18Fujita S. Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar). An unexpected finding from these studies was that the proteolytic activity exhibited a strong pH dependence, with an optimum in the pH range of 7.5–8.0. 3Y. Yamamoto and K. Satoh, unpublished data. 3Y. Yamamoto and K. Satoh, unpublished data. Activity was quite low on the acidic side at pH 5.0–6.0, conditions that mimic the pH of the luminal space in the illuminated thylakoid, where the rate of C-terminal processing is expected to be extremely high under physiological conditions. In addition, the affinity of the protease for the substrate seemed to be too low to account for the expectedly high turnover rate (reviewed in Ref. 29Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Senger H. The Chloroplast: From Molecular Biology to BioTechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 271-276Google Scholar). This study was intended to further characterize the enzyme and to resolve these inconsistencies in pH dependence and affinity between thein vitro and in vivo systems, with the overall aim of understanding the mechanism of proteolytic processing of pD1 under physiological conditions. For the analysis, we utilized pD1 in the PSII complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts obtained from the LF-1 mutant of Scenedesmus obliquus (12Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol.

For the purpose of enzymatic analysis, we have successfully developed an overexpression system for spinach CtpA inE. coli. By adjusting the temperature of IPTG induction, we have been able to obtain substantial amounts of processing enzyme in its active state. The results of analyses using these materials demonstrate that the mode of enzyme-substrate interaction in the C-terminal processing is largely modified by integrating the substrate into the thylakoid membrane. This suggests the presence of a specific molecular interaction(s) between a component(s) on the membrane surface and the soluble enzyme in the luminal space. The competent BL21(DE3) strain ofE. coli was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The wild strain and the LF-1 mutant (12Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of S. obliquus were gifts from Dr. N. I. Bishop (Oregon State University).Scenedesmus cells were heterotrophically grown at 25 °C in the dark in NGY liquid medium (30Bishop N.I. Senger H. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 53-66Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A pair of polymerase chain reaction primers whose sequences are GTCTCTCGAGCTTTCTGAGGAGAATCGAAT (forward primer) and ATCGCTCGAGTCATCTTGAAAAGAGTTGTACGCC (reverse primer) were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Model 394, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). These primers were designed for amplification of a gene fragment encoding the mature part of spinach CtpA protease, corresponding to the segment from Leu151 to the stop codon at position 540 (8Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). They have an external XhoI site at each 5′ terminus for ligation into the expression vector pET-15b(+) (Novagen), which is underlined in the sequences above. In our expression strategy, the initiation codon, the N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and the subsequent epitope for thrombin cleavage encoded on pET-15b(+) were utilized (Fig. 1). Therefore, the XhoI site on the forward primer was arranged such that the desired reading frame was in accord with the strategy. The polymerase chain reaction products of ∼1,200 base pairs were digested by XhoI and ligated into the XhoI site of pET-15b(+). These plasmids were then introduced into competentE. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Transformants suited to our strategy with regard to the direction of insertion, which had been assessed by mapping of the restriction sites, were sent to the next selection. Finally, a clone, pET-CTPA, whose insert had no error during the polymerase chain reaction amplification as confirmed by conventional sequencing, was isolated and used in this work. The BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli carrying the expression plasmids for mature spinach CtpA was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at the desired temperature. Growth was monitored by measuring the turbidity of culture at 600 nm (A 600). When A 600 reached 0.4, the expression of the ctpA gene was induced by the addition of IPTG at 1 mm. The culture was further incubated until A 600 reached ∼0.8. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 0.1 culture volume of lysate buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 mm EDTA. After the addition of 0.01 volume of 10 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 volume of 1% Triton X-100, the cell suspension was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and sonicated at high output (Model 250 sonifier, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) for 20 s at 4 °C. The soluble and insoluble fractions of the extracts were separated by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The purification of overexpressed CtpA from E. coli was achieved by nickel-chelating affinity chromatography utilizing the His tag at its N terminus. In a typical experiment, 50 ml of soluble fraction fromE. coli cells grown at 20 °C was used as the starting material. To remove EDTA, which strips Ni2+ from the chelating column, the soluble fraction was dialyzed against starting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mmimidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl) prior to adsorption onto the column. After passing through a filter (0.45-μm pore size), the solution was loaded onto an AF-chelate TOYOPEARL 650M column (1 (inner diameter) × 6.5 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) that was nickel-immobilized and equilibrated with starting buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of starting buffer and 6 column volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl). CtpA was eluted from the column with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 m imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl). Purified CtpA was dialyzed against an appropriate buffer and stored at −20 °C until used. In a typical experiment, the reaction mixture (33 μl) contained 300 μm synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of spinach pD1 (S-19), 0.75 μg of purified CtpA, and 25 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.7 at 25 °C). After incubation for 1.5 h at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 18% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and then the mixture was kept at room temperature for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min to remove denatured proteins. To 35 μl of the resultant supernatant was added 145 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and then the mixture was passed through a filter (0.45-μm pore size). Peptides in 170 μl of filtrate were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PSII-enriched membrane was prepared from logarithmic growth phase cells of the LF-1 mutant ofScenedesmus, in which CtpA activity is deficient (10Trost J.T. Chisholm D.A. Jordan D.B. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20348-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), according to the modified method of Kuwabara and Murata (41Kuwabara T. Murata N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1982; 23: 533-539Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar) as described by Metz and Seibert (31Metz J.G. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The PSII-enriched membrane containing pD1 was utilized as the substrate for CtpA. The processing activity was visualized by detecting the molecular mass shift of pD1 to mature D1 protein (mD1) by Western blot analysis using antisera raised against the AB-loop sequence of spinach D1 protein. The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 10 μg of chlorophyll from PSII-enriched membrane from LF-1, overexpressed CtpA (1.25 μg of protein), and 40 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). The proteolytic reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min. After collecting the PSII-enriched membrane by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 3 min at 0 °C, the membrane was solubilized with the sample buffer for electrophoresis (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8 at 25 °C), 5% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), and then an aliquot of the extracts corresponding to 2.5 μg of chlorophyll from PSII-enriched membrane was subjected to SDS-PAGE with 15% acrylamide gel containing 6 m urea (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins separated on the acrylamide gel were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each D1 protein band on x-ray film was quantified with a densitometer (Personal Scanning Imager PD110, Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and the processing activity was expressed as the ratio of processed D1 to total D1. The amino acid sequences of peptides separated by SDS-PAGE or HPLC were determined with a pulse liquid-phase automatic peptide sequencer (Model 476A, Applied Biosystems). The sequencing of peptide bands separated by SDS-PAGE was as described in detail by Inagaki et al. (8Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lysyl endopeptidase and thrombin were purchased from Wako (Tokyo) and Novagen, respectively. Penem (allyl-(5S,6S,1′R)-6-(1′-acetoxyethyl)penem-3-carboxylate, SB214357) was a gift of SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Harlow, Essex, United Kingdom). The expression of the spinach ctpA gene in E. coli was attempted in this study to obtain the C-terminal processing protease for pD1 in its active state. The expression plasmid (termed pET-CTPA) carrying a fragment of the ctpA gene encoding the mature part under a promoter for T7 phage RNA polymerase was constructed with pET-15b(+) and then transferred into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli, which contains a gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression was induced by the addition of IPTG at 37, 30, or 20 °C (Fig.2). SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell proteins after the IPTG induction revealed distinct accumulation over time of a polypeptide with a mobility corresponding to ∼47 kDa at each temperature. Edman degradation analysis demonstrated that the 47-kDa protein has a GSSHHHHHHSSG sequence at the N terminus, indicating that an N-terminal fMet was removed (data not shown). Thus, judging from both the sequence and the estimated molecular mass, we concluded that the mature form of CtpA was expressed in E. coli, as designed. At 37 °C, a temperature commonly used for cultivating E. coli cells, practically all of the 47-kDa protein was recovered in the insoluble fraction after high speed centrifugation of cell extracts, and the supernatant fraction was thus totally inactive with respect to the C-terminal cleavage of pD1. (A polypeptide of 47 kDa observed in the SDS-PAGE profile for the soluble fraction was shown not to be CtpA by N-terminal amino acid sequencing.) On the other hand, at 30 and 20 °C, we detected a polypeptide band of ∼47 kDa with a His tag at the N terminus in the soluble fraction. By lowering the temperature of IPTG induction, the proportion of CtpA in the soluble fraction increased, whereas the overall amount of overexpressed CtpA in E. coli cells decreased on a protein basis. At 20 °C, CtpA in the soluble state was estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to correspond to 10–20% of that in the bacterial cells. CtpA in the soluble fraction was active with respect to the C-terminal cleavage of the synthetic pD1 oligopeptide at the correct site, as demonstrated by amino acid sequence analysis of the cleavage products, despite the presence of an additional 22-amino acid sequence at the N terminus. The purification of CtpA was achieved from the soluble fraction of cell extracts from E. coli grown at 20 °C by nickel-chelating affinity chromatography utilizing the His tag at the N terminus as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the purification process, most of the impurities were removed from the column with starting buffer or wash buffer (60 mmimidazole). CtpA was recovered almost at homogeneity in the fraction eluted by elution buffer (1 m imidazole) (Fig.3 A). After purification, the His tag at the N terminus was removed from CtpA by thrombin treatment (Fig. 3 B), although the presence of the His tag at the N terminus has no apparent effect on the enzymatic activity of CtpA, at least under the conditions examined, as mentioned above. In a typical experiment, we obtained ∼1 mg of CtpA from 50 ml of the soluble cell extract from E. coli. Purified CtpA was dialyzed against an appropriate buffer and stored at −20 °C until used. The enzymatic activity of CtpA was stable over a prolonged storage time. This may suggest that soluble CtpA expressed in E. coli, under the conditions described, is folded almost precisely. The properties of proteolytic action of purified CtpA expressed in E. coli for the C-terminal cleavage of pD1 were analyzed using a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of spinach pD1,i.e. from Asn-335 to Gly-353 in pD1, as the substrate, which has been studied in detail (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Fujita S. Inagaki N. Ono T. Inoue Y. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When the oligopeptide was incubated with the purified enzyme, two products with the sequences AIEAPSTNG and NAHNFPLDLA, corresponding to the C-terminal extension and the C terminus of mD1, respectively, were eluted from the reverse-phase HPLC column (Fig. 4, Ala trace), demonstrating that thrombin-treated spinach CtpA expressed in E. coli with an extra N-terminal 6 amino acids (i.e. GSHMLE) recognizes the substrate and cleaves it at the correct site, i.e. between Ala-344 and Ala-345. However, a relatively high K mvalue of ∼0.3 mm was estimated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot of the kinetic traces for overexpressed CtpA (Fig. 4,inset), as is the case for the native enzyme isolated from spinach chloroplasts (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The efficiency of C-terminal cleavage of several synthetic oligopeptides with a substitution at the cleavage site was also examined using the enzyme overexpressed in E. coli for comparison with and verification of the results obtained from the analysis using native spinach enzyme for the recognition mechanism (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the HPLC elution profiles for a series of oligopeptides with a substitution at the cleavage site (position +1, Ala-345). The replacement of Ala by Gly, Val, or Pro served to reduce the rate of proteolysis to ∼50, 30, and 0% of the control, respectively (Fig. 4), whereas replacement of Ala by Cys, Phe, or Ser did not affect the rate of cleavage (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation for the native enzyme in a previous analysis (25Taguchi F. Yamamoto Y. Satoh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10711-10716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Judging from the retention time of reaction products on the chromatogram, we concluded that CtpA expressed in E. coli cleaves the substituted oligopeptides at the normal site,i.e. after Ala-344. Thus, we also conclud"
https://openalex.org/W1973587398,"Using ribonucleotide reductase encoded by vaccinia virus as a model for the mammalian enzyme, our laboratory developed an assay that allows simultaneous monitoring of the reduction of ADP, CDP, GDP, and UDP. That study found ADP reduction to be specifically inhibited by ADP itself. To learn whether this effect is significant for cellular regulation, we have analyzed recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase. We report that allosteric control properties originally described in single-substrate assays operate also under our four-substrate assay conditions. Three distinctions from the vaccinia enzyme were seen: 1) higher sensitivity to allosteric modifiers; 2) higher activity with UDP as substrate; and 3) significant inhibition by ADP of GDP reduction as well as that of ADP itself. Studies of the effects of ADP and other substrates upon binding of effectors indicate that binding of ribonucleoside diphosphates at the catalytic site influences dNTP binding at the specificity site. We also examined the activities of hybrid ribonucleotide reductases, composed of a mouse subunit combined with a vaccinia subunit. As previously reported, a vaccinia R1/mouse R2 hybrid has low but significant activity. Surprisingly, a mouse R1/vaccinia R2 hybrid was more active than either mouse R1/R2 or vaccinia R1/R2, possibly explaining why mutations affecting vaccinia ribonucleotide reductase have only small effects upon viral DNA replication.

First, the interplay between two different allosteric sites evidently acts to ensure that the four deoxyribonucleotide products of the enzyme are synthesized at rates proportional to the base composition of the genome of the organism (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Because deoxyribonucleotides have no known functions in eukaryotic cells except as DNA precursors, it makes good metabolic sense for rates of synthesis and utilization to be balanced. Second and less thoroughly investigated, the four ribonucleotide substrates are reduced at one active site. To what extent does competition among the four ribonucleotide substrates for binding to this site contribute toward the ability of the enzyme to act in concert with the need of the cell for dNTPs? It was partly for this reason that our laboratory developed an assay protocol that allows all four RNR reactions to be monitored simultaneously, in one reaction mixture (2Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results, obtained with ribonucleotide reductases encoded by bacteriophage T4 (2Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and vaccinia virus (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) support the conclusion that ribonucleotide substrate concentrations are equal in importance to concentrations of nucleoside triphosphate effectors as determinants of the ability of the enzyme to produce its four products at rates proportional to the base composition of the genome. We have used the vaccinia virus enzyme as a model for mammalian ribonucleoside diphosphate reductases, because of its close structural relationship to the mammalian enzymes and because the viral enzyme subunits have been available in our laboratory for some time as purified recombinant proteins (4Slabaugh M.B. Davis R.E. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17803-17810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In applying the four-substrate assay to vaccinia virus RNR, we observed one striking phenomenon: a fairly strong and quite specific inhibition of the reduction of ADP by ADP itself (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We speculated that this effect might represent a metabolic control system that links the energy status of a cell with systems for DNA replication. Before carrying out experiments to test this hypothesis, it was essential to learn whether this effect is peculiar to the viral model system we were using or whether a mammalian ribonucleotide reductase behaves similarly. Within the past few years, cDNAs for the large (R1) and small (R2) subunits of the mouse RNR have become available (5Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, using recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase, we have now been able to ask whether ADP behaves similarly as an apparent regulator of enzyme activity. It was also of interest to confirm that the effects of allosteric modifiers, seen in vitro in analysis of single-substrate reactions, are similar when the enzyme is acting upon all four substrates simultaneously. Finally, we wished to extend our earlier observation (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that interspecific hybrid RNRs, formed by mixing mouse and vaccinia virus subunits, are enzymatically active. Like all known mammalian RNRs, the enzymes encoded by phage T4 and vaccinia virus are type I ribonucleotide reductases (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), which act upon ribonucleoside diphosphate (rNDP) substrates. Each enzyme is a heterotetramer containing the homodimeric R1 and R2 proteins. The R2 protein contains a catalytically essential tyrosine free radical formed and stabilized with the help of a nearby iron center consisting of two ferric ions bridged by an oxygen atom. The R1 protein contains the catalytic site and two allosteric sites: the activity site, which binds either ATP or dATP and regulates overall catalytic activity, and the specificity site, which binds either ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP and regulates specificity; for example, dTTP, when bound in the specificity site, activates the reduction of GDP and inhibits the reduction of both CDP and UDP. Mouse R1 and R2 cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), from plasmids developed in Lars Thelander's laboratory (Umeå, Sweden) (5Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E-I. Ingemarson R.

Induction and purification of mouse R1 protein were carried out as described (6Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R.

Also, elution of the protein from a dATP-Sepharose affinity column was carried out with column buffer containing 75 mm ATP, a condition that we had found earlier to be effective in purifying vaccinia virus R1 (4Slabaugh M.B. Davis R.E. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17803-17810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse R2 protein was induced and purified as described by Mann et al.

Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 μm mouse R1 protein, 4 μm R2 protein, and ribonucleoside diphosphate substrates and nucleoside triphosphate effectors at the indicated concentrations and in a total volume of 100 μl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5 μl of 50% (v/v) perchloric acid, and this was followed by chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture (2Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The pH value used for the assay reactions, 8.2, was based upon our earlier determination of the pH optima for RNRs of vaccinia virus and cultured BSC40 monkey kidney cells (8Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 501-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we ran the four-substrate assay with the mouse enzyme at pH 7.6 under our quasi-physiological conditions, we found the activity to be decreased by about 24% compared with the activity determined at pH 8.2 and the overall product profile to be substantially the same (data not shown). Nucleotide binding to mouse R1 protein was measured according to the ultrafiltration assay devised by Ormö and Sjöberg (9Ormö M. Sjöberg B-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For each assay a3H-labeled dNTP, with or without added unlabeled rNDPs, as indicated, was mixed with R1 in a solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 150 μl. After incubation on ice for 15 min, a 30-μl aliquot was taken for scintillation counting to quantitate total nucleotide concentration. The remainder (120 μl) was applied to a Nanosep centrifugal separator (Gelman; cut-off value, 30 kDa), and centrifugation at 6000 rpm was carried out for 2 min. Aliquots of 30 μl were then withdrawn from the filtrate for scintillation counting to quantitate unbound nucleotide. Concentrations of bound nucleotides were determined by subtracting unbound nucleotide from total nucleotide. Control reactions run in the absence of added protein showed that no significant amounts of nucleotide were bound nonspecifically to the filters; in these control reactions the counts in “unbound” nucleotide were virtually identical to counts in “total” nucleotide. With the exception of our preliminary studies on T4 and vaccinia virus ribonucleotide reductases, most of what we know about allosteric control of this crucially important enzyme has been learned from assay protocols in which the enzyme is exposed to only one substrate at a time. Within the cell, the enzyme is exposed to all four rNDP substrates. How might competition among these substrates influence the activities of individual allosteric effectors? Fig. 1 explores the effects of individual allosteric modifiers in the four-substrate assay, as well as illustrating the kind of data generated by this assay. As noted earlier (2Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we remove unreacted rNDP substrates and ATP from the reaction mixture by boronate column chromatography, and then the deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate products of the reactions are resolved by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. These profiles also include the individual dNTP effectors added, but not ATP, which is removed by the boronate column. In this experiment the four rNDP substrates were present initially at equal concentrations of 0.15 mm each. ATP was present at 2.5 mm, its approximate intracellular concentration, whereas each individual dNTP was present at 40 μm. At this level, dATP was expected to bind primarily to the specificity site and less significantly to the activity site. As shown by Eriksson et al. (10Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) for the calf thymus RNR, we found the mouse enzyme to be completely inactive in the absence of any added nucleoside triphosphate (data not shown). The data in Fig. 1 show that individual dNTPs have effects similar but not identical to those described for calf thymus (10Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and mouse (11Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) RNRs in single-substrate assays. dCTP had no significant effect on any of the four activities when results with ATP plus dCTP were compared with results seen when ATP was the only effector added. dTTP strongly activated reduction of GDP and ADP, while inhibiting CDP reduction. dGTP greatly stimulated ADP and GDP reduction, while inhibiting the reduction of both pyrimidine nucleotides. dTTP activated GDP reduction much more strongly than ADP reduction, whereas dGTP had the converse effect. The activation of ADP reduction by dTTP and the activation of GDP reduction by dGTP are effects not seen in single-substrate analysis of calf thymus RNR (10Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or recombinant mouse RNR (11Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). dATP slightly activated ADP reduction and strongly inhibited CDP and UDP reduction, whereas GDP reduction was undetectable. This suggests that dATP added at 40 μm does bind significantly to the activity site. In additional experiments (not shown), dATP was seen to inhibit all four activities at higher concentrations, as has been seen repeatedly in single-substrate assays. Numerical values are presented in Table I. These data show the mouse enzyme to be significantly more sensitive to individual allosteric effectors than vaccinia virus RNR, assayed under similar conditions (compare with Fig. 2 in Ref. 3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, the GDP reductase activity of the viral enzyme was approximately doubled by dTTP and halved by dATP. By contrast, the mouse GDP reductase activity was absolutely dependent upon added dTTP and was completely inhibited by added dATP at the concentration used. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of dGTP upon CDP and UDP reduction appeared to be stronger for the mouse than for the viral enzyme.Table IEffects of allosteric modifiers on activities of mouse ribonucleotide reductasedNTP effectorRate of product formationdCDPdUDPdADPdGDPnmol dNDP/min/mg R1 proteinNone108.011.12.4<0.1dCTP108.211.32.4<0.1dTTP31.810.913.378.4dATP7.6<0.15.1<0.1dGTP11.1<0.192.75.3Each reaction mixture contained ADP, CDP, GDP, and UDP at 0.15 mm each and ATP at 2.5 mm.

Each of the four activities was negligible when ATP was omitted from the reaction mixture. We presume that ribonucleotide reductase in vivo acts upon the four rNDP substrates at relative rates corresponding to the nucleotide composition of the genome. Mouse DNA contains 58% A + T and 42% G + C (12Shapiro H.S. Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1968: H-46Google Scholar). TableII presents enzyme product profiles for reactions run under various conditions. For these experiments, quasi-physiological or in vivo concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates were estimated from pool size determinations in our laboratory for a variety of cultured mammalian cell lines (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and quasi-physiological concentrations of rNDP substrates were estimated from nucleotide pool data compiled by Traut (13Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) for cultured mammalian cell lines. Traut estimated the following values for intracellular rNDP concentrations from averaged data from many studies of nonhuman cell lines: ADP, 849 μm; CDP, 71 μm; GDP, 159 μm; and UDP, 155 μm. We rounded off these values as follows for our quasi-physiological conditions: ADP, 850 μm; CDP, 70 μm; GDP, 160 μm; and UDP, 160 μm. Of course, these estimates could be quite inaccurate because of variation among different cell lines, compartmentation, variation of activity coefficients within the intracellular milieu, and so forth. Nevertheless, our data clearly establish the essentiality of allosteric modifiers for directing the enzyme to produce four deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates at rates corresponding to their rates of utilization.Table IIEffects of allosteric modifiers and substrate concentrations upon mouse ribonucleotide reductase product profilesAssay conditionsPercentage of total product formeddCDPdUDPdADPdGDPEquimolar substrates, no dNTPs78184<1Equimolar substrates, in vivo dNTPs28263314In vivosubstrates, no dNTPs78193<1In vivosubstrates, in vivo dNTPs34252715Percentage of total nucleotides in mouse genome2129aPresent in mouse DNA as dTMP.2921All reaction mixtures contained ATP at 2.5 mm.

The importance of substrate concentrations as a determinant of physiological specificity is evident but less pronounced than what was seen earlier for the vaccinia virus enzyme (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At equimolar rNDPs (150 μm each), ADP reduction was significantly higher and GDP reduction was significantly lower than expected for biologically balanced deoxyribonucleotide production. At quasi-physiological concentrations, ADP reduction was close to the expected value, and GDP reduction was slightly closer to but still below the expected value. This presents a contrast from comparable results with the vaccinia virus RNR, in which we found that GDP reduction is higher than expected under quasi-physiological conditions. The more striking contrast, however, is for UDP reduction, where we found the vaccinia enzyme to have little activity under all conditions tested. Table II, however, shows the relative rate of UDP reduction by the mouse enzyme to correspond fairly closely to the representation of dTMP in the mouse genome. Others have reported (14Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) that most of the dTMP in mammalian genomes arises from dCMP, via the dCMP deaminase reaction followed by thymidylate synthase and that intracellular reduction of UDP to dUDP is negligible under most conditions. The data of Table IIshow CDP reduction at quasi-physiological rNDP concentrations to be considerably higher than the proportion of dCMP in the mouse genome. Therefore, even though UDP reduction is significant, our data are consistent with the concept that a significant fraction of the dTMP residues in mouse DNA arises via deamination of deoxycytidine nucleotides. Although our estimates of effective intracellular rNDP concentrations may be inaccurate for the above-mentioned reasons, we felt that the rNDP concentrations relative to each other should more closely reflect thein vivo situation. Therefore, we carried out a substrate concentration-velocity experiment, using a bioproportional mixture of ribonucleoside diphosphates as the variable substrate rather than a single substrate. According to the mammalian rNDP pool data compiled by Traut (13Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), the ratio of ADP to CDP to GDP to UDP is about 12:1:2:2. Fig. 2 shows results of an experiment in which ADP concentration was varied from 300 to 1800 μm and the other three rNDPs were varied proportionately. None of the concentrations tested yielded a closer fit between the product profile in the four-substrate assay and the nucleotide composition of mouse DNA. This result suggests either that our assumptions about rNDP concentration ratios in mouse cells are inaccurate, that control of rNDP reductase specificity in vivo involves additional factors, or both. The most interesting feature of Fig. 2 is the marked inhibition of purine nucleotide reduction seen at the highest substrate concentrations. In this respect the mouse RNR resembles vaccinia virus RNR (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and this result suggests that the apparent control of RNR activity by ribonucleoside diphosphates might be physiologically significant. To further investigate the basis for this effect, we varied the concentration of each rNDP individually, in the presence of each of the other three rNDPs at its respective estimated in vivo concentration. As shown in Fig.3, ADP inhibited its own reduction at high concentrations, although the effect was not as pronounced as seen in the experiments with bioproportional substrate mixtures. The effect of ADP is evidently more complex than simple competition with other rNDPs for catalytic sites on the enzyme, because CDP reduction was activated at high ADP concentrations; if only competition at the catalytic site site were involved, CDP reduction would decline at higher ADP concentrations, and ADP reduction would increase. By contrast, the effects of the other rNDPs did seem to involve mostly competition for binding at the catalytic site. In Fig.4, for example, note that increasing GDP concentration in the presence of fixed amounts of the other three rNDPs increased the rate of GDP reduction but decreased the activity of the enzyme toward the other three substrates. A nearly identical result was seen with CDP, namely, increased CDP reduction at high levels coupled with decreased activities toward the other three substrates.Figure 4Effects upon mouse rNDP reductase specificity of variations in individual substrate concentrations. For each of the three experiments shown, the concentration of one rNDP was varied as indicated, whereas the levels of the other three rNDPs and the allosteric effectors were held constant at their estimated in vivo concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzyme activity data presented above indicate that the effect of ADP on the RNR product profile is more complex than simple competition between ADP and other rNDP substrates at the catalytic site. Does ADP bind to a previously unknown site on R1, or does it bind at high concentrations to the specificity and/or activity sites? As an approach toward answering that question, we carried out nucleotide binding experiments, using the ultrafiltration assay of Ormö and Sjöberg (9Ormö M. Sjöberg B-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The immediate goal of these experiments was to determine whether ADP, either alone or in combination with other rNDPs, influences binding of dNTP effectors to the high affinity specificity sites of R1. First it was necessary to quantitate the binding of dNTPs to R1 in the absence of added rNDP substrates. Data from these experiments are shown in Fig.5. Both dGTP and dTTP displayed hyperbolic binding behavior as expected for single-site binding. Curve fitting for the dGTP data (Fig. 5 A) yielded aK d of 4.4 ± 0.38 μm and for the dTTP data (Fig. 5 B) a K d of 1.8 ± 0.30 μm. Because dATP binds at two sites with differing affinities, we carried out dATP binding experiments at two different R1 protein concentrations and displayed the data on a Scatchard plot (Fig.5 C). Linear regression analysis yielded for the high affinity (specificity) site a K d of 12.6 ± 2.3 μm and for the low affinity (activity) site aK d of 54.3 ± 4.0 μm. Our first experiment tested the idea that ADP at high concentrations can bind, as an ATP analog, either to the specificity site on R1, to the activity site, or to both. Accordingly, we asked whether ADP at high concentrations could inhibit the binding of dATP to R1. As shown in Fig. 6, however, ADP at concentrations as high as 1800 μm had no discernible effect upon the binding of dATP, present at 1.5 μm (open circles). Because ADP in this experiment is expected to bind to the catalytic site as well as to possible other sites, we modified the protocol by asking whether ADP could inhibit dATP binding under conditions where little if any ADP was bound at the catalytic site. This was accomplished by running the binding assays in the presence of CDP at a constant concentration of 320 μm, 10-fold higher than the reported K m for CDP with a mammalian RNR (11Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), so that ADP would be largely displaced from catalytic sites. Under these conditions also (Fig. 6, closed circles) we saw no effect of ADP upon amount of dATP bound. However, at all concentrations of ADP, the presence of CDP had a slight but consistent depressive effect upon the amount of dATP bound. The latter finding suggested that CDP itself might have a direct effect upon the binding of nucleotides at one or both allosteric sites. We tested this idea by observing the effect of CDP upon the binding of its prime allosteric inhibitor, dGTP. As shown in Fig.7A (open circles), CDP at high concentrations inhibited dGTP binding by nearly 10-fold. This finding suggests that allosteric and catalytic sites are in two-way communication. Most literature on allosteric enzymes focuses upon the concept that effector binding at an allosteric site influences substrate binding at the catalytic site. The data of Fig. 7 Aindicate that the converse relationship also holds. The metabolic rationale for this behavior of the enzyme is that CDP can promote its own reduction by driving release from the enzyme of its prime inhibitor. A similar relationship is shown in Fig. 7 B(open circles), where we show that GDP stimulates the binding of its allosteric activator, dTTP. In this case the data suggest that GDP promotes its own reduction by causing a shift in RNR specificity toward GDP, through binding of an effector that is both inhibitory to CDP and UDP reduction and stimulatory toward its own reduction. Because the primary goal of these experiments was to understand the effect of ADP upon ADP and GDP reduction, the nucleotide binding experiments depicted in Fig. 7 were carried out in the presence of ADP at a constant concentration. That concentration was set at 500 μm, a value permitting ADP to compete effectively with CDP and GDP, respectively, for binding at the catalytic site. Again, as in the experiment of Fig. 6, ADP displayed a small but consistent effect. In Fig. 7 A, note that ADP depressed the inhibition of dGTP binding by CDP, and in Fig. 7 B, the effect of ADP was to depress the stimulation of dTTP binding by GDP. These experiments suggest a model for understanding the effects of ADP upon activities of mouse RNR. As suggested by the data of Fig. 6, ADP may be relatively inert in the sense that its binding to the catalytic site does not directly influence affinities for effectors at the specificity site. However, it might influence these affinities indirectly, by competing with the other RNR substrates for binding to the catalytic site and thereby depressing the effects of those other rNDPs on effector binding. This idea was tested in the experiments of Fig. 8, where ADP concentration was varied in the presence of other rNDP substrates at constant concentrations. As seen in Fig. 6, ADP by itself exerts little or no direct influence on effector binding. Note from the squaresin both panels A and B of Fig. 8 that ADP had little or no effect, in the absence of other rNDPs, on the binding of either dGTP or dTTP. Note also confirmation of the results shown in Fig. 7; in the absence of added ADP, CDP strongly inhibited dGTP binding (compare circles with squares, Fig.8 A), and GDP activated dTTP binding (comparecircles with squares, Fig. 8 B). As ADP concentration was increased, dGTP binding was increased in the presence of CDP (circles, Fig. 8 A), and dTTP binding in the presence of GDP was decreased (circles, Fig.8 B). In Fig. 8 A an even greater stimulation of dGTP binding by ADP was seen when the experiment was carried out in the presence of a mixture of CDP, UDP, and GDP, each at its estimated physiological concentration (triangles). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis upon which the experiment was based, namely, that the effect of ADP binding to allosteric effectors is indirect. From the experiment of Fig. 8 A, we suggest that ADP stimulates dGTP binding by displacing CDP from the catalytic site, thereby limiting the inhibition of dGTP binding by CDP. Similarly, in Fig. 8 B, we suggest that ADP binding displaces GDP, thereby limiting the ability of GDP to stimulate dTTP binding. Although this study has documented some significant differences between the ribonucleotide reductases of mouse cells and vaccinia virus, the two enzymes are closely related, with amino acid sequence identities near 80% (15Tengelson L. Slabaugh M.B. Bibler J.K. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1988; 164: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Partly to examine whether the close structural relationship connotes a close functional relationship, in our earlier study (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we showed that a hybrid enzyme containing vaccinia virus R1 protein and mouse R2 protein was enzymatically active, although the specific activity was lower than our values for the native viral enzyme (4Slabaugh M.B. Davis R.E. Roseman N.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17803-17810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and those determined by Davis et al. (6Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the mouse enzyme. Because for the present study we had prepared homogeneous recombinant mouse R1 protein, we repeated the experiment, using both mouse/vaccinia hybrid enzymes. For this experiment we assayed equimolar rNDP substrates (150 μmeach) in the presence of ATP as the sole allosteric effector, conditions that maximize the reduction of CDP. As shown in Fig.9, the vaccinia R1/mouse R2 hybrid is active, as reported previously, with a specific activity significantly lower than that of either native holoenzyme. Unexpectedly, the mouse R1/vaccinia R2 hybrid was more active than either native enzyme, with a specific activity about twice that of the vaccinia virus holoenzyme. Simultaneous analysis of the four activities of ribonucleotide reductase has revealed novel aspects of the regulation of this pivotal enzyme, as shown both by our earlier studies of type I RNRs of T4 phage and vaccinia virus (2Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2861-2865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and by more recent studies by Anderssonet al. (16Andersson J. Westman M. Hofer A. Sjöberg B-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19443-19448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) of the type III anaerobic RNR of T4 phage. Recombinant mouse ribonucleotide reductase shows allosteric behavior in the four-substrate assay similar to that earlier described for other mammalian RNRs (10Eriksson S. Thelander L. Åkerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2948-2952Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), such as strong dependence upon dGTP for ADP reduction, upon dTTP for GDP reduction, and upon ATP for all activities of the enzyme. General inhibition by dATP and inhibition of CDP and UDP reduction by dGTP are among the feedback inhibition phenomena described previously. Our studies reveal two regulatory effects, less strong but still significant, which have not been reported before: activation of ADP reduction by dTTP and of GDP reduction by dGTP. Whether these effects play a significant role in regulating dNTP pool sizes in vivo cannot yet be determined from our data. The relatively high activity of the mouse enzyme toward UDP was unexpected in light of the negligible activity of the vaccinia virus enzyme toward this substrate, and in vivo data suggesting that the pathway dCMP → dUMP → dTMP →→ dTTP is more significantin vivo for dTTP synthesis than is the pathway involving RNR, viz. UDP → dUDP → dUMP → dTMP →→ dTTP. Perhaps there are additional factors that control UDP reductase activity in vivo. In any case, the results presented here suggest that it would be desirable to re-examine the roles of ribonucleotide reductase and dCMP deaminase in dUMP synthesis in vivo. Regulation of mouse RNR activity by ADP seems to be less specific than was reported previously (3Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29512-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for the vaccinia virus enzyme, in the sense that the bioproportional mixture of rNDPs exerts a stronger regulatory influence under our conditions than does ADP alone. For example, in the experiment of Fig. 2, the percentage of dADP + dGDP in the product mix dropped from 64 to 28% in going from the lowest to the highest rNDP concentration tested. By contrast, in the experiment of Fig. 3, the corresponding change, in going from 800 to 1800 μmADP, was from 48% of the total to 34%. Whatever the specific regulatory mechanisms involved, however, it is apparent that ADP interacts with the enzyme differently from the other rNDPs, because its effects upon the product profile in the four-substrate assay cannot be explained simply in terms of competition among the four substrates for the catalytic site. The nucleotide binding experiments depicted in Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 suggest a model for understanding this interaction. According to this model, ADP binds exclusively at the catalytic site. Note from Fig. 6 that ADP at a 1200-fold molar excess over dATP had no detectable effect upon dATP binding, suggesting that ADP does not interact with the two allosteric sites. We cannot rule out the possibility of some binding of ADP at the activity site, because this experiment was carried out at 1.5 μm dATP, a concentration so low that binding should have occurred primarily at the high affinity specificity site. Nor can we yet rule out the possibility that ADP binds to a previously undescribed site on the R1 protein. More direct approaches are needed, and these are in progress. If we assume that the effects of ADP result from its interaction with the catalytic site, we can understand its effects upon the specificity of mouse ribonucleotide reductase, namely, activation of CDP reduction and inhibition of ADP and GDP reduction. ADP evidently has little direct effect on the binding of either dATP (Fig. 6), dGTP (Fig.8 A, squares), or dTTP (Fig. 8 B,squares), whereas CDP and GDP both have strong effects upon binding of allosteric effectors (Fig. 7). However, ADP can modulate the effects of CDP and GDP by competing with them for binding to the catalytic site. The intracellular pool size of ADP, which is much higher than those of the other three rNDPs (13Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), suggests that this competitive binding is metabolically significant. A consequence of the displacement of CDP and GDP from the catalytic site is to depress the binding of dTTP (promoted by GDP) and increase binding of dGTP (inhibited by CDP) at the specificity site; these events in turn should inhibit reduction of ADP and GDP and increase reduction of CDP. Our observation (Fig. 8 A, triangles) that ADP shows a 3-fold stimulation of dGTP binding in the presence of quasi-physiological concentrations of CDP, GDP, and UDP is consistent with this interpretation. The experiment of Fig. 5 yielded K d values for the binding of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP to mouse R1 protein. The values reported here (12.6 and 54.3 μm for dATP and 4.4 μm for dGTP) are considerably higher than corresponding values recently reported (11Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for mouse R1 (0.07 and 1.5 μm for dATP and 0.2 μm for dGTP). Although we do not know the basis for the discrepancy, we note that the values we have determined are closer to what one might expect a priori if these interactions are to participate in metabolic regulation, because they lie closer to actual intracellular concentrations of these effectors. The average intracellular concentrations estimated by Traut (13Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) are 24 μm for dATP and 5.2 μm for dGTP; these values lie close to those determined in our own laboratory with several different cultured mammalian cell lines (17Leeds J. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, the high activity of the chimeric RNR containing mouse R1 and vaccinia virus R2 was unexpected; it would be of interest to determine whether this higher activity results from particularly efficient iron binding in vitro by the hybrid enzyme. However, our observation may explain why early studies on targeted deletion of the vaccinia virus R1 gene led to mutant viruses with no significant phenotype (18Child S.J. Palumbo G.J. Buller R.M.L. Hruby D.E. Virology. 1990; 174: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Rajagopal I. Ahn B. Moss B. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27415-27418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Perhaps a chimeric enzyme is formed in cells infected by this mutant. In vaccinia virus-infected monkey kidney cells, the R2 protein accumulates in significant excess over R1 (20Howell M.L. Roseman N.A. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7155-7162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viral R2 present may suffice to drive the formation of a significant amount of an enzymatically hybrid enzyme. Because levels of cellular R1 vary with growth phase of a cell culture (21Björklund S. Hjortsberg K. Johansson E. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11322-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a prediction from our observations would be that the ability of a cell line to support productive vaccinia virus infection would be a function of the level of its own R1 protein."
