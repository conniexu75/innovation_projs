https://openalex.org/W1531386924,"Abstract Experiments were performed on adenyl cyclase in washed particles of guinea pig ventricle and in particulate preparations extracted with LiBr. The Km for ATP was 0.08 mm. Since one Mg++ binds with ATP at pH 7.5, it was concluded that the true substrate is a Mg-ATP complex. Concentrations of Mg++ as high as 10 mm were required to saturate the enzyme; the Ka for this cation was 2 to 3 mm. Mg++ saturation curves were sigmoidal. Mg++ did not affect the Km for ATP. It was concluded that Mg++ binds to a second and possibly allosteric site. The consequence of this binding is significantly increased reactivity of the catalytic site for substrate. Fluoride profoundly activated the enzyme even in the presence of saturating amounts of Mg++ and was without significant effect on the affinity of ATP or of Mg++ for their binding sites. It was concluded that F- binds to the enzyme possibly as a magnesium-fluoride complex, the consequence of which is greater reactivity of the catalytic site than that produced by Mg++ alone. This activating effect was specific for F-; a variety of anions and organic fluorine compounds were inactive. The enzyme was activated by catecholamines but to a much lower degree than by F-. Ca++ was inhibitory both in the presence and absence of F-; the inhibitory action of Ca++ was found to be competitive with respect to Mg++. A Ki of about 0.3 mm for Ca++ was obtained. The possibility is considered that Mg++, by binding to a site other than the catalytic site, might serve in physiological regulation of the enzyme and that Ca++ by binding at this site may also have a modulating action."

https://openalex.org/W1556982527,"Abstract The perfused rat kidney was used for a study of gluconeogenesis. The kidney was completely isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 5% albumin. Perfusion flow rate and pressure remained stable for 2 to 3 hours, although the glomerular filtration rate diminished with time. The fractional reabsorption of both water and sodium was 0.92 during the 1st hour of perfusion. The rate of glucose formation from pyruvate was linear and in excess of 1 µmole per min per g of tissue. Glucose production from l-lactate was less than that from pyruvate, and the uptake of lactate was also less. Fructose was converted to glucose more readily than was dihydroxyacetone, and at approximately the same rate as pyruvate. Glucose production from l-glutamate proceeded at about the same rate as that from l-lactate. l-Alanine produced no glucose, and no alanine uptake could be detected. A mixture of amino acids, pyruvate, l-lactate, and glycerol at normal plasma concentrations supported gluconeogenesis at an initial rate of about 0.6 µmole per min per g of kidney. The rate of gluconeogenesis was sensitive to small changes in the pH of the perfusate. With either lactate, pyruvate, glutamine, or a substrate mixture of predominantly amino acids, glucose production was greater at pH 7.23 than at pH 7.64. Conversely, gluconeogenesis from glycerol and fructose was inhibited by a pH of 7.23 and increased by pH 7.64. Addition of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate to the perfusate stimulated gluconeogenesis from lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids, but not from glycerol. Neither glucagon, epinephrine, parathyroid extract, nor vasopressin altered the rate of gluconeogenesis."

Estrogen acutely activated adenyl cyclase in the castrate rat uterus, but this was prevented by administration of DL-propranolol, suggesting that the effect was mediated by catecholamines. Progesterone produced a delayed stimulation of oviduct adenyl cyclase preceding and concomitant with the induction of synthesis of avidin."
https://openalex.org/W1569170977,"Abstract Reaction of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase with imidoesters or cyanate at pH 8 significantly increases the activity of the enzyme, as assayed in high concentrations of NAD+ and ethanol at pH 9.0. Methyl picolinimidate activates the enzyme 19-fold and modifies about 50 of its 60 amino groups, as determined by spectral and amino acid analyses. When the active sites are protected with NAD+ and pyrazole (or NADH and isobutyramide) methyl picolinimidate activates only 2-fold, although most of the amino groups still react; after removal of the reagents by gel filtration, the partially substituted enzyme could be activated 11-fold more by methyl picolinimidate or 2-fold more by 14C-cyanate with the modification of about three amino groups per active site. A similar experiment with ethyl acetimidate in the first step and methyl picolinimidate in the second step gave similar results. Product inhibition studies show that the reactions catalyzed by both the native and picolinimidylated enzymes at pH 9.0 conform to the same mechanism, ordered bi bi. The modified enzyme has 12- to 53-fold larger Michaelis and inhibition constants for NADH and NAD+ and 12- and 30-fold larger turnover numbers. The rate-limiting step in either the forward or the reverse reaction with the native enzyme is the breakdown of the enzyme-coenzyme complex; the picolinimidylated dehydrogenase probably gives higher maximum velocities because the complexes dissociate faster. Picolinimidylation of the enzyme does not greatly affect the binding of AMP, ADP, or adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose, but markedly decreases the binding of NAD+, NADH, and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide. The reactivities of the essential —SH groups and the zinc ions at the active sites of the enzyme are not affected by picolinimidylation. These results indicate that the amino groups that can be modified are not required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme and that there is probably at least one amino group near the binding site for the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1523619076,"Abstract The stearyl coenzyme A desaturase system of hen liver microsomes has been purified 4-fold by fractionation with deoxycholate. Further fractionation by diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography has yielded a particle (DE fraction) in which DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity has been enriched 10-fold but desaturase activity has been completely lost. Treatment of the purified desaturase with N-ethylmaleimide has yielded a particle (N fraction) with neither desaturase nor DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity present. Combination of the N fraction with the DE fraction has restored the stearyl-CoA desaturase activity. The DE fraction can be completely replaced by the soluble, highly purified DPNH-cytochrome b5 reductase. These observations strongly suggest that DPNH-cytochrome b5 reductase is an integral part of the stearyl-CoA desaturase system."
https://openalex.org/W1753662493,"Abstract Fifteen hours after the intracardiac administration of a physiological dose (0.65 nmole) of radioactive cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) to rachitic chicks, the bulk of the radioactivity in the plasma, liver, and intestine exists as three polar metabolites. These are designated Metabolites 4A, 4B, and 4C on the basis of their chromatographic mobility on silicic acid columns. After doses of 0.65 to 6.5 nmoles of cholecalciferol, the predominant metabolite found in the plasma is 4A with smaller amounts of 4B and 4C. In the intestine, a primary target tissue of cholecalciferol, the predominant metabolite is 4B, with much smaller amounts of 4A and 4C. Metabolite 4A from both the plasma and intestine is tentatively identified as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the basis of its migration with 25-hydroxycholecalciferol during silicic acid column chromatography. The biological activity of Metabolites 4A and 4B was examined with an assay which measures intestinal calcium transport, in vivo. Both 4A and 4B have biological activity significantly greater than equivalent amounts of cholecalciferol. The kinetics of the appearance of Metabolite 4B in the intestine and its binding to intestinal chromatin are consistent with the lag in the physiological response to cholecalciferol. When radioactive Metabolite 4A is administered to rachitic chicks, the bulk of the plasma radioactivity remains as 4A, but the predominant metabolite found in the intestine is 4B. These data support the concept that Metabolite 4B may be the biologically active form of cholecalciferol in the intestine and that 25-hydroxycholecalciferol is an intermediate in its formation."

All-night electroencephalography was used to examine the sleep stage characteristics of these groups. Compared with the unselected age-matched group, the short sleepers showed no significant diminution in their stage 4 (deep) or rapid eye movement (dream) sleep. The long sleepers were observed to obtain significantly more rapid eye movement sleep than did the other groups."
https://openalex.org/W1525663151,"Abstract Adenyl cyclase and cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase were shown in homogenates of bovine corpora lutea. In order to determine the site of action of luteinizing hormone, the adenyl cyclase activity was assessed in the absence of phosphodiesterase activity. This was accomplished by using a high concentration of theophylline and short incubation periods. Under these conditions, luteinizing hormone significantly increased the adenyl cyclase activity. NaF produced an even more marked stimulation of this enzyme. Epinephrine at a concentration of 0.2 mm produced a small but statistically significant stimulation of adenyl cyclase, but preparations of luteinizing hormone inactivated by hydrogen peroxide, bovine serum albumin, prolactin, adrenocorticotropin, and glucagon were inert in homogenates that responded to luteinizing hormone and NaF. The minimum effective dose of luteinizing hormone was 0.1 µg per ml. Luteinizing hormone had no effect on the phosphodiesterase activity when assayed under a variety of conditions, but NaF produced a slight but significant inhibition of this enzyme activity when the substrate cyclic AMP was added at a saturating level. These data indicate that the increase in endogenous cyclic AMP brought about by luteinizing hormone is due to a stimulation of the adenyl cyclase rather than to an inhibition of the phosphodiesterase."

https://openalex.org/W1490582195,"Abstract An α-l-fucosidase was purified approximately 600-fold from Clostridium perfringens; it is free of other glycosidases present in the crude extract. The fucosidase occurs in multiple isozymic forms with molecular weights greater than 200,000. It is an α-(1 → 2)-specific l-fucosidase with action on oligosaccharides and glycoproteins, but with no action on simple methyl or nitrophenyl fucosides. Action on the H-specific hog submaxillary glycoprotein results in the loss of the serological specificity. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 6.0, with a Km of 0.175 mm and its activity is enhanced by the presence of salts, the most effective being calcium chloride."

https://openalex.org/W1537398950,"Abstract To estimate the chain lengths based upon the 5' terminals and to provide information on methylated oligonucleotides, nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNAs were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis and the resultant oligonucleotides were separated and identified. The 5' terminal of each RNA class was found to be mainly (80%) the methylated dinucleoside triphosphate pCmpUp. In addition, smaller amounts of pCp (10%) and pAp (10%) were found. Based on the 5' terminal analysis, the ratio of the approximate chain lengths of the polynucleotide chains is 1:1.5:2.5 in nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA, respectively, and is in good agreement with ratios derived from hybridization studies and equilibrium sedimentation studies. An alkali-stable trinucleotide (UmpUmpCp) is present in all of the nucleolar RNA classes in amounts equimolar to the terminal pCmpUp. The 16 types of 2'-O-methylated alkali-stable dinucleotides present in the nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNAs accounted for 1.2, 1.1, and 0.9% of the total residues in 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S nucleolar RNA, respectively. From these values, and the cleavage patterns derived from the hybridization data, a working model of nucleolar 45 S RNA is presented in which the 28 S nucleolar RNA is placed at the 5' end of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1564379214,"When sucrose phosphorylase reacts with sucrose, a covalent glucose-enzyme complex can be isolated. In one case, the complex was isolated by rapidly denaturing the enzyme under acidic conditions. In the other case, the complex was isolated by chemically modifying the protein with NaIO4 after addition of the substrate. The NaIO4-modified complex maintains the ability to transfer the glucosyl group to acceptors with an acceptor specificity that resembles the native enzyme. The rate of reaction is approximately 1/20,000 that of the native enzyme. Pepsin digestion of both types of complexes produces positively charged, glucose-containing fragments, presumably peptides. The linkage between glucose and peptides as well as between glucose and enzyme is extremely base labile. For the glucosyl-peptides, t½ of glucose release at pH 6.0 is 80 min at 25°. When glucose is released from glucosyl peptides in 75% methanol, only glucose and no methyl glucoside is formed. It was concluded that glucose must be linked to the peptide through an oxygen atom contributed by the peptide and that the C-1 glucose oxygen bond was not broken during solvolysis. The glucose released from the peptides has the β configuration. Therefore, formation of the glucose-enzyme complex proceeds with inversion of configuration at the C-1 atom of the glucosyl moiety of sucrose. This fact, together with the isolation of a glucose-enzyme complex, provides support for the hypothesis that sucrose phosphorylase functions through a double replacement mechanism with intermediate formation of a β-linked glucose-enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1521190597,"Abstract The role of mitochondrial anion exchange reactions in the control of gluconeogenesis in perfused livers from fasted rats was investigated by using 2-n-butylmalonate to inhibit malate transport across the mitochondrial membrane. Glucose production from pyruvate or lactate was inhibited 50% to 80% by 5 mm butylmalonate. Oleate (0.5 or 1.5 mm) increased glucose production from pyruvate from 82 to 218 µmoles per 100 g, body wt, per hour, while butylmalonate decreased the rate of gluconeogenesis observed in the presence of oleate to 130 µmoles per 100 g, body wt, per hour. Uptake of substrates and oxygen consumption by the liver were only slightly inhibited, while production of ketone bodies was stimulated both in the presence and absence of oleate. Measurements of the tissue contents of intermediates of the gluconeogenic sequence with pyruvate as substrate identified sites of interaction at the pyruvate carboxylase, glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase steps. Calculated estimates of the intracellular distribution of malate were consistent with the hypothesis that the primary effect of butylmalonate was inhibition of malate transport, resulting in an increased concentration gradient of malate between mitochondria and cytosol. Since malate egress from the mitochondria provides both the carbon and reducing equivalents required for glucose production from pyruvate, diminished malate transport results directly in a decreased rate of gluconeogenesis. A relative deficiency of reducing equivalents in the cytosol caused by competition between lactate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-P dehydrogenase for the available NADH in the cytosol accounts for the inhibitory site of interaction at the latter step. The activational interaction at phosphofructokinase is interpreted as due to a redistribution of citrate into the mitochondria accompanying the altered malate concentration gradient. It is postulated that an increased rate of recycling between fructose diphosphate and fructose-6-P, resulting in a wasteful use of ATP, accounts for the maintenance of high oxygen consumption rates despite decreased net glucose formation after butylmalonate addition. Flux through the citric acid cycle in livers perfused with pyruvate was calculated to be 230 µmoles per 100 g, body wt, per hour. This rate was unchanged by addition of butylmalonate in the absence of oleate. In the presence of 1.5 mm oleate, flux through the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was in the direction of malate synthesis, and the activity of the citric acid cycle was calculated to be 320 µmoles per 100 g, body wt, per hour. Further addition of butylmalonate decreased citric acid cycle flux to 210 µmoles per 100 g, body wt, per hour. The present work provides substantial support to the concept that exchange of anions across the mitochondrial membrane is an integral feature of gluconeogenesis in rat liver and that malate transport can be a rate-controlling step in the over-all sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1519291991,"Abstract From the recently identified group of low molecular weight nuclear RNA's, a 4.5 S RNA, referred to as 4.5 S RNAi, was isolated, purified, and partially characterized. The 4.5 S RNA was initially obtained from nuclear 4 to 7 S RNA of Novikoff hepatoma cells by electrophoresis on preparative polyacrylamide gels. Chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex resulted in the separation of three 4.5 S RNA components. Of these, the 4.5 S RNAi had a purity of approximately 90% as shown by terminal analysis, i.e. the 3'-terminal nucleoside of 4.5 S RNAi is uridine (87%) and its 5'-terminal nucleoside 3',5'-diphosphate is pGp (90%). The Tm of the 4.5 S RNAi is 65° and its nucleotide composition determined by absorbance is 24.8% AMP, 25.6% UMP, 24.6% GMP, and 25.0% CMP. This RNA has been shown to be localized in the extranucleolar portion of the nucleus. The whole 4.5 S nuclear RNA contains at least one more fraction, referred to as 4.5 S RNAiii, which has a blocked 3' terminal. Its nucleotide composition determined by absorbance is 26.6% AMP, 25.8% UMP, 28.5% GMP, and 19.1% CMP. Like the 4.5 S RNAi, this RNA is also localized in the extranucleolar portion of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1530739409,"Abstract Photooxidation of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase in the presence of rose bengal did not effect the rate or extent of acetylation of the enzyme with p-nitrophenyl acetate; however, the rate of deacetylation of the S-acetyl-enzyme was selectively inhibited by 50 to 60%. Amino acid analysis of the photooxidized enzyme showed about 1 histidine residue per monomer was destroyed. No other changes in amino acid content were found. Peptide mapping studies showed that a specific histidine was photooxidized. The sequence of the tetradecapeptide containing the photosensitive histidine is as follows: Val-Asp-Val-Val-Ala-Ile-Asn-Asp(Pro,Phe)Ile-Asp-Leu-His Photooxidation also inhibited oxidation of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde by 50 to 60% suggesting that the histidine residue is involved in the principal physiological reaction carried out by the enzyme. At high dye to enzyme ratios, rose bengal in the dark also inhibited the esterase and dehydrogenase activities. Rose bengal was a competitive inhibitor with respect to DPN and arsenate, but a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde or p-nitrophenyl acetate. The effects of photooxidation produced a permanent change in the enzyme whereas the dark inhibitions were completely reversed by removal of the dye from the enzyme surface with charcoal treatment. The role of histidine in the various reactions catalyzed by the enzyme is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1545128939,"Abstract To define more clearly the relationships of nucleolar 45 S, 35 S, and 28 S RNA to ribosomal 18 S and 28 S RNA, hybridization studies were carried out with these RNAs and DNA obtained from nucleoli of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. As determined by saturation studies, the percentage of nucleolar DNA complementary to 18 S and 28 S rRNA was 0.08 and 0.195%, respectively; the percentage of DNA complementary to 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S nucleolar RNA was 0.25, 0.35, and 0.52%, respectively. The percentage of nucleolar DNA complementary to an equimolar mixture of 18 S and 28 S rRNA was 0.28%. Competition experiments showed that 28 S rRNA competes to the extent of 84, 63, and 43%, respectively, with nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA. On the other hand, 18 S rRNA did not compete effectively with 28 S and 35 S nucleolar RNA but competed to the extent of 17% with nucleolar 45 S RNA. According to the saturation and competition experiments, nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA contain nonribosomal RNA segments corresponding in length to about 18, 41, and 43%, respectively, of the total molecules. Based upon these studies and those of the accompanying paper, a revised model is presented for the conversion reactions involved in formation of ribosomal RNA from nucleolar precursors."

https://openalex.org/W1580817730,"Abstract The prolyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli has been purified. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited by p-mercuribenzoate when two to four groups are bound per molecule of enzyme. Many analogues of proline were tested as substrates and inhibitors. The requirements for activation and transfer appear to be the same: a secondary l-amino acid with a side chain not much bulkier than the ring of proline. Substitutions of hydroxyl or methyl groups on carbon 3 or carbon 4 cause steric inhibition that minimize or prevent binding, but allo-hydroxyproline and trans-3-methyl proline are substrates at high concentrations. Double bonds in the ring destroy substrate activity but pyrrole is bound as a competitive inhibitor. The carboxyl group is not essential for binding and probably does not form an ionic bond since the amide is bound almost as well. d-Proline is not bound to the enzyme. Several open chain compounds are activated and transferred to tRNApro. The broad specificity of the enzyme suggests that mechanisms used to confer great specificity on other activating enzymes (induced fit) do not apply to the proline enzyme. It is also suggested that open chain analogues might be incorporated into proteins in place of proline."

https://openalex.org/W1529393278,"Abstract A system suitable for metabolic studies in vitro on uterine horns is described. Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is effective at low concentrations (0.1 mm or 0.001 mm if used as the dibutyryl derivative) in stimulating the uptake by the tissue of uridine-5-3H and l-leucine-4,5-3H and their incorporation into RNA and proteins in ovariectomized rat uteri. The effect of cyclic AMP is rapid, and has a degree of specificity since other nucleotides like AMP and GMP do not induce parallel stimulation in the first 15 min of incubation. On prolonged exposure (2 hours), however, AMP and GMP cause effects similar to those of cyclic AMP, although their magnitude is smaller. The early effect of cyclic AMP appears to be a facilitated uptake of these metabolites. During the early phase (up to 15 to 30 min), there is no change in the relative specific radioactivity of RNA, the apparent rise in the labeling of RNA and proteins being due to the increase in the intracellular amount of radioactivity. On prolonged incubation (60 to 120 min), however, the relative specific activity increases, suggesting the activation of transcription processes. The rise in the synthesis of RNA in the early and late phases is not prevented by cycloheximide and does not appear to require the obligatory synthesis of protein or proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1570473787,"Abstract Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an inducible enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which catalyzes the oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl coenzyme A, was purified to the extent that a preparation was obtained which was homogenous by the criterion of disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 132,000 by gel filtration. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase dissociated into subunits in urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions. The molecular weight of the subunit was estimated at between 58,000 and 69,000 by the techniques of gel electrophoresis and gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate, respectively, which means that the native enzyme is composed of at least two subunits. The purified enzyme catalyzed the reduction of NAD with methylmalonate semialdehyde and propionaldehyde. In the presence of CoA, propionyl-CoA was a product of methylmalonate semialdehyde oxidation. The enzyme was active when mercaptoethanol replaced CoA and an active propionyl derivative was formed then as well. The stoichiometry between NADH and propionyl-CoA was 1:1. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate-1-14C were used to generate methylmalonate semialdehyde-1-14C, and radioactive carbon dioxide was produced when methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase was present in the reaction mixture. The Michaelis constants for methylmalonate semialdehyde, NAD, CoA, mercaptoethanol, and propionaldehyde were determined. The proposal is made that the physiological role of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase in cell metabolism is to catalyze the oxidation of methylmalonate semialdehyde to propionyl-CoA in the catabolism of valine."
https://openalex.org/W1643595646,"The accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was determined by measuring the accumulation of labeled cyclic AMP in fat cells whose adenine nucleotides had been labeled with adenine-3H during the isolation of the white adipose cells. The addition of growth hormone and 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methyl-pregna-1, 4-diene-3,20-dione (dexamethasone) increased the accumulation of labeled cyclic AMP and lipolysis after a lag period of at least 1 hour. At the end of 4 hours of incubation, most of the increase in accumulation of cyclic AMP due to epinephrine or growth hormone and dexamethasone was in the medium rather than in the cells. Puromycin and cycloheximide, which are inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocked the increases in both labeled cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis due to growth hormone and dexamethasone. However, the addition of cycloheximide alone did stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation without affecting lipolysis due to theophylline. Growth hormone and glucocorticoid also increased phosphorylase activity in fat cells, and this was blocked by cycloheximide. These results indicate that there is an increase in accumulation of labeled cyclic AMP due to growth hormone and glucocorticoid which is blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1655430733,"The relationship of early transcriptive events to protein synthesis has been studied in protoplasts of bacteriophage T4-infected Escherichia coli by division of the infection cycle into a period of transcription and one of translation with inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. The accumulation of specific messengers during an initial incubation in the presence of 5-methyltryptophan or chloramphenicol was determined by the inhibition of further RNA synthesis with rifamycin and the measurement of the increase in the activity of various early enzymes after the restoration of protein synthesis. Three groups of early enzymes could be distinguished operationally according to the manner in which the respective messenger RNA accumulated during incubation with 5-methyltryptophan. In the case of one early enzyme, deoxynucleotide kinase, the messenger RNA did not accumulate in the presence of 5-methyltryptophan, a suggestion that the transcription of this region of the phage DNA requires the prior synthesis of a specific phage-induced protein. It was also shown that early viral transcription is severely limited when the synthesis of phage-induced proteins is inhibited with chloramphenicol. These studies suggest that early transcriptive events in viral development may be regulated by the synthesis of specific proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1559128512,"Abstract The DPN+-specific malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), which catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of pyruvate with concomitant oxidation of DPNH, has been purified from glucose-grown cells of Escherichia coli. The enzyme is inhibited by ATP (and some other nucleoside triphosphates) and coenzyme A in an allosteric manner. Both of the inhibitors cause noncompetitive inhibition when DPN+ or malate is the varied substrate. In addition, the hyperbolic rate-concentration plots for malate in the absence of the inhibitors become sigmoidal in their presence. Aspartate acts as an activator for the enzyme and in its presence the inhibition caused by CoA is reversed, while the degree of inhibition caused by ATP remains unchanged. From these experiments it is deduced that the inhibitory binding sites for CoA and ATP are different from each other. Since quite low levels of CoA are effective in inhibiting the enzyme it is suggested that the enzyme does not function in vivo unless specific deinhibition is brought about by excess aspartate."
https://openalex.org/W1521655750,"Abstract The mechanism of the inhibition in vitro of the microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase system by sterculate has been investigated. Our data do not support the suggestions that this is mediated by the binding of thiol groups of enzyme proteins by the cyclopropene group and that this is competitive with substrate. Sterculate did inhibit the desaturase system in vitro but data suggest this to be nonspecific, stemming from the detergent nature of free fatty acid and hence of doubtful significance for metabolism in vitro. However, it was found that dietary (methyl) sterculate decreased the activity of the microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase system. The mechanism of this action of sterculate remains obscure. A new procedure for the precise measurement of the microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase system is described based on the permanganate-periodate oxidation of fatty acid methyl esters followed by the separation of monomethyl azelate-14C derived from oleate-1-14C from other fatty acid methyl esters with the use of a Florisil column. The utilization of rat liver microsomes for the enzymatic synthesis of stearyl-1-14C-CoA is also described."

The N(6)-O(2)'-dibutyryl analog of this cyclic nucleotide produced greater increases in vesicular enzyme activities than those induced by the parent compound. The observed enhancement of the key glycolytic enzymes and of hexose monophosphate shunt dehydrogenase was significantly inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The evidence indicates that cyclic adenosine monophosphate may be involved as an intermediary in the action of androgenic hormones on male accessory sex organs."

This reaction is accompanied by the transfer of a hydrogen from ethylene glycol to 5'-deoxyadenosine. After the reaction is over the acetaldehyde dissociates slowly from the enzyme, but both 5'-deoxyadenosine and the new corrinoid remain bound to the enzyme, where the latter is gradually converted to hydroxocobalamin. The cleavage of coenzyme, which is first order in enzyme-B12 complex, obeys saturation kinetics with respect to ethylene glycol, showing a Vmax of about 0.2 sec-1 and a Km for ethylene glycol of 0.02 m. The optical spectrum of the new B12 derivative resembles that of an alkyl cobalamin or a thiol cobalamin. However, spectral changes observed on treating the reaction mixture with urea or heat to denature the enzyme suggest that the latter possibility is more likely than the former. The possibility that the new compound is a hitherto unknown type of corrin derivative cannot be excluded. As a result of the reaction, the activity of the enzyme is substantially reduced, but not abolished. The enzyme is capable of promoting the cleavage of more than 1 mole of coenzyme per mole of active site. Both of these observations indicate that the enzyme participates catalytically in the cleavage reaction, and is not destroyed as a consequence of the reaction. These results are formulated in terms of a mechanism which relates the observed reaction to the catalytic reaction in which ethanolamine is substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1507811951,"Abstract The kinetics of phosphorolysis of compounds in the series (Ap)nA (n = 2 to 8), p(Ap)nA (n = 2 to 4), and (Up)nU, (n = 3 to 6) has been studied. Km and Vmax values were obtained for all compounds. Km decreases with increasing chain length and reaches a minimum value with compounds containing 5 phosphate residues. With the shorter compounds the dependence of Km on the nucleoside residues is also apparent. Experiments with inhibitory oligonucleotides such as (Ap)nA-cyclic-p and (Ap)nA-2',3'-p confirm the results with substrates. The Vmax for all oligonucleotide substrates is greater than the Vmax for polyadenylic acid. Vmax reaches an optimum value with oligonucleotides having 5 nucleoside residues. On the basis of these results, a model for the active center of polynucleotide phosphorylase is proposed. This model has multiple subsites for the interaction of the enzyme with polynucleotides. Similar results were obtained with an enzyme form which does not require oligonucleotide primer in the polymerization reaction and an enzyme form which does require primer."
https://openalex.org/W1515606077,"Abstract The kinetics of the phosphorolysis of oligoadenylic acids by highly purified polynucleotide phosphorylase of Micrococcus luteus have been investigated in detail. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity against either inorganic phosphate or oligonucleotide substrate concentration were linear, and further, the affinity of the enzyme for either substrate was unaffected by the presence of the other. Oligonucleotides with phosphate esterified to the free terminal 3'-OH groups are competitive inhibitors with respect to oligonucleotide substrate and noncompetitive with respect to inorganic phosphate. Conversely, two analogues of the ADP product, dADP and adenosine 5'-methylene diphosphonate, are competitive inhibitors with respect to Pi and are, in general, noncompetitive with respect to oligonucleotide. The results were almost identical with primer-independent and primer-dependent enzyme. On the basis of these data a rapid equilibrium random Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism is proposed for M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase. The stepwise phosphorolysis of oligonucleotides with chain length up to six proceeds by a random mechanism and not by the processive mechanism observed with long polymers."

https://openalex.org/W1556234758,"Abstract The metabolism of N6,O2'-(2',3'-3H)-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (3H-DBcAMP) was studied in isolated rat epididymal adipocytes. 3H-Butyric acid, isolated from incubation mixtures after stimulation by 3H-DBcAMP of lipolysis or after stimulation or inhibition of glucose oxidation by 3H-DBcAMP, represented less than 4% hydrolysis of the butyryl groups of DBcAMP during up to 2 hours of incubation; this hydrolysis appeared to be nonenzymatic in nature. Of the butyric acid produced, less than 10% was lost by oxidation to CO2 and by volatilization. Only two nucleotides were found following incubation of 3H-DBcAMP, with or without adipocytes, for up to 2 hours—the original 3H-DBcAMP and a radioactive compound with the chromatographic mobility of N6-monobutyryl cyclic AMP (MBcAMP). The molar ratio of 3H-MBcAMP to 3H-DBcAMP in the isolated material, although greater than that of the substrate prior to incubation, was not significantly different in incubations with or without adipocytes. 3H-MBcAMP, although similar to 3H-DBcAMP in lipolytic potency, could not, in the amounts (4 to 8%) present as contaminant in preparations of 3H-DBcAMP, be responsible for the effects ascribed to 3H-DBcAMP. It is concluded that, under the experimental conditions used, DBcAMP exerted several regulatory effects on the metabolism of adipocytes without the necessity for prior removal of one or both butyryl groups from the nucleotide. This implies that free 6-amino and 2'-hydroxyl groups of cyclic AMP are not required for its biological activities in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1525697832,"Abstract A 13-fold increase was observed in the specific activity of ribonucleotide reductase activity in the spleen of mice infected with a murine leukemia virus. After partial purification, the properties of the enzyme were investigated. The pH optimum was between 6.8 and 7.4. There was an absolute requirement for a hydrogen donor, dithiothreitol. Magnesium ions stimulated the reaction. The ribonucleoside diphosphates were the preferred substrates. The reduction rate was affected by the presence of nucleoside triphosphates in concentrations ranging from 5 x 10-5 to 10-3 m. The reduction of CDP was stimulated by dCTP and ATP. UDP reduction was stimulated by ATP. The reduction of ADP was stimulated by GTP and dGTP. The GDP reduction was stimulated by dTTP. In the presence of ATP, the weak activators, dTTP and dATP, inhibit the CDP reduction. With minor exceptions, the ribonucleotide reductase from murine leukemic spleen closely resembles that of Novikoff hepatoma."

However, when cytosol proteins are separated by acrylamidegel electrophoresis, rapid changes in the amount and labeling of several protein fractions are evident in less than 30 minutes and are no longer evident within 60 minutes. This finding supports the proposal that the effects of tropic hormones and their intracellular mediators involve rapid selective effects on protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1601970533,"Abstract An estradiol dehydrogenase (17β-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase) which catalyzed the reversible oxidation of 17β-estradiol to estrone was purified more than 800-fold from ovine ovary homogenates with a 9.9% yield. The specific activity in the best preparation was 136 nmoles of NADH produced per min per mg of protein at 30°. The preparations approached homogeneity by sedimentation analysis and by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and 4.3. The molecular weight was 104,000 from sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the Stokes radius was 50.5 A from gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The preferred steroid substrate was 17β-estradiol; the preferred cofactor was NAD+. The enzyme also accepted 3-O-methyl-17β-estradiol as a substrate but did not dehydrogenate ethanol or 1,2-propanediol. Under the conditions of assay used (20% organic solvent), the Michaelis constant for NAD+ was 5.2 x 10-4 m, and for 17β-estradiol it was 3.0 x 10-5 m. Kinetic studies of the forward reaction showed that the mechanism was sequential. The purified enzyme was unstable in simple buffers and was stabilized by the presence of certain inorganic ions, 20% glycerol, and 0.05 m 2-mercaptoethanol."

https://openalex.org/W1589051402,"Abstract The controversial issue concerning a zinc requirement for the enzymatic activity of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase has been investigated. Nine preparations of the dehydrogenase crystallized from rabbit muscle were analyzed for zinc by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Likewise, the assay mixtures for four enzymatic activities, dehydrogenase, transferase, phosphatase, and esterase, were examined. None of the enzyme preparations or the assay mixtures contained any significant amount of zinc. It is therefore concluded that 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle is not a metallo-enzyme and zinc is not required for coenzyme binding, substrate binding, or catalytic activity."
