https://openalex.org/W2574978968,"Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated with statistical significance professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce more difficult to exploit strategies than prior approaches."

Here we report a storage strategy, called DNA Fountain, that is highly robust and approaches the information capacity per nucleotide. Using our approach, we stored a full computer operating system, movie, and other files with a total of 2.14 × 106 bytes in DNA oligonucleotides and perfectly retrieved the information from a sequencing coverage equivalent to a single tile of Illumina sequencing. We also tested a process that can allow 2.18 × 1015 retrievals using the original DNA sample and were able to perfectly decode the data. Finally, we explored the limit of our architecture in terms of bytes per molecule and obtained a perfect retrieval from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, orders of magnitude higher than previous reports."

To see whether mouse ESCs and their extraembryonic counterparts, trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), can recapitulate normal development, Harrison et al. combined ESCs and TSCs in an extracellular matrix culture (see the Perspective by Pera). The resultant “ETS-embryos” displayed considerable resemblance to normal embryos, even specifying mesoderm and primordial germ cells at the boundary between embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. These ETS-embryos are a genetically tractable tool for studying mammalian embryogenesis. Science , this issue p. eaal1810 ; see also p. 137"

To understand how species may adapt to this change, we must understand which aspects of the changing climate exert the most powerful selective forces. Siepielski et al. looked at studies of selection across species and regions and found that, across biomes, the strongest sources of selection were precipitation and transpiration changes. Importantly, local and regional climate change explained patterns of selection much more than did global change. Science , this issue p. 959"
https://openalex.org/W2593042581,"Layer-specific interneuron activity Somatostatin-expressing interneurons are an important group of inhibitory neurons in the brain that target and thus control the dendrites of pyramidal cells. These interneurons have recently been shown to play a role in sensorimotor integration, reinforcement encoding, and selective attention. Muñoz et al. used channelrhodopsin-assisted patching to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of neocortical dendritic inhibition in vivo. They were able to record the activity of somatostatin-expressing interneurons in all neocortical layers in behaving mice. The results provide a framework for understanding the changes in dendritic inhibition that take place in the neocortex during active behaviors. This framework is very distinct from the view obtained from previous recordings that were restricted to interneurons in the superficial layers of the neocortex. Science , this issue p. 954"

Kischkewitz et al. report a metal-free alternative pathway, wherein the boron stays bound to one end of the olefin while a carbon radical attacks the other end. Charge transfer then prompts migration of an alkyl or aryl group from the boron to form a second carbon-carbon bond. The boron can subsequently be displaced, generating a versatile array of alcohols, lactones, and quaternary carbon centers from simple precursors. Science , this issue p. 936"

Key insights into the unfolding pathways of diverse proteins have come from single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments in which proteins are literally pulled apart. Yu et al. developed a SMFS technique that could unfold individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules in a native lipid bilayer with 1-µs temporal resolution (see the Perspective by Müller and Gaub). The technique delivered a 100-fold improvement over earlier studies of bacteriorhodopsin and revealed many intermediates not seen before.

However, they also have a range of well-known side effects and can cause addiction. Painful conditions such as inflammation or trauma are often associated with localized tissue acidification. Spahn et al. designed a novel opioid receptor agonist that, unlike clinically used opioids, best activates the receptors in such acidified tissues. In rat models of inflammatory pain, the new drug exerted strong pain relief essentially without the side effects of standard opioids. Science , this issue p. 966"

Li et al. analyzed two fossil human skulls from central China, dated to 100,000 to 130,000 years ago. The crania elucidate the pattern of human morphological evolution in eastern Eurasia. Some features are ancestral and similar to those of earlier eastern Eurasian humans, some are derived and shared with contemporaneous or later humans elsewhere, and some are closer to those of Neandertals. The analysis illuminates shared long-term trends in human adaptive biology and suggests the existence of interconnections between populations across Eurasia during the later Pleistocene.

https://openalex.org/W2594168221,"According to recent estimates, at least 11% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to surgically-treatable diseases. In children, the burden is even more striking with up to 85% of children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) having a surgically-treatable condition by age 15. Using population data from four countries, we estimated pediatric surgical needs amongst children residing in LMICs.A cluster randomized cross-sectional countrywide household survey (Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need) was done in four countries (Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Nepal and Uganda) and included demographics, a verbal head to toe examination, and questions on access to care. Global estimates regarding surgical need among children were derived from combined data, accounting for country-level clustering.A total of 13,806 participants were surveyed and 6,361 (46.1%) were children (0-18 years of age) with median age of 8 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 4-13) years. Overall, 19% (1,181/6,361) of children had a surgical need and 62% (738/1,181) of these children had at least one unmet need. Based on these estimates, the number of children living with a surgical need in these four LMICs is estimated at 3.7 million (95% CI: 3.4, 4.0 million). The highest percentage of unmet surgical conditions included head, face, and neck conditions, followed by conditions in the extremities. Over a third of the untreated conditions were masses while the overwhelming majority of treated conditions in all countries were wounds or burns.Surgery has been elevated as an ""indivisible, indispensable part of health care"" in LMICs and the newly formed 2015 Sustainable Development Goals are noted as unachievable without the provision of surgical care. Given the large burden of pediatric surgical conditions in LMICs, scale-up of services for children is an essential component to improve pediatric health in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2594552501,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that is traditionally stratified based on clinical signs and symptoms. Recent imaging and molecular biomarker innovations provide unprecedented opportunities for improved TBI precision medicine, incorporating patho-anatomical and molecular mechanisms. Complete integration of these diverse data for TBI diagnosis and patient stratification remains an unmet challenge.The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) Pilot multicenter study enrolled 586 acute TBI patients and collected diverse common data elements (TBI-CDEs) across the study population, including imaging, genetics, and clinical outcomes. We then applied topology-based data-driven discovery to identify natural subgroups of patients, based on the TBI-CDEs collected. Our hypothesis was two-fold: 1) A machine learning tool known as topological data analysis (TDA) would reveal data-driven patterns in patient outcomes to identify candidate biomarkers of recovery, and 2) TDA-identified biomarkers would significantly predict patient outcome recovery after TBI using more traditional methods of univariate statistical tests. TDA algorithms organized and mapped the data of TBI patients in multidimensional space, identifying a subset of mild TBI patients with a specific multivariate phenotype associated with unfavorable outcome at 3 and 6 months after injury. Further analyses revealed that this patient subset had high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enrichment in several distinct genetic polymorphisms associated with cellular responses to stress and DNA damage (PARP1), and in striatal dopamine processing (ANKK1, COMT, DRD2).TDA identified a unique diagnostic subgroup of patients with unfavorable outcome after mild TBI that were significantly predicted by the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms. Machine learning methods such as TDA may provide a robust method for patient stratification and treatment planning targeting identified biomarkers in future clinical trials in TBI patients.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01565551."
https://openalex.org/W2591973444,"We characterized wildfire transmission and exposure within a matrix of large land tenures (federal, state, and private) surrounding 56 communities within a 3.3 million ha fire prone region of central Oregon US. Wildfire simulation and network analysis were used to quantify the exchange of fire among land tenures and communities and analyze the relative contributions of human versus natural ignitions to wildfire exposure. Among the land tenures examined, the area burned by incoming fires averaged 57% of the total burned area. Community exposure from incoming fires ignited on surrounding land tenures accounted for 67% of the total area burned. The number of land tenures contributing wildfire to individual communities and surrounding wildland urban interface (WUI) varied from 3 to 20. Community firesheds, i.e. the area where ignitions can spawn fires that can burn into the WUI, covered 40% of the landscape, and were 5.5 times larger than the combined area of the community core and WUI. For the major land tenures within the study area, the amount of incoming versus outgoing fire was relatively constant, with some exceptions. The study provides a multi-scale characterization of wildfire networks within a large, mixed tenure and fire prone landscape, and illustrates the connectivity of risk between communities and the surrounding wildlands. We use the findings to discuss how scale mismatches in local wildfire governance result from disconnected planning systems and disparate fire management objectives among the large landowners (federal, state, private) and local communities. Local and regional risk planning processes can adopt our concepts and methods to better define and map the scale of wildfire risk from large fire events and incorporate wildfire network and connectivity concepts into risk assessments."

An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing. We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multi-mode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias to the junction provides a source of microwave photons, while the circuit's nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher order Josephson frequencies down to the cavity's fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent microwave photons at low temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2593892840,"Corneal scarring limits vision for millions of individuals worldwide. Corneal transplantation (keratoplasty) is the standard of care for corneal opacity; however, it bears the risk of graft rejection and infection and is not universally available. Stem cell therapy holds promise as an alternative to keratoplasty. Stem cells from human corneal stroma (CSSC) induce regeneration of transparent corneal tissue in a mouse wound-healing model. In this study we investigated the mechanism by which CSSC prevent deposition of fibrotic tissue. Infiltration by CD11b+/Ly6G+ neutrophils and myeloperoxidase expression were increased in corneas 24 hr after corneal wounding but were reduced in CSSC-treated wounds. Secretion of TSG-6, a protein known to regulate neutrophil migration, was up-regulated in CSSC in response to TNFα and as CSSC differentiate to keratocytes. In vivo, wounded mouse corneas treated with CSSC contained human TSG-6. Inhibition of neutrophil infiltration into cornea by CSSC was reversed when TSG-6 expression was knocked down using siRNA. Silencing of TSG-6 expression in CSSC reduced their ability to block scarring and the expression of mRNA for fibrosis-associated proteins collagen III, tenascin C, and smooth muscle actin in wounded corneas. Neutropenic mice exhibited a significant reduction in corneal scarring and fibrotic mRNA expression 2 weeks after wounding. These results support the conclusion that neutrophil infiltration is an essential event in the fibrotic response to corneal damage and that prevention of scarring by CSSC is mediated by secretion of TSG-6 by these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2594482234,"Brain regions affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) display well-recognized early neuropathologic features in the endolysosomal and autophagy systems of neurons, including enlargement of endosomal compartments, progressive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, and lysosomal dysfunction. Although the primary causes of these disturbances are still under investigation, a growing body of evidence suggests that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular C-terminal fragment β (C99), generated by cleavage of APP by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), is the primary cause of the endosome enlargement in AD and the earliest initiator of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory impairment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the endolysosomal degradation pathway and autophagy on the proteolytic processing and turnover of C99. We found that pharmacologic treatments that either inhibit autophagosome formation or block the fusion of autophagosomes to endolysosomal compartments caused an increase in C99 levels. We also found that inhibition of autophagosome formation by depletion of Atg5 led to higher levels of C99 and to its massive accumulation in the lumen of enlarged perinuclear, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive organelles. In contrast, activation of autophagosome formation, either by starvation or by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin, enhanced lysosomal clearance of C99. Altogether, our results indicate that autophagosomes are key organelles to help avoid C99 accumulation preventing its deleterious effects.-González, A. E., Muñoz, V. C., Cavieres, V.

https://openalex.org/W2593043413,"Periodontitis are bacterial inflammatory diseases, where the bacterial biofilms present on the tooth-supporting tissues switch from a healthy state towards a pathogenic state. Among bacterial species involved in the disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to induce dysbiosis, and to induce virulence of otherwise healthy bacteria like Streptococcus gordonii. During biofilm development, primary colonizers such as S. gordonii first attach to the surface and allow the subsequent adhesion of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis. Interactions between those two bacteria have been extensively studied during the adhesion step of the biofilm. The aim of the study was to understand interactions of both species during the growing phase of the biofilm, for which little knowledge is available, using a mathematical model. This two-species biofilm model was based on a substrate-dependent growth, implemented with damage parameters, and validated thanks to data obtained on experimental biofilms. Three different hypothesis of interactions were proposed and assayed using this model: independence, competition between both bacteria species, or induction of toxicity by one species for the other species. Adequacy between experimental and simulated biofilms were found with the last hypothetic mathematical model. This new mathematical model of two species bacteria biofilms, dependent on different substrates for growing, can be applied to any bacteria species, environmental conditions, or steps of biofilm development. It will be of great interest for exploring bacterial interactions in biofilm conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2592326795,"Factors that affect the removal of organic carbon by heterotrophic bacterioplankton can impact the rate and magnitude of organic carbon loss in the ocean through the conversion of a portion of consumed organic carbon to CO2. Through enhanced rates of consumption, surface bacterioplankton communities can also reduce the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) available for export from the surface ocean. The present study investigated the direct effects of elevated pCO2 on bacterioplankton removal of several forms of DOC ranging from glucose to complex phytoplankton exudate and lysate, and naturally occurring DOC. Elevated pCO2 (1000–1500 ppm) enhanced both the rate and magnitude of organic carbon removal by bacterioplankton communities compared to low (pre-industrial and ambient) pCO2 (250 –~400 ppm). The increased removal was largely due to enhanced respiration, rather than enhanced production of bacterioplankton biomass. The results suggest that elevated pCO2 can increase DOC consumption and decrease bacterioplankton growth efficiency, ultimately decreasing the amount of DOC available for vertical export and increasing the production of CO2 in the surface ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2592374344,"DNA d ouble s trand b reaks (DSBs) severely disrupt DNA integrity. 53BP1 plays critical roles in determining DSB repair. Whereas the recruitment of 53BP1 to the DSB site is key for its function, recent evidence suggests that 53BP1's abundance also plays an important role in DSB repair because recruitment to damage sites will be influenced by protein availability. Initial evidence has pointed to three proteins, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7, the cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL), and the nuclear structure protein lamin A/C, that may impact 53BP1 levels, but the roles of each protein and any interplay between them were unclear. Here we report that UbcH7-dependent degradation plays a major role in controlling 53BP1 levels both under normal growth conditions and during DNA damage. CTSL influenced 53BP1 degradation during DNA damage while having little effect under normal growth conditions. Interestingly, both the protein and the mRNA levels of CTSL were reduced in UbcH7-depleted cells. Lamin A/C interacted with 53BP1 under normal conditions. DNA damage disrupted the lamin A/C-53BP1 interaction, which preceded the degradation of 53BP1 in soluble, but not chromatin-enriched, cellular fractions. Inhibition of 53BP1 degradation by a proteasome inhibitor or by UbcH7 depletion restored the 53BP1-lamin A/C interaction. Depletion of lamin A/C, but not CTSL, caused a similar enhancement in cell sensitivity to DNA damage as UbcH7 depletion. These data suggest that multiple pathways collectively fine-tune the cellular levels of 53BP1 protein to ensure proper DSB repair and cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2594483659,"High tuberculosis (TB) burden countries should consider systematic screening among adults in the general population. We identified symptom screening rules to be used in addition to cough ≥2 weeks, in a context where X-ray screening is not feasible, aiming to increase the sensitivity of screening while achieving a specificity of ≥85%.We used 2010 Zambia South Africa Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Reduction (ZAMSTAR) survey data: a South African (SA) training dataset, a SA testing dataset for internal validation and a Zambian dataset for external validation. Regression analyses investigated relationships between symptoms or combinations of symptoms and active disease. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for candidate rules.Among all participants, the sensitivity of using only cough ≥2 weeks as a screening rule was less than 25% in both SA and Zambia. The addition of any three of six TB symptoms (cough <2 weeks, night sweats, weight loss, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath), or 2 or more of cough <2 weeks, night sweats, and weight loss, increased the sensitivity to ~38%, while reducing specificity from ~95% to ~85% in SA and ~97% to ~92% in Zambia. Among HIV-negative adults, findings were similar in SA, whereas in Zambia the increase in sensitivity was relatively small (15% to 22%).High TB burden countries should investigate cost-effective strategies for systematic screening: one such strategy could be to use our rule in addition to cough ≥2 weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2592202438,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a partial suppression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 on skeletal muscle pH, energetics, and function (MCT1+/- mice). Twenty-four MCT1+/- and 13 wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a rest-exercise-recovery protocol, allowing assessment of muscle energetics (by magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and function. The study included analysis of enzyme activities and content of protein involved in pH regulation. Skeletal muscle of MCT1+/- mice had lower MCT1 (-61%; P < 0.05) and carbonic anhydrase (CA)-II (-54%; P < 0.05) contents. Although intramuscular pH was higher in MCT1+/- mice at rest (P < 0.001), the mice showed higher acidosis during the first minute of exercise (P < 0.01). Then, the pH time course was similar among groups until exercise completion. MCT1+/- mice had higher specific peak (P < 0.05) and maximum tetanic (P < 0.01) forces and lower fatigability (P < 0.001) when compared to WT mice. We conclude that both MCT1 and CAII are involved in the homeostatic control of pH in skeletal muscle, both at rest and at the onset of exercise. The improved muscle function and resistance to fatigue in MCT1+/- mice remain unexplained.-Chatel, B., Bendahan, D., Hourdé, C., Pellerin, L., Lengacher, S., Magistretti, P., Fur, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2591579748,"The objectives of this study were to describe and demonstrate a new model of developing patient reported outcomes (PROs) that are patient-centered, and to test the hypothesis that following this model would result in a qualitatively different PRO than if the typical PRO development model were followed. The typical process of developing PROs begins with an initial list of signs or symptoms originating from clinicians or PRO developers; patient validation of this list ensures that the list (i.e., the new PRO) is interpretable by patients, but not that patient perspectives are central or even represented. The new model begins with elicitation from clinicians and patients independently and separately. These perspectives are formally analyzed qualitatively, and the results are iteratively integrated by researchers, supporting clinical relevance and patient centeredness. We describe the application of this new model to the development of a PRO for urinary signs and symptoms in individuals with neuropathic bladder, and test the hypothesis that the two processes generate qualitatively different instruments using a national validation sample of 300 respondents. Of its 29 items, the new instrument included 13 signs/symptoms derived from existing clinical practice guidelines, with 16 others derived from the patient/focus groups. The three most-endorsed items came from the patients, and the three least-endorsed items came from clinical guidelines. Thematic qualitative analysis of the elicitation process, as well as the results from our national sample, support the conclusion that the new model yields an instrument that is clinically interpretable, but more patient-centered, than the typical model would have done in this context."

Data from 1,814 patients with type 2 diabetes without DR were obtained from a Japanese diabetes registry at Tenri Hospital, Nara, Japan. To assess the independent correlations between baseline PA levels and newly developed DR, the participants were divided into five categories based on their PA levels. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying exposure information was used and adjusted for potential confounders to assess the independent correlations. At baseline, the mean age, BMI, and hemoglobin A1c levels of the patients were 65.5 years, 24.5 kg/m2, and 7.2% (54 mmol/mol), respectively. After 2 years, newly developed DR was confirmed in 184 patients (10.1%). Patients with newly developed DR had longer duration of type 2 diabetes (14.7 versus 11.0 years, p < 0.0001), higher systolic blood pressure (139.2 versus 135.1 mmHg, p = 0.0012), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (74.0 versus 77.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.0382), greater urinary albumin–creatinine ratio (4.00 versus 2.45 mg/mmol, p < 0.0039), and higher HbA1c levels (7.5 versus 7.2%, p = 0.0006) than those without newly developed DR. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for DR development were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.53–1.40; p = 0.557), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.52–1.31; p = 0.421), 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35–0.94; p = 0.027), and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.42–0.94; p = 0.025)for the second, third, fourth, and fifth PA categories, respectively, compared with the reference category of patients with a mean PA of 0 metabolic equivalent of task-hours/week).

However, exogenous supply of vitamin B12 was required to maintain the activity of glycerol dehydratase, resulting in high production cost. To avoid the addition of VB12, we have previously constructed a P3HP biosynthetic route with β-alanine as intermediate, and the present study aimed to improve the P3HP production of this pathway. L-aspartate decarboxylase PanD was found to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the β-alanine pathway firstly. To improve the pathway efficiency, PanD was screened from four different sources (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Corynebacterium glutamicum). And PanD from C. glutamicum was found to have the highest activity, the P3HP production was improved in flask cultivation with this enzyme. To further improve the production, the host strain was screened and the culture condition was optimized. Under optimal conditions, production and content of P3HP reached to 10.2 g/L and 39.1% (wt/wt [cell dry weight]) in an aerobic fed-batch fermentation.

However, relevant thermodynamic parameters are lacking, and equilibrium thermodynamic methods are of no avail because the key parameters can only be determined by kinetic measurement. By modifying KinTek Explorer software, we present a new general method for globally fitting data collected over a range of substrate concentrations and temperatures and apply it to HIV reverse transcriptase. Fluorescence stopped-flow methods were used to record the kinetics of enzyme conformational changes that monitor nucleotide binding and incorporation. The nucleotide concentration dependence was measured at temperatures ranging from 5 to 37 °C, and the raw data were fit globally to derive a single set of rate constants at 37 °C and a set of activation enthalpy terms to account for the kinetics at all other temperatures. This comprehensive analysis afforded thermodynamic parameters for nucleotide binding (Kd, ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS at 37 °C) and kinetic parameters for enzyme conformational changes and chemistry (rate constants and activation enthalpy). Comparisons between wild-type enzyme and a mutant resistant to nucleoside analogs used to treat HIV infections reveal that the ground state binding is weaker and the activation enthalpy for the conformational change step is significantly larger for the mutant. Further studies to explore the structural underpinnings of the observed thermodynamics and kinetics of the conformational change step may help to design better analogs to treat HIV infections and other diseases. Our new method is generally applicable to enzyme and chemical kinetics."

Vertebrate R3 RPTPs consist of five members: PTPRB, PTPRJ, PTPRH and PTPRO, which dephosphorylate tyrosine residues, and PTPRQ, which dephosphorylates phophoinositides. R3 RPTPs are considered novel therapeutic targets in several pathologies such as ear diseases, nephrotic syndromes and cancer. R3 RPTP vertebrate receptors, as well as their known invertebrate counterparts from animal models: PTP52F, PTP10D and PTP4e from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and F44G4.8/DEP-1 from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, participate in the regulation of cellular activities including cell growth and differentiation. Despite sharing structural and functional properties, the evolutionary relationships between vertebrate and invertebrate R3 RPTPs are not fully understood. Here we gathered R3 RPTPs from organisms covering a broad evolutionary distance, annotated their structure and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. We show that R3 RPTPs (i) have probably originated in the common ancestor of animals (metazoans), (ii) are variants of a single ancestral gene in protostomes (arthropods, annelids and nematodes); (iii) a likely duplication of this ancestral gene in invertebrate deuterostomes (echinodermes, hemichordates and tunicates) generated the precursors of PTPRQ and PTPRB genes, and (iv) R3 RPTP groups are monophyletic in vertebrates and have specific conserved structural characteristics. These findings could have implications for the interpretation of past studies and provide a framework for future studies and functional analysis of this important family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2592684053,"Confabulators consistently generate false memories without intention to deceive and with great feelings of rightness. However, to our knowledge, there is currently no known effective treatment for them. In order to fill this gap, our aim was to design a neuropsychological treatment based on current theoretical models and test it experimentally in 20 confabulators sequentially allocated to two groups: an experimental and a control group. The experimental group received nine sessions of treatment for three weeks (three sessions per week). The sessions consisted of some brief material that participants had to learn and recall at both immediate and delayed time points. After this, patients were given feedback about their performance (errors and correct responses). Pre- and post-treatment measurements were recorded. Confabulators in the control group were included in a waiting list for three weeks, performed the pre- and post- measurements without treatment, and only then received the treatment, after which a post-treatment measurement was recorded. This applied to only half of the participants; the other half quit the study prematurely. Results showed a significant decrease in confabulations and a significant increase in correct responses in the experimental group; by contrast, patients in the control group did not improve during the waiting list period. Only control group patients who subsequently received the treatment after serving as controls improved. The effects of the treatment were generalized to patients' everyday lives, as reported by relatives, and persisted over time. This treatment seems to be effective and easy to implement and consequently of clinical interest. Moreover, it also has theoretical implications regarding the processes related to the genesis and/or maintenance of confabulations. In particular, results point to a deficit in early stages of memory retrieval with the preservation of later strategic monitoring processes. Specifically, some of the processes involved may include selective attention or early conflict detection deficits. Future research should test these hypotheses."

Scientists wonder whether the little-studied, dimly lit coral reefs may serve as a lifeboat for shallow reefs under stress. Studies are just getting started to rigorously test this deep reef refuge hypothesis, first proposed in 1996. A recent paper in Science Advances is one of the first, testing whether populations of corals might reseed shallow ones. Researchers suspect reseeding may happen in only a few coral species, but say the reefs may serve as havens for fish that can swim between habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2592156395,"The purpose of this study was to clarify if Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and self-selected exercise intensity are sensitive not only to alterations in the absolute level of arterial saturation (SPO2) but also the rate of change in SPO2. Twelve healthy participants (31.6 ± 3.9 y, 175.5 ± 7.7 cm, 73.3 ± 10.3 kg, 51 ± 7 mL·kg-1·min-1 ) exercised four times on a cycle ergometer, freely adjusting power output (PO) to maintain RPE at 5 on Borg’s 10-point scale with no external feedback to indicate their exercise intensity. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was reduced during three of those trials such that SPO2 decreased during exercise from starting values (>98%) to 70%. These trials were differentiated by the time over which the desaturation occurred: 3.9 ± 1.4 min, -8.7 ± 4.2%•min-1 (FAST), 11.0 ± 3.7 min, -2.8 ± 1.3%•min-1 (MED), and 19.5 ± 5.8 min, -1.5 ± 0.8%•min-1 (SLOW) (P < 0.001). Compared to stable PO throughout the control condition (no SPO2 manipulation), PO significantly decreased across the experimental conditions (FAST = 2.8 ± 2.1 W•% SPO2-1; MED = 2.5 ± 1.8 W•% SPO2-1; SLOW = 1.8 ± 1.6 W•% SPO2-1; P < 0.001). The rates of decline in PO during FAST and MED were similar, with both greater than SLOW. Our results confirm that decreases in absolute SPO2 impair exercise performance and that a faster rate of oxygen desaturation magnifies that impairment."

But nuclear forensic specialists, who rely largely on nuclear test data collected years ago in western deserts, lack a clear picture of how energy from a detonation would propagate in the highly saturated geology of many U.S. port cities. To remedy that, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency last October quietly staged Humming Terrapin: a 2-week test series at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland that detonated nearly 2 metric tons of conventional explosives to simulate nuclear blast effects in shallow water. The team is now sifting the data and building models that would allow forensic experts—if the unimaginable were to occur—to decipher the bomb9s design and perhaps determine who was behind the blast."

Now, they want to see a black hole, or at least its silhouette. Next month, astronomers will harness radio telescopes across the globe to create the equivalent of a single Earth-spanning dish—an instrument powerful enough, they hope, to image black holes backlit by the incandescent gas swirling around them. Their targets are the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*, and an even bigger one in the neighboring galaxy M87."

Myocardial infarction (heart attack) causes irreversible damage to the heart, leaving the survivor with reduced cardiac output and lowering their quality of life. Some animals, such as the zebrafish and the neonatal mouse, have a regenerative capacity, but until now, we have not been able to elucidate any regenerative capability in the adult human heart. Voges et al. have grown immature human cardiac organoids that display an innate ability to regenerate after injury. Unlike in adult tissue, these organoids do not form fibrotic scars and can recover functionally. The organoids provide the first insight into human cardiac regeneration and are a step toward finding a source for cellular therapy after cardiac damage.

Fluorination is a powerful strategy to fine-tune molecular properties in pharmaceutical research, but it is often difficult to place the F atoms exactly where you want them. Pitts et al. report a photochemical reaction applied to polycyclic terpenoid frameworks that reliably fluorinates C–H bonds three or four carbons away from the oxygen in an enone group. The site selectivity in one case distinguished among 65 different aliphatic C–H bonds. The authors postulate a radical mechanism involving H-atom abstraction by the enone in a triplet excited state.

Chiral anomaly is one of the most striking phenomena predicted to occur in Dirac and Weyl semimetals. One of its consequences, the decrease in electrical resistance with applied magnetic field, has been observed in several of these materials, but disentangling it from other, less exotic effects is tricky. Working with nanoplates of the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, Zhang et al. observed two additional signatures of the chiral anomaly in nonlocal transport and optical response. The unusual nonlocal transport was caused partly by the diffusion of valley polarization, which in turn was a consequence of the chiral anomaly. These complementary signatures will make it possible to study the phenomenon more closely.

The clinical success of cancer immunotherapy has been both gratifying and perplexing to immunologists. One unsolved mystery is why fewer than 20% of cancer patients respond to this treatment. Spitzer et al. hypothesized that immune cells influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy reside outside the tumor microenvironment, the focus of most previous research. They used mass cytometry to assess system-wide immune responses that contribute to antitumor immunity in mice treated with immunotherapy. They found that CD4 T cells in peripheral tissues continued to proliferate after tumor rejection and were required for protection against new tumors. These results raise the possibility that therapies exploiting the antitumor activity of CD4 T cells may benefit cancer patients who do not respond to existing immunotherapies.

Live birth has evolved multiple times among vertebrates, most notably in mammals. Although live birth also occurs in some reptiles, including several extinct marine reptiles, it has appeared convincingly to be absent in the Archosauromorphs, the lineage leading to dinosaurs, birds, and crocodiles. Liu et al. describe a previously unknown marine Archosauromorph from the middle Triassic in China, Dinocephalosaurus , which shows evidence of an embryo within the body cavity. Viviparity in marine animals has clear functional advantages, but the lack of evidence for live birth across millions of years in this large group has caused some to question whether its evolution was impossible because of some genetic or developmental constraint. This new evidence suggests that, at least initially, this was not the case.
