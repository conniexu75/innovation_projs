On the other hand, in the presence of added glucose, some tissues show high respiratory rates without carbohydrate utilization (2, 3). In both cases the question of what materials the tissues utilize has not been adequately answered. It was hoped that a quantitative study of the in vitro metabolism of bone marrow in a medium containing no glucose might answer the following questions. Is the rate of oxygen consumption dependent on the presence or absence of glucose? In the absence of aerobic glycolysis, is lactic acid involved in the metabolism of bone marrow cells? How much is the respiratory quotient altered when bone marrow cells are denied glucose?"

https://openalex.org/W206236749,"A method of fractionation of proteins in solution in which an electrophoretic adaptation of the principles of the Clusius column is utilized was suggested by Kirkwood in 1941 (1) and tested experimentally by Nielsen and Kirkwood (2) several years later. Recently an electrophoresis-convection apparatus of improved design has been described and successfully used in the fractionation of the pseudoglobulin of horse diphtheria antitoxin (3) and bovine serum proteins (4). 

Fractionation occurs in a narrow vertical channel between two semipermeable membranes, connecting an upper and lower reservoir. Separation depends upon the superposition of diflerential horizontal electrophoretic transport of the components on vertical convective transport of the solution as a whole. The vertical convective transport is controlled by the horizontal density gradient produced by the electrophoretic migration of the proteins across the channel. The result of the superposition of horizontal electrophoretic transport and vertical convective transport is movement of the mobile components from the top reservoir to the bottom reservoir at rates depending on their mobilities, with a relative enrichment of the top reservoir with respect to the slow components and the bottom reservoir with respect to the fast components. 

The separation of a protein mixture possessing discrete mobility and isoelectric point spectra, e.g. serum, into its constituent proteins is accomplished by successive immobilization of the components at their respective isoelectric points and transport of the mobile components from the top reservoir of the apparatus."

https://openalex.org/W2082452170,"Introduction THE photo-disintegration of atomic nuclei by high-energy X-rays is well known ; but there seems previously to have been no record of the production of radioactivity in animal tissues. In view ofthaocvious radiobiological and medical importance of any such phenomena, we have carried out pre-lirimiary observations on rat tissues exposed to beams of X*rays from the Royal Cancer Hospital synchrotron. It was found that there is no difficulty in demonstrating induced activity in the tissues, and we have therefore attempted to find out what elements are responsible for the activity, the order of radioactivity induced, and to assess its biological significance."

Where, as in the rumen microflora of the ox3, biochemical observations have been attempted, they have shown that the iodophile material is a polysaccharide. A knowledge of the mechanism of such synthesis is essential, therefore, to a fuller understanding of the chemical changes accompanying the microbial breakdown of dietary carbohydrates, including starch and cellulose, in the rumen and cæcum of various animal species."

https://openalex.org/W2409260913,"AT the recent Newcastle meeting of the British Association, the Botany and Zoology Sections jointly held a symposium on the artificial induction of mutations. Dr. P. T. Thomas (Aberystwyth) reviewed the work on the induction of cytoplasmic changes by the action of chemical agents. He pointed out that when such changes are induced in lower organisms, as in yeasts, they often appear to be relatively stable, indicating that the cytoplasm in these organisms is incompletely subordinated to the control of the nucleus. In higher organisms, on the other hand, cytoplasmie changes are of limited duration (Dauermodifikation), although they may last through several sexual generations."

Volume 4, Bulletin No. 13 of the South African Archæological Society contains a number of interesting articles. The Abbé Breuil describes some newly discovered rock-shelter paintings near Ladybrand, the technique of which is reminiscent, of the Franco-Cantabrian art. Is it going to be found that prior to the already well-known rock-shelter paintings in the sub-continent there existed there an earlier, more naturalistic art? Breuil also discusses the age of the painted rocks and their authors. The last word has not been said on this subject."

A formal opening of the laboratories in which it is installed was held on July 5, and was attended by representatives of the Medical Research Council, Atomic Energy Research Establishrnent, Ministry of Health, and other bodies. Some of the technical detail of the tit has already been described in Nature1 by Fry, Gallop, Goward and Dain, who were responsible for its development."
