Following digestion of the histone with trypsin and Pronase, the peptides and amino acids were fractionated by exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. All of the radioactivity of the 14C-acetate-labeled f2a1 histone was recovered in one peak which was identified as e-N-acetyllysine."

https://openalex.org/W2047887257,"Oral speech develops in the human infant as an outgrowth of his contact with older humans who are continuously using language. A deaf mute fails to speak because he never hears the acoustic patterns which make up words. He has no sound patterns to follow, no models to imitate. If the ear itself is functioning but the child is mentally retarded, he may be able to hear but not to imitate. Again, he does not learn to speak. A normal ear, a normal brain and speech organs, the continuous hearing of spoken language, and a great deal of imitation are necessary for the completion of the process."

https://openalex.org/W1583136696,"Abstract Neuraminidase of rat liver is now shown to possess the latency characteristic of lysosomal enzymes. Particular conditions were required for this demonstration, since the enzyme is sensitive to many treatments usually used in such studies. Assay conditions are described which indicate that rat liver has much higher neuraminidase activity than heretofore reported. Since EDTA is moderately inhibitory, and divalent cations are stimulating to some extent, metal is probably involved in the action of the enzyme. However, anion effects are also reported herein. α1-Glycoprotein and a glycopeptide fraction derived from this protein showed substrate activity comparable to that of sialyllactose, whereas a brain ganglioside preparation was a poorer substrate. Analysis of subcellular fractions from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells indicated that most of the neuraminidase of these cells is present in the fraction containing lysosomes and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1529410735,"Abstract Effects of a complex polyene antibiotic, filipin, and its four components were studied upon biological (erythrocyte) and artificial (liposome) membranes in order to test the hypothesis of polyene action. The hemolytic activity of filipin complex could be removed more effectively by liposomes which had cholesterol incorporated (phosphatidyl choline (7)-dicetylphosphate (2)-cholesterol (1)) than by cholesterol-lacking spherules (phosphatidyl choline (7)-dicetylphosphate (2)-cholesterol (0)). The order of hemolytic activity of filipin components was: filipin II ≅ filipin III >> filipin I g filipin IV and this order paralleled their biological action. Filipin III, which is the major (53%) component of the complex, preferentially disrupted liposomes prepared with cholesterol (judged by release of CrO4=); filipin II (25% of the complex) indiscriminately disrupted liposomes whether or not cholesterol was present. Filipin I and filipin IV were far less disruptive to the artificial structures. Other phospholipids (sphingomyelin g cardiolipin >> phosphatidyl ethanolamine) were also shown to interact with filipin components. The experiments resolve discrepancies reported with filipin complex, the interaction of which with artificial membranes prepared either with or without cholesterol depends upon the relative enrichment of the complex in one or another of its components and the subsequent polyene-lipid ratio. Consequently, although filipins clearly interact with phospholipids in model systems, no significant objections remain to the general sterol receptor hypothesis of polyene action upon biological membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1602335477,"Abstract A partially purified enzyme preparation has been obtained from urease-negative extracts of urea-grown Candida utilis which catalyzes the Mg++- and K+-dependent decomposition of 1 mole of urea to 1 mole of carbon dioxide and 2 moles of ammonia, concomitant with the cleavage of 1 mole of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. This activity is also found in extracts of the green alga Chlorella when the organism is grown on urea as sole nitrogen source. Potent inhibition of the reaction by avidin (with nullification of this effect by biotin) suggests that the process is mediated via a biotin-containing enzyme. The possible significance of this new reaction in the utilization of urea carbon and nitrogen for biosynthetic purposes is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565030246,"Abstract The additional lactate dehydrogenase isozyme from rabbit testis and sperm, lactate dehydrogenase isozyme-1 (B4) from heart, and lactate dehydrogenase isozyme-5 (A4) from liver have been separated and partially purified by preparative starch gel electrophoresis. Studies performed on these fractions comprised Km and optimum substrate concentration for pyruvate, α-ketobutyrate, and lactate, inhibition by substrate and product, effect of oxamate, oxalate, urea, some citric acid cycle metabolites, pH, and heating. Results indicate that rabbit testicular lactate dehydrogenase isozyme is a distinct molecular form with peculiar catalytic properties. It showed different behavior against high substrate concentrations whether the direct or the reverse reaction was studied: striking inhibition by pyruvate, no effect with lactate. There is a remarkable correlation between these properties and metabolic requirements of mature spermatozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1596249613,"Abstract The Clemmensen reduction procedure has been adapted for the tritiation of kryptogenin to obtain cholest-5-ene-3β, 26-diol-3H. Intravenous administration of cholest-5-ene-3β,26-diol to the bile fistula rat and hamster was followed by rapid excretion of bile acid metabolites in bile. Cholic acid was identified as a metabolite of cholest-5-ene-3β,26-diol by reverse isotope dilution in five hamsters and three rats. In addition, a monohydroxy bile acid, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, was identified as a metabolite of cholest-5-ene-3β,26-diol. It seems possible, therefore, that a pathway from cholesterol to primary bile acid can exist which begins with the oxidation of the side chain to a C-24 carboxylic acid and is followed by alterations of the steroid ring."

https://openalex.org/W1484240844,"Abstract The incorporation of labeled amino acids into the α and β chains of hemoglobin has been studied in rabbit reticulocytes. Relative rates of synthesis were assessed by measurement of the specific activities of globin and of constituent α and β chains prepared from unpurified, ribosomefree hemolysates. The α:β specific activity ratio of approximately 1.0 indicated that labeled α and β chains were produced in nearly equal numbers. However, in hemoglobin which was purified from these hemolysates two features were noted that indirectly suggested the presence of a pool of α chains and a smaller pool of β chains: (a) the α:β specific activity ratio was less than 1.0, and (b) a loss of α chain radioactivity and a smaller loss of β chain radioactivity were observed following purification of the hemoglobin. More direct evidence for these previously formed pools has been found in (a) the radioactivity elution pattern observed on gel filtration of unpurified hemolysate, which revealed a radioactive protein of high specific activity, and (b) further analysis of this minor peak by ion exchange chromatography, peptide mapping, and spectrophotometry. Incubation with added hemin (1 x 10-4 m) was associated with (a) an increase in the specific activities of globin and of α and β chains, (b) the disappearance of the pool of β chains, which probably existed as αβ dimers, (c) persistence of a pool of α chains during the periods of incubation used, and (d) an increase in the α:β specific activity ratio in purified hemoglobin. A model of hemoglobin biosynthesis is suggested which could account for the observed effects of added hemin in terms of (a) stimulation of the synthesis of α and β chains, (b) combination of hemin with αβ dimers (globin) to form hemoglobin, and (c) promotion of the assembly of newly synthesized α and β chains, thus largely bypassing the pool of α chains. In this manner, heme may be said to coordinate as well as stimulate the synthesis of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1601723346,"Abstract The role of surface binding on the Ca++ translocation in mitochondria has been studied. The Ca++ bound at the mitochondrial surface in the absence of respiration is translocated to the inner mitochondrial spaces at the initiation of respiration. Impermeant cations, which compete with Ca++ for the binding at the mitochondrial surface, also affect the rate of aerobic Ca++ translocation. The initial rates of aerobic Ca++ uptake and of related processes, such as H+ release and oxygen consumption, are about 40% slower in 0.125 m KCl than in 0.25 m sucrose. Inhibition by K+ of the surface binding and of the rate of Ca++ translocation parallel each other although the degree of inhibition is higher in the former process. Surface binding of Ca++ is also reduced by the addition of Mg++, by lowering the pH, or by increasing the osmolarity of the medium, and the rates of oxygen uptake and H+ release undergo a parallel decrease. The effect of surface binding on the aerobic stoichiometries and the mechanism of Ca++ translocation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1645405255,"The present study describes the isolation and partial purification of a particulate preparation from Micrococcus cerificans which actively catalyzes the net synthesis of CDP-diglyceride from CTP and phosphatidic acid. 14C-CTP was utilized to develop a sensitive quantitative assay for the phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase. A detailed study of the effects of various factors affecting the enzyme activity in vitro resulted in the observation that the bacterial enzyme has virtually an absolute requirement for K+ and a non-ionic detergent. These factors appear to represent the major differences between the bacterial and mammalian form of the enzyme. The specific activity of the best bacterial fraction thus far obtained (8000 µmoles per g of protein per hour) is nearly 100 times greater than any obtained thus far from mammalian sources. By utilizing the bacterial enzyme, it has been possible to produce CDP-diglyceride biosynthetically with a 58% efficiency based on phosphatidic acid utilization. The primary role of CDP-diglyceride in the bacterial biosynthesis of essential phosphoglycerides as previously shown by other investigators now gains significant support by the demonstration of an active biosynthesis of this compound in bacterial extracts."
https://openalex.org/W192484025,"Abstract A partial purification of adult rat liver carbamyl phosphate synthetase is described. The mitochondrial enzyme has been purified to a specific activity of 23.3 µmoles of citrulline per hour per mg of protein. Kinetic studies reveal Michaelis constants for ammonium ion, bicarbonate, ATP, N-acetylglutamic acid, and magnesium similar to the reported values for frog liver carbamyl phosphate synthetase. Glutamine does not serve as a nitrogen source. Not all of the enzyme was found in the mitochondrial fraction: regardless of the mildness of homogenization, approximately 6 to 8% of the total activity was found in the supernatant. Various pyrimidine nucleotides were found to inhibit carbamyl phosphate synthetase. Detailed kinetic studies with cytidine triphosphate, the most potent of these, showed that at 5 mm half-maximal inhibition is observed. Cytosine derivatives were more potent inhibitors than uracil derivatives, and triphosphates more potent than the monophosphates. The inhibition by CTP was not altered by prior exposure of the enzyme to heat or mercuric chloride; however, in the presence of CTP, carbamyl phosphate synthetase was stabilized during heat inactivation. The limited amounts of carbamyl phosphate synthetase in rat liver supernatant and its inhibition by pyrimidine metabolites suggest its potential importance as a regulatory site in pyrimidine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1499314919,"Abstract A cell-free protein-synthesizing system from rabbit reticulocytes has been used to study amino acid incorporation with the use of polyribonucleotides of defined sequences as messengers. The following polyribonucleotide messengers were tested, and the amino acids incorporated in response to the corresponding messenger are shown in parentheses: poly r-U (Phe), poly r-A (Lys), poly r-C (Pro), poly r-UG (Val, Cys), poly r-AC (His, Thr), poly r-UC (Leu, Ser), poly r-AUC (His, Ile, Ser), poly r-GUA (Ser, Val), poly r-AUG (Asp, Met), poly r-CAA (Asn, Gln, Thr), and poly r-UUG (Val, Cys, Leu). No amino acid was incorporated in response to UAG and UGA codons. Reticulocyte ribosome preparations, after preincubation in the cell-free protein-synthesizing system to remove endogenous messenger RNA and washing with glycerol, still retained most of the enzymic activities required for protein synthesis. Such ribosome preparations were almost free of endogenous amino acids and transfer RNA. When tested in the presence of the above mentioned polyribonucleotide messengers but in the absence of lysate, these ribosome preparations gave amino acid incorporations similar to those described above. In addition, particularly in the presence of high Mg++ concentration, poly r-UG stimulated incorporation of methionine and tyrosine in addition to valine and cysteine and poly r-UUG stimulated incorporation of isoleucine and tyrosine in addition to valine, leucine, and cysteine. Competition experiments with unlabeled amino acids allowed the following ambiguous codon assignments: GUG for methionine, UGU for tyrosine, and GUU for isoleucine."
https://openalex.org/W1536092884,"Abstract Because enzyme-active sites have been identified by covalent bonding of substrate derivatives, we presumed that a similar approach might be used to characterize macromolecular steroid-binding sites. Accordingly, 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol was synthesized and the structure was determined by analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Elemental analysis was compatible with monosubstitution of mercury. Under physiological conditions, 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol reacts with cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and reduced glutathione giving a spectral shift with maximal increase in absorbance at 305 mµ. For the reduced glutathione-4-mercuri-17β-estradiol mercaptide, Δe = 3.4 x 103 m-1 cm-1. One mole of egg albumin reacts with 3 moles of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol, indicating three reactive sulfhydryl groups in the native protein. The reaction follows second order kinetics: k = 13.5 m-1 sec-1. When 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol reacts with glutathione or egg albumin in aqueous solution, 33 µm 17β-estradiol has no effect on the rate of mercaptide formation. Under generally similar conditions, the rates of mercaptide formation with glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase (which have allosteric binding sites for 17β-estradiol) are significantly decreased by 33 µm 17β-estradiol. Similar concentrations of cortisol and estriol (studied with pyruvate kinase) have no effect. Further, mercaptide formation between p-chloromercuribenzoate and pyruvate kinase is not inhibited by 33 µm 17β-estradiol. These observations are compatible with a mechanism in which the steroid moiety of 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol delivers mercury to the allosteric binding site for 17β-estradiol. The resulting increase in local concentration favors mercaptide formation with a reactive residue at or near the binding site. Inhibition of mercaptide formation by 17β-estradiol occurs because it can occupy the binding site and thus exclude 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol. These observations indicate that it may be possible to use 4-mercuri-17β-estradiol for identification of amino acid residues at the steroid-binding sites of high affinity present in steroid-converting enzymes and in receptor proteins of target organs."
https://openalex.org/W1649905020,"Abstract The methylglucose polysaccharide (MGP) from mycobacterial species was digested with α-amylase and glucoamylase and then partially hydrolyzed with acid, and the resulting oligosaccharides were reduced with sodium borotritide. By means of gel filtration and paper chromatography, an homologous series of α-(1 → 4)-linked oligosaccharides containing only 6-O-methylglucose were isolated, the largest of which was a decasaccharide. Exhaustive digestion of MGP by α-amylase and glucoamylase released 4 sugar residues per molecule of polysaccharide, 3 glucose units, and 1 of 3-O-methylglucose. Since these four sugars were released, in part, as a tetrasaccharide by α-amylase, and since the newly exposed nonreducing terminus was 6-O-methylglucose, it follows that the tetrasaccharide was attached as a unit to the 6-O-methylglucose-containing section of the main chain of the polysaccharide. From the total glucose content of the polysaccharide (7 moles) and the fact that 6 moles were assigned to the main chain, it is concluded that the glucose-containing side chain is a single glucose unit attached to position 3 of the first 6-O-methylglucose unit in the main chain. Confirmation of the above conclusions was obtained in other experiments. MGP was oxidized by sodium periodate, the polyaldehyde was reduced with sodium borotritide, and the products obtained by acid hydrolysis were determined. These were erythritol (4 moles), glycerol (2.6 moles), 1-O-methylerythritol (8.9 moles), glucose (1 mole), 6-O-methylglucose (1 mole), and 3-O-methylglucose (1 mole). Mild acid hydrolysis of the periodate-oxidized and borohydride-reduced MGP yielded 6-O-methylglucosyl-(1 → 2) erythritol and α-glucosyl-(1 → 1)-glycerol. The data presented here and in the preceding publications allow us to propose the complete structure for the polysaccharide. A search for 6-O-methylglucose-containing lipopolysaccharides in species of Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, and Nocardia gave negative results. Because these bacteria are thought to be among the closest phylogenetic relatives of the mycobacteria, the methylglucose lipopolysaccharide may be unique to this genus. The intact lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the growth of selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1559896750,"Abstract A highly purified nucleoside diphosphokinase from bovine liver mitochondria showed no signs of heterogeneity as judged by disc electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, or gel filtration. The following physical constants of the enzyme were measured or calculated: Stokes' radius (a), 39.1 A, diffusion coefficient (D20,w), 5.49 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, sedimentation coefficient (s20,w), 5.64 S, apparent partial specific volume (Vapp), 0.77 cm3 g-1, molecular weight, 109,000 g mole-1, and frictional ratio (f/f0), 1.22. When the purified enzyme was incubated in the presence of Mg++ and 32P-labeled ATP at pH 8.5, a stable phosphoenzyme intermediate was formed. After removing excess 32P-ATP by gel filtration, the radioactive phosphoenzyme was shown to transfer its label to ADP, a finding consistent with a ping-pong reaction mechanism previously deduced from kinetic studies. The native enzyme was found to react with 4.0 moles of p-chloromercuribenzoate per 105 g of protein, whereas the sodium lauryl sulfate-treated enzyme reacted with 7.9 moles of either p-chloromercuribenzoate or silver nitrate."
https://openalex.org/W1575470294,"Abstract The 6-O-methylglucose-containing polysaccharide (MGP), from mycobacterial species, is known to have a branched structure, with 3-O-methylglucose and glucose at the non-reducing termini. A glucose unit at the reducing terminus is linked glycosidically to the 2-hydroxyl of d-glyceric acid. This paper describes further studies which are aimed at defining the structure of the reducing end of the polysaccharide. The aglycon of MGP has been converted to the methyl ester which was reduced with sodium borotritide. α-Glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-glycerol-3H and α-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-α-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-glycerol-3H were isolated from a partial acid hydrolysate of the radioactive product, thus establishing the configuration of the glucosidic linkage to glyceric acid. The aglycon of MGP was removed by a Lossen rearrangement, and the glucose residue at the reducing terminus was reduced with sodium borotritide to yield r-MGP*. A radioactive disaccharide, which accumulated during partial acid hydrolysis of r-MGP*, was isolated in 25% yield. It was characterized as isomaltitol. Acid hydrolysis of methylated r-MGP* gave 1,2,3,4,5-penta-O-methylglucitol as the only radioactive product. Three other radioactive oligosaccharides, a tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharide, derived from the reducing end of the polysaccharide, were isolated from a partial acid hydrolysate of r-MGP*. The trisaccharide was characterized as β-Glcp-(1 → 3)-α-Glcp-(1 → 6)-glucitol-3H; the tetrasaccharide was 6-O-methyl-α-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-Glcp-(1 → 3)-α-Glcp-(1 → 6)-glucitol-3H; and the pentasaccharide was α-Glcp-(1 → 3)-6-O-methyl-α-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-Glcp-(1 → 3)-α-Glcp-(1 → 6)-glucitol-3H. Coupled with the results outlined in the previous paragraph, the structures of these oligosaccharides define the configurations and linkages for the first 5 residues at the reducing end of the molecule. A procedure employing well known reactions was adapted for the selective stepwise degradation of oligosaccharides from the reducing end. This involved reduction of the reducing terminal sugar residue and selective oxidation of the resulting polyol with dilute periodate. The oxidized fragment was reduced and the small reduced aglycon was then cleaved from the remainder of the molecule by mild acetolysis. A single application of the method to isomaltotriose and the radioactive trisaccharide from r-MGP* gave isomaltose and laminaribiose, respectively. A re-examination of the methanolized products of methylated MGP by gas liquid chromatography provided direct evidence for a single (1 → 6) linkage in the polysaccharide. The sugars, in an acid hydrolysate of methylated α-amylase-digested MGP, were reduced with sodium borotritide, oxidized by sodium periodate, and reduced a second time. The products contained radioactive 2,4,6-tri-O-methylglucitol, 2,3-di-O-methylthreitol, and 2,3,4-tri-O-methylxylitol plus 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylglucitol in the approximate molar ratios 1:8:3. Therefore, a single (1 → 3) linkage is also present in the main chain of MGP. With the exception of this linkage, the (1 → 6) linkage mentioned above, and the branch point linkage, all remaining linkages in the polysaccharide appear to be of the (1 → 4) type. The substrate specificities of two enzymes used for structural analyses, an α-glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger and an α-glucosidase from the yeast, Debaryomyces vanryi, were investigated. At low substrate concentrations the former is highly specific for α-(1 → 4)-linked glucosyl residues, while the latter hydrolyzes a much broader spectrum of α-glucosides."
https://openalex.org/W1539450818,"Abstract Exploration of the regulatory factors governing the progressive augmentation of rat liver histidase during postnatal development has revealed that increased estrogen secretion during puberty is responsible for the steep rise in the activity of this hepatic enzyme characteristic of the maturing female. Ovarian ablation at 23 days of age depressed the rate of developmental rise in this enzyme to that observed in the male. 17β-Estradiol administration to such ovariectomized rats throughout the adolescent period evoked a precocious rise in hepatic histidase activity, which finally achieved adult levels of 2.5-fold those of estrogen-deprived animals. In the adult female, hepatic histidase is reversibly controlled by estrogen; the activity of this liver enzyme may be depressed upon ovariectomy and restored with 17β-estradiol administration. Progesterone, alone or in the presence of estradiol, is without effect on this enzyme. Investigation of the molecular processes which underlie the estrogenic regulation of hepatic histidase during puberty and in the adult has been initiated. Incubation in vitro of mixtures of liver homogenates from adult males and females indicates that neither dissociable enzyme activators nor inhibitors are responsible for the sexual dichotomy in the histidase activity levels observed in the adult. Administration in vivo of either l-ethionine, which inhibits protein synthesis, or actinomycin D, which blocks RNA production, suppresses both the normal developmental rise in histidase during puberty and the estrogenic enhancement of this enzyme in adults. Thus, continued protein synthesis and transcriptional activity are requisite to, and perhaps augmented elaboration of specific RNA and protein macromolecules underlie, both the developmental and hormonally induced enhancement in histidase level."

https://openalex.org/W1983788676,"THE immunosuppressive properties of anti-lymphocyte serum have attracted a great deal of attention. Most work has been carried out with antisera against lymphocytes of laboratory animals1–3, but some clinical studies have also been made using anti-human lymphocyte serum (AHLS)4. Clinical work, however, is handicapped by the lack of method of assaying the immunosuppressive potency of AHLS in vitro. It has been shown that the stimulation of nucleic acid which is induced by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in human lymphocytes in vitro is broadly similar to that induced by antigens5–8. We have therefore studied the effect of anti-mouse lymphocyte serum (AMLS) on the response of mouse peripheral lymphocytes to PHA in vitro in the hope of establishing a correlation with the graft protecting potency of the serum. If a correlation could be established it seemed that analogous assays of AHLS might be used as a guide to its graft protecting potency."
https://openalex.org/W1593061951,"Abstract In a cell-free system prepared from human leukocytes, synthesis of deoxythymidine is catalyzed by a transfer of deoxyribosyl from a deoxynucleoside to thymine (pyrimidine deoxyribosyltransferase) and by a coupled deoxynucleoside phosphorylase mechanism in which deoxythymidine is synthesized from the deoxyribose-1-P formed after phosphorolytic cleavage of either purine or pyrimidine deoxynucleosides. Both enzymatic mechanisms participate in deoxythymidine synthesis with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides as the deoxyribosyl donor. However, the proportion synthesized by either mechanism is dependent on the concentration of deoxynucleoside. At concentrations above 5 mm the transferase is the predominant enzymatic mechanism. Purine deoxynucleosides, on the other hand, participate in deoxythymidine synthesis only by a coupled deoxynucleoside phosphorylase mechanism. Rates of deoxythymidine synthesis with purine deoxynucleosides as deoxyribosyl donors were approximately one-tenth to one-thirtieth of the rates with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides. The constant ratio of transferase to phosphorylase through a 140-fold purification and during heat inactivation studies suggests that both activities are the function of one protein. In the presence of thymine and both deoxyuridine and deoxyribose-1-P, synthesis of deoxythymidine occurs independently by both enzymatic mechanisms, indicating that there are separate sites for each deoxyribosyl donor."

https://openalex.org/W1530889893,"Abstract Polynucleotide phosphorylase of Micrococcus luteus (formerly Micrococcus lysodeikticus) is converted to a primer-dependent form by limited tryptic hydrolysis. Evidence is presented which indicates that the loss of a portion of the polypeptide is not itself responsible for the loss of ability to initiate polymerization. Thus, the primer-dependent enzyme obtained after tryptic hydrolysis is converted to primer-independent enzyme by reduction with sulfhydryl reagents. It can then be reconverted to primer dependence by reaction with sulfhydryl inhibitors. Under suitable conditions these treatments have a selective effect on the ability of the enzyme to polymerize ADP in the absence of primer. Neither the ability to phosphorolyze polyribonucleotide nor the ability to polymerize in the presence of primer is markedly affected. Therefore it appears that the tryptic hydrolysis is accompanied by the modification of one or more sulfurcontaining amino acids. This modification is incompatible with polymerization unless a primer is present. Preliminary experiments on the nature of these residues in the original enzyme are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1561960166,"Abstract Potentiometric and spectrophotometric titrations of staphylococcal enterotoxin B have been carried out in 0.16 m KCl at 25°. Potentiometric titration results indicate that the titration curves are essentially reversible between pH 1.50 and 11.0. All of the ionizable groups in enterotoxin B found from the titration curves are consistent with the amino acid composition which has been reported in the literature. The intrinsic pK values of individual ionizable groups and the electrostatic interaction factor, w, have been calculated. Spectrophotometric titration of enterotoxin B reveals that approximately 6 tyrosyl residues which have a pKint of 10.3 are titrated normally, while 8 tyrosyl groups are titrated between pH 11 and 12, and 7 tyrosyl residues are titrated between pH 12.0 and 13.5. Acetylation of enterotoxin B with acetylimidazole indicates that 5 to 6 tyrosyl residues are present in enterotoxin B. Urea (8 m) had only a slight effect on the spectrophotometric titration and renders 10 tyrosyl groups available for acetylation. The tyrosyl groups are available for titration in 5 m guanidine-hydrochloride, however, only 14 tyrosyl residues are acetylated when 100-fold molar excess of acetylimidazole is used. All of the tyrosyl residues are available for acetylation with acetylimidazole in the presence of 5 m guanidine-hydrochloride when 300-fold molar excess of the reagent is used. Nitration of enterotoxin B with tetranitromethane revealed that 6 tyrosyl residues are available for the reaction. Essentially no loss of biological activity is observed when 6 free tyrosyl residues are chemically modified. However, antigen-antibody reaction was diminished when the abnormal tyrosyl residues were acetylated. Since conformational change has been observed after exposure of the abnormal tyrosine groups, the role of hydrophobic interactions for maintaining the rigid structure of enterotoxin B is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1503158388,"Investigation of the metabolism of d- and dl-dethiobiotin in Aspergillus niger has revealed the following. 14C-5-Methyl-2-oxo-4-imidazolidine-butyric acid (the 2-carbon shorter side chain analogue) and 14C-5-methyl-2-oxo-4-imidazolidine-acetic acid (the 4-carbon shorter side chain analogue) have been characterized following their isolation by charcoal adsorption and anion exchange chromatography from culture filtrates of A. niger grown on medium enriched with carbonyl-labeled dethiobiotin. Another metabolite has been similarly isolated from both carbonyl- or carboxyl-labeled dethiobiotin and shown to be the l-sulfoxide of biotin. The corresponding shorter side chain analogues of biotin do not accumulate when the carbonyl-labeled vitamin is supplied to growing cultures of A. niger. Both d and l stereoisomers of dethiobiotin seem to be degraded by A. niger to the same over-all extent. Specific activities of the 14C-catabolites indicate that stepwise β-oxidation of the dethiobiotin side chain accounts for the results satisfactorily, and that the l isomer may be somewhat more efficiently converted to its 2-carbon shorter analogue, but the d isomer of the 2-carbon shorter analogue may be more efficiently degraded to its 4-carbon shorter analogue. Some cleavage of the ureido ring system occurs as 14CO2 is lost from carbonyl-labeled dethiobiotin as well as from carboxyl-labeled biotin."

The presence of both ATP and UTP has little influence on the rates observed with r(A)n or r(U)n. With d(A)n or d(T)n, however, the noncomplementary substrate influences the extent of incorporation of the complementary substrate, and both the complementary and the noncomplementary nucleotides are incorporated into product strands. The addition of a second complementary homopolymer exerts a profound stimulatory influence on the template capacity of the first template strand. A polydeoxynucleotide strand is more effective in this enhancement than a polyribonucleotide strand. Furthermore, the enhancement is observed whether or not the second strand is itself serving as a template for RNA polymerase activity. These data are examined with regard to possible rate-governing factors."
https://openalex.org/W1484478972,"Abstract Optical rotation and optical rotatory dispersion were used to study the structural conformation of flagellin, the constituent protein of flagellar filaments of bacteria. Flagellins from four mesophilic bacteria undergo a reversible transition in the pH range of 2 to 4, whereas flagellins from three thermophiles do not. Flagellin from a bacterium with an intermediate maximum growth temperature undergoes an intermediate transition. The relative differences in the acid stability of the flagellins apparently reflect the differences in heat stability observed for the respective flagellins and flagellar filaments studied. The relative resistance of bacterial flagella to disruptive agents depends at least in part on the inherent stability of the flagellin subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1978651078,"THE range of chemical agents which can produce sterility in experimental male rodents is gradually increasing. (For recent surveys, see Jackson1,2.) The list includes nitroaromatic compounds, for example, nitrofuranes, nitrothiazoles and nitropyrroles, besides a variety of compounds of the alkylating category. Recently, a nitrothiazole derivative, niridazole (‘Ambilhar’), has been introduced for the treatment of schistosomiasis3,4 and part of its effective toxic action involves damage to the gonads of the male and female parasite. Reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis in mice by this compound has been described5. Here we wish briefly to record the ability of two simple unrelated substances, ethylenedimethanesulphonate (EDS) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) effectively to inhibit the reproductive capacity of Schistosoma mansoni within the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W1490262186,"Abstract The hemoglobin molecule lost part of its α-helical structure when its tertiary structure was disrupted by the addition of 2-chloroethanol. The molecular weight was reduced to one-fourth. The observed decrease in helix content was directly in parallel with the decrease in the magnitude of the Cotton effect in the Soret absorption band. This phenomenon was attributed to the dependence of the secondary structure formation on the interaction between peptide chains and the prosthetic heme group. In 20 to 50% of aqueous 2-chloroethanol, the hemoglobin molecule assumes a partially helical random coil, and it was characterized by the measurement of intrinsic viscosity, by the effect of temperature on its structure, and by fast deuterium exchange of the amide hydrogens. In aqueous 2-chloroethanol solution of more than 50%, the fraction of helix in the peptide chain increased along with the concentration of 2-chloroethanol. This was found to be a common phenomenon for denatured proteins of various kinds."

https://openalex.org/W1546398594,"Abstract In a cell-free system prepared from human leukocytes, the syntheses of deoxythymidine and deoxyuridine from pyrimidine base and deoxyribose-1-P, catalyzed by deoxythymidine phosphorylase, are inhibited by purine bases and purine deoxynucleosides. The most effective inhibitors are the 6-oxypurines: hypoxanthine, xanthine, and allopurinol. 6-Mercaptopurine is also a potent inhibitor. The inhibition with a partially purified enzyme is characterized by a decrease in the Vmax and a slight increase in Km for deoxyribose-1-P. Interpretation of the kinetic data with varying concentrations of thymine is complicated by thymine substrate inhibition. However, it is clear that inhibition by purines with varying concentrations of thymine is not primarily due to competition with thymine for the catalytic site but mainly results in a reduction in Vmax. Treatment of the enzyme with thymine prior to the addition of purines greatly diminished the inhibitory effects of purines. Attempts to modify the inhibitor sites selectively with urea, mercury, heat, trypsin, or enzyme aging were unsuccessful. In the presence of urea the enzyme is less sensitive to thymine inhibition, but there is no decrease in purine inhibition. In addition, with increasing concentrations of urea there is a corresponding increase in the apparent Km for thymine. Although both purines and thymine stabilize the enzymes during prolonged dialysis, thymine but not purines also stabilized the enzyme against heat denaturation. Uridine phosphorylase, catalyzing uridine synthesis from uracil and ribose-1-P, is inhibited by 6-mercaptopurine and hypoxanthine but not by allopurinol. Deoxythymidine synthesis by direct transfer of deoxyribosyl from deoxyuridine to thymine (pyrimidine deoxyribosyltransferase) is also inhibited by purines, but the inhibition is slight compared to the inhibition of deoxythymidine synthesis from thymine and deoxyribose-1-P."
