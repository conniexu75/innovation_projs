https://openalex.org/W1972078993,"Rhodium complexes containing chiral phosphine ligands catalyze the hydrogenation of olefinic substrates such as Î±-aminoacrylic acid derivatives, producing chiral products with very high optical yields. Elucidation of the mechanisms of such reactions leads to the conclusion that the stereoselection is dictated not by the preferred initial binding of the substrate to the chiral catalyst, but rather by the much higher reactivity of the minor diastereomer of the catalyst-substrate adduct corresponding to the less favored binding mode."

This has made it nearly impossible to incorporate the valuable characteristics from several wild, diploid Solanum species into the cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum But some wild species have ""endosperm balance numbers"" different from those of most Solanum diploid species, and these numbers or ""effective ploidies"" can be manipulated to create new hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2018847220,"Population experiments with Anolis lizard species demonstrate a relation between the amount of between-species competition and the degree of interspecific resource partitioning (the more the partitioning the less the competition). Specifically, the amount of resource partitioning between the two species (Anolis gingivinus and Anolis wattsi pogus) on the island of St. Maarten is less than that between the two species (Anolis bimaculatus and Anolis wattsi schwartzi) on the island of St. Eustatius. The presence of Anolis wattsi both lowers the growth rates and raises the perch heights of Anolis gingivinus individuals. In contrast, Anolis wattsi has no effect on Anolis bimaculatus. Thus, when there is less resource partitioning, Anolis wattsi has a greater competitive effect. This verifies, for these species, a central assumption of competition theory: the strength of between-species competition is inversely related to the amount of interspecific resource partitioning."

https://openalex.org/W2065686645,Wind-tunnel studies indicate that the geometry of Pinus ovulate cones may enhance the probability of pollen entrapment by aerodynamically predetermining airflow patterns around scale-bract complexes. Pollination experiments reveal that pollen from a particular species has the highest probability of reaching the ovules of its own species. The phenomenon of species-specific pollination appears to be related to the specific morphometry of scale-bract complexes and the terminal settling velocity of pollen of the same species. These data are interpreted as evidence for a reciprocity between the aerodynamic characteristics of airborne pollen and ovulate cones of some conifer species.

https://openalex.org/W2060862497,"The effective area, resistance, and configuration of the apical and basolateral cell membranes of the bullfrog gastric mucosa were studied as a function of acid secretion rate, by alternating-current impedance methods. The drop in transepithelial resistance with acid secretion is attributed to the great increase in apical membrane area (hence conductance) associated with tubulovesicles. There is no evidence of a change in basolateral membrane resistance or of apical membrane premeability per unit area."

A recent experiment done at the University of Paris South in Orsay in which polarization correlations of two photons from the decay of excited calcium 40 are measured is emphasized. (KAW)
