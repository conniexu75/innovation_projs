Private practise, as exemplified in the functions of the family physician, offered, apart from surgery, almost the only opportunity for the use of a medical training. During the past thirty years how extensively have medical activities become diversified. The paths of service that now invite the young physician are so varied that every graduate should be able to select a way for employing his peculiar powers to the best advantage. Quite apart from the conventional career of the physician, the surgeon, or the different specialists, are the opportunities for usefulness in the widespread movements which are socializing medicine. In professional service at hospitals and sanatoriums important work can be done; in boards of health, municipal, state and national; in public propaganda for temperance, for the prevention of infant mortality, for industrial hygiene, for the care of school children; in the campaigns against tuberculosis and venereal disease -in all these activities the possibilities of applying a medical education usefully to social needs are numerous and are yearly increasing. Still another new career open to the young graduate is that of research in the medical sciences. For attracting young men into scholarly careers the medical sciences are, I suspect, at some disadvantage compared with other natural sciences."

https://openalex.org/W2011971211,"While I have wandered from the main subject of the sun, to consider the source of stellar energy, the two topics are so intimately related that their solutions are identical. I consider that I have demonstrated the reasonableness of Jeans's theory by the manner in which it seems to fit the observed facts. There is, as I can see, no important objection to the hypothesis. It is too much to hope that the foregoing analysis is rigidly complete, but I confidently believe that the main points are established and that further modification will consist in the clearing up of details. The application of astrophysics and atomic theory to a new field appears to have met with considerable success. In spite of this success, however, caution is necessary. The present position of the theory advocated in this paper is somewhat analogous to the place once held by the theory of Helmholtz-i.e., it is the only one sufficiently elastic to stretch over the region of known facts. Our knowledge is yet limited and, with our vision thus impaired, we can not predict the future. Some unforeseen event may upset our present hypothesis as completely as that of Helmholtz; we have built as securely as possible upon observation, and it remains for the future to test the accuracy of this or any other theory so established. In an attempt to discover a reasonable explanation of the origin and duration of the solar radiation, all possible sources of energy are examined. The following hypotheses are reviewed and discarded, the arguments against their validity being too well known to necessitate a review at this place; (1) Original Heat; (2) Chemical; (3) Gravitational, (a) Meteoric, (b) Contraction; (4) Radioactive."
