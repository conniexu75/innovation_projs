https://openalex.org/W2116224228,"Most prior studies have found that substituting biofuels for gasoline will reduce greenhouse gases because biofuels sequester carbon through the growth of the feedstock. These analyses have failed to count the carbon emissions that occur as farmers worldwide respond to higher prices and convert forest and grassland to new cropland to replace the grain (or cropland) diverted to biofuels. By using a worldwide agricultural model to estimate emissions from land-use change, we found that corn-based ethanol, instead of producing a 20% savings, nearly doubles greenhouse emissions over 30 years and increases greenhouse gases for 167 years. Biofuels from switchgrass, if grown on U.S. corn lands, increase emissions by 50%. This result raises concerns about large biofuel mandates and highlights the value of using waste products."
https://openalex.org/W2130365445,"Increasing energy use, climate change, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil fuels make switching to low-carbon fuels a high priority. Biofuels are a potential low-carbon energy source, but whether biofuels offer carbon savings depends on how they are produced. Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop–based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a “biofuel carbon debt” by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO 2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. In contrast, biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages."

https://openalex.org/W1974395471,"Despite a century of effort, our understanding of how cities evolve is still woefully inadequate. Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers."

https://openalex.org/W2107015337,"The senile plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease sufferers are thought to develop gradually over years. The involvement of plaques in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is a hotly debated issue. New work, using mutiphoton microscopy to follow plaque formation in vivo in a mouse model of the disease, supports the view that amyloid plaques appear before local neurotoxicity is visible. Surprisingly, senile plaques form rapidly, within 24 hours: within a day or two microglial cells accumulate and neuritic abnormalities start to appear. Based on these observations, it's possible to speculate that the slow degeneration in Alzheimer's disease is marked by sudden changes in cortical structure, and that altering the kinetics of this process might change the rate of disease progression. Senile plaques are thought to accumulate over the course of decades in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. In vivo mutiphoton microscopy is used to follow the birth of such plaques in live Alzheimer's disease model mice. It is found that plaques form extraordinarily quickly, over 24 hours. Within 1–2 days, the microglia move in and noticeable neuritic changes ensue. These data argue that neuritic dysfunction follows, rather than precedes, amyloid deposition. Senile plaques accumulate over the course of decades in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. A fundamental tenet of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease is that the deposition of amyloid-β precedes and induces the neuronal abnormalities that underlie dementia1. This idea has been challenged, however, by the suggestion that alterations in axonal trafficking and morphological abnormalities precede and lead to senile plaques2. The role of microglia in accelerating or retarding these processes has been uncertain. To investigate the temporal relation between plaque formation and the changes in local neuritic architecture, we used longitudinal in vivo multiphoton microscopy to sequentially image young APPswe/PS1d9xYFP (B6C3-YFP) transgenic mice3. Here we show that plaques form extraordinarily quickly, over 24 h. Within 1–2 days of a new plaque’s appearance, microglia are activated and recruited to the site. Progressive neuritic changes ensue, leading to increasingly dysmorphic neurites over the next days to weeks. These data establish plaques as a critical mediator of neuritic pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2008807830,"The transcriptional response to auxin is critical for root and vascular development during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. Auxin induces the degradation of AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors, freeing their binding partners, the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) proteins, which can activate transcription of auxin response genes. We show that TOPLESS (TPL) can physically interact with IAA12/BODENLOS (IAA12/BDL) through an ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF)–associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif. TPL can repress transcription in vivo and is required for IAA12/BDL repressive activity. In addition, tpl-1 can suppress the patterning defects of the bdl-1 mutant. Direct interaction between TPL and ARF5/MONOPTEROS, which is regulated by IAA12/BDL, results in a loss-of-function arf5 / mp phenotype. These observations show that TPL is a transcriptional co-repressor and further our understanding of how auxin regulates transcription during plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2081874733,"We have developed a biomechanical energy harvester that generates electricity during human walking with little extra effort. Unlike conventional human-powered generators that use positive muscle work, our technology assists muscles in performing negative work, analogous to regenerative braking in hybrid cars, where energy normally dissipated during braking drives a generator instead. The energy harvester mounts at the knee and selectively engages power generation at the end of the swing phase, thus assisting deceleration of the joint. Test subjects walking with one device on each leg produced an average of 5 watts of electricity, which is about 10 times that of shoe-mounted devices. The cost of harvesting—the additional metabolic power required to produce 1 watt of electricity—is less than one-eighth of that for conventional human power generation. Producing substantial electricity with little extra effort makes this method well-suited for charging powered prosthetic limbs and other portable medical devices."

https://openalex.org/W2083833353,"We show that silver(I) hexacyanocobaltate(III), Ag3[Co(CN)6], exhibits positive and negative thermal expansion an order of magnitude greater than that seen in other crystalline materials. This framework material expands along one set of directions at a rate comparable to the most weakly bound solids known. By flexing like lattice fencing, the framework couples this to a contraction along a perpendicular direction. This gives negative thermal expansion that is 14 times larger than in ZrW2O8. Density functional theory calculations quantify both the low energy associated with this flexibility and the role of argentophilic (Ag+...Ag+) interactions. This study illustrates how the mechanical properties of a van der Waals solid might be engineered into a rigid, useable framework."
https://openalex.org/W2162632039,"Sometime in the next 20 to 30 years, developing countries in Asia and Africa are likely to cross a historic threshold, joining Latin America in having a majority of urban residents. The urban demographic transformation is described here, with an emphasis on estimates and forecasts of urban population aggregates. To provide policy-makers with useful scientific guidance in the upcoming urban era, demographic researchers will need to refine their data sets to include spatial factors as well as urban vital rates and to make improvements to forecasting methods currently in use."
https://openalex.org/W2073244501,"The proportion of a country's population living in urban areas is highly correlated with its level of income. Urban areas offer economies of scale and richer market structures, and there is strong evidence that workers in urban areas are individually more productive, and earn more, than rural workers. However, rapid urbanization is also associated with crowding, environmental degradation, and other impediments to productivity. Overall, we find no evidence that the level of urbanization affects the rate of economic growth. Our findings weaken the rationale for either encouraging or discouraging urbanization as part of a strategy for economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2082317060,"The majority of people now live in urban areas and will do so for the foreseeable future. As a force in the demographic and health transition, urbanization is associated with falling birth and death rates and with the shift in burden of illness from acute childhood infections to chronic, noncommunicable diseases of adults. Urban inhabitants enjoy better health on average than their rural counterparts, but the benefits are usually greater for the rich than for the poor, thus magnifying the differences between them. Subject to better evidence, I suggest that the main obstacles to improving urban health are not technical or even financial, but rather are related to governance and the organization of civil society."
https://openalex.org/W2026663553,"Reactivated memory undergoes a rebuilding process that depends on de novo protein synthesis. This suggests that retrieval is dynamic and serves to incorporate new information into preexisting memories. However, little is known about whether or not protein degradation is involved in the reorganization of retrieved memory. We found that postsynaptic proteins were degraded in the hippocampus by polyubiquitination after retrieval of contextual fear memory. Moreover, the infusion of proteasome inhibitor into the CA1 region immediately after retrieval prevented anisomycin-induced memory impairment, as well as the extinction of fear memory. This suggests that ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent protein degradation underlies destabilization processes after fear memory retrieval. It also provides strong evidence for the existence of reorganization processes whereby preexisting memory is disrupted by protein degradation, and updated memory is reconsolidated by protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970500614,"Nucleosome-binding proteins act to modulate the promoter chromatin architecture and transcription of target genes. We used genomic and gene-specific approaches to show that two such factors, histone H1 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), exhibit a reciprocal pattern of chromatin binding at many RNA polymerase II–transcribed promoters. PARP-1 was enriched and H1 was depleted at these promoters. This pattern of binding was associated with actively transcribed genes. Furthermore, we showed that PARP-1 acts to exclude H1 from a subset of PARP-1–stimulated promoters, suggesting a functional interplay between PARP-1 and H1 at the level of nucleosome binding. Thus, although H1 and PARP-1 have similar nucleosome-binding properties and effects on chromatin structure in vitro, they have distinct roles in determining gene expression outcomes in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2009560557,"Although vaccination has almost eliminated measles in parts of the world, the disease remains a major killer in some high birth rate countries of the Sahel. On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries, high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics. Here, however, we show that measles epidemics in Niger are highly episodic, particularly in the capital Niamey. Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission—generating high amplitude epidemics—within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice, this leads to frequent stochastic fadeouts, interspersed with irregular, large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage, but still below the local elimination threshold, could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build-up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur. Measles is all but eradicated in many countries, but in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia it remains a major killer. An epidemiological study of measles in Niger between 1986 and 2002, just before a major immunization programme began, shows that the epidemics were unexpectedly episodic, interspersed with periods of local extinction. Modelling points to seasonality in disease transmission as the cause for this variability. This has implications for the management of vaccination campaigns. In particular, as vaccine delivery ramps up towards the goal of eradication, an occasional violent seasonal epidemic can be expected, and vaccination can be optimized to minimize this instability. It is reported that measles epidemics in Niger are unexpectedly episodic, and it is shown through modelling that powerful seasonality in transmission generates high amplitude, chaotic epidemics, with potentially important consequences for vaccine-based control strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2063496234,"The pairing of fermions lies at the heart of superconductivity and superfluidity. The stability of these pairs determines the robustness of the superfluid state, and the quest for superconductors with high critical temperature equates to a search for systems with strong pairing mechanisms. Ultracold atomic Fermi gases present a highly controllable model system for studying strongly interacting fermions. Tunable interactions (through Feshbach collisional resonances) and the control of population or mass imbalance among the spin components provide unique opportunities to investigate the stability of pairing-and possibly to search for exotic forms of superfluidity. A major controversy has surrounded the stability of superfluidity against an imbalance between the two spin components when the fermions interact resonantly (that is, at unitarity). Here we present the phase diagram of a spin-polarized Fermi gas of (6)Li atoms at unitarity, experimentally mapping out the superfluid phases versus temperature and density imbalance. Using tomographic techniques, we reveal spatial discontinuities in the spin polarization; this is the signature of a first-order superfluid-to-normal phase transition, and disappears at a tricritical point where the nature of the phase transition changes from first-order to second-order. At zero temperature, there is a quantum phase transition from a fully paired superfluid to a partially polarized normal gas. These observations and the implementation of an in situ ideal gas thermometer provide quantitative tests of theoretical calculations on the stability of resonant superfluidity."
https://openalex.org/W2056158481,"The diversity and complexity of food webs (the networks of feeding relationships within an ecological community) are considered to be important factors determining ecosystem function and stability. However, the biological processes driving these factors are poorly understood. Resource quality affects species interactions by limiting energy transfer to consumers and their predators, affecting life history and morphological traits. We show that differences in plant traits affect the structure of an entire food web through a series of direct and indirect effects. Three trophic levels of consumers were influenced by plant quality, as shown by quantitative herbivore–parasitoid–secondary parasitoid food webs. We conclude, on the basis of our data, that changes in the food web are dependent on both trait- and density-mediated interactions among species."
https://openalex.org/W2060177226,"Mouse CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes differentiate into CD4+ helper-lineage cells upon expression of the transcription factor Th-POK but commit to the CD8+ cytotoxic lineage in its absence. We report the redirected differentiation of class I-restricted thymocytes into CD4+CD8- helper-like T cells upon loss of Runx transcription factor complexes. A Runx-binding sequence within the Th-POK locus acts as a transcriptional silencer that is essential for Th-POK repression and for development of CD8+ T cells. Thus, Th-POK expression and genetic programming for T helper cell development are actively inhibited by Runx-dependent silencer activity, allowing for cytotoxic T cell differentiation. Identification of the transcription factors network in CD4 and CD8 lineage choice provides insight into how distinct T cell subsets are developed for regulating the adaptive immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2004261895,"Aggregation of alpha-synuclein is a key event in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease. Recent findings suggest that oligomers represent the principal toxic aggregate species. Using confocal single-molecule fluorescence techniques, such as scanning for intensely fluorescent targets (SIFT) and atomic force microscopy, we monitored alpha-synuclein oligomer formation at the single particle level. Organic solvents were used to trigger aggregation, which resulted in small oligomers (""intermediate I""). Under these conditions, Fe(3+) at low micromolar concentrations dramatically increased aggregation and induced formation of larger oligomers (""intermediate II""). Both oligomer species were on-pathway to amyloid fibrils and could seed amyloid formation. Notably, only Fe(3+)-induced oligomers were SDS-resistant and could form ion-permeable pores in a planar lipid bilayer, which were inhibited by the oligomer-specific A11 antibody. Moreover, baicalein and N'-benzylidene-benzohydrazide derivatives inhibited oligomer formation. Baicalein also inhibited alpha-synuclein-dependent toxicity in neuronal cells. Our results may provide a potential disease mechanism regarding the role of ferric iron and of toxic oligomer species in Parkinson diseases. Moreover, scanning for intensely fluorescent targets allows high throughput screening for aggregation inhibitors and may provide new approaches for drug development and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1974445124,"Energy redistribution, including the many phonon-assisted and electronically assisted energy-exchange processes at a gas-metal interface, can hamper vibrationally mediated selectivity in chemical reactions. We establish that these limitations do not prevent bond-selective control of a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction. State-resolved gas-surface scattering measurements show that the ν 1 C-H stretch vibration in trideuteromethane (CHD 3 ) selectively activates C-H bond cleavage on a Ni(111) surface. Isotope-resolved detection reveals a CD 3 :CHD 2 product ratio &gt; 30:1, which contrasts with the 1:3 ratio for an isoenergetic ensemble of CHD 3 whose vibrations are statistically populated. Recent studies of vibrational energy redistribution in the gas and condensed phases suggest that other gas-surface reactions with similar vibrational energy flow dynamics might also be candidates for such bond-selective control."

In this study, structure and function of carboxysomes purified from wild type Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and from a high CO2-requiring mutant that is devoid of carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase were compared.

Many bacteria form intracellular polyhedral microcompartments that act as microbial organelles. They sequester metabolically important enzymes and enhance or regulate their activity. Several molecular mechanisms have been postulated for the way in which microcompartments function (1Cannon G.C. Bradburne C.E. Aldrich H.C. Baker S.H. Heinhorst S. Shively J.M. Appl. Environ.

Two families of small shell proteins appear to be the only common genetic and structural elements among the bacterial microcompartments formed by such metabolically diverse prokaryotes as heterotrophs and autotrophs (1Cannon G.C.

Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 161-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inorganic carbon is actively transported into the cell interior and concentrated in the cytoplasm as bicarbonate, which must first be converted to CO2 by a carboxysome-associated carbonic anhydrase before it can be fixed by RubisCO (8Price G.D.

Direct biochemical studies of β-carboxysomes from cyanobacteria have been hampered by difficulties with the purification of intact particles (1Cannon G.C. Bradburne C.E. Aldrich H.C. Baker S.H.

Shively J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 52-59Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The CbbL and CbbS polypeptides, which account for 60–70% of the total carboxysome protein (3Heinhorst, S., Cannon, G. C., and Shively, J. M. (2006) in Microbial Monographs (Shively, J.

Microbiol. 1983; 134: 52-59Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), represent the large and small subunit, respectively, of RubisCO. The balance of the carboxysome mass is accounted for by polypeptides that are associated with the thin protein boundary membrane, also known as shell. The major structural shell elements are CsoS1A, CsoS1B, and CsoS1C, highly conserved small proteins that are the products of duplicated genes. Recent crystallographic studies of CsoS1A and its cyanobacterial homologs, CcmK2 and CcmK4, have shown that the proteins form hexamers. These pack into sheets and likely form the facets of the icosahedral carboxysome (11Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Tanaka S. Nguyen C.V. Phillips M. Beeby M. Yeates T.O.

PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: 1345-1354Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Each of the hexamers contains a pore that might be involved in the controlled passage of substrates and products into and out of the carboxysome. The other conserved microcompartment constituents, OrfA, OrfB, and CcmL, crystallize as pentamers and may be located on the vertices of the icosahedral particle (13Tanaka S. Kerfeld C.A. Sawaya M.R. Cai F. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. Yeates T.O. Science. 2008; 319: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The CsoS2A and CsoS2B polypeptides, which together account for nearly 12% of the carboxysomal protein by weight (3Heinhorst, S., Cannon, G. C., and Shively, J. M. (2006) in Microbial Monographs (Shively, J. M., ed) Vol. II, pp. 141–164, Springer-Verlag, Berlin HeidelbergGoogle Scholar), are products of a single gene in the cso operon (14Baker S.H. Lorbach S.C.

Their high calculated pI value has led to the speculation that they may act as rudimentary transporters for the phosphorylated RubisCO substrates and products (15Heinhorst S. Williams E.B. Cai F. Murin C.D. Shively J.M. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8087-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The remaining shell protein CsoSCA, which is encoded by the csoS3 gene and only a minor component by weight (15Heinhorst S. Williams E.B. Cai F. Murin C.D. Shively J.M. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8087-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), is the carbonic anhydrase of α-carboxysomes (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Its lack of sequence homology with known carbonic anhydrases led to its original categorization into a novel class (ϵ) (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Subsequent crystallographic analysis, however, revealed that CsoSCA constitutes a subclass of β-carbonic anhydrases that appears to be populated exclusively by α-carboxysomal enzymes (17Sawaya M.R.

The CsoSCA protein is very tightly associated with the shell and is released only under conditions that result in disassembly of the shell. The likely functional form of the carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase is a dimer that is present in only 40 copies/carboxysome. Despite this low number, kinetic characterization of recombinant CsoSCA (rCsoSCA) revealed that the enzyme could supply the ∼270 holoenzyme molecules of carboxysomal RubisCO with a sufficient amount of CO2 to maintain saturating substrate conditions (15Heinhorst S.

In an effort to further assess the biological role of the carboxysomal CA, we have taken advantage of the homogeneous carboxysome preparations that can be obtained from H. neapolitanus to directly compare the biochemical properties of wild type microcompartments with those isolated from a csoS3 insertion mutant that is devoid of carboxysomal carbonic anhydrase activity and requires elevated CO2 levels to grow at normal rates. Cultures—Wild type H. neapolitanus (ATCC 23641) and mutant csoS3::Km cultures were maintained in a bioreactor (INFORS-HT, Switzerland) at a dilution rate of 0.08 h–1 and a pH of 6.4, as previously described (16So A.K.

The overhangs generated by the restriction enzymes were filled in with Escherichia coli PolI Klenow fragment, and the cassette was blunt end-ligated into the linearized pTnEP2.2 to generate pHncsoS3::Km. The wild type csoS3 gene of H. neapolitanus was replaced by the mutant version via homologous recombination following electroporation with pHncsoS3::Km (21English R.S. Jin S. Shively J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3256-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were allowed to recover in medium without antibiotic for 24 h before being transferred to selective medium containing 50 μg·ml–1 kanamycin. All of the cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2-enriched atmosphere. Gene replacement in H. neapolitanus csoS3::Km was verified by sequence determination of genomic DNA and by Southern hybridization. Complementation of H. neapolitanus csoS3::Km—A single colony of the H. neapolitanus csoS3::Km mutant was used to inoculate a liquid culture that was grown at 30 °C in medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells from this culture were transformed with pcsoS3ProEx plasmid DNA (17Sawaya M.R. Cannon G.C. Heinhorst S. Tanaka S. Williams E.B. Yeates T.O. Kerfeld C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) by electroporation (21English R.S. Jin S. Shively J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3256-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This expression construct contains a mutated csoS3 gene that yields enzymatically active rCsoSCA with a His residue instead of Tyr92. Following a 24-h recovery period at elevated CO2 levels, cells that had regained the ability to grow at ambient CO2 levels were selected in medium without antibiotics. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (22Stoner M.T. Shively J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 287-292PubMed Google Scholar) and digested with EcoRI or ClaI. Following gel electrophoresis the DNA fragments were blotted onto a nylon support via alkaline transfer (23Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., and Seidman, J. G. (1998) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 2.9.1–2.9.15, John Wiley and Sons Inc., Boston MAGoogle Scholar). The blot was probed with 32P-labeled csoS3 DNA at 68 °C overnight. Replacement of csoS3::Km by an uninterrupted copy of the gene in H. neapolitanus was confirmed by sequencing of genomic DNA. Isolation of Carboxysomes from Wild Type and Mutant H. neapolitanus—Wild type and csoS3::Km mutant cells from 6–8-liter cultures were used to purify carboxysomes as described before (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because elevated CO2 levels are known to suppress carboxysome formation (24Beudeker R.F. Cannon G.C. Kuenen J.G. Shively J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 124: 185-189Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it was necessary to switch csoS3::Km cells to ambient CO2 levels once the culture had reached the desired density during growth in CO2-supplemented air. All of the protein samples were desalted using Micro-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mm Bicine, pH 8.0. Electron Microscopy—Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids (EMS, Fort Washington, PA) were floated on a solution containing purified carboxysomes for 3 min. The samples were allowed to dry in air for 10 s before being stained with 1% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 40 s. The grids were air-dried for 10 min prior to being observed under a Zeiss EM-109 transmission electron microscope. Photographs of carboxysomes were taken by exposing Kodak EM film 4489 for 2 s. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Carboxysome proteins were separated by electrophoresis in pre-cast Criterion SDS, 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Gelcode Blue (Pierce). Protein blots were probed with polyclonal antiserum raised against H. neapolitanus rCsoSCA (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) as primary antibody and with goat anti-rabbit, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibody. The blots were developed with One-Step NBT-BCIP reagent (Pierce). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Quantity One program supplied with the VersaDoc imaging system (model 4000 MP; Bio-Rad). Radiometric RubisCO Assays—Desalted protein samples were activated in 50 mm Bicine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Na14HCO3 (0.1 μCi·μmol–1) for 10 min. Each 0.5-ml assay contained 50 mm Bicine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RubP) (Fluka brand; Sigma), and the appropriate amount of NaHCO3 to give a final concentration range from 1.45 to 80.2 mm (this includes the contribution of the bicarbonate used to activate RubisCO). In parallel assays, the NaHCO3 concentration was kept at 60 mm, and the RubP concentration was varied from 12.5 to 800 μm. CO2 fixation was initiated by adding 10 μl of activated protein sample. To determine the relative carbon assimilation rates in intact wild type and mutant cells, 25-ml aliquots of bioreactor-grown wild type and mutant cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of sterile medium. To start the reaction, 20-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were added to growth medium that contained radioactive bicarbonate at various concentrations (1.0 μCi·μmol–1). The reactions were stopped at 1-min intervals by adding 100-μl assay aliquots to 300 μl of glacial acetic acid. The vials containing the acidified samples were heated to remove excess 14CO2, cooled, and mixed with 4 ml of ScintiVerse II mixture (Fisher). Radioactivity was counted in a LS 6000SC scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Quench and counting efficiency were determined from a standard curve of 14C-labeled n-hexadecane in 0.3 ml of glacial acetic acid. The initial velocities were calculated from linear regression lines plotted using Prism 4. The Vmax and Km values for CO2 (KC) and RubP were obtained by fitting the results to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetic assays were performed in triplicate and repeated with a minimum of three independent preparations. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations in carboxysome and RubisCO preparations were determined with the BCA assay (Pierce); those in intact cell samples were estimated with a modified Lowry assay (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin served as standard. Generation of the csoS3::Km Mutant—The wild type csoS3 gene of H. neapolitanus, which encodes CsoSCA, was interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette between the ClaI sites in the csoS3 coding sequence to produce plasmid pHncsoS3::Km. Following electroporation of mid-exponential phase, H. neapolitanus cells with this construct and selection of kanamycin-resistant transformants in 5% CO2-enriched air colonies with a high CO2-requiring phenotype were recovered that grew at close-to-wild type rates only at elevated CO2 levels. Gene replacement was confirmed by Southern blotting and sequence analysis of genomic DNA (data not shown). A single high CO2-requiring colony was used to establish the working culture of csoS3::Km. Comparison of mutant and wild type growth rates demonstrated extremely slow growth of csoS3::Km at ambient CO2 levels but nearly wild type rates when the culture was aerated with 5% CO2 in air (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis of crude cell extracts with anti-rCsoSCA antibodies revealed a strong signal for the wild type but undetectable CsoSCA levels in the mutant (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Morphology and composition of wild type and csoS3::Km mutant carboxysomes.

Insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette between the two ClaI sites in the csoS3 gene of the mutant csoS3::Km yielded two diagnostic ClaI restriction fragments of ∼8.3 and 1.1 kilobase pairs, respectively. ClaI-digested genomic DNA from wild type and from clones complemented with plasmid pcsoS3ProEx produced the two wild type size fragments of ∼0.9 and 7.3 kilobase pairs, respectively, indicative of restored csoS3 ClaI sites in the transformants. Furthermore, the restored csoS3 gene, as expected, encoded a His instead of the wild type Tyr residue at position 92 of CsoSCA. This fortuitous mutation, which was introduced during subcloning of the H. neapolitanus csoS3 gene (17Sawaya M.R. Cannon G.C. Heinhorst S. Tanaka S. Williams E.B. Yeates T.O. Kerfeld C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), has no effect on the carbonic anhydrase activity of rCsoSCA (15Heinhorst S. Williams E.B. Cai F. Murin C.D. Shively J.M. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8087-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This mutation was therefore instrumental in documenting that the wild type phenotype in the complemented H. neapolitanus clones resulted from replacement of the interrupted genomic csoS3 copy with a fully functional plasmid-borne gene, presumably by homologous recombination. Isolation of Carboxysomes Lacking CsoSCA—H. neapolitanus csoS3::Km cells were grown in a chemostat under conditions identical to those used to cultivate wild type cells, except that the mutant culture was aerated with air supplemented with 5% CO2. Under these conditions, a dilution rate of 0.08 h–1 was maintained. Removal of the supplemental CO2 resulted in rapid wash-out of the mutant cells and confirmed that a wild type growth rate was supported only at elevated CO2 concentrations. Chemostat efflux was collected and aerated with 5% CO2 in air until ∼6 liters of culture had accumulated. Because the expression of high cellular carboxysome levels is known to be suppressed by high CO2 concentrations (24Beudeker R.F. Cannon G.C. Kuenen J.G. Shively J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 124: 185-189Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the mutant culture in the collection tank was switched to ambient CO2 for 18–24 h prior to cell harvest and subsequent carboxysome purification. Yields of mutant carboxysomes purified by the standard procedure (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were comparable with those from wild type cells (∼10 mg of carboxysome protein/8 g of wet weight of cells). Furthermore, isolated csoS3::Km carboxysomes did not appear to be morphologically different from wild type microcompartments, as judged by electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). The mutant microcompartments were, however, consistently found to be ∼15–20% larger in diameter than their wild type counterparts when analyzed by dynamic light scattering (data not shown). The stopped flow changing indicator assays (25Khalifah R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2561-2573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected no carbonic anhydrase activity in purified mutant carboxysomes at protein concentrations that yielded clear evidence of enzyme activity in wild type microcompartments (Fig. 3). Comparison of the polypeptide composition of both types of carboxysomes by denaturing SDS-PAGE revealed similar but not identical patterns. The most obvious difference was the absence of the CsoSCA band at ∼60 kDa in mutant carboxysomes (Fig. 2D). Immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-rCsoSCA antibodies (16So A.K. Espie G.S. Williams E.B. Shively J.M. Heinhorst S. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) confirmed the absence of detectable amounts of CsoSCA from the mutant microcompartments. Somewhat surprisingly, the molar ratio of CsoS2A to CsoS2B, which is close to 1:1 in wild type carboxysomes (3Heinhorst, S., Cannon, G. C., and Shively, J. M. (2006) in Microbial Monographs (Shively, J. M., ed) Vol. II, pp. 141–164, Springer-Verlag, Berlin HeidelbergGoogle Scholar, 10Cannon G.C. Shively J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 52-59Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was shifted to favor the larger form 2:1 in mutant carboxysomes (Fig. 2D). Carbon Fixation by Mutant Cells—Rates of carbon fixation by bioreactor-grown wild type and mutant cells were determined at various DIC concentrations. Although maximal fixation rates were comparable (0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.13 ± 0.01 μmol·min–1·mg protein–1 for wild type and mutant, respectively), the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (bicarbonate, carbonate, and CO2) required to produce the half-maximal rate (KDIC) was more than three times higher for mutant (KDIC = 3.9 ± 1.0 mm) than for wild type cells (KDIC = 1.1 ± 0.2 mm) (Fig. 4). Moreover, the ratio of wild type to mutant CO2 fixation rate is 3.3 ± 1.0 at ambient CO2 ([DIC] = 26 μm) and 1.5 ± 0.3 at 5% CO2 ([DIC] = 3.3 mm) (26Dean, J. A. (1999) Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 15th Ed., pp. 5.3–5.7, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, NYGoogle Scholar), consistent with the measured differences in growth rates (Fig. 1). CO2 Fixation Kinetics in Isolated Carboxysomes—To judge the effect of the shell-bound carbonic anhydrase on carboxysomal CO2 fixation rates, the RubisCO activity of mutant and wild type carboxysomes was determined radiometrically (27Shively J.M. Ball F. Brown D.H. Saunders R.E. Science. 1973; 182: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). For these experiments we report KC as μm CO2, calculated from the input HCO–3 concentration at pH 8.0, to allow comparison with the true Km of free RubisCO and of the enzyme in broken carboxysomes. We refer to the concentration of HCO–3 required to produce half-maximal velocity as KC to distinguish it from the true KMCO2, which can be measured for carboxysome-bound RubisCO only if the flux of CO2 across the shell does not affect the accessibility of RubisCO to its substrate. CO2 fixation rates at standard assay conditions (60 mm bicarbonate) and varying RubP concentrations yielded a Vmax for mutant carboxysomes of 1.1 ± 0.1 μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein, which is ∼60% of the maximal rate observed for wild type particles (1.6 ± 0.1 μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein). The apparent Km for RubP, on the other hand, was essentially the same for mutant and wild type carboxysomes (174.7 ± 16.1 and 146.2 ± 5.6 μm, respectively). Likewise, Vmax obtained at a fixed, saturating RubP concentration of 0.5 mm and increasing bicarbonate concentrations from 1.45 to 80.2 mm was consistently slightly lower for the mutant carboxysomes (1.3 ± 0.1 μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein) than for wild type particles (1.7 ± 0.1 μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein) (Table 1). The KC for mutant carboxysomes (499.3 ± 47.1 μm), however, was nearly 3-fold higher than that measured for wild type microcompartments (177.1 ± 16.3 μm) (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic constants for the RubisCO reactionKCVmaxμm CO2μmol·min-1·mg-1Intact carboxysomes Wild type177.1 ± 16.31.7 ± 0.1 Wild type + rCsoSCA163.1 ± 10.71.6 ± 0.1 Mutant499.3 ± 47.11.3 ± 0.1 Mutant + rCsoSCA430.6 ± 49.61.2 ± 0.1Broken carboxysomes Wild type126.7 ± 10.82.0 ± 0.1 Mutant167.3 ± 13.22.0 ± 0.1Freed RubisCO Wild type163.7 ± 17.12.9 ± 0.1 Mutant165.8 ± 14.23.0 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To assess whether exogenously added carbonic anhydrase could functionally complement the missing carboxysome component, purified rCsoSCA was mixed with purified csoS3::Km carboxysomes at an activity level that was 5-fold higher than that measured for wild type carboxysomes (15Heinhorst S. Williams E.B. Cai F. Murin C.D. Shively J.M. Cannon G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8087-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). No significant effect on Vmax and KC values was observed (Table 1). To further evaluate how the presence and location of CsoSCA within the carboxysome affect carboxysome function, the carboxysome shell was disrupted by a freeze/thaw treatment (15Heinhorst S.

Electron microscopic examination of the remaining structures revealed the presence of shell ghosts that retained their icosahedral shape to some degree but contained breaks and tears (3Heinhorst, S., Cannon, G.

A key protein in signaling this process is AS160, a Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) whose activity appears to be suppressed by Akt phosphorylation. Tbc1d1 is a Rab GAP with a sequence highly similar to that of AS160 and with the same Rab specificity as that of AS160. The role of Tbc1d1 in regulating GLUT4 trafficking has been unclear. Our previous study showed that overexpressed Tbc1d1 inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, even though insulin caused phosphorylation on its single canonical Akt motif. In the present study, we show in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that Tbc1d1 is only 1/20 as abundant as AS160, that knockdown of Tbc1d1 has no effect on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, and that overexpressed Tbc1d1 also inhibits GLUT4 translocation elicited by activated Akt expression. These results indicate that endogenous Tbc1d1 does not participate in insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes and suggest that the GAP activity of Tbc1d1 is not suppressed by Akt phosphorylation. In addition, we discovered that Tbc1d1 is much more highly expressed in skeletal muscle than fat and that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator 5′-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside partially reversed the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by overexpressed Tbc1d1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 5′-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside activation of the kinase AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 translocation in muscle.

The above findings strongly suggest that Tbc1d1 is a component in the signal transduction pathway leading to AMPK-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in muscle. Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose transport into adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and heart. The basis for this effect is a rapid increase in the amount of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in the plasma membrane. These cell types contain specialized intracellular vesicles enriched in GLUT4. Insulin stimulates the movement of the GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane and their fusion with it (1Huang S. Czech M.P. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). This process is known as insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. A key signal transduction pathway for GLUT4 translocation proceeds from the insulin receptor to activation of the protein kinase Akt (1Huang S. Czech M.P.

In the absence of insulin AS160 keeps Rab10 and possibly other Rabs in their inactive GDP form; insulin treatment causes Akt phosphorylation of AS160; phosphorylation suppresses its GAP activity and thereby results in an elevation of the active GTP form of Rab10 and possibly other Rabs; the GTP form of the Rab(s) triggers the machinery for the docking of GLUT4 vesicles to the plasma membrane, which then leads to the fusion with the membrane.

We recently partially characterized a Rab GAP known as Tbc1d1 that is highly related to AS160 (7Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Tbc1d1 and AS160 are 47% identical over their entire length and 79% identical in their GAP domains. We showed that Tbc1d1 and AS160 have the same Rab substrate specificities; notably Tbc1d1 also acts on Rab10. We found that similarly to AS160, Tbc1d1 can regulate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, there is a major difference between the two GAPs. Overexpression of Tbc1d1 markedly inhibits GLUT4 translocation, whereas overexpression of AS160 does not. This finding suggested that unlike AS160, the Tbc1d1 GAP activity might not be suppressed by Akt phosphorylation of Tbc1d1. Tbc1d1 contains one canonical Akt phosphorylation motif (RXRXX(S/T)), which we established is phosphorylated in response to insulin (7Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, AS160 contains five canonical Akt motifs that increase in phosphorylation in response to insulin (2Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to characterize Tbc1d1 further. We present evidence that although Tbc1d1 is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the endogenous protein is unlikely to participate significantly in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and that Akt phosphorylation is unlikely to regulate ectopic Tbc1d1. In the course of this study we discovered that Tbc1d1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, with little or no expression in adipose tissue and heart. In skeletal muscle, contraction and activation of AMPK, as well as insulin, stimulate GLUT4 translocation (1Huang S. Czech M.P. Cell Metab. 2007; 5: 237-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 8Jessen N. Goodyear L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2005; 99: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 9Fujii N. Jessen N. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E867-E877Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Hence, this discovery raised the possibility that Tbc1d1 participates in the regulation of GLUT4 translocation in response to contraction and/or AMPK activation. In support of this possibility we found that the inhibitory effect of overexpressed Tbc1d1 on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is partially relieved by AICAR, an agent that activates AMPK. Plasmids—The cDNA encoding the large splice variant of mouse Tbc1d1 (gi37538012) was obtained from the Kazusa Foundation. The cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NotI site of 3× FLAG-CMV-7.1 expression vector, which introduces a 3× FLAG tag at the amino terminus. Plasmids for expression of two GST fusion proteins with portions of mouse Tbc1d1 were generated by PCR amplification of regions encoding amino acids 2–269 (designated NT) and amino acids 443–627 (designated PG) and ligation into the BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX-5X-3.

The plasmid for expression of myrAkt1 with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag (catalog number 17-253) was purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA). Antibodies—Affinity-purified antibodies against the NT and PG portions of the NT and PG GST fusion proteins of mouse Tbc1d1 were prepared as follows. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose. Rabbits were immunized with the fusion proteins. The antibodies were affinity-purified from the immune serum on the immobilized GST fusion protein, as described in Ref. 10Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Unless stated otherwise, this antibody was used for immunoblotting AS160. An affinity-purified antibody against phosphoserine 237 of Tbc1d1 was prepared by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA) through immunization of rabbits with the phosphopeptide N-acetyl-PMRKSF-pSQPGLRSLC-amide.

Cell Culture and Assay of Cell Surface GLUT4—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in culture and differentiated into adipocytes as described in Ref. 12Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The relative amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface was measured by the quantitative single-cell fluorescence assay that employs the reporter construct of GLUT4 with an HA tag in the amino-terminal extracellular loop and GFP fused to the carboxyl terminus (HA-GLUT4-GFP). This method is described in detail in Ref. 2Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar. A brief description is as follows. Adipocytes on day 4 of differentiation were transfected by electroporation with the plasmid for HA-GLUT4-GFP together with the plasmids for Tbc1d1, myrAkt, and/or vector controls. For all the transfection experiments herein, the 3× FLAG-tagged human Tbc1d1 was used. After 24 h the cells were treated with insulin, AICAR, and/or both as described in the figure legends. Insulin treatment was always for 30 min with 160 nm insulin. Subsequently cells were fixed with formaldehyde or made into SDS samples. The fixed cells were labeled with anti-HA and then with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. The Cy3 and GFP fluorescence intensities of individual cells were quantitated. After correction for background fluorescence, the Cy3 to GFP ratio was calculated. This ratio is a measure of the relative amount of HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface normalized to the level of GLUT4 expression for that cell. For each condition the ratio in ∼50 cells was measured. In our earlier experiments (see Figs. 2 and 3) insulin caused approximately a 5-fold increase in GLUT4 at the cell surface, whereas in our later ones (see Fig. 5) the effect was ∼10-fold. The difference was traced to the use of different lots of 3T3-L1 cells from the American Type Culture Collection.FIGURE 3Effect of myrAkt on cell surface GLUT4 and Tbc1d1 phosphorylation. A, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were co-transfected with the plasmid for HA-GLUT4-GFP and the plasmids for myrAkt1 with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag (Akt) and 3× FLAG-tagged human Tbc1d1 (Tbc) or for the corresponding empty vectors (AV, TV). Cell surface HA-GLUT4-GFP was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are the averages ± S.E. for four experiments. The values in each experiment were normalized to 1.0 for the AV, TV control in the insulin state. B, immunoblots of the SDS samples of the transfected cells in A for myrAkt with anti-Myc tag and for Tbc1d1 with anti-FLAG tag. The 1× load contained 20 μg of protein. The anti-Myc also cross-reacted with a protein that migrated just below myrAkt, which serves as a loading control. C, SDS/C12E9 lysates of the transfected cells in A were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG agarose. The immunoadsorbates were immunoblotted for phosphorylation of Tbc1d1 with the PAS antibody (upper panel) and for Tbc1d1 with anti-FLAG (lower panel). A repetition of B and C with a second set of samples gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Effect of AICAR on Tbc1d1 inhibition of GLUT4 translocation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with HA-GLUT4-GFP and either control vector plasmid (V) or the plasmid for 3× FLAG-tagged human Tbc1d1. The cells were untreated (basal, B) or treated with insulin (I), 1 mm AICAR (A), or 1 mm AICAR plus insulin (Ins). Treatment with AICAR was 70 min. Insulin was added during the final 30 min. A, cell surface HA-GLUT4-GFP was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are the averages ± S.E. for four independent experiments. They have been normalized to a value of 1.0 for the vector (Vec) control in the insulin state. The significance of the difference between surface GLUT4 in the presence of insulin versus AICAR plus insulin for cells overexpressing Tbc1d1 was calculated by the Student's two-tailed, paired t test. B, SDS samples of the cells in A were immunoblotted for pThr172 AMPK, AMPK, pThr56 eEF2, eEF2, and 3× FLAG-tagged Tbc1d1. The 1× load contained 30 μg of protein. A repetition of these blots with the samples from a second experiment gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For shRNA-mediated knockdown of Tbc1d1, the pSiren-RetroQ system (Clontech, CA) was employed, as described previously (4Eguez L. Lee A. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Kane S. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this method 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were infected with a retrovirus containing the shRNA and the puromycin resistance gene. Fibroblasts stably expressing the shRNA were selected with puromycin, differentiated into adipocytes, and assayed for HA-GLUT4-GFP at the cell surface as described above. The sequences of the shRNA for knockdown of Tbc1d1 and for the control (13Mitra P. Zheng X. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were GCAGCGAGAGAATGAATTA and CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG, respectively. Immunoprecipitation, Mass Spectrometry, and Immunoblotting—For the isolation of endogenous Tbc1d1 for mass spectrometry identification, we followed the immunoprecipitation procedure described in Ref. 14Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar. Ten 10-cm plates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 7 of differentiation were solubilized in SDS/dithiothreitol, and then the sulfhydryl groups were capped with N-ethylmaleimide. An excess of the nonionic detergent C12E9 over SDS (3.5-fold by weight) was added to the lysate, followed by the PG antibody against Tbc1d1 and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoadsorbate was washed, and the adsorbed proteins were released with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The expected Tbc1d1 band was excised from the gel and digested in gel with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were subjected to microcapillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA). Using SEQUEST v. 27 and the NCBI nr protein data base, Tbc1d1 peptides were sequenced and qualified in Sequest Summary of Proteomics Brower suite v3.3.22 requiring mass accuracy of 2.5 ppm or less, a minimum of five peptides with score final > 0.80, and the sum of score final > 9.9. For isolation of endogenous Tbc1d1 to assess its knockdown by immunoblotting (see Fig. 2B), we used the same immunoprecipitation procedure with single 10-cm plates on day 5 of differentiation. For isolation of 3× FLAG-tagged Tbc1d1 to measure its phosphorylation by immunoblotting (see Fig. 3C), we also used this immunoprecipitation procedure with anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma), as described previously (7Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, SDS samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to ImmobilonP membrane (Millipore, Temecula, CA) and detected with primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Recombinant Proteins and Tissue and Cell Samples for Immunoblotting—Recombinant FLAG-tagged mouse Tbc1d1 and human AS160 were expressed by transfecting 10-cm plates of HEK293F cells with 10 μg of the plasmids for these proteins using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). SDS/C12E9 lysates of the cells were prepared as described above, and each protein was isolated by immunoadsorption with anti-FLAG conjugated to agarose and then released with SDS sample buffer. This method yielded relatively pure preparations of each protein contaminated with only smaller amounts of the lower molecular weight heavy and light chains of anti-FLAG, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The concentration of each protein in the SDS sample was estimated by visual comparison of the intensity of its Coomassie Blue staining with that of known nanogram amounts of molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) whose staining intensities bracketed that of the Tbc1d1 and AS160 samples. Mouse tissues were dissected from mice euthanized with carbon dioxide and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were obtained littermate wild-type and AS160 knock-out mice that were on a mixed 129, C57BL/6 background. The characterization of the AS160 knock-out mouse, which was purchased from Lexicon Genetics Inc., will be reported elsewhere. The frozen tissues were disrupted with a polytron in cold 40 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm EP475, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenates, in which the protein concentration was about 4 mg/ml, were made 1.5% in C12E9, and microcentrifuged for 10 min. The supernatants were removed and made into SDS samples by the addition of one-third volume of concentrated sample buffer. The protein concentration of these samples, as well as that of other SDS samples herein, was determined by the precipitating Lowry assay (15Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7132) Google Scholar). L6 myoblasts expressing Myc-tagged GLUT4 were a generous gift from Dr. Amira Klip (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). These were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum for carrying as myoblasts, and confluent plates were cultured in 2% serum for differentiation into myotubes. Fused cells were first visible on day 4 of differentiation into myotubes. At various days in the differentiation process, a 10-cm plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then dissolved in 1 ml of SDS sample buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (see above) and held at 100 °C for 5 min. This same procedure was used to generate SDS samples of 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation. Expression of Tbc1d1 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Although it has been reported that Tbc1d1 mRNA is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Guo X. Liao K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 251: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), expression of the protein has not been established. To determine whether Tbc1d1 protein is expressed, we immunoprecipitated Tbc1d1 from a SDS/C12E9 lysate of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The precipitated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. A band in the region of 140 kDa was observed. It was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Fourteen unique tryptic peptides from Tbc1d1, covering 12.4% of the sequence, were identified (data not shown). We next examined Tbc1d1 expression during the course of differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and compared its expression to that of AS160 (Fig. 1). Mouse Tbc1d1 and human AS160 recombinant proteins were included to allow quantitation of the amounts of each protein. In addition, samples of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in which Tbc1d1 or AS160 were knocked down were included to verify the identification of each protein. In the case of Tbc1d1, a protein at ∼140 kDa, as well as some other proteins of higher and lower size, were detected (Fig. 1, upper panel, left). The 140-kDa protein is Tbc1d1, because it was markedly reduced in the sample from adipocytes expressing Tbc1d1 shRNA (Fig. 1, upper panel, Con versus KD lanes). The Tbc1d1 in the adipocytes migrated more rapidly than the recombinant mouse Tbc1d1, which migrated at ∼170 kDa (Fig. 1, upper panel, middle). Most likely the reason is that adipocytes express the short splice variant of Tbc1d1, whereas the recombinant protein is the long splice variant. The long and short splice variants of Tbc1d1 differ by 94 amino acids (7Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, the recombinant protein has a 3× FLAG tag of 27 amino acids at the amino terminus. Expression of Tbc1d1 was constant between day 0 of differentiation and day 4 and then decreased at days 6 and 8. The full adipocyte phenotype is reached at about day 6 (17El-Jack A.K. Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence, Tbc1d1 decreases somewhat upon differentiation. This finding contrasts with the report that its mRNA increases upon 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (16Guo X. Liao K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 251: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). From comparison with the known amounts of recombinant protein, cells at day 4 contained ∼5 ng of Tbc1d1/mg of protein. In contrast to Tbc1d1 the expression of AS160 was very low in fibroblasts (day 0) and increased to a maximum at day 4 and then decreased somewhat (Fig. 1, lower panel, left). The mobility of AS160 on day 2 is slightly less than on the other days because insulin present in the differentiation medium on day 2 leads to phosphorylation on multiple sites. Because the complete cDNA for mouse AS160 is not available, we used recombinant human AS160 as the standard and immunoblotted for AS160 with an antibody against a peptide that is identical in human and mouse AS160, so that reactivity with the mouse and human protein should be the similar. Based upon comparison with the standards (Fig. 1, lower panel, middle), cells at day 4 expressed ∼100 ng of AS160/mg of protein. Thus, AS160 is 20 times more abundant than Tbc1d1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The adipocyte AS160 exhibited a higher mobility than the recombinant human AS160 (∼160 and 180 kDa, respectively). Similarly to Tbc1d1, there is a long and short splice variant of AS160 (7Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In mouse AS160 these differ by a single exon of 63 amino acids. Through immunoblotting with an antibody against a peptide in this exon, we have found that 3T3-L1 adipocytes express mainly the short variant of AS160 (data not shown). Because the recombinant human AS160 was the long variant and also contained the 3× FLAG tag at its amino terminus, the adipocyte AS160 migrated more rapidly than the recombinant AS160. Effect of Knockdown of Tbc1d1 on Cell Surface GLUT4— Knockdown of AS160 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes elevates GLUT4 at the cell surface in the absence of insulin, to a level that is ∼30% of that seen with insulin (4Eguez L. Lee A. Chavez J.A. Miinea C.P. Kane S. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Here we examined the effect of knockdown of Tbc1d1 on the relative amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface. Approximately 75% knockdown of Tbc1d1 protein was achieved through stable expression of shRNA by retroviral infection of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). Knockdown of Tbc1d1 had little or no effect on GLUT4 at the cell surface in either the basal or insulin state (Fig. 2A). Insulin treatment increased the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface by ∼4-fold. The lack of an effect of Tbc1d1 knockdown suggests that endogenous Tbc1d1 does not play a significant role in keeping the Rab(s) required for GLUT4 translocation in the inactive GTP form, most probably because of its low expression in comparison with that of AS160. Effect of Akt Phosphorylation of Tbc1d1—Overexpression of Tbc1d1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes markedly inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas overexpression of AS160 does not inhibit (2Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 7Roach W.G."
https://openalex.org/W1969184513,"The cyclotides are stable plant-derived mini-proteins with a topologically circular peptide backbone and a knotted arrangement of three disulfide bonds that form a cyclic cystine knot structural framework. They display a wide range of pharmaceutically important bioactivities, but their natural function is in plant defense as insecticidal agents. To determine the influence of individual residues on structure and activity in the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1, all 23 non-cysteine residues were successively replaced with alanine. The structure was generally tolerant of modification, indicating that the framework is a viable candidate for the stabilization of bioactive peptide epitopes. Remarkably, insecticidal and hemolytic activities were both dependent on a common, well defined cluster of hydrophilic residues on one face of the cyclotide. Interestingly, this cluster is separate from the membrane binding face of the cyclotides. Overall, the mutagenesis data provide an important insight into cyclotide biological activity and suggest that specific self-association, in combination with membrane binding mediates cyclotide bioactivities."

Our results, drawn from all known couples of the Icelandic population born between 1800 and 1965, show a significant positive association between kinship and fertility, with the greatest reproductive success observed for couples related at the level of third and fourth cousins. Owing to the relative socioeconomic homogeneity of Icelanders, and the observation of highly significant differences in the fertility of couples separated by very fine intervals of kinship, we conclude that this association is likely to have a biological basis."

Relatively little is known about the glycoprotein receptors, glycan ligands, and intracellular death pathways used by these galectins. However, our laboratory has found that galectin-1 and galectin-3 kill different subsets of thymocytes, and use distinct sets of glycoprotein receptors and glycan ligands to kill T cells (16Stillman B.N. Hsu D.K. Pang M. Brewer C.F. Johnson P. Liu F.T. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar); this suggests that, in vivo, different galectins expressed at different times and in different anatomic sites may target specific T cell subsets for death. Galectin-1 and galectin-9 are highly expressed in many immune organs, including bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus (7Perillo N.L. Uittenbogaart C.H. Nguyen J.T. Baum L.G. J. Exp.

Whereas galectin-1 and galectin-9 have the canonical carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) 2The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; DMNJ, deoxymannojirimycin; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcript; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Th1, T helper 1. 2The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; C2GnT, core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; DMNJ, deoxymannojirimycin; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcript; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Th1, T helper 1. that define the galectin family, the two galectins have distinct structural features and belong to different subfamilies. Galectin-1 belongs to the dimeric galectin subfamily; galectin-1 is synthesized as a monomer with one CRD that non-covalently homodimerizes (Kd ∼ 7 μm) (24Cho M. Cummings R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5198-5206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The dimeric form appears to be required for induction of T cell death (6Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The galectin-1 homodimer is a relatively rigid structure, with the two identical CRDs oriented in an anti-parallel orientation (25Liao D.I. Kapadia G. Ahmed H. Vasta G.R. Herzberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1428-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, galectin-9 belongs to the tandem repeat subfamily, with two CRDs joined by a flexible peptide linker. Three galectin-9 isoforms with peptide linkers of different lengths have been described in different tissues and cell lines (20Wada J. Ota K. Kumar A. Wallner E.I. Kanwar Y.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Tureci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol.

Muller W.E. Yagi F. Kasai K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 232-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Unlike galectin-1, where the two CRDs are identical, the N-terminal and C-terminal CRDs of galectin-9 are different; the two CRDs share an amino acid sequence homology of only 39%, and bind distinct sets of saccharide ligands (26Tureci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundschuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The differences in the N- and C-terminal CRD sequences and respective ligand specificities suggest that the two CRDs of galectin-9 may play different roles in mediating the functions of galectin-9, e.g. triggering cell death. Given the length of the galectin-9 linker peptide, the N- and C-terminal CRDs of galectin-9 would also be predicted to have greater rotational flexibility and greater flexibility in the spacing between the CRDs, compared with the two CRDs of the galectin-1 dimer. Both galectin-1 and galectin-9 can kill thymocytes, peripheral T cells, and T cell lines (6Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G.

Morita Y. Hiragushi K. Hida K. Shikata K. Yamamura M. Kanwar Y. Makino H. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1941-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the few studies that have examined the mechanism of galectin-9 T cell death suggest that there are significant differences between the galectin-1 and galectin-9 death pathways. First, galectin-9 is much more potent than galectin-1 in inducing T cell death; even when galectin-1 is made as a leucine zipper dimer or a bivalent single chain molecule, minimal cell death is observed in vitro at concentrations <1 μm (31Battig P. Saudan P. Gunde T. Bachmann M.F. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32van der Leij J. van den Berg A. Harms G. Eschbach H. Vos H. Zwiers P. van Weeghel R. Groen H. Poppema S. Visser L. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, 0.1 μm galectin-9 is sufficient to induce significant apoptosis of MOLT-4 and Jurkat T cells, thymocytes, and peripheral blood T cells (19Lu L.H. Nakagawa R. Kashio Y. Ito A. Shoji H. Nishi N. Hirashima M. Yamauchi A. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 141: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Wada J. Ota K. Kumar A. Wallner E.I. Kanwar Y.S. J. Clin.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 3631-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Second, galectin-9 and galectin-1 appear to recognize different T cell surface glycoprotein receptors; Tim-3 and CD44 have been identified as glycoprotein receptors for galectin-9 (33Zhu C. Anderson A.C. Schubart A. Xiong H. Imitola J. Khoury S.J. Zheng X.X. Strom T.B. Kuchroo V.K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 34Katoh S. Ishii N.

Care Med. 2007; 176: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas galectin-1 binds to several T cell surface glycoproteins including CD2, CD3, CD7, CD43, and CD45 (8Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Pang M. Nguyen J.T. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2331-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Nguyen J. Evans D.P. Galvan M. Pace K.E. Leitenberg D. Bui T.N. Baum L.G. J.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, galectin-1-induced death of MOLT-4 T cells does not result in activation of caspases or release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (12Hahn H.P. Pang M. He J. Hernandez J.D. Yang R.Y. Li L.Y. Wang X. Liu F.T. Baum L.G. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, galectin-9-induced death of MOLT-4 T cells results in cytochrome c release and is dependent on caspase activation (28Kashio Y. Nakamura K. Abedin M.J. Seki M. Nishi N. Yoshida N. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3631-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The structural features of different galectins that determine differential recognition of target cells and distinct biologic effects remain unknown. In this study, we directly compared galectin-1- and galectin-9-induced T cell death with regard to requirements for glycan ligands and glycoprotein receptors, intracellular death mediators, and target cell susceptibility using murine thymocytes. To understand the structural features of galectin-1 and galectin-9 that contribute to differences in receptor requirements for death and susceptibility of target cell populations, we designed a series of hybrid proteins that combine various structural features of galectin-1 and galectin-9. Using these constructs, we determined that both CRD specificity and CRD presentation contribute to galectin potency in triggering cell death; however, the primary determinant of the T cell death pathway triggered by a specific galectin is the specificity of the C-terminal CRD. Elucidating the different T cell death pathways used by different galectins and determining the structural features of galectins required to trigger these distinct death pathways is a critical step in understanding how this family of molecules coordinately regulates T cell survival.

Messenger RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA from Jurkat E6-1 T cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Galectin-9 and galectin-1 cDNA were obtained using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For galectin-9, primer sequences were: Gal-9FNde, 5′-tgcaatccatatggccttcagcagttcccag-3′, and Gal-9RXho, 5′-cccctcgagctatgtctgcacatgggt-3′. For galectin-1, primers were: Gal1FNde, 5′-ggagatatagatatggcttgtggtctggtcgcc-3′, and Gal1RXho, 5′-cccctcgagtcagtcaaaggccacacattt-3′. cDNAs encoding gal-1-9-1, gal-9-9-1, and gal-1-9-9 were obtained via overlapping PCR. To construct cDNA encoding gal-1-9-1, galectin-1 cDNA was used as PCR template and the primers were: Gal1FNde (described above); Gal1RDR3, 5′-ctgcactgtgtggatgactgtctgggtgtcaaaggccacacatttgat-3′; Gal1FDR3, 5′-atccacacagtgcagagcgcccctggacaggcttgtggtctggtcgcc-3′; and Gal1RXho (described above). The PCR products of both reactions were purified and mixed to use as a PCR template for generating gal-1-9-1, using primers Gal1FNde, Gal1FDR3 or Gal1RDR3, Gal1RXho. To construct cDNA encoding gal-9-9-1, galectin-9 cDNA was used as a template to obtain the N-terminal CRD sequence, and galectin-1 cDNA was used as a template for the C-terminal CRD. The primers were: Gal9FNde (described above), Gal9NCRDLNKR, 5′-ggcgctctgcactgtgtggatgactgtctgggtctggaagctgatgtaggacag; Gal1LNK9F, 5′-cacacagtgcagagcgcccctggacaggcttgtggtctggtcgccagc; and Gal1RXho (described above). The PCR products of both reactions were purified and mixed to use as a PCR template for generating gal-9-9-1, using Gal9FNde, Gal9NCRDLNKR or Gal1LNK9F, and Gal1Rxho primers. To construct cDNA encoding gal-1-9-9, galectin-1 cDNA was used as the template for the N-terminal CRD, and galectin-9 cDNA was used as the template for the C-terminal CRD. The primers were: Gal1FNde (described above), Gal1–9R, 5′-tgtctgggtgtcaaaggccacaca-3′; Gal9SF, 5′-acccagacagtcatccacaca-3′; and Gal9RXho, 5′-cccctcgagctatgtctgcacatgggt-3′. The PCR products of both reactions were purified and mixed to use as PCR template for generating gal-1-9-9, using Gal1FNde, Gal1–9R or Gal9SF, and Gal1RXho primers. To construct cDNA encoding single chain bivalent galectin-1 (gal-1 GG), overlapping PCR as described by Battig et al. (31Battig P. Saudan P. Gunde T. Bachmann M.F. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used with the following modification. The first domain of galectin-1 cDNA was amplified from a modified pGEMEX-1 vector (Promega) using primer F1 (5′-ggagaccacaacggtttcc-3′), which anneals to the T7 promoter region of the pGEMEX vector and primer R2 (5′-accacaagccataccgccgtcaaaggccacacatttg-3′). The second domain of galectin-1 cDNA was amplified with primer F2 (5′-gtggcctttgacggcggtatggcttgtggtctggtc-3′) and primer R1 (5′-actcaagcttatgcatgcggcc), which anneals to the pGEMEX vector 20 bp after the galectin-1 stop codon. The resulting PCR products were amplified together for 5 cycles followed by amplification with primers F1 and R2 for 18 cycles. The final PCR products of gal-9, gal-1-9-1, and gal-1-9-9 were cloned into TOPO-TA-PCR vector (Invitrogen), and gal-1 GG was cloned into TOPO-XL-PCR vector from Invitrogen. Construction of Galectin Expression Vectors—For galectin-9, gal-1-9-1, gal-9-9-1, and gal-1-9-9, cDNA was cut from the TOPO-TA-PCR vectors containing the sequence of interest with NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Digested cDNA was purified and ligated into pET vector 3.1 (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) linearized by the same two restriction enzymes. Gal-1 GG cDNA was cut from the TOPO-XL-PCR vector with XbaI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) and ligated to modified pGEMEX-1 vector linearized by the same two restriction enzymes. The ligated products were transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli DH5α (Novagen) to amplify the expression vectors. Plasmids (pET/galectin vectors and modified PGEMEX-1/gal-1 GG) were isolated and the inserts verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Expression of Galectins—Recombinant galectin-1, gal-1 GG, gal-1-9-1, gal-9-9-1, gal-1-9-9, and galectin-9 were purified as previously described (38Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Baum L.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), except that E. coli Rossetta (DE3)/pLysS cells (Novagen), that have enhanced capability to express mammalian proteins with rare codons for E. coli, were used. All galectins were eluted from a lactose-agarose affinity column using 200 mm lactose, followed by further purification on a sizing column (38Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Baum L.G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After concentration, galectin-1, gal-1 GG, and gal-1-9-1 were dialyzed against 1× PBS with 8 mm dithiothreitol, whereas gal-9-9-1, gal-1-9-9, and galectin-9 were dialyzed against 1× PBS. T Cell Death Assays—1 × 106 cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of the various galectins or buffer control for 6 (mouse cell lines) or 5 h (human cell lines), in 24-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Buffer control for galectin-1, gal-1 GG, and gal-1-9-1 was 0.2 mm dithiothreitol in 1× PBS, to match the final dilution of the galectin stock in 1× PBS. Buffer control for gal-1-9-9, gal-9-9-1, and galectin-9 was 1× PBS. 100 mm β-Lactose was added to dissociate the cells and the cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS. Cell death was determined by annexin V-FITC binding and PI uptake using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and CellQuest software as described (6Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). 10,000 events were acquired per sample, and percent cell death determined as: (1 - (viable annexin V- (galectin)/viable annexin V- (control))) × 100. Thymocyte Death Assays—Thymus tissues were harvested from 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Thymocytes were harvested as previously described (13Hernandez J.D. Nguyen J. He J. Wang W. Ardman B. Green J.M. Fukuda M. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 5328-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell viability was >95%. 1 × 106 cells were incubated with galectins at the indicated concentrations or buffer control for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were dissociated with 100 mm lactose and washed with 1× PBS before phenotypic analysis using CD4-phycoerythrin and CD8-FITC at 0.2 μg/ml. Isotype-matched controls were included for all reagents. Staining was performed at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer with 0.2 μg/ml 7-AAD. To quantitate percent cell death in each thymocyte subset, 10,000 total events were collected on a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed with CellQuest software, and live cells were determined by gating for forward versus side scatter profiles and absence of 7-AAD (13Hernandez J.D.

To quantitate absolute cell death in each thymocyte subset, CountBright absolute counting beads (Invitrogen) were used and analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 25 μl of beads were added to 100 μl of thymocytes (1 × 106 cells) and mixed well prior to flow cytometry analysis; 3,000 bead events were collected per sample. Thymocyte viability was assessed based on forward versus side scatter and absence of 7-AAD uptake. The absolute number of viable cells in each subset was obtained by reference to the number of beads per sample.

Despite the long-standing use of minoxidil for balding, its mechanism is unclear; suggestions include action on vasculature or follicle cells. Similar drugs also stimulate hair, implicating ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. To investigate whether K(ATP) channels are present in human follicles, we used organ culture, molecular biological, and immunohistological approaches. Minoxidil and tolbutamide, a K(ATP) channel blocker, opposed each other's effects on the growing phase (anagen) of scalp follicles cultured in media with and without insulin. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction identified K(ATP) channel component gene expression including regulatory sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) SUR1 and SUR2B but not SUR2A and pore-forming subunits (Kir) Kir6.1 and Kir6.2. When hair bulb tissues were examined separately, epithelial matrix expressed SUR1 and Kir6.2, whereas both dermal papilla and sheath exhibited SUR2B and Kir6.1. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated similar protein distributions. Thus, human follicles respond biologically to K(ATP) channel regulators in culture and express genes and proteins for two K(ATP) channels, Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.1/SUR2B; minoxidil only stimulates SUR2 channels. These findings indicate that human follicular dermal papillae contain K(ATP) channels that can respond to minoxidil and that tolbutamide may suppress hair growth clinically; novel drugs designed specifically for these channels could treat hair disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2144160911,"Linker histone H1 has been generally viewed as a global repressor of transcription by preventing the access of transcription factors to sites in chromatin. However, recent studies suggest that H1 can interact with other regulatory factors for its action as a negative modulator of specific genes. To investigate these aspects, we established a human cell line expressing H1.2, one of the H1 subtypes, for the purification of H1-interacting proteins. Our results showed that H1.2 can stably associate with sets of cofactors and ribosomal proteins that can significantly repress p53-dependent, p300-mediated chromatin transcription. This repressive action of H1.2 complex involves direct interaction of H1.2 with p53, which in turn blocks p300-mediated acetylation of chromatin. YB1 and PURα, two factors present in the H1.2 complex, together with H1.2 can closely recapitulate the repressive action of the entire H1.2 complex in transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA interference analyses further confirmed that the recruitment of YB1, PURα, and H1.2 to the p53 target gene Bax is required for repression of p53-induced transcription. Therefore, these results reveal a previously unrecognized function of H1 as a transcriptional repressor as well as the underlying mechanism involving specific sets of factors in this repression process.

Histones are the major protein components to compact genomic DNA into the limited volume of the nucleus as a highly organized chromatin structure. The basic element of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octameric core of histones containing two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1Kornberg R.D.

This repeating unit of chromatin is associated with another type of histone called linker histone H1 to achieve an additional level of compaction, making genes inaccessible to transcription factors and preventing their expression (5Brown D.T.

Mammalian cells have at least eight histone H1 subtypes including H1.1 through H1.5 and somatic cell-specific H1o as well as germ cell-specific H1t and H1oo, all consisting of a highly conserved globular domain and less conserved N- and C-terminal domains (6Bustin M.

The existence of multiple H1 subtypes and the diversity of their amino acid sequences raise the possibility that individual subtypes have nonredundant functions in various cellular processes. In addition, the expression of each H1 subtype depends on the tissue, phase of the cell cycle, and developmental stage, further suggesting the specific contribution of linker histone subtypes for regulation of various cellular processes (6Bustin M. Catez F. Lim J.H. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 617-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 8Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem.

Although most studies have focused on the contribution of H1 as a structural component of the nucleosome, it is becoming apparent that H1 also acts as a repressor for specific gene transcription (12Alami R. Fan Y. Pack S. Sonbuchner T.M. Besse A. Lin Q. Greally J.M. Skoultchi A.I. Bouhassira E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Brown D.T.

This repressive capacity of H1 on transcription appears to be accomplished by its localization at particular chromosomal domains with specific transcription regulators. Msx1 recruits a linker histone H1 to the MyoD gene, and this selective localization correlates with a repressive chromatin state and gene repression (16Lee H. Habas R. Abate-Shen C. Science. 2004; 304: 1675-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Simultaneous inactivation of three H1 subtype genes (H1.2, H1.3, and H1.4) in mouse embryonic cells significantly affects the expression of a subset of genes, supporting a rather specific action of H1 in gene regulation (17Fan Y. Nikitina T. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Zhao J. Magnuson T.R. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4559-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrating that specific sets of ribosomal proteins interact with H1 to suppress transcription also provides support for a rather complex mechanism for the effect of H1 in gene regulation (18Ni J.Q. Liu L.P. Hess D. Rietdorf J. Sun F.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1959-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the linker histone H1 requires other regulatory factors to retain its optimal capacity and specificity for epigenetic gene regulation. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which transcription is down-regulated by H1, we purified factors stably associated with H1.2, one of the human H1 subtypes, by using an epitope tagging and stable cell line approach. Our functional analysis demonstrated that the purified H1.2 complex represses p53-dependent, p300-mediated chromatin transcription by blocking chromatin acetylation. The result that H1.2 alone is defective in repression underscores the significance of factors associated with H1.2 for repressive action of H1.2 in transcription. Furthermore we found that the physical interaction of the H1.2 complex with p53, most likely through H1.2 present in the complex, provides a novel mechanism for the transcriptional repression by the H1.2 complex. Therefore, apart from a role of H1 in maintaining higher order chromatin structure, our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of action of linker histone H1 in specific transcription events. Generation of H1.2 Cell Line—To construct pIRES-FHH1.2 vector used for mammalian expression of H1.2, human H1.2 gene was amplified by PCR and inserted into NotI and EcoRI sites of pIRESneo containing FLAG and HA 2The abbreviations used are: HAhemagglutininNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBSAbovine serum albuminGSTglutathione S-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationshRNAshort hairpin RNAASXL1additional sex combs-like protein 1PARP1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1TGase7tissue transglutaminase 7CAPERαcoactivator of activating protein-1 and estrogen receptors αFIRfar upstream element-binding protein 1-interacting repressorYB1Y box-binding protein 1WDR5WD repeat domain 5PURαpurine-rich element-binding protein ANAP1nucleosome assembly protein 1CTC-terminal domainNTN-terminal domain. tags. HeLa-S cells (1 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg of pIRES-FHH1.2 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and positive clones were selected with G418 (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. H1.2 expression within the isolated clones was confirmed by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The selected H1.2 cell line was grown in an 8-liter spinner culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-PO4 medium (Irvine Scientific), and nuclear extract (0.5 g) was prepared as described recently (19Heo K.

Purification and Identification of H1.2 Complex—To purify the H1.2 complex, the nuclear extract prepared from the H1.2 cell line was first loaded onto a phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman) equilibrated with BC150 buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, 150 mm KCl). The bound proteins were step-eluted with BC300, BC500, BC850, BC1200, and BC2000 buffers. The BC1200 fraction containing the H1.2 complex was dialyzed in BC300 buffer and further purified by using M2 agarose affinity chromatography (Sigma) (19Heo K. Kim B. Kim K. Choi J. Kim H. Zhan Y. Ranish J.A. An W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15476-15483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The preparation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with a 4–20% linear gradient and immunoblotting using either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody. A portion of the H1.2 complex isolated after M2 agarose affinity chromatography (0.2 ml) was applied to a 5-ml 15–40% glycerol gradient in BC250 buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 20 h in an SW 55Ti rotor at 4 °C, fractions (150 μl) were collected from the top of the tube. The distribution of the H1.2 complex was determined by silver staining and Western blotting of 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels. For mass spectrometry analysis, purified factors were resolved by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were excised from the gel and submitted to the protein sequencing facility at the University of Southern California core mass spectrometry facility for in-gel trypsin digestion followed by peptide sequencing according to facility protocols. The presence of the identified proteins within the purified H1.2 complex was further confirmed by Western blot analysis.

Construction and Expression of Recombinant H1.2—Wild type and C terminus-deleted H1.2 constructs were generated by subcloning H1.2 gene fragments encoding amino acids 1–213 and amino acids 1–109. Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) were transformed with the resulting pET-H1.2 construct, grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C. Harvested bacteria were lysed in 25 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m KCl) by sonication, and the cleared lysate (125 mg) was bound to Ni-NTA affinity resin (Novagen) in batch by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. After binding, the resin was washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted with BC300 buffer containing 0.25 m imidazole. The eluted protein was loaded onto a 1-ml CM-Sephadex C-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with BC300 buffer. After extensive washing with BC300 buffer, the bound proteins were step-eluted with BC300, BC500, BC800, and BC1200 buffers. The combined BC800 fractions containing H1.2 were dialyzed against BC300 buffer and applied to an SP-HP column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with BC300 buffer. Elution was again carried out by using a fourphase salt gradient (0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.2 m) in BC buffer. H1.2-containing 0.8 m fractions were collected and dialyzed against BC100 buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as a protein standard. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Assays—To generate H1.2 fused to GST, H1.2 DNA sequence was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant GST and GST-H1.2 proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Vectors encoding ASXL1, β-catenin, TGase7, CAPERα, YB1, and WDR5 were prepared by subcloning their cDNAs into pcDNA3.1/His vector (Invitrogen).

The GST tag was removed from GST-PURα by thrombin cleavage kit (Novagen). In vitro binding experiments were carried out using purified recombinant GST or GST-H1.2 (2 μg) proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and one of the prepared components of the H1.2 complex in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Glutathione beads were washed four times in binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer to elute bound proteins, which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibodies as described in Fig. 2B. For identification of the p53 interaction domain of H1.2, expression vectors for H1.2 deletion mutants, i.e. H1.2 N-terminal domain (H1.2 NT), H1.2 globular domain (H1.2 GD), and H1.2 C-terminal domain (H1.2 CT) were also generated by inserting PCR-amplified cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–34 (for NT), 35–109 (for globular domain, GD), and 110–213 (for CT) of H1.2, respectively, into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-p53 fusion proteins comprising full-length p53, its first 83 residues (for NT), residues 120–290 (for DNA binding domain), and its final 104 residues (for CT) were also prepared as described previously (26Gu W.

All other expression vectors were identical to those used in the TnT coupled transcription-translation system. 293T cells (3 × 106) were transiently transfected with 3 μg of an expression vector for FLAG-PARP1, Xpress-β-catenin, Xpress-TGase7, HA-FIR, Xpress-CAPERα, Xpress-YB1, Xpress-PURα, or Xpress-WDR5 along with 3 μg of an expression vector for FLAG- or Xpress-H1.2. Total amounts of the expression vectors were kept constant by adding empty vectors. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, and total cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Xpress antibodies (Invitrogen) as described previously (28An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G.

For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, 293T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against H1.2 (Abcam) and p53. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analysis—The vector pEGFP-H1.2 was generated by subcloning H1.2 gene into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1, and other expression plasmids were prepared as described under “Immunoprecipitation Assays.” HeLa cells were grown on 18-mm glass coverslip to 40% confluency with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-PO4 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with 0.3 μg of mammalian expression vectors for EGFP-H1.2 along with 0.3 μg of an expression vector for Xpress-ASXL1, FLAG-PARP1, HA-FIR, Xpress-CAPERα, Xpress-YB1, Xpress-PURα, and Xpress-WDR5 as indicated in Fig. 2D. Two days after transfection, cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. For localization of other proteins, fixed cells were blocked in 3% BSA and incubated with the anti-FLAG, anti-Xpress, or anti-HA antibody, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and subsequently with the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory). All incubations were at room temperature for 2 h.

The following primers were used for RT-PCR: Bax, 5′-CGTCCACCAAGAAGCTGAGCG-3′ and 5′-AGCACTCCCGCCACAA AGATG-3′; and actin, 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Construction of H1.2, YB1, and PURα shRNA Plasmids and Stable Transfection—The design and construction of the shRNA clones against H1.2, YB1, and PURα were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). shH1.2 (gatccAGAGCGTAGCGGAGTTTCTttcaagagaAGAAACTCCGCTACGCTCTTTttttggaaa and agcttttccaaaaAAAGAGCGTAGCGGAGTTTCTtctcttgaaAGAAACTCCGCTACGCTCTg), shYB1 (gatccGAAGGTCATCGCAACGAAGttcaagagaCTTCGTTGCGATGACCTTCTTttttggaaa and agcttttccaaaaAAGAAGGTCATCGCAACGAAGtctcttgaaCTTCGTTGCGATGACCTTCg), and shPURα (gatccgCCGCAAGTACTACATGGATttcaagagaATCCATGTAGTACTTGCGGTTttttggaaa and agcttttccaaaaAACCGCAAGTACTACATGGATtctcttgaaATCCATGTAGTACTTGTGGcg) (target sequences are capitalized) were subcloned into pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo plasmid (Ambion) and used for generation of stable cell lines. RNA was extracted from U2OS cells stably transfected with shRNA of H1.2, YB1, or PURα with or without adriamycin (0.5 mg/ml for 8 h, Fluka) treatment by using the RNeasy minikit. The cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA with the SuperScript III First-Strand kit (Invitrogen), and relative changes in expression of Bax gene were assessed by real time PCR. Linker Histone H1.2 Stably Associates with Multiple Regulatory Factors in Living Cells—As a first step in exploring the repressive roles of H1 in transcription, we generated a HeLa-derived cell line that constitutively expresses FLAG- and HA-tagged H1.2 for the purification of the H1.2 complex (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Our Western blot analysis with FLAG antibody confirmed that the major fraction of expressed H1.2 was present in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Similar Western analysis of the cell line nuclear extracts with H1.2 antibody also confirmed comparable levels of ectopic H1.2 versus endogenous H1.2 (Fig. 1C), thus minimizing the possibility that ectopic H1.2 nonspecifically interacts with other factors due to its non-physiological concentration. To enhance the purity of the H1.2 complex in our purification, the nuclear extract prepared from the cultured H1.2 cell line was initially fractionated on a P11 phosphocellulose column with increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 1A). The 1.2 m fraction containing ectopic H1.2 was further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-FLAG antibody. An SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified H1.2 complex consistently identified 16 bands that were not observed with the control purification similarly conducted with HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1E). In an effort to confirm the stability of the H1.2 complex, we further purified it by ultracentrifugation in a 15–40% glycerol gradient under stringent conditions (250 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). As shown in Fig. 1G, the complex sedimented as a single discrete peak in the glycerol gradient (fractions 21–25), suggesting that H1.2 forms a single complex. To define the functional role of H1 as a single protein, His-tagged H1.2 was also expressed in bacteria and purified by three consecutive chromatographies using Ni-NTA, CM-Sephadex C-25, and SP-HP as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1D). The overall procedures for purification of the H1.2 complex and the recombinant H1.2 are summarized in Fig. 1, A and D. To identify the factors present in the H1.2 complex, the major protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The most prominent proteins identified in our analysis were four endogenous ribosomal proteins (L13a, L7a, L22, and S3) among the cluster of abundant low molecular weight proteins. These results are consistent with recent results from Drosophila indicating that H1 interacts with multiple nuclear ribosomal proteins for more efficient repression of transcription (18Ni J.Q.

https://openalex.org/W2069133591,"Earth's solid-iron inner core is elastically anisotropic. Sound waves propagate faster along Earth's spin axis than in the equatorial plane. This anisotropy has previously been explained by a preferred orientation of the iron alloy hexagonal crystals. However, hexagonal iron becomes increasingly isotropic on increasing temperature at pressures of the inner core and is therefore unlikely to cause the anisotropy. An alternative explanation, supported by diamond anvil cell experiments, is that iron adopts a body-centered cubic form in the inner core. We show, by molecular dynamics simulations, that the body-centered cubic iron phase is extremely anisotropic to sound waves despite its high symmetry. Direct simulations of seismic wave propagation reveal an anisotropy of 12%, a value adequate to explain the anisotropy of the inner core."
https://openalex.org/W2029952427,"There are several lines of evidence that the podocyte slit diaphragm (SD), which serves as a structural framework for the filtration barrier in kidney glomerulus, also plays an essential role as a signaling platform. Several SD components including nephrin and TRPC6 are known to be phosphorylated by a Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK), Fyn. Here we have characterized Neph1, another SD component, as a novel substrate of SFK. Fyn interacts with and phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of Neph1 in vitro and in intact cells. Peptide mass fingerprinting and site-directed mutagenesis identified several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In pull-down assays using rat glomerular lysates, Neph1 but not nephrin specifically binds to adaptor protein Grb2 and tyrosine kinase Csk in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Both tyrosine 637 and 638 of Neph1 are crucial for Neph1-Grb2 binding. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 637 is significantly up-regulated in in vivo models of podocyte injury. Furthermore, Neph1 attenuates ERK activation elicited by Fyn, and this inhibitory effect requires the intact binding motif for the Grb2 SH2 domain. Our results shown here demonstrate that Neph1 is a novel in vivo substrate of SFK and suggest that Neph1 modulates ERK signaling through phosphorylation-dependent interaction with Grb2. Thus, SFK orchestrates a wide spectrum of protein-protein interactions and intracellular signaling networks at SD through tyrosine phosphorylation."

Quantum measurement (scanning tunneling microscopy) of these “quantum drums”—degenerate two-dimensional electron states on the copper(111) surface confined by individually positioned carbon monoxide molecules—reveals that isospectrality provides an extra topological degree of freedom enabling robust quantum state transplantation and phase extraction."
https://openalex.org/W1989093636,"Reproducing in cities has always been costly, leading to lower fertility (that is, lower birth rates) in urban than in rural areas. Historically, although cities provided job opportunities, initially residents incurred the penalty of higher infant mortality, but as mortality rates fell at the end of the 19th century, European birth rates began to plummet. Fertility decline in Africa only started recently and has been dramatic in some cities. Here it is argued that both historical and evolutionary demographers are interpreting fertility declines across the globe in terms of the relative costs of child rearing, which increase to allow children to outcompete their peers. Now largely free from the fear of early death, postindustrial societies may create an environment that generates runaway parental investment, which will continue to drive fertility ever lower."

Growth curves were measured from overnight cultures diluted to A600 nm = 0.2. A yeast strain list and primer sequences are provided in the supplemental table. Intracellular NAD+ and NR Transport—Intracellular NAD+ was calculated for cells grown to A600 nm = 1.0 as described (3Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C.

For measurement of NR uptake, cells were grown in NA-free medium with rigorous aeration to A600 nm = 1.0, at which time 1 ml of cell culture was combined with the appropriate amount of [3H]NR and incubated for the specified times. Triplicate cell samples were collected using a Millipore 1225 sampling vacuum manifold on premoistened 1.2-μm nitrocellulose filters and washed twice with 5 ml of potassium-buffered saline prior to scintillation counting. Kinetic parameters were calculated from initial rates. For pH-dependent transport assays, the culture medium was buffered to the indicated pH values by addition of a 1% volume of sodium citrate (pH 3.5–5.5) or Tris-Cl (pH 6.5–9.5). Nrt1 Is Necessary and Sufficient for Normal NR Incorporation into NAD+—The NR transporter in Hemophilus influenza is encoded by the pnuC gene (18Herbert M. Sauer E. Smethurst G. Kraiss A. Hilpert A.K. Reidl J. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5398-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which has homologs in eubacteria and bacteriophage. There are no reports of a eukaryotic NR transporter and no pnuC-homologous eukaryotic sequences. Overexpression studies of human nucleoside transporters in frog oocytes indicated that high expression of the equilibrative transporters ENT1 and ENT2 and the concentrative transporter CNT3 increased the import of the NR analogs tiazofurin and benzamide riboside (19Damaraju V.L.

Yeast. 2006; 23: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); and thi73 and yil166c, which resemble additional uncharacterized transporters. Wild-type yeast cells grown on NA-free medium have an intracellular NAD+ concentration of ∼0.8 mm, which is elevated by ∼1 mm when supplemented with 10 μm NR (3Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Yeast strains deleted for each of the 14 candidate transporters were assayed for diminution or loss of this effect. As shown in Fig. 1A, all but two candidates were as sensitive to NR as the wild type. Deletions in nrt1 (previously termed YOR071C/THI71) and fun26 decreased incorporation of NR into NAD+ by 83 and 36%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, the double nrt1 fun26 mutant exhibited a 93% reduction in NR utilization, rendering the NR-dependent increase in NAD+ concentration statistically insignificant. These data suggest that Nrt1 is responsible for the majority of NR import, with a potential minor role for Fun26. To test the hypothesis that NR utilization depends on Nrt1, the gene was cloned into the single copy vector pRS317 under the control of its native promoter. As shown in Fig. 1B, upon introduction of this plasmid into the double mutant background, there was a 102% restoration of the NR-dependent increase in NAD+. To test whether Nrt1 and Fun26 might have roles in assimilation of other NAD+ precursors, we grew wild-type and nrt1 fun26 mutant strains in NA-free medium and in medium supplemented with 10 μm NR, NA, or Nam. Whereas the wild-type strain incorporated each vitamin into an additional 1 mm intracellular NAD+, the nrt1 fun26 strain obtained the full NAD+ benefit from NA and Nam, but not from NR (Fig. 1C). Thus, neither Nrt1 nor Fun26 appears to play any role in import of NA or Nam. Nrt1 Is Necessary and Sufficient for NR-dependent Cell Growth—To set up a system in which deletions of putative vitamin transporter genes could be assayed for effects on cell growth, we deleted the gene encoding 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase, which performs an essential step in the de novo biosynthesis of NAD+ from tryptophan. As shown in Fig. 2A, the bna1 mutant was incapable of growth in NA-free medium but grew well when supplemented with either 10 μm NA or NR. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), deletion of the NRT1 gene with or without deletion of FUN26 permitted NA-dependent growth but abolished normal growth with NR supplementation. When the NRT1 gene was added back to the bna1 nrt1 fun26 mutant (Fig. 2D), NR-dependent growth was fully restored. Indeed, the Nrt1 dependence of NR utilization is stronger than the Tna1 dependence of NA utilization because bna1 tna1 mutants fail to grow at 40 nm NA, grow slightly at 400 nm NA, and grow normally at 4 μm NA (13Llorente B. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, examination of the growth curves in Fig. 2 (B and C) indicates that growth of bna1 nrt1 mutants was slight at 10 μm NR. Nrt1 Is Required for High Affinity, pH-dependent, Specific Import of NR—To determine whether NR is incorporated into yeast cells in an Nrt1-dependent manner, we prepared [3H]NR from [3H]NMN and measured incorporation of radioactivity into yeast cells exposed to 50 μm NR. The wild-type strain exhibited a robust linear import activity for the entirety of the 70-min assay, whereas the nrt1 disruption strain exhibited no detectable import (Fig. 3A). Nrt1 is highly similar in sequence to Thi7, a concentrative thiamine transporter and member of the major facilitator superfamily (15Enjo F. Nosaka K. Ogata M. Iwashima A. Nishimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19165-19170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with an ability to concentrate thiamine 1000-fold inside the cell (26Iwashima A. Nishino H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thiamine import is pH-dependent, with strong activity between pH 4 and 5 and declining activity at pH 6 and 7 (26Iwashima A. Nishino H. Nose Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 330: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, Nrt1 is related in sequence to Fur4, which transports uracil via a proton symport mechanism (27Hopkins P. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Eddy A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 49: 173-177Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that Nrt1 transport of NR is pH-dependent. Although initial rates of 25 μm NR import were essentially unchanged from pH 3.5 to 6.5, the import of NR was reduced to 5% at pH 7.5 and not distinguishable from the background at pH 8 and above (Fig. 3B). Having shown that all detectable NR import is Nrt1-dependent, we were able to characterize the kinetic parameters of NR transport by Nrt1 in wild-type cells over a range of NR concentrations. Transport was saturable with a Km of 21 ± 3.6 μm and a maximal rate of 20.4 ± 0.9 pmol/min/107 cells (Fig. 3C). Taking the intracellular volume of a haploid cell to be 70 fl (28Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), the rate of maximal import would produce ∼29 μm NR inside the cell/min. Under standard supplementation conditions of 10 μm extracellular NR, ∼9 μm nucleoside would be imported per min. In addition to the pH dependence of NR transport, we considered that NR transport may be under the regulation of a set of transcriptional repressors that control expression of multiple components of the NAD+ biosynthetic machinery. Examination of the microarray data from cells deleted for either the transcriptional repressor Sum1, the NAD+-dependent protein lysine deacetylase Hst1, and Rfm1, which forms a protein complex with Sum1 and Hst1, indicates that NRT1 is one of 55 genes derepressed by deletion of each factor (29McCord R. Pierce M. Xie J. Wonkatal S. Mickel C. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NR transport capacity may be derepressed at the transcriptional level under conditions of declining NAD+, when Hst1 enzyme activity becomes limited (30Bedalov A. Hirao M. Posakony J. Nelson M. Simon J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7044-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Once NR enters the cell, it is converted to NMN (2Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Cell. 2004; 117: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) or Nam (3Belenky P. Racette F.G. Bogan K.L. McClure J.M. Smith J.S. Brenner C. Cell. 2007; 129: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To test whether metabolites related to NR inhibit NR transport, non-labeled Nam and NMN were added to NR import assays. At high micromolar concentrations, no inhibition was detected. However, at Nam and NMN concentrations of 10 mm, competitive inhibition was demonstrated (Fig. 3D), albeit with Ki values >2 mm. Sequence Analysis of Nrt1—By hidden Markov modeling and topology prediction (31Kahsay R.Y. Gao G. Liao L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), Nrt1 is a deca-spanning membrane protein with both termini and a 74-amino acid loop between helices 6 and 7 projecting into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). This topology is the same as the 28% sequence identical Fur4 uracilproton symporter, the internalization of which is mediated by cytoplasmic phosphorylation and ubiquitylation (32Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The closest sequence homologs of Nrt1 are Thi7 (84%), the thiamine transporter, and Thi72 (81%), which, like Nrt1, has been considered a low affinity thiamine transporter (15Enjo F. Nosaka K. Ogata M. Iwashima A. Nishimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19165-19170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data suggest recent gene duplication events and, considering the absence of NR transport in nrt1 mutants, functional divergence. In the pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, NR availability appears to play a critical role in host infection (11Ma B. Pan S.J. Zupancic M.L. Cormack B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to note that the sequences most similar to Nrt1 outside of S. cerevisiae Thi7 and Thi72 are C. glabrata sequences XP_446731 (68%) and XP_449349.1 (65%) and the Vanderwaltozyma polyspora sequence XP_001645454.1 (67%). Identification of Nrt1 as the high affinity NR transporter in S. cerevisiae reinforces the need to identify environmental sources of NR. Current data indicate that NR utilization is limited by alkaline conditions and by Nrt1 expression, which is repressed by Sum1, Hst1, and Rfm1 (29McCord R. Pierce M. Xie J. Wonkatal S. Mickel C. Vershon A.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2009-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additional work will be needed to define the effect of cell aging and nutritional conditions on NR transport, the influence of cellular metabolism on Nrt1 internalization, and the identity of NR transporters in other organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2033542419,"The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is needed for post-translational activation of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase by transferring a sulfur atom to the desulfo-molybdenum cofactor of these enzymes. ABA3 is a two-domain protein consisting of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal NifS-like cysteine desulfurase domain and a C-terminal domain of yet undescribed function. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain of ABA3 decomposes l-cysteine to yield elemental sulfur, which subsequently is bound as persulfide to a conserved protein cysteinyl residue within this domain. <i>In vivo</i>, activation of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase also depends on the function of the C-terminal domain, as can be concluded from the <i>A. thaliana aba3</i>/<i>sir3</i>-<i>3</i> mutant. <i>sir3</i>-<i>3</i> plants are strongly reduced in aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activities due to a substitution of arginine 723 by a lysine within the C-terminal domain of the ABA3 protein. Here we present first evidence for the function of the C-terminal domain and show that molybdenum cofactor is bound to this domain with high affinity. Furthermore, cyanide-treated ABA3 C terminus was shown to release thiocyanate, indicating that the molybdenum cofactor bound to the C-terminal domain is present in the sulfurated form. Co-incubation of partially active aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase with ABA3 C terminus carrying sulfurated molybdenum cofactor resulted in stimulation of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase activity. The data of this work suggest that the C-terminal domain of ABA3 might act as a scaffold protein where prebound desulfo-molybdenum cofactor is converted into sulfurated cofactor prior to activation of aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W2066713996,"Sortilin has been implicated in the formation of insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles in adipocytes by regulating sorting events between the trans-Golgi-network and endosomes. We herein show that sortilin serves as a potent myogenic differentiation stimulator for C2C12 myocytes by cooperatively functioning with p75NTR, which subsequently further contributes to development of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system in C2C12 myotubes. Sortilin expression was up-regulated upon C2C12 differentiation, and overexpression of sortilin in C2C12 cells significantly stimulated myogenic differentiation, a response that was completely abolished by either anti-p75NTR- or anti-nerve growth factor (NGF)-neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, small interference RNA-mediated suppression of endogenous sortilin significantly inhibited C2C12 differentiation, indicating the physiological significance of sortilin expression in the process of myogenesis. Although sortilin overexpression in C2C12 myotubes improved insulin-induced 2-deoxyglucose uptake, as previously reported, this effect apparently resulted from a decrease in the cellular content of GLUT1 and an increase in GLUT4 via differentiation-dependent alterations at both the gene transcriptional and the post-translational level. In addition, cellular contents of Ubc9 and SUMO-modified proteins appeared to be increased by sortilin overexpression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that sortilin is involved not only in development of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system in myocytes, but is also directly involved in muscle differentiation via modulation of proNGF-p75NTR.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that sortilin is involved not only in development of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system in myocytes, but is also directly involved in muscle differentiation via modulation of proNGF-p75NTR. One of the major physiological roles of insulin is the control of postprandial blood glucose levels, and skeletal muscle is the primary tissue responsible for the bulk (70-80%) of insulin-stimulated postprandial glucose disposal (1DeFronzo R.A. Jacot E. Jequier E. Maeder E. Wahren J. Felber J.P. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 1000-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 2Nuutila P. Knuuti M.J. Raitakari M. Ruotsalainen U. Teras M. Voipio-Pulkki L.M. Haaparanta M. Solin O. Wegelius U. Yki-Jarvinen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E941-E946PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of insulin on overall glucose disposal is primarily achieved via stimulation of glucose uptake into insulin-target tissues, and defects in this insulin action in skeletal muscle contribute to development of the insulin resistance which is characteristic of type 2 diabetes (3Koistinen H.A. Zierath J.R. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, glucose transport is regulated by a facilitative glucose transport system involving at least two members of the glucose transporter family, GLUT1 and GLUT4 (4Mueckler M. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 6-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their expression levels are strictly regulated during myocyte differentiation (5Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). GLUT1 is targeted predominantly to the sarcolemma (muscle plasma membrane) and is therefore implicated in the regulation of basal glucose transport, although a marked reduction in GLUT1 expression occurs during muscle differentiation (5Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Shimokawa T. Kato M. Ezaki O. Hashimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 is remarkably up-regulated upon muscle differentiation, and GLUT4 protein is predominantly localized in intracellular tubulo-vesicular elements under basal conditions (7Rodnick K.J. Slot J.W. Studelska D.R. Hanpeter D.E. Robinson L.J. Geuze H.J. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6278-6285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ralston E. Ploug T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2967-2978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular storage compartments to the cell surface, resulting in the insulin-responsive augmentation of glucose uptake (9Rudich A. Klip A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2003; 178: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, differentiation-dependent changes in the amount and composition of these GLUT proteins, especially the increase in cellular GLUT4 content, contribute to development of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system in myocytes and adipocytes (5Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9885-9890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, GLUT4 expression is not the only factor responsible for conferring the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake function in these insulin-responsive cells, because ectopic expression of GLUT4 in other cell types such as fibroblasts is insufficient to generate an insulin-stimulated glucose transport system (11Haney P.M. Slot J.W. Piper R.C. James D.E. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent studies using adipocytes have revealed that one of the additional factors prerequisite for higher insulin responsiveness is a signaling cascade developed during the course of adipocyte differentiation that is absent in pre-adipocytes (13Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 14Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A.

In addition to differentiation-dependent establishment of this signaling cascade, Kandror and colleagues (15Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 16Lefrancois S. Zeng J. Hassan A.J. Canuel M. Morales C.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6430-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) recently reported that sortilin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is implicated in the sorting of Vps10p-interacting proteins between the trans-Golgi network, plasma membrane, and lysosomes, serves as another important factor that promotes development of the insulin-induced glucose transport system by producing insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles. They found that fibroblasts ectopically expressing both sortilin and GLUT4 display significantly augmented glucose uptake in response to insulin stimulation (12Shi J. Kandror K.V. Dev Cell. 2005; 9: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although it has already been reported that sortilin is expressed in muscle (17Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

Sortilin was originally purified from human brain extracts using receptor-associated protein affinity chromatography (17Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H.

Sortilin has a Vps10p domain in its luminal region at the N terminus and therefore belongs to the mammalian VPS10p family of sorting receptors. The intraluminal domain of sortilin was shown to interact with a wide array of proteins, including an unprocessed form of nerve growth factor (proNGF), 3The abbreviations used are:proNGFunprocessed form of nerve growth factorNGFnerve growth factorp75NTRp75 neurotrophin receptorVpsvacuolar protein sortingGGAGolgi-localizing γ-adaptin ear homology domain, ARF-binding proteinsARFADP-ribosylation factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNASUMOsmall ubiquitin-related modifierBDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorMHCmyosin heavy chainDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminECFPenhanced cyan fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineAbantibody. neurotensin, lipoprotein lipase, precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and prosaposin, as well as receptor-associated protein (16Lefrancois S.

Therefore, sortilin functions not only to direct the intracellular movements of such newly synthesized interacting proteins but also functions as a receptor for these proteins once sortilin is exposed to the cell surface plasma membrane. Nevertheless, the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin does not possess a domain enabling it to directly activate the intracellular signaling cascade (24Mazella J. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent studies have, however, revealed that sortilin forms a complex with proNGF and p75NTR, a low affinity NGF receptor, and triggers p75NTR signaling cascades leading to various cellular responses, including differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (22Nykjaer A. Lee R. Teng K.K. Jansen P. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Kliemannel M. Schwarz E. Willnow T.E. Hempstead B.L. Petersen C.M.

Interestingly, genes encoding precursors of NGF and BDNF, and their common low affinity receptor p75NTR, were shown to be expressed in C2C12 myoblasts (26Seidl K. Erck C. Buchberger A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, several lines of evidence indicate that NGF affects myogenic differentiation and muscle development in an autocrine fashion via p75NTR (26Seidl K. Erck C. Buchberger A. J. Cell.

In the present study, we explored the functional roles of sortilin in muscle by using the skeletal muscle cell line C2C12. We herein report sortilin to be a potent differentiation stimulator functioning cooperatively with p75NTR, which subsequently further contributes to development of the insulin responsive glucose transport system in C2C12 cells. We present compelling evidence that sortilin is involved not only in generating insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles but also in elaborating an entire glucose transport system exhibiting much higher insulin responsiveness via regulation of the processes of myogenesis, including expressions of GLUT proteins and perhaps various other proteins involved in the development of insulin responsiveness. Thus, our results provide new insights into the functional roles of sortilin in myogenesis and in development of the insulin-responsive glucose transport system in myocytes.

Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were of the purest grade available from Sigma Chemicals. Cell Culture—Myoblasts from the mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (30Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 30 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (growth medium) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For biochemical study, cells were grown on 6-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 3 ml of growth medium. Three days after plating, the cells had reached ∼80-90% confluence (Day 0). Differentiation was then induced by switching the growth medium to DMEM supplemented with 2% calf serum, 30 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (differentiation medium). The differentiation medium was changed every 24 h. For the immunofluorescent staining study, cells were grown on 22-mm glass coverslips (Matsunami C022221, Osaka, Japan) in 6-well plates. Generation of C2C12 Cells Expressing Sortilin—Human sortilin cDNA was inserted into a pMXs retroviral vector, which is generated by modifying the pBABE retroviral vector (31Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). The pMXs-sortilin or pMXs (control) was transfected into Plat E cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), and high titer retroviral supernatants were obtained. C2C12 myoblasts were infected with the generated retrovirus in growth medium containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene. Two days after infection, positive selection was performed in the presence of 5 μg/ml puromycin, and 20 individual clones were isolated. The sortilin expression level in each clone was analyzed by Western blotting as described below. Adenoviral Expression of Myc-GLUT4-ECFP in C2C12 Cells—An adenoviral technique was used to express rat GLUT4, possessing the c-Myc epitope tag in the first extracellular loop and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) at the C terminus. Briefly, established exofacial-Myc-GLUT4-ECFP cDNA (32Kanzaki M. Furukawa M. Raab W. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30622-30633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was inserted into adenoviral vector pHMCA5, generously provided by Dr. H. Mizuguchi (33Mizuguchi H. Kay M.A. Hum Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mizuguchi H. Kay M.A. Hum Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The high titer viruses were produced by transfection of pHMCA5-Myc-GLUT4-ECFP or empty vector into 293 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Applied Science). Viral stocks of 5-50 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml were prepared in serum-free DMEM and frozen at -80 °C. The next day the medium was changed, and incubation was continued for another 24 h. Then, 2-deoxy[3H]glucose and Myc antibody uptake assays were performed as described below. Expression of Myc-GLUT4-ECFP was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Western Blot Analysis—The expression levels of each protein were analyzed by Western blotting. In brief, cells were lysed with NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). The extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations of supernatants were determined, and 3× Laemmli sample buffer was added to achieve a 1× final concentration. From 50 to 100 μg of total protein was subjected to 7.5-10% SDS-PAGE (1:30, bis:acrylamide). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.), and the membranes were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoblotting to detect each protein was achieved with an overnight incubation at 4 °C with 3% BSA/TBS containing either anti-sortilin antibody (1:1000), anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibody (1:1000), anti-myogenin antibody (1:1000), anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (1:1000), or anti-troponin T antibody (1:1000). Anti-β-actin (1:500) or anti-insulin receptor β-subunit (1:1000) antibodies were used as a loading control. Specific total proteins were visualized after subsequent incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and a SuperSignal Chemiluminescence detection procedure (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Three independent experiments were performed for each condition. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Assay—A 2-deoxy[3H]glucose uptake assay was performed as previously described (35Nedachi T. Kanzaki M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: E817-E828Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 4 h, and then washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate HEPES buffer (KRPH buffer; 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6)). The serum-starved cells were incubated without or with 100 nm insulin for 60 min in KRPH buffer and then chilled on ice. After washing with ice-cold KRPH buffer, glucose transport was determined by addition of 2-deoxy[3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 0.1 mm, 0.5 μCi/ml). After 4 min of incubation with the KRPH buffer containing 2-deoxy[3H]glucose, the reaction was stopped by adding phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma), and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in 0.2 n NaOH solution, and 2-deoxy[3H]glucose uptake was assessed by scintillation counting. 20 μm cytochalasin B were added to the assay buffer for the measurement of nonspecific background. Specific uptake, i.e. the background subtracted from the total uptake, was obtained. The protein content was determined in each experiment with a BCA protein assay kit. Data are presented as picomoles of 2-deoxy[3H]glucose per milligram protein per minute. For each experiment, at least three assays were performed under each condition, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Anti-Myc Antibody Uptake Assay—For the measurement of insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, the C2C12 cells expressing Myc-GLUT4-ECFP were starved in serum-free DMEM for 4 h, washed three times with KRPH buffer, and then placed in a CO2 incubator with 2 ml of KRPH buffer. Ten minutes after incubation, the cells were treated with or without 100 nm insulin in the presence of 4 μg/ml of the anti-Myc antibody for 60 min. Next, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, harvested using 1× Laemmli sample buffer without bromphenol blue and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). After the protein concentration had been determined, bromphenol blue and 2-mercaptoethanol were added, denatured by incubation for 5 min at 95 °C, and subjected to Western blotting using anti-mouse IgG antibody, anti-Myc antibody, or anti-Sortilin antibody. Immunofluorescence and Image Analysis—After experimental treatments, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were washed, and then blocked in PBS containing 5% calf serum plus 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively (unless otherwise indicated), in 1% BSA/PBS, and samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were imaged using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV-1000) with associated application program ASW Ver. 1.3 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) for processing. Myogenin-positive cells were counted within a 500-μm × 500-μm area. At least five fields were counted for each sample under 20× microscopic magnification. For all microscopic analyses, at least three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Subcellular Fractionation of C2C12 Cells—To detect endogenous GLUT1 and GLUT4, fractionation was performed according to the method of Tortorella and Pilch (36Tortorella L.L. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E514-E524Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (three 150-mm plates for each sample) were washed with PBS three times, harvested with a cell scraper, suspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, then homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to collect the pellet for the total membrane fraction. For detection of GLUT1, the total membrane fraction was lysed in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting using anti-GLUT1 antibody (1:5840). For detection of GLUT4, the total membrane fraction was lysed in 100 μl of 8 m urea, 5% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). After the protein concentration had been determined as described above, dithiothreitol and bromphenol blue were added to each sample (final concentrations, 343.6 μm and 0.005%, respectively). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-GLUT4 antibody (1:500) (37Shibata H. Omata W. Suzuki Y. Tanaka S. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9704-9709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and was quantified using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Reverse transcription was carried out using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit for PCR from Roche Applied Science. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using the Roche LightCycler, utilizing Roche SYBR Green reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplification of PCR products was quantified during PCR by measuring fluorescence associated with binding of double-stranded DNA to the SYBR Green dye incorporated into the reaction mixture. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to PCR-amplify the cDNAs of interest were: GLUT4 (upper primer, 5′-TGCTCTCCTGCAGCTGATT-3′; lower primer, 5′-TTCAGCTCAGCTAGTGCGTC-3′), GLUT1 (upper primer, 5′-CTTCCTGCTCATCAATCGT-3′; lower primer, 5′-AGCTCCAAGATGGTGACCTT-3′), sortilin (upper primer, 5′-AATGGTCGAGACTATGTTGTG-3′; lower primer, 5′-CCGGTACCCATTTGTTGT-3′), and Ubc9 (upper primer, 5′-GGCACAATGAACCTGATGAAC-3′; lower primer, 5′-TTGGTGGTGAGGACGGATAGT-3′). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was quantified as a housekeeping gene by using: upper primer 5′-GGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATGA-3′, and lower primer 5′-GCATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGT-3′. Following an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 1 min, 30-45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 1 s, and 72 °C for 10 s were used for GLUT4, GLUT1, sortilin, and Ubc9. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 57.5 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s was used. siRNA-mediated Reduction of Sortilin in C2C12 Cells—The siRNA species purchased from Nippon EGT Co. Ltd. (Toyama, Japan) were designed to target the following cDNA sequences: scrambled, 5′-AGGGUGGGUUUGGCCAAAATT-3′; and sortilin siRNA-1, 5′-GGUGGUGUUAACAGCAGAGTT-3′; sortilin siRNA-2, 5′-CCAUUGGUGUGAAAAUCUA-3′, and sortilin siRNA-3, 5′-GGACCACAUUACUAUACCA-3′. Scramble and sortilin siRNA-1 were modified from the reference (38Zeng J. Hassan A.J. Morales C.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 68: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the sequences of sortilin siRNA-2 and -3 were provided by Nippon EGT Co. Ltd. 200 nmol of sortilin siRNA, or scrambled siRNA species, was introduced into C2C12 myoblasts using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Ninety-six hours after transfection (day 3 of differentiation), cells were harvested with NET buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-sortilin antibody, anti-myogenin antibody, or anti-β-actin antibody (as a control). Measurement of GLUT Stability—Adenoviral infected WT- and sort10-C2C12 cells expressing Myc-GLUT4-ECFP were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, and"

A new series begins this week. 'Horizons' are commissioned articles in which experts speculate on what will happen over the next few years in their fields. On the cover, one of Antony Gormley's figures in his Another Place installation sets the tone. In the first piece, Thomas Kirkwood considers the potential of systems biology to de-link disease and old age. Peter Murray-Rust writes on a new 'open' approach to chemistry. But his subtext is broader: the future of the 'semantic web', where computers can make as much use of information as humans can. M. Armand and J.-M. Tarascon show how advances in materials science can provide the batteries of the future. George Koentges tackles 'evo-devo', the marriage of fossil evidence, genomic sequencing and molecular developmental biology. And R. J. Schoelkopf and S. M. Girvin raise the prospect that circuit quantum electrodynamics could pave the way for practical quantum computing and communication.

Although several cytoskeletal proteins have been identified as substrates, how localized calpain activity is regulated and the mechanisms controlling substrate recognition are not clear. In this study, we report that phosphoinositide binding regulates the susceptibility of the cytoskeletal adhesion protein α-actinin to proteolysis by calpains 1 and 2. At first, α-actinin did not appear to be a substrate for calpain 2; however, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) binding to α-actinin resulted in nearly complete proteolysis of the full-length protein, producing stable breakdown products. Calpain 1 was able to cleave α-actinin in the absence of phosphoinositide binding; however, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding increased the rate of proteolysis, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) binding significantly inhibited cleavage. Phosphoinositide binding appeared to regulate calpain proteolysis of α-actinin by modulating the exposure of a highly sensitive cleavage site within the calponin homology 2 domain. In U87MG glioblastoma cells, which contain elevated levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, α-actinin colocalized with calpain within dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures. Furthermore, proteolysis of α-actinin producing stable breakdown products was observed in U87MG cells treated with calcium ionophore to activate the calcium-dependent calpains. Additional evidence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated calpain proteolysis of α-actinin was observed in rat embryonic fibroblasts. These results suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding is a critical determinant for α-actinin proteolysis by calpain.

In conclusion, phosphoinositide binding to the substrate is a potential mechanism for regulating susceptibility to proteolysis by calpain. Calpains 1 and 2 are ubiquitous calcium-dependent proteases that play an important role in the signaling of various cellular processes and have been implicated in the degeneration observed in numerous pathological conditions (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). The requirement of calcium concentrations above physiological levels, micromolar for calpain 1 and millimolar for calpain 2, has stimulated much investigation for other factors involved in the activation of calpain. Autolysis lowers the concentration of calcium required for half-maximal activity from 7.1 to 0.6 μm for calpain 1 and from 1000 to 180 μm for calpain 2 (2Edmunds T. Nagainis P.A. Sathe S.K. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no evidence that autolysis is required for calpain modulation in cells.

Although progress has been made in understanding how calpain activity is regulated in the cell, lack of knowledge regarding the mechanisms controlling substrate recognition limits the understanding of calpain function. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate calponin homology phosphoinositide 3-kinase glutathione S-transferase platelet-derived growth factor green fluorescent protein. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate calponin homology phosphoinositide 3-kinase glutathione S-transferase platelet-derived growth factor green fluorescent protein. Calpains 1 and 2 cleave several adhesion proteins involved in cell motility, and inhibition of calpain activity reduces cell migration (10Franco S.J. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A role for calpain proteolysis in cell adhesion was first proposed in a 1987 study by Beckerle et al. (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which localized calpain 2 to focal adhesions and demonstrated that talin was a sensitive substrate. In the study, the authors showed that purified α-actinin was not susceptible to calpain proteolysis (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Using pharmacological inhibitors, the importance of calpain activity was extended to cell migration, identifying a role for calpain in the detachment of the rear of the cell during migration (12Palecek S.P. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A role for calpain in the regulation of cell migration was further established when embryonic fibroblasts lacking calpain 1 and 2 activity were observed to have decreased rates of migration correlating with a loss of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (14Dourdin N. Bhatt A.K. Dutt P. Greer P.A. Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Huttenlocher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion and migration have become a valuable model system for examining the physiological regulation and function of calpain proteolysis. Although the work cited above provides convincing evidence that calpains 1 and 2 are necessary for the migration of various cell types, the precise mechanisms controlling substrate recognition during cell migration are not understood. Phosphoinositides are also important for cell migration, particularly during chemotaxis (15Van Haastert P.J. Devreotes P.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 16Insall R.H. Weiner O.D. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 743-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is required for establishing polarity and actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells (17Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and more recently, a role for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was identified at the rear of migrating cells (18Van Keymeulen A. Wong K. Knight Z.A. Govaerts C. Hahn K.M. Shokat K.M. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 also appears to play an important role at the leading edge and rear of migrating cells (19Sun Y. Ling K. Wagoner M.P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the specific functions of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 during cell migration are not clearly defined, both phosphoinositides bind to and regulate the structure and function of various cytoskeletal and adhesion proteins (20Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Two studies have identified loose connections between phosphoinositide binding and calpain proteolysis. The first showed that overexpression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enhanced calpain proteolysis of fodrin, a brain-specific isoform of spectrin (21Aki T. Yoshida K. Fujimiya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second demonstrated that calpain cleaved α-actinin in T cells (22Selliah N. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar) stimulated under conditions that activate PI3K (23Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the basis of these studies, we proposed the hypothesis that the susceptibility of adhesion proteins to calpain proteolysis is controlled by phosphoinositide binding to the substrate protein. To test this hypothesis, we examined the proteolysis of α-actinin by calpain in the absence and presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vitro and in cultured glioblastoma cells. Our results demonstrate that phosphoinositide regulation of α-actinin structure controls access to the calpain cleavage site, modulating susceptibility to proteolytic post-translational modification. Reagents and Proteins—Phosphoinositides were purchased from Matreya (State College, PA). Anti-α-actinin IgM (BM-75.2) and anti-talin were from Sigma. Anti-calpain 2 was purchased from Triple Point Biologics (Forest Grove, OR). Anti-α-actinin IgG (AT6.172) and anti-calpain 1 were from Chemicon. Anti-GFP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Calpain 1 (purified from human erythrocytes; specific activity ≥ 1000 units/mg), calpain 2 (rat recombinant; specific activity ≥ 1500 units/mg), and A23187 were purchased from Calbiochem. α-Actinin dimer was purified from chicken gizzard as described previously (24Feramisco J.R.

The GST-α-actinin actin-binding domain and His-tagged CH2 domain were expressed and purified as described (25Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol.

Incubations were continued for an additional 1 h in the absence or presence of calpain and 1 mm calcium. Reactions were stopped by the addition of a modified gel loading buffer containing 250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, followed by a 2-min incubation at 100 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce) or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting, and quantified using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. N-terminal Sequencing—Following calpain proteolysis and electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Protein bands were identified by Ponceau S staining and excised, and N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out by the University of Texas Medical Branch Biomolecular Resource Facility (Galveston, TX). Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—U87MG glioblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum following the protocols from the supplier (ATCC). Immunostaining was carried out using cells plated on fibronectin as described (27Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and fixed with 3% formaldehyde (Tousimis) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min; blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C; and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with anti-α-actinin IgM (1:500), anti-calpain 1 IgG (1:20), or anti-calpain 2 IgG (1:20). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and mounted using ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). Immunostaining was examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 100× microscope, and images were captured with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera controlled by Metamorph 6.3 imaging software. Rat embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum and were treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) as described previously (28Greenwood J.A.

Cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-tagged wild-type or mutant α-actinin and p110(K227E)5′-Myc as reported previously (25Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R.

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Binding Increases the Susceptibility of α-Actinin to Proteolysis by Calpain 2—Although evidence has been reported that calpain is involved in the proteolysis of α-actinin in T cells (22Selliah N. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar), α-actinin was shown to be a poor substrate for calpain 2 in vitro (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro assays were carried out in the absence of phosphoinositides. In the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, α-actinin was highly susceptible to proteolysis by calpain 2 (Fig. 1). Consistent with the previous report (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), <20% of the α-actinin protein was cleaved by calpain 2 in the absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1, lane 2). However, when PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was bound to α-actinin, almost complete proteolysis of the full-length protein was observed, leaving stable breakdown products of ∼80 and ∼65 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4). Although differences in the size of breakdown products were observed, PtdIns(4,5)P2 did not alter the extent of α-actinin proteolysis by calpain 2 (Fig. 1, lane 6). The increase in susceptibility resulting from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to α-actinin was observed at low nanomolar concentrations of calpain (Fig. 2). At a concentration of 10 nm calpain 2, the major breakdown product appeared to be ∼80 kDa, consistent with the size of the α-actinin fragment resulting from the activation of calpain in anti-CD3-treated T cells (22Selliah N. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, anti-CD3 also activates PI3K in T cells (23Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), further supporting the hypothesis that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding regulates the susceptibility of α-actinin to proteolysis by calpain. The small increase in the size of the major calpain 2-induced breakdown product observed with increasing concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 indicates that binding enhances the susceptibility of α-actinin by exposing a highly sensitive cleavage site (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Calpain 2 cleaves PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-bound α-actinin at low nanomolar concentrations. α-Actinin (1 μm) was preincubated in the absence or presence of 50 μm PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for 15 min at 30 °C.

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 did not appear to alter the concentration of calcium required for calpain 2 to cleave α-actinin (Fig. 4). PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to bind to and influence the activity of calpain 2 (3Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Suzuki K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 485-489PubMed Google Scholar, 4Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 did not enhance the proteolysis of α-actinin by calpain 2. In addition, the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 did not affect the proteolysis of GST, a moderate substrate for calpain 2 (data not shown). These results support the hypothesis that it is the direct binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to α-actinin that is regulating susceptibility to proteolysis by calpain. Calpain 2 Cleavage Removes the Actin-binding Domain of α-Actinin—Using monoclonal antibodies specific for the N or C terminus of α-actinin (30Corgan A.M. Singleton C. Santoso C.B. Greenwood J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we were able to deduce that calpain 2 cleaves within the N-terminal region of the protein (Fig. 5). Immunoblotting with anti-α-actinin clone AT6.172, recognizing the N terminus (30Corgan A.M. Singleton C. Santoso C.B. Greenwood J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), demonstrated that calpain proteolysis in the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 resulted in an almost complete lost of signal (Fig. 5A, lane 4). In contrast, immunoblotting with anti-α-actinin clone BM-75.2, recognizing the C terminus (30Corgan A.M. Singleton C. Santoso C.B. Greenwood J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), demonstrated that calpain proteolysis in the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 resulted in a stable breakdown product of ∼80 kDa, which included the C terminus (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Furthermore, proteolysis of a GST fusion protein containing the actin-binding domain of α-actinin demonstrated that both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 increased the susceptibility of the isolated domain to cleavage by calpain 2 (Fig. 6). However, the extent of calpain cleavage of the isolated CH2 domain was independent of phosphoinositide binding (Fig. 7). A diagram of the full-length α-actinin homodimer is shown in Fig. 8.FIGURE 6Binding of both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 increases the susceptibility of the isolated actin-binding domain of α-actinin to proteolysis by calpain 2.

The diagram of the α-actinin homodimer identifies the three regions of the protein: the actin-binding domain (ABD), the spectrin repeats, and the EF-hand domain. The location of the phosphoinositide-binding site is represented by the symbol within the CH2 domain (25Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol.

The primary cleavage site determined by N-terminal sequencing is marked by the arrowhead; a secondary cleavage site is identified by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The combined results of the proteolysis assays suggest that a highly sensitive calpain cleavage site resides within the CH2 domain of α-actinin. The susceptibility of the CH2 domain to calpain proteolysis suggests that this cleavage site is exposed in the isolated domain (Fig. 7). However, when the actin-binding domain is expressed with the CH1 and CH2 domains together, the highly sensitive calpain cleavage site is no longer accessible. The crystal structure of the isolated α-actinin actin-binding domain demonstrates interaction between the CH1 and CH2 domains (31Borrego-Diaz E. Kerff F. Lee S.H. Ferron F. Li Y. Dominguez R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 155: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the potential to restrict access to the highly sensitive calpain cleavage site. Both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 increased the susceptibility of the isolated actin-binding domain to calpain proteolysis. Presumably, phosphoinositide binding disrupted the interaction between the CH domains, increasing access to the highly sensitive calpain cleavage site. Previous studies have also presented evidence of interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the adjacent molecules of the α-actinin homodimer (32Tang J. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Young P. Gautel M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which would further restrict access to the highly sensitive calpain cleavage site. Interestingly, only the binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could expose the highly sensitive cleavage site within the α-actinin homodimer, increasing susceptibility to calpain proteolysis (Fig. 1). Similarly, only PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding can disrupt α-actinin bundled actin filaments (30Corgan A.M. Singleton C. Santoso C.B. Greenwood J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As we have proposed previously, the phosphates at the fourth and fifth positions of the inositol head group of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 appear to mediate binding with the CH2 domain, whereas the phosphate at the third position of the inositol head group appears to disrupt interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of the α-actinin homodimer (25Fraley T.S.

Singleton C. Santoso C.B. Greenwood J.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To further understand phosphoinositide regulation of α-actinin proteolysis by calpain, it was important to identify the location of the highly sensitive calpain cleavage site. N-terminal sequencing of the ∼80-kDa breakdown product resulting from calpain 2 proteolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-bound α-actinin revealed that cleavage occurred after tyrosine 246 (Fig. 8) within the final helix of the CH2 domain (31Borrego-Diaz E. Kerff F. Lee S.H. Ferron F. Li Y. Dominguez R. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 155: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the signal was significantly lower, evidence for a secondary cleavage site after serine 243 was also observed. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent cleavage of α-actinin within the CH2 domain is consistent with the binding of phosphoinositides to this domain (25Fraley T.S. Tran T.C. Corgan A.M. Nash C.A. Hao J. Critchley D.R. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24039-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Binding Increases and PtdIns(4,5)P2 Binding Decreases the Susceptibility of α-Actinin to Proteolysis by Calpain 1—Similar to the calpain 2 isoform, calpain 1 is a ubiquitous calcium-activated protease involved in the regulation of cell migration (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 10Franco S.J. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3829-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 34Wu M. Yu Z. Fan J. Caron A. Whiteway M. Shen S.H. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although calpain 1 is activated by micromolar levels of calcium compared with the millimolar concentrations required for calpain 2, both isoforms appear to have the same substrate specificity. To determine whether phosphoinositide binding influences α-actinin susceptibility to cleavage by calpain 1, the proteolysis assay described above was repeated. Some cleavage of α-actinin by calpain 1 was observed in the absence of phosphoinositides (Fig. 9, lane 2). However, consistent with calpain 2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 increased the susceptibility of α-actinin to calpain 1 proteolysis by altering the primary site of cleavage to produce a breakdown product of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 9, lane 4). In contrast to calpain 2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding inhibited calpain 1 proteolysis of α-actinin (Fig. 9, lane 6). N-terminal sequencing of the ∼80-kDa breakdown product showed that calpain 1 cleaved PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-bound α-actinin after tyrosine 246, the same site as calpain 2 (Fig. 8). By exposing the cleavage site at tyrosine 246, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 not only increased the susceptibility of α-actinin but restricted calpain 1 to the production of one primary breakdown product. Thus far, the results suggest that phosphoinositide binding to the substrate influences calpain proteolysis by 1) regulating the rate or extent of proteolysis and 2) controlling the cleavage site and production of breakdown products. To determine whether PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 influences the concentration of calcium required for calpain 1 cleavage of α-actinin, proteolysis assays were carried out in the presence of increasing calcium concentrations. Surprisingly, the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 increased the in vitro concentration of calcium required for calpain 1 cleavage of α-actinin from 125 to 250 μm (Fig. 10). However, the negatively charged phosphate groups on phosphoinositides have been demonstrated to bind divalent cations in vitro (35Flanagan L.A. Cunningham C.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Kosik K.S. Janmey P.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1440-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), providing one explanation for the increased calcium requirement. Calcium-dependent Proteolysis of α-Actinin in U87MG Glioblastoma Cells—Although calpain proteolysis of α-actinin has been shown in T cells (22Selliah N. Brooks W.H. Roszman T.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar) under conditions that potentially activate PI3K (23Von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it was important to verify these results in cells known to be regulated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. U87MG glioblastoma cells are deficient for the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase PTEN and therefore have relatively high basal levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (36Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 37Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C.

Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar), providing a good system to test whether α-actinin is a substrate for calpain in adherent cells. Because colocalization is required for an enzyme to act upon its substrate in a cellular system, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the localization of α-actinin and calpains 1 and 2 in U87MG glioblastoma cells induced to migrate by plating on fibronectin as described previously (27Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Strong staining for calpain 1 was observed in the perinuclear region of U87MG cells (Fig. 11A). However, a distinct population of calpain 1 was also observed at the leading edge of this migrating cell (Fig. 11A, arrow). α-Actinin staining was observed in the perinuclear region and within the adhesion complexes at the leading edge and rear of the cell (Fig. 11A′). A beaded staining pattern was also observed, representing the population of α-actinin localized along actin stress fibers. Most importantly, all of the staining observed for calpain 1 at the leading edge of the cell colocalized with α-actinin-containing adhesion complexes (Fig. 11A, arrow). However, not all α-actinin staining adhesion complexes costained for calpain 1. For example, calpain 1 staining was not observed in the α-actinin-containing adhesion complex at the rear of the cell (Fig. 11A, arrowhead). Similar to calpain 1, the strongest staining for calpain 2 was observed in the perinuclear region (Fig. 11B). However, distinct populations of calpain 2 staining were also observed to colocalize with α-actinin within membrane ruffles at the cell edge (Fig. 11B, arrow). These results demonstrate that calpains 1 and 2 colocalize with α-actinin within highly dynamic actin cytoskeletal structures of U87MG glioblastoma cells. However, the percent of the total α-actinin population localized to these dynamic structures is small, suggesting that only a small fraction of the total α-actinin population is subject to proteolysis by calpain. Protein from U87MG glioblastoma total cell lysates was immunoblotted to assay for α-actinin proteolysis. The calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the cells to rapidly increase the intracellular concentrations of calcium and to activate calpain. Activation of the calcium-dependent calpain proteases was verified by immunoblotting for talin, an established calpain substrate and adhesion protein (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). As expected, a time-dependent increase in the previously reported talin breakdown product (11Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Franco S.J. Rodgers M.A. Perrin B.J. Han J. Bennin D.A. Critchley D.R. Huttenlocher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) was observed following treatment with A23187 (Fig. 12). Similar to talin, a time-dependent increase in α-actinin breakdown products was observed in the A23187-treated cells. In addition, α-actinin breakdown products were observed in untreated cells (t = 0), suggesting that a basal level of calpain activity exists in U87MG cells. Interestingly, no talin proteolysis was observed in the untreated cells. Franco et al. (39Franco S. Perrin B. Huttenlocher A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have reported that calpain 2 is responsible for the proteolysis of talin in fibroblasts. Therefore, it is possible that calpain 2 was responsible for the A23187-stimulated proteolysis of α-actinin and talin in the U87MG cells, whereas calpain 1 was responsible for the proteolysis of α-actinin observed in the untreated cells (Fig. 12). PDGF-induced Proteolysis of α-Actinin in Fibroblasts—Numerous studies have reported that PDGF induces cell motility in a PI3K-dependent manner (40Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that PDGF treatment of fibroblasts induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to α-actinin, resulting in the restructuring of focal adhesion plaques (28Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lysates from PDGF-treated fibroblasts were immunoblotted to determine whether α-actinin proteolysis correlated with focal adhesion restructuring. Time-dependent increases in α-actinin breakdown products were observed following 10- and 30-min treatments with PDGF (Fig. 13). The breakdown products migrated as a doublet of ∼80 kDa, consistent with that observed for α-actinin proteolysis by calpain in vitro (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 9). These results suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated calpain proteolysis of α-actinin may play a role in the regulation of cell adhesion during migration. Phosphoinositide Binding Regulates the Susceptibility of α-Actinin to Proteolysis in Fibroblasts—To test the hypothesis that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding regulates the susceptibility of α-actinin to calpain proteolysis in a cellular system, constitutively active PI3K was coexpressed with GFP-tagged wild-type or mutant α-actinin with a decreased affinity for phosphoinositides (25Fraley T.S.

Coexpression of GFP-tagged wild-type α-actinin with constitutively active PI3K resulted in an increase in α-actinin breakdown products (Fig. 14, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, an increase in α-actinin breakdown products was not observed when GFP-tagged mutant α-actinin was coexpressed with constitutively active PI3K (Fig. 14, lanes 4 and 5). Coexpression of GFP-tagged α-actinin with constitutively active PI3K was confirmed by immunostaining as shown in Ref. 29Fraley T.S. Pereira C.B. Tran T.C. Singleton C. Greenwood J.A. J. Biol.

Previously, we used this experimental system to demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding to α-actinin played a role in regulating the disassembly of focal adhesions and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (29Fraley T.S.

Results of the current study suggest that the mechanism by which PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding mediates α-actinin function involves regulation of susceptibility to proteolysis by calpain. The requirement for calpain activity during cell adhesion and migration is well established with influence on the processes of cell spreading, membrane protrusion, adhesion complex turnover, and tail retraction (12Palecek S.P.

Although calpain cleavage of adhesion proteins is an important regulatory mechanism, it is not clear how the localization, activation, and substrate selection for calpains 1 and 2 are modulated during cell adhesion and migration. This study addresses the cellular regulation of the calpain system from the point of view of the substrate, identifying a role for phosphoinositide binding in modulating the susceptibility of α-actinin to calpain proteolysis. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-regulated proteolysis of α-actinin by calpain in cell adhesion and migration. In addition, it will be important to determine whether calpain proteolysis of other proteins is influenced by phosphoinositide binding."

Second, it is found that the conversion factors (Cf) for the transfer of hydrogen to the pro-S and pro-R positions of the methylene group are not equivalent: the Cf-1-R:Cf-1-S ratio is 2.1, whereas the Cf-3-R:Cf-3-S ratio is 0.8. It is shown that this non-equivalence is not determined by the stereochemistry of the terminal NADH- and NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, but is dependent on the cofactor selectivities of the reductive and oxidative steps of the reduced nucleotide cycle. The anaerobic fermentation of glucose by Leuconostoc mesenteroides via the reductive pentose phosphate pathway leads to the accumulation of lactic acid and ethanol.

During the anaerobic fermentation of glucose by the reductive pentose phosphate (RPP) 2The abbreviations used are:RPPreductive pentose phosphate6-PDG6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenaseADHalcohol dehydrogenaseAlDHaldehyde dehydrogenaseCfhydrogen atom transfer coefficientGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating)Glu-6-PDHglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseLDHlactate dehydrogenase.2The abbreviations used are:RPPreductive pentose phosphate6-PDG6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenaseADHalcohol dehydrogenaseAlDHaldehyde dehydrogenaseCfhydrogen atom transfer coefficientGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating)Glu-6-PDHglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenaseLDHlactate dehydrogenase. pathway, each mole of glucose is converted to 1 mol of CO2, 1 mol of d-lactate, and 1 mol of ethanol. In the course of this fermentation, the hydrogen atoms of glucose are redistributed among the hydrogen atoms of the d-lactate and ethanol that accumulate, or lost to the medium. Hydrogen may be transferred directly in a C-H bond that remains intact, or via the reduced nucleotide pool NAD(P)H. Further hydrogens are introduced from water. The relationship between the substrate hydrogens and the products has been largely established by using 3H or highly enriched 2H tracer studies (Fig. 1). reductive pentose phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase hydrogen atom transfer coefficient glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase. reductive pentose phosphate 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase aldehyde dehydrogenase hydrogen atom transfer coefficient glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase. However, such studies mostly show only the qualitative relationships. By using natural abundance and very low 2H enrichment, the isotopic redistribution of 2H into the products of fermentation can be quantitatively measured using 2H NMR (1Pionnier S. Zhang B.L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Pionnier S. Robins R.J. Zhang B-L. J. Agric. Food.

Thus, (a2H/1H)i=aim(a2H/1H)m+∑jaij(a2H/1H)j(Eq. 1) where (2H/1H)i is the isotopic ratio at position i of the product, (2H/1H)m is the isotopic ratio of the medium, and (2H/1H)j is the isotopic ratio at site j of the substrate. The terms aim and aij are the isotope redistribution coefficients that give the quantitative description of the link between the substrate and the products (2Pionnier S. Robins R.J. Zhang B-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Zhang B-L. Yunianta Martin M. J. Biol.

The value of these parameters is principally defined by the exchange reactions that can occur, directly or indirectly, between the water of the medium and the hydrogen atoms in the substrate, the intermediates and the products, and the kinetic isotope effects associated with the biochemical reactions involved in the fermentation pathway. These influences lead to a non-statistical distribution of 2H in the population of monodeuterated isotopomers within the final product (3Robins R.J. Billault I. Duan J.R. Guiet S. Pionnier S. Zhang B-L. Phytochem. Rev. 2003; 2: 87-102Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The technique of quantitatively describing the hydrogen isotope transfer coefficient (Cf) values using 2H NMR has been used to show that it is possible to distinguish the pathway used to ferment glucose to lactic acid by the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis (glycolysis) and Leuconostoc (Ln.) mesenteroides (RPP) (5Roger O. Lavigne R. Mahmoud M. Buisson C. Onno B. Zhang B-L. Robins R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24923-24928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In those cases where a prochiral center exists, the stereospecificity of the reductase that transfers hydride from NAD(P)H is a key factor influencing the value of Cf, because H is introduced stereospecifically. In ethanol production by the anaerobic fermentation of glucose with Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae, for example, the 2H of NAD2H is introduced to the re face of acetaldehyde by the NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), leading exclusively to the formation of (R)-[1-2H]ethanol (2Pionnier S. Robins R.J. Zhang B-L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2003; 51: 2076-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Ln. mesenteroides, the C2–C3 moiety of glucose is fermented in anaerobic conditions to ethanol. It is evident from the RPP pathway (Fig. 1) that both the (1S)- and (1R)-hydrogens are introduced from the NAD(P)H pool by the terminal steps of ethanol biosynthesis, the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (AlDH) and ADH. Thus, a similar situation should exist as described (5Roger O. Lavigne R. Mahmoud M. Buisson C. Onno B. Zhang B-L. Robins R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24923-24928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) for lactic acid: the Cf values for ethanol produced by Ln. mesenteroides and S. cerevisiae should differ. However, the situation in Ln. mesenteroides is more complex than in S. cerevisiae. First, Ln. mesenteroides contains two ADHs, one NADH-dependent, the other NADPH-dependent (6DeMoss R. J. Bacteriol. 1954; 68: 252-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the stereochemistry varies for different ADH activities, the Cf values could be strongly influenced by the stereochemistry of these two ADHs. For example, the broad specificity NADPH-dependent secondary ADH of Leuconostoc kefir has been shown to introduce H to the si face of higher aldehydes or ketones, leading to the formation of the R-isomer (7Bradshaw C.W. Hummel W. Wong C-H. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 1532-1536Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), whereas the ADH from Aeropyrum pernix is NADH-dependent and produces (S)-alcohols from the corresponding ketones (8Hirakawa H. Kamiya N. Kawarabayashi Y. Nagamune T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2004; 97: 202-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As far as we are aware, the stereospecificities of the Ln. mesenteroides ADHs have not been defined. Second, one hydrogen is introduced by an AlDH and the final prochirality of this hydrogen will depend on the stereospecificity of the subsequent ADH. A further complication is that, whereas in S. cerevisiae only the NAD+/NADH pool is involved in ethanol biosynthesis, in Ln. mesenteroides both NAD+ and NADP+ participate in the hydride abstraction and hydride donor reactions. Reductant power in the form of NAD(P)H is produced by three oxidase reactions: glucose-6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PDH, EC 1.1.1.49), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PDG, EC 1.1.1.44), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating) (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) (Fig. 1). Redox balance in the NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH ratios is achieved via three terminal reductase reactions: d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-LDH, EC 1.1.1.28), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.10), and alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1 and EC 1.1.1.2). In Ln. mesenteroides, Glu-6-PDH and 6-PDG are both capable of transferring a hydrogen atom to either NAD+ or NADP+, although with different affinities for the two cofactors (9DeMoss R. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 328-334Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Crans D.C. Schelble S.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, GAPDH in Leuconostoc oenos is NAD+-specific (11Veiga-da-Cunha M. Santos H. Van Schaftingen E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the regeneration steps, both d-LDH (12Dartois V. Phalip V. Schmitt P. Diviès C. Res. Microbiol. 1995; 146: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and AlDH are NADH-dependent (13Kazahaya T. Kawai K. Yashima S. Sasaki Y. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1972; 18: 43-55Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas Ln. mesenteroides ADH uses both NADH and NADPH (6DeMoss R. J. Bacteriol. 1954; 68: 252-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the aim of describing quantitatively the origins of all the non-exchangeable hydrogens in ethanol derived by glucose fermentation with Ln. mesenteroides, we have fermented glucose slightly enriched with [1-2H]-, [2-2H]-, or [3-2H]glucose and measured the isotopic incorporation into ethanol. We have observed that isotopic transfer to the pro-(1S)- and pro-(1R)-hydrogen positions of ethanol is not equivalent. To explain this observation, we have determined the stereospecificities of the NADH-dependent and NADPH-dependent ADH activities and the cofactor selectivities of the enzymes that participate in the nucleotide cofactor cycle. This article presents the isotopic transfer data and interprets this in relation to the input to and use of the NAD(P)H pools. Materials—d-Glucose was obtained from Prolabo. Specifically labeled glucose (all at 98 atom %) was obtained from the following sources: [1-2H]glucose and [6,6-2H2]glucose from Euriso-Top; [2-2H]glucose from Cambridge Isotope Labs, [3-2H]glucose from OMICRON Biochemicals Inc. Sodium [1-2H]formate was obtained from Sigma and 2H2O (99.95 atom %) from Euriso-Top. Components of the culture medium were obtained as follows: tryptone, yeast extract (autolytic) from Biokar; casein-meat peptone from Labogros; soya-flour peptone (prepared using papain) and sodium glycerophosphate from Merck; ascorbic acid and MgSO4 from Sigma. The same supply of each component was used for all fermentations. NAD+/Na was obtained from Roche Applied Science GmbH, NADP+/Na (97%) and glucose dehydrogenase (382 units/ml) from Sigma, and formate dehydrogenase (176 units/ml) from Fluka. Bacterial Cultures—Ln. mesenteroides mesenteroides strain 19D cit+ was obtained from the collection of the Laboratoire de Microbiologie Alimentaire Industrielle (ENITIAA, Nantes, France) and was stored at –80 °C in M17 medium (14Terzaghi B. Sandine W. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Culture Conditions for Ethanol Production—Culture was carried out as described previously (5Roger O. Lavigne R. Mahmoud M. Buisson C. Onno B. Zhang B-L. Robins R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24923-24928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and was ended when constant weight was attained (typically ∼72 h). The complete utilization of glucose was verified by 1H NMR (15Silvestre V. Goupry S. Trierweiler M. Robins R.J. Akoka S. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1862-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Supernatant was recovered by centrifugation (4250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and kept at –20 °C. To follow the isotopic relationship between each position in glucose and each position in ethanol, a trace quantity of specifically enriched glucose was added to the fermentation medium. To 30.01 g (±1 mg) of d-glucose was added 7.8 mg (±0.1 mg) of [1-2H]glucose, or 7.8 mg (±0.1 mg) [2-2H]glucose, or 8.1 mg (±0.1 mg) of [3-2H]glucose, or 7.9 mg (±0.1 mg) of [6,6-2H2]glucose. These quantities gave site-specific enrichments of ∼400 ppm, ∼3-fold natural abundance (∼150 ppm). At this level, the NMR properties of the molecule remain unaltered. The resulting enrichment was obtained by calculation and is given in Table 1. Similarly, to establish the isotopic connection with water, 10004.6 g of tap water was enriched with 2.1336 g of 2H2O (99.95 atom %), giving a fermentation medium enriched at 341.0 ppm (natural abundance = 149.1 ppm).TABLE 1(2H/1H)i of ethanol produced by fermentation with Ln. mesenteroides using labeled water or glucoseMedium, (2H/1H)mGlucoseEthanolLabeled site j(2H/1H)j of the reference(2H/1H)j of the labeled site(2H/1H)CH3(2H/1H)CH2(2H/1H)CH-R(2H/1H)CH-SppmppmaRef = commercial corn glucose, for which the (2H/1H)i values are taken from Ref. 19.ppmbThe (2H/1H)j values of the enriched glucose at site j, by calculation.ppmcMean values ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Culture Conditions for Enzyme Preparations—For the preparation of enzyme extract, static anaerobic fermentation was carried out in 500 ml of M17 medium (14Terzaghi B. Sandine W. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (pH 7.4) containing 4.5 g of glucose (25 mmol) in a 0.5-liter closed Duran bottle. Following inoculation with Ln. mesenteroides recovered from –80 °C storage, the culture was left for ∼36 h at 30 °C until the optical dispersion at 550 nm was ≈1.3. Enzyme Extracts—Bacterial cells were recovered from culture by centrifugation (4250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.1). This suspension was transferred to a 30-ml centrifuge tube and repelleted (4250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.1, 0.5 mg/ml dithiothreitol) and the cells disrupted by ultrasonication (Vibracell: 60% amplitude, 5 min, pulse sequence 5-s on/off, power ∼23 W, 4 °C). The debris was removed by centrifugation (4250 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant used without further treatment as a crude Ln. mesenteroides enzyme preparation. Protein content was determined from the OD280/OD260 ratio. Enzyme Activities—Enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically (rate of change of OD at 343 nm) at 30 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.1) with 2.5 mm MgCl2. Enzyme concentration was adjusted to give pseudo-first order kinetics over a ∼5-min initial period. Cofactors were used at saturating concentration (0.5 mm). It was confirmed that the concentrations of substrates used were saturating. These were: for Glu-6-PDH, 6 mm glucose 6-phosphate; for 6-PDG, 6 mm 6-phosphogluconate; for GAPDH, 5.9 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; for d-LDH, 1.5 mm pyruvate; for ADH, 0.28 mm acetaldehyde; for AlDH, 0.5 mm acetyl coenzyme A. All activities were correct for non-substrate blanks. Formation of [1-2H]Ethanol by NADH-dependent ADH Activity—Ln. mesenteroides crude extract was incubated under conditions in which NAD2H was constantly regenerated using the [2H]formate/formate dehydrogenase system (16Wong C-H. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 2816-2818Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In 6 replicate 2-ml Eppendorf tubes was mixed: 50 μl of NAD+ (7.8 mm, 6 mg/ml of NAD+/Na freshly prepared in H2O), 100 μl of [2H]formate (0.68 m, 47 mg/ml sodium [1-2H]formate in 0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), and 50 μl of formate dehydrogenase (17.6 units/ml in 0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). After 15 min at 30 °C, 1.0 ml of Ln. mesenteroides crude extract and 100 μl of acetaldehyde (1.78 m, 100 μl/ml H2O) were added, and the mixture was left to incubate for ∼18 h at 30 °C. One tube was used to verify that ethanol production had occurred: the other 5 were used to extract ethanol for 2H NMR analysis. Formation of [1-2H]Ethanol by NADPH-dependent ADH Activity—Ln. mesenteroides crude extract was incubated under conditions in which NADP2H was constantly regenerated using the [1-2H]glucose/glucose dehydrogenase system (17Wong C-H. Drueckhammer D.G. Sweers H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4028-4031Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In 6 replicate 2-ml Eppendorf tubes was mixed: 50 μl of NADP+ (11.2 mm, 7.7 mg/ml of NADP+/Na freshly prepared in H2O), 100 μl of [2H] glucose (0.5 m, 90 mg/ml [1-2H]glucose freshly prepared in H2O), and 20 μl of glucose dehydrogenase (3.8 units/ml in 0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). After 15 min at 30 °C, 1.0 ml of Ln. mesenteroides crude extract and 100 μl of acetaldehyde (1.78 m, 100 μl/ml H2O) were added, and the mixture was left to incubate for ∼18 h at 30 °C. One tube was used to verify that ethanol production had occurred: the other 5 were used to extract ethanol for 2H NMR analysis. Extraction of Ethanol from Fermentation Medium—The ethanol was recovered from the fermentation medium or from enzyme incubation by distillation using a Cadiac column equipped with a Teflon turning band. The water titer, as determined by Karl-Fischer titration, was ∼8%. Extraction of Ethanol from Enzyme Incubation Medium—To the ethanol produced by enzymatic reaction was added a volume of absolute ethanol of between 8 and 11 ml. The volume was estimated so as to dilute the 2H label of the ethanol produced by reaction to ∼450 ppm. Ethanol was recovered by distillation and the water content estimated as described above. The water titer, as determined by Karl-Fischer titration, was ∼5%. Quantification of Ethanol—Ethanol production was quantified by gas chromatography. For enzyme incubations, 0.4 g of NaCl and 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate were added to the incubation mixture. After vigorous agitation (3 min), the phases were separated by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 1 min) and the ethyl acetate phase recovered. Ethanol was quantified by gas chromatography on a Hewlett Packard 6380 gas chromatograph fitted with a PTA-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.5 μm) with helium as carrier gas at a constant flow (1.2 ml/min) and an injector temperature of 250 °C. Elution conditions were as follows: 35 °C for 4 min, 40 °C/min to 200 °C, and 200 °C for 1 min. Detection was by flame ionization detection at 250 °C. Under these conditions, the retention times were: ethanol at 2.99 min and acetaldehyde at 3.28 min. Calibration was with known concentrations of ethanol (15 to 190 mm) treated exactly like the samples. Esterification of Ethanol—To resolve the (1S)- and (1R)-deuterium positions of ethanol in the NMR spectrum, the ethanol was converted to ethyl mandelate, essentially as described in Ref. 18Rabiller C. Mesbahi M. Martin M. Chirality. 1990; 2: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. To an ethanol sample of 3.5–5.0 ml (56–80 mmol) was added 20 ml of dry benzene in a 50-ml round-bottomed flask. Residual water was eliminated by slow azeotropic distillation on a Dean-Stark apparatus using 3-Å molecular sieves and gentle warming. Distillation was repeated about 15 times, replacing the molecular sieves as required, until <0.2% water remained, as determined by Karl-Fischer titration. Then, 3.04 g (20 mmol) of S-(+)-mandelic acid and 50 μl of 18 m sulfuric acid were added. The reaction mixture was gently warmed and water eliminated as described using the Dean-Stark apparatus. After about 20 cycles, heating was increased to remove the benzene by distillation and the ethyl mandelate was recovered by distillation in vacuo at 120 °C. Yield was typically 58–60%. 2H NMR Spectroscopy—The 2H NMR spectra of ethanol were recorded with a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer operating at 61.4 MHz and fitted with a 19F field frequency locking device. Acquisition parameters for ethanol from fermentations were: number of scans, 400; sweep width, 1197 Hz; acquisition time, 2.45 s; delay, 4.45 s; pulse (90°), 18.8 μs; T = 303 K; broadband 1H decoupling; 5 repetitions. Acquisition parameters for ethanol from enzyme incubations were: number of scans, 200; sweep width, 1197 Hz; acquisition time, 6.8 s; delay, 0.2 s; pulse (90°), 19.5 μs; T = 303 K; broadband 1H decoupling; 10 repetitions. The 2H NMR spectra of ethyl mandelate were recorded with a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer operating at 76.7 MHz and fitted with a 19F field frequency locking device. Acquisition parameters were: number of scans, 5000; sweep width, 1502 Hz; acquisition time, 3.4 s; delay, 0.1 s; pulse (90°), 13 μs; T = 315 K; broadband 1H decoupling; 5 repetitions. The sample preparation for ethanol was ∼1.8 g of ethanol and 1.2 g of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylurea (internal reference) mixed in a sample vial with 100 μl of C6F6 (lock). Exact quantities were recorded. The sample was filtered and introduced into a 10-mm NMR tube fitted with an anti-vortex. Five or 10 spectra were recorded for each sample and an exponential multiplication associated with a line broadening of 2 Hz was used. The sample preparation for ethyl mandelate was ∼1.7 g of ethyl mandelate and 1.8 g of benzene mixed in a sample vial with 100 μl of C6F6 (lock). Exact quantities were recorded. The sample was filtered and introduced into a 10-mm NMR tube fitted with an anti-vortex. Five spectra were recorded for each sample and an exponential multiplication associated with a line broadening of 0.5 Hz was used. The quantitative measurement of the areas under the peaks and the calculation of the (2H/1H)i ratios were carried out as described previously (5Roger O. Lavigne R. Mahmoud M. Buisson C. Onno B. Zhang B-L. Robins R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24923-24928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The isotopic ratios (2H/1H)CH-R and (2H/1H)CH-S were obtained from Equations 2 and 3, respectively, (a2H/1H)CH-R=2×(a2H/1H)CH2×ARAR+AS(Eq. 2) (a2H/1H)CH-S=2×(a2H/1H)CH2×ASAR+AS(Eq. 3) where (2H/1H)CH2 is the area under the CH2 peak in the ethanol spectrum and AR and AS are the areas under the peaks for the CH-R and CH-S, respectively, obtained by integration of the NMR spectrum of ethyl mandelate. The enantiomeric excess was calculated from Equation 4. EE=(a2H/1H)CH-R-(a2H/1H)CH-S(a2H/1H)CH-R+(a2H/1H)CH-S(Eq. 4) Ethanol has five non-exchangeable hydrogen atoms: three in the methyl (CH3) group and two in the methylene (CH2OH) group. The former are equivalent, whereas the latter are prochiral. Thus, both (1S)-2H- and (1R)-2H-ethanol can occur naturally, making three monodeuterated isotopomers possible. To establish the isotopic Cf values between different positions of glucose and these three monodeuterated isotopomers in ethanol biosynthesized by Ln. mesenteroides, fermentation was carried out in the presence of glucose slightly deuterated at sites 1, 2, or 3. Glucose slightly bideuterated at 6R,6S (6,6 designates the average of these positions) was used to test that no ethanol was produced by glycolysis. Glucose from corn (Zea mays) was used as reference, the natural abundance (2H/1H)j having been previously determined for each hydrogen position j (19Zhang B-L. Billault I. Lo X.B. Mabon F. Remaud G. Martin M.L. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 2002; 50: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fermentation was also performed with slightly deuterated water to determine the extent to which this was a source of hydrogen in ethanol. As Equation 1 is a linear function, isotope redistribution coefficients aij can be established using only two (2H/1H)i values and their corresponding (2H/1H)j or (2H/1H)m values. Therefore, the isotopic correlation was measured at natural abundance and at ∼3-fold site-specific enrichment in glucose or water. For each fermentation, it was confirmed by HPLC and/or 1H NMR that all the glucose had been consumed. The molar ratio yield of ethanol was 0.85 in relation to glucose and 0.95 in relation to lactate, in close agreement with literature values (20Cogan T.M. Jordan K.N. J. Dairy Sci. 1994; 77: 2707-2717Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The deuterium content of ethanol isolated from fermentation with water or glucose at different slight enrichments is summarized in Table 1. Deuterium Transfer from Medium Water to Ethanol—The data in Table 1 show that 2H is incorporated from water into both the CH2OH and CH3 positions of ethanol. It is also clear that incorporation occurs in both hydrogen positions of the CH2OH. Equations 5, 6, 7, 8 are the solutions to Equation 1 for the fermentation of natural abundance glucose in the presence of slightly deuterated water, showing the aim for each potential isotopomer. (a2H/1H)CH3=0.28(a2H/1H)m+53.2(Eq. 5) (a2H/1H)CH2=0.26(a2H/1H)m+109.1(Eq. 6) (a2H/1H)CH-R=0.22(a2H/1H)m+128.8(Eq. 7) (a2H/1H)CH-S=0.29(a2H/1H)m+89.8(Eq. 8) These coefficients indicate the magnitude of isotope redistribution between medium water and position i of ethanol, whereas the residue shows the extent to which 2H in position i of the ethanol is derived from other sources (principally the different positions of glucose).
