https://openalex.org/W2146092834,"The enzyme α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT or GGTA1) synthesizes α1,3-galactose (α1,3Gal) epitopes (Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAc-R), which are the major xenoantigens causing hyperacute rejection in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Complete removal of α1,3Gal from pig organs is the critical step toward the success of xenotransplantation. We reported earlier the targeted disruption of one allele of the α1,3GT gene in cloned pigs. A selection procedure based on a bacterial toxin was used to select for cells in which the second allele of the gene was knocked out. Sequencing analysis demonstrated that knockout of the second allele of the α1,3GT gene was caused by a T-to-G single point mutation at the second base of exon 9, which resulted in inactivation of the α1,3GT protein. Four healthy α1,3GT double-knockout female piglets were produced by three consecutive rounds of cloning. The piglets carrying a point mutation in the α1,3GT gene hold significant value, as they would allow production of α1,3Gal-deficient pigs free of antibiotic-resistance genes and thus have the potential to make a safer product for human use."

The obtained MEM electron density revealed that van der Waals dimers of physisorbed O2 locate in the middle of nanochannels and form a one-dimensional ladder structure aligned to the host channel structure. The observed O-O stretching Raman band and magnetic susceptibilities are characteristic of the confined O2 molecules in one-dimensional nanochannels of CPL-1 (coordination polymer 1 with pillared layer structure)."
https://openalex.org/W2099317703,"There is currently limited data available pertaining to the global characterization of the cell surface proteome. We have implemented a strategy for the comprehensive profiling and identification of surface membrane proteins. This strategy has been applied to cancer cells, including the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma, the LoVo colon adenocarcinoma, and the Sup-B15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B cell) cell lines and ovarian tumor cells. Surface membrane proteins of viable, intact cells were subjected to biotinylation then affinity-captured and purified on monomeric avidin columns. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the monomeric avidin columns as intact proteins and were subsequently separated by two-dimensional PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by hybridization with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Highly reproducible, but distinct, two-dimensional patterns consisting of several hundred biotinylated proteins were obtained for the different cell populations analyzed. Identification of a subset of biotinylated proteins among the different cell populations analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and tandem mass spectrometry uncovered proteins with a restricted expression pattern in some cell line(s), such as CD87 and the activin receptor type IIB. We also identified more widely expressed proteins, such as CD98, and a sushi repeat-containing protein, a member of the selectin family. Remarkably, a set of proteins identified as chaperone proteins were found to be highly abundant on the cell surface, including GRP78, GRP75, HSP70, HSP60, HSP54, HSP27, and protein disulfide isomerase. Comprehensive profiling of the cell surface proteome provides an effective approach for the identification of commonly occurring proteins as well as proteins with restricted expression patterns in this compartment.

Comprehensive profiling of proteins expressed on the cell surface could provide a better understanding of the manner in which the cell surface proteome is regulated and how it responds to a variety of intracellular and extracellular signals. This compartment is also rich in therapeutic targets. For example, the discoveries that the gene for a growth factor receptor (HER2) is amplified in breast tumors and its protein product is overexpressed at the cell surface have led to an effective form of therapy for breast cancer utilizing an antibody that targets HER2 (1Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Eng. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9491) Google Scholar). Also, elucidation of the role of growth factor receptors expressed on the cell surface in signaling and in uncontrolled cell proliferation, as in the case of epidermal growth factor receptor, has led to the development of new anticancer therapies that target specific components of the epidermal growth factor receptor signal transduction pathway. Selective compounds have been developed that target the extracellular ligand binding region of epidermal growth factor receptor (2Raymond E. Faivre S. Armand J.P. Drugs. 2000; 60 Suppl. 1: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of an effective strategy for the comprehensive analysis of surface membrane proteins would have important implications. In cancer, cell surface proteins that are restricted in their expression to specific cancer(s) or that undergo restricted modifications could be utilized for antibody-based therapy, as in the case of HER2 or for vaccine development or other forms of immunotherapy. Signaling pathways regulated by surface membrane proteins or receptors could also be targeted for a drug-based therapy. There is currently a paucity of data pertaining to the comprehensive analysis of surface membrane proteins due, in part, to a lack of effective strategies to profile the proteome of surface membranes. Problems associated with the profiling of this compartment stem from the limited abundance of surface membrane proteins and the difficulty in resolving and identifying them. Protein tagging technologies have been available for a long time and have been utilized in a variety of applications, yet surprisingly, very few studies have attempted to incorporate protein tagging as part of strategies to enhance sensitivity of procedures for quantitative protein analysis, such as two-dimensional gels. For example, protein radio-iodination has been utilized for many years in different types of protein studies, yet few publications have emerged that were based on the analysis of radioiodinated proteins in complex mixtures, when compared with the vast literature that exists for protein analysis and detection by silver staining. Novel approaches to improve the detection of proteins by post-harvest alkylation and subsequent radioactive labeling with either [3H]iodoacetamide or 125I have been described and are promising (3Vuong G.L. et al.Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The high affinity and specificity of avidin-biotin interactions have been exploited for diverse applications in immunology, histochemistry,in situ hybridization, affinity chromatography, and many other areas (4Wilbur D.S.

Biotinylation reagents provide the “tag” that transforms poorly detectable molecules into probes, which can be recognized by a labeled detection reagent. Once tagged with biotin, a molecule of interest such as an antibody or receptor ligand can be used to probe cells, tissues, or proteins immobilized on blots or arrays. The tagged molecule is detected with a labeled avidin conjugate. Although the binding of biotin to native avidin or streptavidin is essentially irreversible, modified avidins can bind biotinylated probes reversibly, making them valuable reagents for isolation and purification of biotinylated molecules from complex mixtures. We have implemented a biotinylation-based strategy for targeting surface membrane-derived proteins, to allow capture of these proteins, thereby providing substantial enrichment, and increased sensitivity through the use of avidin labels for detection. There have been prior studies that have combined protein biotinylation with two-dimensional gels (9Hewett P.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In these studies, protein identification was largely based on the use of antibodies to specific proteins. However, very recently, a global surface protein biotinylation strategy, coupled with the use of mass spectrometry, was applied to Helicobacter pylori, leading to the identification of 18 proteins (10Sabarth N.

We here report on the global profiling of proteins on the surface of a variety of cancer cell types, which has uncovered an abundance of proteins with chaperone function. All cell culture reagents, including RPMI 1640 (containing l-glutamine) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM,1 containingl-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and pyridoxine hydrochloride), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (d-PBS), fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Streptavidin R-phycoerythrin, Alexa 488 highly cross-adsorbed goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa 488 donkey anti-goat IgG were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Immobilon-P PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Acrylamide used in the one-dimensional electrophoresis, urea, ammonium persulfate, and piperazine diacrylamide were all purchased from Bio-Rad (Rockville Centre, NY). Acrylamide used in the two-dimensional electrophoresis was purchased from Serva (Crescent Chemical, Hauppauge, NY), and carrier ampholytes (both pH 4–8 and pH 3.5–10) and Nonidet P-40 were purchased from Gallard/Schlessinger (Carle Place, NY). All other reagents and chemicals were obtained from either Fisher or Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Established human cancer cell lines cultured as adherent monolayers (SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells, and LoVo colon adenocarcinoma cells) were propagated at 37 °C in a 6% CO2-humidified incubator in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were passaged weekly upon reaching confluence. The non-adherent (Sup-B15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia-B cell) human Leukemia cell line was grown at 37 °C in a 6% CO2-humidified incubator in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were passaged weekly. Freshly isolated ovarian tumor cells were obtained from ascites fluid by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min at room temp), followed by washing with DMEM (without added serum or protein), then purified on a 3-ml layer of Ficoll-Paque (400 × g for 40 min at 20 °C). The tumor cell-containing band was harvested from the Ficoll-Paque and washed three times in d-PBS (without added serum or protein). Adherent monolayers of cultured cells (SH-SY5Y, A549, and LoVo) grown in 75-cm2tissue culture dishes were washed three times with d-PBS (without added serum or protein). 10 ml of DMEM (without added serum or protein) containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Following biotinylation, the cells were washed in PBS and harvested by scraping the cell monolayers in PBS containing 2% Nonidet P-40. The cells were further disrupted by brief sonication. Sup-B15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia-B cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min at room temp) and washed three times with RPMI 1640 (without added serum or protein). Sup-B15 cells and ovarian tumor cells were suspended at 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 and DMEM, respectively (without added serum or protein), containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by addition of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Following biotinylation, the cells were washed in PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and solubilized in PBS containing 2% Nonidet P-40. The cells were further disrupted by brief sonication. Solubilized biotinylated membrane proteins from the various cell populations were purified on ImmunoPure immobilized monomeric avidin columns (Pierce), with modifications of the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2.5-ml columns of immobilized monomeric avidin were prepared and extensively washed with PBS. The columns were washed with 2 mmd-biotin in PBS to block any non-reversible biotin binding sites on the column. The loosely bound biotin was removed from the reversible biotin binding sites by washing with 12 ml of 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8), and the columns were then extensively washed with PBS. The disrupted cells with membrane protein biotinylation were again subjected to sonication, after which the solubilization solution was clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C). The solubilization solution was passed through the immobilized monomeric avidin columns three times, after which the column was again extensively washed with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40. The bound biotinylated proteins were eluted from the column with 5 mmd-biotin in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Fractions containing eluted protein were concentrated on Centricon YM-3 columns (Millipore). Biotinylated proteins in the tumor cells and in the cell lines were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE (11Strahler J.R. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Creighton T. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1989: 65-92Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were solubilized with lysis buffer, containing 8 m urea, 2% pH 3.5–10 carrier ampholytes, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Isoelectric focusing was carried out using either pH 4–8 carrier ampholyte-based tube gels for 13,200 V-h at room temperature or using immobilized 4–10 pH gradient (IPG)-based strips (12Hanash S.M. Strahler J.R. Neel J.V. Hailat N. Melhem R. Keim D. Zhu X.X. Wagner D. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5709-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One-dimensional gels were loaded onto a cassette containing the second-dimensional gel, after equilibration in second-dimensional sample buffer (125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). Separation in the second dimension was performed by electrophoresis in 7–14% polyacrylamide gradient SDS gels, and the samples were electrophoresed until the dye front reached the opposite end of the gel. Some gels were silver-stained and digitized for pattern analysis as previously described (13Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Chu E.H.Y. Strahler J.R. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 199-204Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For some other gels, the resolved proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane. Unstained membranes were prepared for hybridization by incubation with blocking buffer (consisting of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1.8% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h, then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated biotin-streptavidin complex (at a 1:400 dilution) for 40 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed five times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, once in TBS, briefly incubated in ECL, and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film. Patterns visualized were directly compared with comparable gel silver-stain patterns. Additional two-dimensional gels containing proteins eluted from avidin columns were silver-stained by successive incubations in 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min, 0.1% silver nitrate for 40 min, and 0.014% formaldehyde plus 2% sodium carbonate. The proteins of interest were excised from the two-dimensional gels and destained for 5 min in 15 mm potassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate as described previously (14Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Following three washes with water, the gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and dried for 30 min in a vacuum centrifuge. Digestion was performed by addition of 100 ng of trypsin (Promega) in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Following enzymatic digestion for 18 h at 37 °C, the peptides were extracted twice with 50 μl of 60% acetonitrile/1% trifluoroacetic acid. After removal of acetonitrile in a vacuum centrifuge, the peptides were concentrated by using pipette tips (C18, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Peptide mixtures were analyzed using either a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Voyager-DE mass spectrometer, operated in delayed extraction mode, or by nanoflow capillary liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI Q-TOF MS/MS) in the Q-TOF micro (MicroMass, Manchester, UK). The peptide mixtures were analyzed using a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 μl of sample:0.5 μl of matrix). Peptides were selected in the mass range of 800–4000 Da. Spectra were calibrated using calibration mixture 2 of the Sequazyme peptide mass standards kit (PerSeptive Biosystems). MALDI-TOF MS gave a peptide mass fingerprint for each spot based on the molecular mass of trypsin-digested products. We compared the resulting masses with known trypsin digest protein sequence databases (SwissProt or NCBInr) using the MS-Fit data base search engine developed by the University of California at San Francisco (available at prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml3.2/msfit.htm). ESI MS/MS tandem spectra were recorded in the automated MS to MS/MS switching mode, with anm/z-dependent set of collision offset values. Singly to triply charged ions were selected and fragmented, with argon used as the collision gas. The acquired spectra were processed and searched against a non-redundant SwissProt protein sequence data base using the ProteinLynx global server (available at www.micromass.co.uk). The cell lines and tumor cells were grown in two-well chamber slides for 48 h and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were washed briefly in d-PBS. Aldehyde groups resulting from fixation were quenched in 50 mml-lysine (in d-PBS), after which the fixed monolayers were washed three times in d-PBS (containing 1 mg/ml BSA). Each chamber was incubated with 0.5 ml of the appropriate primary antibody diluted as indicated in d-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at room temp. The cells were washed in d-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA). After which they were incubated in 0.5 ml ofd-PBS (containing 2 mg/ml BSA) containing either 10 μg/ml highly cross-adsorbed Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 20 μg/ml Alexa-488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, or 20 μg/ml highly cross-adsorbed Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The stained monolayers were washed three times in d-PBS (containing 1 mg/ml BSA) and three times in d-PBS, after which a glass coverslip was mounted on the monolayers in GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Fluorescence images were visualized through a Zeiss 510LSM Confocal Laser Scanning microscope. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), which was followed by clean-up on an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen), then the total RNA was used to generate cRNA probes. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the HuGeneFL arrays were performed as previously described (65). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (Superscript Choice System, Invitrogen) with an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added 3′ of the poly-T (Genset, La Jolla, CA). Following second-strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitrotranscription reaction supplemented with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified on RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). 15 μg of each cRNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm magnesium acetate). 15 μg of fragmented cRNA was used to prepare 300 μl of hybridization mixture (100 mm MES, 1m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) containing 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega, Madison WI), 500 μg/ml acetylated BSA (Invitrogen), and control cRNAs for comparison of hybridization efficiency between arrays. Prior to hybridization, the mixtures were heated to 94 °C for 5 min, equilibrated at 45 °C for 5 min, and then clarified by centrifugation (16,000 ×g) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of each sample (10 μg of fragmented cRNA in 200 μl of hybridization mixture) were hybridized to HuGeneFL arrays at 45 °C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm. The arrays were then washed with non-stringent wash buffer (6× SSPE) at 25 °C, followed by stringent wash buffer (100 mm MES (pH 6.7), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) at 50 °C, and stained with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. The arrays were washed again with 6× SSPE, stained with biotinylated anti-streptavidin IgG, followed by a second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and a third washing with 6× SSPE. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Data analysis was performed using GeneChip 4.0 software. The approach we have implemented for the comprehensive profiling and identification of surface membrane proteins involves the selective biotinylation of the surface proteins of intact cells. Following separation by two-dimensional PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes, the biotinylated proteins are visualized by hybridization with a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase complex. Alternatively, biotinylated proteins are captured on an affinity column, followed by their separation and identification. We have applied this approach to the analysis of surface membranes of cancer cells and compared biotinylation patterns obtained for different cell lineages. Fig. 1 displays the biotinylated proteins in whole cell lysates of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells following cell surface labeling. It is evident that the pattern of visualized biotinylated proteins (Fig. 1 B) is quite rich in separated proteins that are not visualized in silver-stained two-dimensional gels of the same whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 A). Many of the resolved biotinylated proteins form trains of spots, as expected for proteins that undergo numerous post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation). Although some proteins could be matched in their location between the silver-stained (Fig. 1 A) and biotinylated (Fig.1 B) two-dimensional patterns, most biotinylated proteins did not have a match in the silver-stained two-dimensional pattern of whole cell lysates. This strongly suggests that we were able to obtain a selective and enhanced visualization of low abundance proteins by biotinylation of the surface membrane. Because the population of surface membrane proteins that were biotinylated represented low abundance proteins at the whole cell level, it was necessary to utilize an enrichment procedure following biotinylation to allow identification of the biotinylated proteins. To this end, a column of immobilized monomeric avidin was utilized to bind biotinylated proteins, with their subsequent elution from the column in PBS containing 5 mmd-biotin, 1% Nonidet P-40. Column eluates from different cell populations were each concentrated ∼400-fold, and aliquots were resolved by either two-dimensional PAGE or IPG, followed by silver staining for some aliquots or transfer to PVDF membranes for others. PVDF membranes were hybridized with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase and visualized with the ECL reagents. Two-dimensional patterns for eluted proteins visualized by silver staining had remarkable similarity with two-dimensional patterns of proteins that were transferred to PVDF membranes, then hybridized with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase and detected with the ECL reagent, indicating that most proteins captured on the column represented biotinylated proteins. Fig. 2displays an IPG two-dimensional pattern for the A549 lung adenocarcinoma following column elution and silver staining. It shows similarity with the pattern for the same cell population obtained following a carrier ampolyte separation of a whole cell lysate of biotinylated A549 cells in the common pH separation region (Fig. 1). Moreover, patterns resolved by carrier ampolyte or IPG overlapped substantially for the same pH separation range (Figs.1 B and 2). Furthermore, Fig. 3shows that the pattern of biotinylated proteins from ovarian tumor cells that were visualized by hybridization was highly similar to the pattern obtained from silver-stained gels of the same aliquot of eluted protein.Figure 3Similarity of ovarian biotinylation patterns as visualized by hybridization and silver-stained images of the same monomeric avidin column eluate. Surface proteins of ovarian cells were biotinylated and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following solubilization, the proteins were resolved by two-dimensional PAGE using carrier ampholytes (pI 4–8) in the first dimension then visualized either by mass spectrometry-compatible silver staining or hybridization with streptavidin-HRP complex, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows point to biotinylated proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry. Interestingly, the patterns visualized by silver stain and hybridization appear to be virtually identical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We sought to identify the biotinylated proteins we considered to be abundant, based on their intensity in images of two-dimensional blots that were hybridized with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase. These proteins also occurred as relatively abundant proteins in two-dimensional silver stain patterns of proteins eluted from monomeric avidin columns. Preparative quantities of biotinylated surface membrane proteins from ∼3 × 108 cells were prepared for each of the cell lines analyzed. Following solubilization, the biotinylated proteins were captured and purified on monomeric avidin columns. The eluted proteins were resolved by two-dimensional PAGE, after which the gels were stained with a mass spectrometry-compatible silver stain. One unstained gel from each preparation of silver-stained gels for protein identification was transferred to a PVDF membrane and hybridized with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase complex to visualize the proteins that were biotinylated. In comparison to databases of proteins previously identified in our laboratory, we noted that some of the visualized biotinylated proteins actually represent proteins that were previously identified in whole cell lysates. However, considerable enrichment was evident in the biotinylated surface protein patterns (Fig. 4). We next determined whether patterns obtained from the various cell populations (e.g. A549 lung adenocarcinoma, papillary ovarian carcinoma, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, LoVo colon carcinoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia-B cell type) were sufficiently distinctive to identify surface proteins with restricted expression patterns. Although it was apparent that some proteins were expressed in all cell types, some of the visualized biotinylated proteins were detect"
https://openalex.org/W2032145856,"Eukaryotic chromosomes are anchored to a spindle apparatus during mitosis, but no such structure is known during chromosome segregation in bacteria. When sister chromosomes are segregated during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, the replication origin regions migrate to opposite poles of the cell. If and how origin regions are fastened at the poles has not been determined. Here we describe a developmental protein, RacA, that acts as a bridge between the origin region and the cell poles. We propose that RacA assembles into an adhesive patch at a centromere-like element near the origin, causing chromosomes to stick at the poles."
https://openalex.org/W2124700733,"An antibacterial peptide with 16 amino acid residues was found in plasma of the freshwater crayfish,Pacifastacus leniusculus. This peptide, designated astacidin 1, was purified by cation-exchange column chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Astacidin 1 has a broad range of antibacterial activity, and it inhibits growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The primary sequence of astacidin 1 was FKVQNQHGQVVKIFHH-COOH. The molecular mass was 1945.2 Da, and no carbohydrate-linked amino acid residues could be found by mass spectrometry. A synthetic astacidin 1 resulted in similar activity as the authentic astacidin 1 against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas it had less or no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Three amino-terminal-truncated synthetic peptides were made; they all showed low activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal part of astacidin 1 contributes to the antibacterial activity. The structure of astacidin 1 based on the CD results showed that it has a β-sheet structure in citric acid buffer at pH 4, 6, and 8. Cloning of astacidin 1 shows that it is the carboxyl-terminal part of crayfish hemocyanin and that astacidin 1 is produced by a proteolytic cleavage from hemocyanin under acidic conditions. The processing and release of astacidin 1 from hemocyanin is enhanced when crayfish are injected with lipopolysaccharide or glucan. An antibacterial peptide with 16 amino acid residues was found in plasma of the freshwater crayfish,Pacifastacus leniusculus. This peptide, designated astacidin 1, was purified by cation-exchange column chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Astacidin 1 has a broad range of antibacterial activity, and it inhibits growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The primary sequence of astacidin 1 was FKVQNQHGQVVKIFHH-COOH. The molecular mass was 1945.2 Da, and no carbohydrate-linked amino acid residues could be found by mass spectrometry.

The primary structures of antimicrobial peptides with positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids are highly diverse, yet their secondary structures share a common feature of amphipathicity, and many of these peptides are membrane-active by ion-channel formation or carpet effect (4Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Google Scholar, 5Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-88Google Scholar). Although they exhibit great structural diversity, they are often divided into four major groups according to composition and secondary structural patterns. The first group has an antiparallel β-sheet structure containing three disulfide bridges, and these defensin peptides can be divided into two subgroups according to their structure. The mammalian defensins have a triple-stranded β-sheet structure (6Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Google Scholar), whereas insect defensins form two-stranded β-sheets with a flanking α-helix (7Cornet B. Bonmatin J.M. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Ptak M. Vovelle F. Structure. 1995; 3: 435-448Google Scholar). Although all defensins contain three disulfide bonds, the mammalian and insect defensins show different three-dimensional structures. Cecropin and magainin family peptides contain linear peptides forming α-helices and are deprived of cysteine residues. This group generally has a random coil structure in aqueous solution and can penetrate bacterial membranes and disrupt the membrane structure by ion channel formation (8Christensen B. Fink J.

A third group of peptides has a loop structure containing one or more cysteine residues such as bactenecin, and the fourth group comprises peptides with an over-representation of specific amino acids, such as proline, arginine (11Agerberth B.

However, until now, no glycine-rich molecules have been reported in mammals.The Toll signaling pathway is involved in regulating dorsal-ventral polarity in developing embryos and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides in Drosophila. Antimicrobial peptides synthesized in the fat body are secreted into the hemolymph. One role of the Toll pathway inDrosophila immune response is to activate the synthesis of these peptides after fungal or Gram-positive bacterial infection (17Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Google Scholar), whereas the immune deficiency pathway is involved in producing peptides aimed at Gram-negative bacteria in Drosophila.Several antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from insects and chelicerates, and only a few peptides have been reported from crustaceans such as the shore crab Carcinus maenas (18Relf J.M. Chisholm J.R.S. Kemp G.D. Smith V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 350-357Google Scholar) and the shrimp Penaeus vanamei (19Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Dorsselaer A.V. Rodribuez J. Bachère E. J.

Here we present the isolation, biochemical characterization, and synthesis of a new antimicrobial peptide, astacidin 1, from plasma of the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus.DISCUSSIONThe cells of invertebrates and mammals produce various antimicrobial substances that act as endogenous antibiotics or disinfectants. Most antimicrobial peptides consist of fewer than 100 amino acids; these peptides are amphipathic, carry a net positive charge, and manifest a well defined α-helical or β-sheet structure in membrane-like environments. Expression of antimicrobial peptides can be constitutive, inducible, or both; several reviews of this topic have appeared in recent years (2Boman H.G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 15-25Google Scholar, 33Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 248: 1313-1318Google Scholar, 34Bulet P. Hetru C. Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Dev.

Although there are extensive studies on antimicrobial proteins as important immune molecules in various animals, a few antibacterial proteins have been characterized from crustaceans (18Relf J.M. Chisholm J.R.S. Kemp G.D. Smith V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 350-357Google Scholar, 19Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Dorsselaer A.V. Rodribuez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Google Scholar).Here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of a novel peptide with a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from the hemolymph of the freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, which we have named astacidin 1. The antibacterial molecule was purified to homogeneity and is fully characterized at the level of its primary and secondary structure by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, MALDI-TOF-MS, and CD spectrum. Astacidin 1 consists of 16 amino acid residues with no cysteine, a strong cationic property, and a β-sheet structure based on CD spectrum, which is likely to be important for its antibacterial activity. Another antibacterial peptide, thanatin from the bugPodisus maculiventris (37Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chernysh S. Briand J.P. Roussel J.P. Letellier L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1221-1225Google Scholar), shows a structure similar to that of astacidin 1. Thanatine is a 21-amino acid residue peptide containing two cysteine residues that form an internal disulfide bridge. This peptide has two β-sheet stranded sheets (five residues each), which are held together by a single disulfide bridge. Such an antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet structure is also found in brevinins from frog (38Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Barra D. Bossa J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11956-11961Google Scholar), protegrins from porcine leukocytes (39Aumelas A. Mangoni M. Roumastand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy G. Calas B. Chavenieu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 575-583Google Scholar), and tachyplesins isolated from the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (40Tamamura H. Kuroda M. Masuda M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Nakashima H. Yamamoto N. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Lancelin J.M. Kohda D. Tata S. Inagaki F. Fujii N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 209-216Google Scholar). However, there is no sequence homology between astacidin 1 and these peptides including thanatin. Three truncated synthetic peptides were made to elucidate the minimal structure required for antibacterial activity. The amino-terminal-truncated synthetic peptides had less antibacterial activity than authentic astacidin 1, which suggests that the amino-terminal amino acids are important for antibacterial activity.Many antimicrobial peptides are derived from larger precursors, and processing and generation of antibacterial peptides have been reported from several species. For example, in amphibians, buforin I from the stomach gland cells of the Asian toad Bufo bufo is generated by a pepsin-mediated processing of the cytoplasmic histone H2A (41Kim H.S. Yoon H. Minn I. Park C.B. Lee W.T. Zasloff M. Kim S.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3268-3274Google Scholar). In mice, the precursor α-defensin is cleaved by metalloproteinase, a matrilysin to produce α-defensin (42Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar), and human defensin-5 is also processed by paneth cell trypsin (43Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Google Scholar). The organization and processing of peptides from one large precursor molecule is an efficient way to synthesize different effector molecules and amplify the antibacterial response. Interestingly, astacidin 1 is released from the carboxyl-terminal part of crayfish hemocyanin by a cysteine-like proteinase and is up-regulated by injection of LPS or glucan. The LPS injection results in the generation of other proteins than astacidin 1, whereas glucan injection mainly leads to production of astacidin 1. Recently, three kinds of small antimicrobial peptides were reported from shrimp, which could also be produced from the carboxyl-terminal part of hemocyanin (44Destoumieux-Garzón D. Sulnier D. Garnier J. Jouffrey C. Bulet P. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47070-47077Google Scholar). The production of these peptides can be enhanced by exposure to LPS. The small antimicrobial peptide with a molecular mass of 2.7 kDa named PvHCt purified from Penaeus vannamei has a similar size to astacidin 1 (Fig. 3), whereas two other peptides, PsHCt 1 and PsHCt 2 purified from Penaeus stylirostris, are large (7.9 kDa and 8.3 kDa, respectively), but none of them has any homology to astacidin 1.Hemocyanin is an interesting molecule that serves as an oxygen carrier for many chelicerates and crustaceans. In a recent study, hemocyanins were suggested to have phenoloxidase activity after proteolytic cleavage at the amino-terminal part of hemocyanins in chelicerates such as the spider, Eurypelma californicum (45Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Google Scholar, 46Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Google Scholar), and the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (47Nagi T. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29264-29267Google Scholar). Several physicochemical properties of hemocyanins are very similar to those of phenoloxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) (48Decker H. Ryan M. Jaenicke E. Terwilliger N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17796-17799Google Scholar, 49Decker H. Terwilliger N. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1777-1782Google Scholar). Phenoloxidase is an efficient immune molecule for non-self recognition and is the terminal compound of the so-called prophenoloxidase activating system that is involved in immune reaction such as melanin production, cell adhesion, encapsulation, and phagocytosis as well as sclerotization of the arthropod cuticle (29Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Google Scholar). It is expressed in hemocytes without a signal peptide and synthesized as a zymogen that is activated by a proteolytic cleavage of an amino-terminal peptide. In contrast, hemocyanin is produced in hepatopancreas and then released to plasma. Evolution seems to have developed a double function of hemocyanin in the chelicerates (50Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Google Scholar). Under normal conditions the hemocyanin has a function as an oxygen carrier, but it may be converted to phenoloxidase after infection to prevent microbial invasion. The amino acid sequence of crayfish hemocyanin reveals high homology with shrimp hemocyanin and crayfish prophenoloxidase, but there is no homology in the carboxyl-terminal part (Fig. 3). Therefore, only crayfish hemocyanin, and not crayfish prophenoloxidase, can produce and release astacidin 1. In this study, we report that crustacean hemocyanin can be processed by a cysteine-like proteinase, most likely from a lysosomal organelle, to generate an antimicrobial peptide under acidic condition and that this production can be further enhanced by injecting LPS and glucan into the animal. Antimicrobial peptides have become recognized as important components of the nonspecific host defense or innate immune system in a variety of organisms ranging from plants and insects to animals, including mollusca, crustaceans, amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and humans (1Boman H.G.

Jaenicke E. Terwilliger N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17796-17799Google Scholar, 49Decker H. Terwilliger N. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1777-1782Google Scholar). Phenoloxidase is an efficient immune molecule for non-self recognition and is the terminal compound of the so-called prophenoloxidase activating system that is involved in immune reaction such as melanin production, cell adhesion, encapsulation, and phagocytosis as well as sclerotization of the arthropod cuticle (29Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Google Scholar). It is expressed in hemocytes without a signal peptide and synthesized as a zymogen that is activated by a proteolytic cleavage of an amino-terminal peptide. In contrast, hemocyanin is produced in hepatopancreas and then released to plasma. Evolution seems to have developed a double function of hemocyanin in the chelicerates (50Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Google Scholar). Under normal conditions the hemocyanin has a function as an oxygen carrier, but it may be converted to phenoloxidase after infection to prevent microbial invasion. The amino acid sequence of crayfish hemocyanin reveals high homology with shrimp hemocyanin and crayfish prophenoloxidase, but there is no homology in the carboxyl-terminal part (Fig. 3). Therefore, only crayfish hemocyanin, and not crayfish prophenoloxidase, can produce and release astacidin 1. In this study, we report that crustacean hemocyanin can be processed by a cysteine-like proteinase, most likely from a lysosomal organelle, to generate an antimicrobial peptide under acidic condition and that this production can be further enhanced by injecting LPS and glucan into the animal. The cells of invertebrates and mammals produce various antimicrobial substances that act as endogenous antibiotics or disinfectants. Most antimicrobial peptides consist of fewer than 100 amino acids; these peptides are amphipathic, carry a net positive charge, and manifest a well defined α-helical or β-sheet structure in membrane-like environments. Expression of antimicrobial peptides can be constitutive, inducible, or both; several reviews of this topic have appeared in recent years (2Boman H.G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 15-25Google Scholar, 33Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 248: 1313-1318Google Scholar, 34Bulet P. Hetru C. Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 329-344Google Scholar, 35Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Google Scholar, 36Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Google Scholar). Although there are extensive studies on antimicrobial proteins as important immune molecules in various animals, a few antibacterial proteins have been characterized from crustaceans (18Relf J.M. Chisholm J.R.S. Kemp G.D. Smith V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 350-357Google Scholar, 19Destoumieux D. Bulet P. Loew D. Dorsselaer A.V. Rodribuez J. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28398-28406Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of a novel peptide with a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from the hemolymph of the freshwater crayfish, P. leniusculus, which we have named astacidin 1. The antibacterial molecule was purified to homogeneity and is fully characterized at the level of its primary and secondary structure by a combination of reverse-phase chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, MALDI-TOF-MS, and CD spectrum. Astacidin 1 consists of 16 amino acid residues with no cysteine, a strong cationic property, and a β-sheet structure based on CD spectrum, which is likely to be important for its antibacterial activity. Another antibacterial peptide, thanatin from the bugPodisus maculiventris (37Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chernysh S. Briand J.P. Roussel J.P. Letellier L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1221-1225Google Scholar), shows a structure similar to that of astacidin 1. Thanatine is a 21-amino acid residue peptide containing two cysteine residues that form an internal disulfide bridge. This peptide has two β-sheet stranded sheets (five residues each), which are held together by a single disulfide bridge. Such an antiparallel two-stranded β-sheet structure is also found in brevinins from frog (38Simmaco M. Mignogna G. Barra D. Bossa J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11956-11961Google Scholar), protegrins from porcine leukocytes (39Aumelas A. Mangoni M. Roumastand C. Chiche L. Despaux E. Grassy G. Calas B. Chavenieu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 575-583Google Scholar), and tachyplesins isolated from the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (40Tamamura H. Kuroda M. Masuda M. Otaka A. Funakoshi S. Nakashima H. Yamamoto N. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Lancelin J.M. Kohda D. Tata S. Inagaki F. Fujii N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 209-216Google Scholar). However, there is no sequence homology between astacidin 1 and these peptides including thanatin. Three truncated synthetic peptides were made to elucidate the minimal structure required for antibacterial activity. The amino-terminal-truncated synthetic peptides had less antibacterial activity than authentic astacidin 1, which suggests that the amino-terminal amino acids are important for antibacterial activity. Many antimicrobial peptides are derived from larger precursors, and processing and generation of antibacterial peptides have been reported from several species. For example, in amphibians, buforin I from the stomach gland cells of the Asian toad Bufo bufo is generated by a pepsin-mediated processing of the cytoplasmic histone H2A (41Kim H.S. Yoon H. Minn I. Park C.B. Lee W.T. Zasloff M. Kim S.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3268-3274Google Scholar). In mice, the precursor α-defensin is cleaved by metalloproteinase, a matrilysin to produce α-defensin (42Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Google Scholar), and human defensin-5 is also processed by paneth cell trypsin (43Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Google Scholar). The organization and processing of peptides from one large precursor molecule is an efficient way to synthesize different effector molecules and amplify the antibacterial response. Interestingly, astacidin 1 is released from the carboxyl-terminal part of crayfish hemocyanin by a cysteine-like proteinase and is up-regulated by injection of LPS or glucan. The LPS injection results in the generation of other proteins than astacidin 1, whereas glucan injection mainly leads to production of astacidin 1. Recently, three kinds of small antimicrobial peptides were reported from shrimp, which could also be produced from the carboxyl-terminal part of hemocyanin (44Destoumieux-Garzón D. Sulnier D. Garnier J. Jouffrey C. Bulet P. Bachère E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47070-47077Google Scholar). The production of these peptides can be enhanced by exposure to LPS. The small antimicrobial peptide with a molecular mass of 2.7 kDa named PvHCt purified from Penaeus vannamei has a similar size to astacidin 1 (Fig. 3), whereas two other peptides, PsHCt 1 and PsHCt 2 purified from Penaeus stylirostris, are large (7.9 kDa and 8.3 kDa, respectively), but none of them has any homology to astacidin 1. Hemocyanin is an interesting molecule that serves as an oxygen carrier for many chelicerates and crustaceans. In a recent study, hemocyanins were suggested to have phenoloxidase activity after proteolytic cleavage at the amino-terminal part of hemocyanins in chelicerates such as the spider, Eurypelma californicum (45Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Google Scholar, 46Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Google Scholar), and the horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (47Nagi T.

https://openalex.org/W2171721764,"Emerin belongs to the “LEM domain” family of nuclear proteins, which contain a characteristic ∼40-residue LEM motif. The LEM domain mediates direct binding to barrier to autointegration factor (BAF), a conserved 10-kDa chromatin protein essential for embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. In mammalian cells, BAF recruits emerin to chromatin during nuclear assembly. BAF also mediates chromatin decondensation during nuclear assembly. The LEM domain and central region of emerin are essential for binding to BAF and lamin A, respectively. However, two other conserved regions of emerin lacked ascribed functions, suggesting that emerin could have additional partners. We discovered that these “unascribed” domains of emerin mediate direct binding to a transcriptional repressor, germ cell-less (GCL). GCL co-immunoprecipitates with emerin from HeLa cells. We determined the binding affinities of emerin for GCL, BAF, and lamin A and analyzed their oligomeric interactions. We showed that emerin forms stable complexes with either lamin A plus GCL or lamin A plus BAF. Importantly, BAF competed with GCL for binding to emerin in vitro, predicting that emerin can form at least two distinct types of complexes in vivo. Loss of emerin causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a tissue-specific inherited disease that affects skeletal muscles, major tendons, and the cardiac conduction system. Although GCL alone cannot explain the disease mechanism, our results strongly support gene expression models for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy by showing that emerin binds directly to a transcriptional repressor, GCL, and by suggesting that emerin-repressor complexes might be regulated by BAF.

Biochemical roles for emerin in gene expression are discussed. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy barrier to autointegration factor germ cell-less interaction zone bovine serum albumin Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)1 is characterized by progressive muscle weakening, contractures of major tendons, and defects in cardiac conduction that can be life-threatening (1Emery A.E. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 26: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). EDMD is inherited through mutations in two different genes: LMNA andSTA. LMNA encodes A-type lamins, which are developmentally regulated nuclear filament proteins, and STAencodes an integral nuclear membrane protein named emerin (2Nagano A. Koga R. Ogawa M. Kurano Y.

Nguyen T.M. Sewry C.A. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because emerin is expressed in most cells, but its loss affects only a few specific tissues, emerin was proposed to have roles in tissue-specific gene expression (7Wilson K.L.

The LEM domains of LAP2β and emerin mediate their direct binding to barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) (13Furukawa K. J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BAF is a 10-kDa, highly conserved chromatin protein essential for the viability of dividing cells (16Zheng R. Ghirlando R. Lee M.S. Mizuuchi K. Krause M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8997-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, BAF recruits emerin to chromatin during nuclear assembly (17Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this recruitment is somehow essential for localizing emerin at the reforming nuclear envelope. BAF also has important roles in higher-order chromatin structure during nuclear assembly (18Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.M. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The LEM domain of emerin is essential for binding to BAF, and the central region of emerin is essential to bind lamin A (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results, coupled with distinct binding regions for BAF and lamins on LAP2β (14Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), suggest that BAF links chromatin directly to membrane-anchored LEM proteins and indirectly to lamins. However, two conserved regions of emerin lacked any ascribed function, suggesting that emerin has additional unknown partners (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that these “unascribed” domains of emerin mediate direct binding to germ cell-less (GCL) a transcriptional repressor that is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. Niliet al. (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J. Rechavi G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3297-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that GCL binds LAP2β. GCL also binds directly to the DP3 subunit of E2F-DP heterodimers and thereby represses E2F-DP-dependent gene transcription (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J. Rechavi G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3297-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21de la Luna S. Allen K.E. Mason S.L. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 212-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Independently, E2F-DP-dependent genes are repressed by retinoblastoma protein, which binds to E2F and recruits histone-modifying complexes (22Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LAP2β can inhibit a reporter gene regulated by E2F-DP, suggesting that LAP2β itself is a repressor; furthermore, co-expression of both LAP2β and GCL repressed transcription as effectively as retinoblastoma protein (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J. Rechavi G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3297-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because GCL binds to a region in LAP2β that is conserved with emerin, we proposed and tested the hypothesis that GCL also binds emerin. We determined the binding affinities of emerin for GCL, BAF, and lamin A and studied their oligomeric interactions biochemically. Our findings support molecular models in which emerin and its partners form at least two types of complexes in vitro. Our results suggest that emerin has distinct roles in vivo, depending on whether it is complexed with BAF or a transcription factor. Human emerin (residues 1–222) was cloned into pET15 plasmid (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), and alanine substitution mutagenesis was performed as described previously (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type emerin and all mutant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3):pLysS as described previously (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induced bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and sonicated (30 s, five times each). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged (20 min, 40,000 ×g, 4 °C). The pellet was washed twice with PBS; resuspended in 8 m urea, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); and recentrifuged for 20 min at 40,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered, treated with 10 volumes of 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and recentrifuged (40,000 × g for 20 min). This supernatant was loaded on a Superdex 75 preparative gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. Emerin elutes at a position consistent with monomers (data not shown). Fractions containing emerin protein were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 35S-labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TnT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA encoding human GCL was a kind gift from Amos Simon (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J. Rechavi G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3297-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant human emerin (residues 1–222) was covalently attached to Affi-Gel-15 beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Beads were washed three times in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.5 mm EGTA) and incubated with either 35S-GCL or 35S-BAF for 2 h at 22–24 °C. Beads were washed five times with binding buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 3.5 mg nuclear extract/experiment. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were generated by standard cell fractionation techniques, as described previously (23Offterdinger M. Schofer C. Weispoltshammer K. Grunt T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Antibodies against human GCL were produced in rabbits (#4438) immunized against a GCL peptide corresponding to residues 408–420, linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Microtiter well binding assays were done essentially as described previously (24Black B.E. Levesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), with the following changes. To measure affinities accurately, the amount of emerin per microtiter well was titrated 10–20-fold: we added lamin A, GCL, or BAF at several concentrations ranging from 0.5 nmto 10 μm to microtiter wells containing either 1, 5, 10, 20, or 50 pmol of emerin. These affinity curves were confirmed by computer modeling (data not shown). When testing for GCL binding to our collection of emerin mutants, subsaturating amounts of35S-GCL (50 nm) were used, with 15–25 pmol of emerin typically present per well. Wells were not allowed to dry at any time during these assays. In all cases, bound 35S-labeled proteins were extracted with 5% SDS and counted in a scintillation counter. To detect three-way complexes, 150 nm lamin A plus 250 nm BAF, 160 nm lamin A plus 54 nmGCL, or 5 μm BAF plus 60 nm GCL was mixed and immediately added to 10 pmol of wild type emerin. BAF inhibition of GCL binding to emerin was quantitated by first mixing 60 nm35S-GCL with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant BAF (50 nm to 10 μm), prepared as described previously (18Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.M. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and immediately adding the mix to 1.5 pmol of emerin immobilized on microtiter wells. Wells were washed five times with binding buffer, eluted with SDS, and separated on SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by autoradiography. Multitissue panels I and II (Clontech) were used as templates to probe with oligonucleotide primers specific for a LAP2β-specific exon or GCL, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′ LAP2β primer was 5′-CTCAAGCTGGAATAACTGAGACTGAATGG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-GGGTCAACATGAAGAAAATTAGAGAAGG-3′. The 5′ GCL primer was 5′-CCGGGATCCGATGAATATTATTGAACTGGAGATTCC-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CCGCTCGAGGTTTTCTGGATCTTCTGGGTGGC-3′. Control primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were provided by the manufacturer. HeLa cells (109) were resuspended in sample buffer, and 106 cell equivalents were subjected to SDS-PAGE along with 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng of recombinant purified human BAF. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with an antibody against human BAF diluted 1:1000 (18Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.M. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We calculated the concentration of BAF near the inner nuclear membrane by modeling the nucleus as a sphere 5 μm in diameter and defining the interaction zone (IZ) to extend 200 nm from the inner membrane. We calculated the volume of the IZ by subtracting the volumes of two spheres, where R 1 is the radius to the inner membrane (2.5 μm), and R 2 (2.3 μm) equalsR 1 minus the interaction distance (200 nm). The volume of the IZ of the nuclear envelope was V IZ= V 1 − V 2 = 14.1 fl (10−15 liters), where V 1 = 4/3πR13 and V 2 = 4/3πR23. Because the GCL-binding region in LAP2β was conserved in emerin, we tested the hypothesis that GCL can also bind emerin. We synthesized full-length 35S-labeled human GCL and BAF and incubated each protein separately with recombinant human emerin conjugated to Affi-Gel beads. Beads conjugated with BSA served as negative controls. The emerin beads specifically bound BAF and also bound efficiently to GCL (Fig. 1 A). The equilibrium affinity of the emerin-GCL interaction was measured using a microtiter well binding assay. Recombinant soluble purified emerin (residues 1–222) was immobilized in microtiter wells, and different concentrations of soluble 35S-GCL were added to each well. In this assay, the affinity of GCL for emerin was 30 nm(range, 20–60 nm; n = 30; Fig.1 B), and the stoichiometry of interaction was ∼0.8–1 mol GCL/mol emerin (data not shown). These results demonstrated that emerin can bind a transcriptional repressor, GCL, with high affinity in vitro. GCL was previously shown to be enriched at the nuclear envelope in Drosophila and mammalian cells (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R.

Biol. 1999; 215: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine whether GCL and emerin interacted in vivo, we did co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HeLa nuclear extract was incubated with either protein A beads alone or protein A beads plus anti-emerin antibody. These beads were then washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies against GCL. GCL co-immunoprecipitated with emerin; comparatively little GCL was pulled down by the protein A beads alone (Fig. 1 C). Co-immunoprecipitation of GCL with emerin was evidently efficient because GCL was present at almost undetectable levels in the starting lysate (Fig. 1 C, load). Thus, emerin and GCL appear to interact both in vitro and in vivo. We then mapped the GCL-binding region in emerin. The microtiter well binding assay was used to test 35S-GCL binding to a collection of emerin mutants (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each containing a cluster of alanine substitutions in residues highly conserved between human LAP2β and emerin (Fig. 1 D, mutations are noted inblack). We immobilized either BSA, recombinant wild type emerin (residues 1–222), or emerin mutant proteins in microtiter wells and added 35S-GCL to the solution in these wells. After washing, the bound 35S-GCL was removed using 5% SDS and counted (Fig. 1 E, graph). To control for the amount of emerin present in each well, immobilized emerin proteins were eluted from parallel wells using 10% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an anti-emerin antibody (Fig. 1 D, top). At the concentration of35S-GCL used for these studies (50 nm), emerin was in 3–5-fold excess. Mutants 24, 112, 164, and 179 bound 68–84% as well as wild type emerin (Fig. 1 E). Mutants 34, 196, 207, and 214 had weak binding (35–45% of wild type). The weakest binding among “conserved mutations” was seen for mutants 70 and 76 (Fig.1 E). The background binding of 35S-GCL to BSA ranged from 16–23% of the wild type emerin signal, suggesting that mutants 34–76 and 196–214 were severely reduced in binding to GCL. To refine the putative GCL-binding domain of emerin, we generated 11 new emerin mutants by alanine substitutions, specifically targeting clusters of residues that are dissimilar between LAP2β and emerin (Table I; Fig. 1 D, mutations are shown in gray). We reasoned that emerin-specific residues might contribute uniquely to its affinity for GCL and that these new mutations might better define the GCL-binding domain. Indeed, several emerin-specific mutations disrupted binding quite effectively. When tested in the well binding assay, mutants 122, 133, 151, 161, 198, and 206 each bound 35S-GCL to at least 65% wild type levels (Fig. 1 F, graph). Control blots verified that similar amounts of mutant emerin protein were immobilized in each well (Fig. 1 F, top). Mutant 145 was compromised (∼50% wild type activity) but still bound detectably to 35S-GCL. Importantly, mutants 45A, 45E, 175, and 192 had very low or background levels of binding to35S-GCL (Fig. 1 F). Collectively, these results identified two regions in emerin essential for binding to GCL: (a) residues 34–83, which overlap the LEM domain, and (b) residues 175–196 and 207–217 near the transmembrane domain of emerin. These results also implicated serines at positions 175–176 and 192–196 of human emerin as potentially critical for binding GCL.Table IMutations in “emerin-specific” residuesName of mutationWild type residuesMutant45A45RRR45AAA45E45RRR45EEE133133Q133H122122TS122AA145145EE145AA151151ER151AA161161YQS161AAA175175SSL175AAA192192SSSSS192ASAAA198198SSWLTR198AAAAA206206IRPE206AAPA Open table in a new tab Most disease-causing mutations in the emerin gene cause cells to be null for emerin protein. However, there are special mutations in emerin (point mutants S54F, Q133H, P183H, P183T, and deletion Δ95–99) that cause EDMD, wherein the mutant proteins are stable and properly localized at the nuclear envelope (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Δ95–99 mutation disrupts emerin binding to lamin A in vitro but has no effect on BAF binding. Mutants S54F and P183H bind normally to both lamin A and BAFin vitro (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether any disease-causing mutations disrupted emerin binding to GCL, we used 35S-GCL to probe mutants S54F, Δ95–99, and P183H immobilized on microtiter wells. Similar amounts of emerin protein were present in each well, as determined by Western blotting of parallel microtiter wells (Fig.2 A, α-emr). GCL bound to emerin mutants S54F and P183H at levels similar to wild type (75–85% of wild type). In contrast, GCL binding to Δ95–99 was reduced to levels barely above the BSA negative control. The Δ95–99 disease mutation therefore disrupts emerin binding to two partners: (a) transcriptional regulator GCL, and (b) lamin A (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the Δ95–99 mutation causes emerin to misfold, nonspecifically disrupting its binding to both partners. However, any such misfolding must be spatially limited because the Δ95–99 mutant is soluble and can still bind BAF (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore has a properly folded LEM domain. Alternatively, GCL and lamin A might both require this region of emerin and might theoretically compete for binding to emerin. Our GCL binding results for all emerin mutants are mapped schematically in Fig. 2 B,relative to previous results for BAF and lamin A (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues required to bind GCL mapped primarily to the two “unascribed” regions of emerin that flank the lamin-binding region, with some overlap of both the BAF- and lamin A-binding domains. Thus, this transcription factor represents an important new type of binding partner for emerin. The identification of a transcription factor as a binding partner for emerin raised important questions about the relationship between GCL and emerin's other partners. To test the hypothesis that GCL, BAF, or lamin A might compete with each other for binding to emerin, we first needed to determine the equilibrium binding affinities of BAF and lamin A for emerin. BAF dimers bind emerin with a K d of 200 nm (range, 100–550 nm; n = 23; Fig. 2 C) and stoichiometry of ∼0.75–1 mol BAF dimer/mol emerin in microtiter well binding assays (Fig. 2 C; data not shown). Lamin A bound emerin with higher affinity (40 nm; range, 30–80 nm; n = 19; Fig. 2 D) and a stoichiometry of ∼0.85–1.1 mol lamin A dimer/mol emerin (Fig. 2 D; data not shown). Thus, all three partners had reasonable affinities for emerin (K d of 200, 40, and 30 nm for BAF, lamin A, and GCL, respectively). We then did competition assays to determine whether BAF competed with GCL for binding to emerin. Microtiter wells with a constant amount of immobilized emerin were incubated with buffer containing a constant amount of 35S-GCL plus increasing concentrations of BAF (Fig. 3 A). Under these conditions, BAF blocked the binding of GCL to emerin, with 50% inhibition of binding at 4.1 μm BAF (K i, Fig. 3 A). This competition depended specifically on the BAF-emerin interaction because BAF failed to compete for GCL binding to emerin LEM domain mutant m24 (Figs.1 D and 3 B) (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that BAF binding to the LEM domain of emerin displaces GCL by reducing its affinity because GCL also depends on residues at the C terminus of the LEM domain. Because the affinity of BAF for emerin (200 nm) is about 7-fold weaker than that of GCL (30 nm), it was reasonable that higher levels of BAF (4.1 μm) were required to inhibit GCL binding. To determine whether these concentrations were physiologically relevant, we did Western blots comparing HeLa cell lysates against known amounts of purified recombinant BAF and determined that HeLa cells contain ∼7 nm endogenous BAF (Fig. 3 C). However, based on the relative fluorescence intensities for BAF in cultured Xenopus cells, determined by indirect immunofluorescence (18Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.M. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we estimate that ∼30% of cellular BAF is concentrated near the nuclear inner membrane. We therefore modeled the nucleus as a sphere (diameter, 5 μm) and defined the interaction zone as extending 200 nm from the inner membrane (Fig.3 C, IZ). Based on these estimates, the concentration of BAF dimers near the nuclear envelope is ∼9 μm (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, local (molecular scale) concentrations of BAF could be even higher because BAF dimers oligomerize in the presence of DNA in vitro (16Zheng R. Ghirlando R. Lee M.S. Mizuuchi K. Krause M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8997-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunoblotting results for GCL suggested that the concentration of GCL near the nuclear envelope is lower, ∼1 μm (data not shown). Thus, the above-determined affinities of emerin for BAF and GCL are likely to be physiologically relevant and collectively predict that BAF has the potential to inhibit GCL binding to emerin at the nuclear envelope in cells. Does lamin A influence GCL binding to emerin? To answer this question, we did binding competition assays in microtiter wells, using appropriate concentrations of each protein. Emerin was immobilized in wells and incubated with buffer containing premixed 54 nm35S-GCL plus 160 nm35S-lamin A (GCL does not bind detectably to lamin A; data not shown). This concentration of lamin A ensured that over 90% of emerin molecules would be occupied by lamin A, and thus any GCL signal could be validly attributed to the formation of three-way complexes. Interestingly, lamin A and GCL did not compete for binding to emerin but instead bound efficiently and simultaneously to emerin in vitro (Fig.3 D). We concluded that emerin is capable of forming stable complexes with lamin A and GCL at the nuclear envelope, if BAF is absent or negatively regulated. This finding supported “scaffolding” models in which lamin A anchors emerin at the inner nuclear membrane yet does not interfere with emerin binding to the transcriptional repressor. Can BAF itself form stable complexes with emerin and lamin A? To answer this question, we used a relatively low concentration of lamin A (150 nm dimers) because lamin A binds weakly but directly to BAF with a K d of 1 μm (Fig.3 E). In the presence of 150 nm lamin A, only one in five BAF molecules would be prebound to lamin A (see Fig.3 E). Under these conditions, we found that BAF (at 250 nm) and lamin A (at 150 nm) bound simultaneously and quantitatively to emerin (Fig. 3 F). This work strongly supported our previous model that emerin can bind independently, through distinct domains, to both BAF and lamin A (15Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T. Hiraoka Y. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4567-4573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because GCL can interact with two different LEM proteins (emerin and LAP2β), the tissues susceptible to EDMD disease may be determined, at least in part, by the natural presence or absence of LEM domain proteins, such as LAP2β, whose functions overlap with emerin. To determine whether LAP2β or GCL was present in tissues affected by EDMD, we performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of mRNA from 16 human tissues using LAP2β- or GCL-specific primers. LAP2β expression is relatively low but detectable in heart and skeletal muscle, which are strongly affected by the loss of emerin (Fig. 3 G). The low expression of LAP2β mRNA in these tissues was consistent with previously determined low levels of LAP2β protein (26Ishijima Y. Toda T. Matsushita H. Yoshida M. Kimura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Human GCL mRNA was abundant in only one tissue examined (testis). GCL was undetectable in eight tissues (liver, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, small intestine, colon, and peripheral blood leukocytes), and low expression of GCL was detected in heart, brain, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, consistent with expression patterns seen in adult mice (27Leatherman J.L. Kaestner K.H. Jongens T.A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, GCL is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and is present (albeit at low levels) in two tissues (heart and skeletal muscle) affected in EDMD patients. Obviously, the expression pattern for GCL does not explain the tissue specificity of EDMD disease. However, as discussed below, GCL is the first of many transcription factors that may bind emerin (see “Discussion”). Thus, models based on GCL-emerin interactions may be generally applicable to the disease mechanism. Our biochemical results suggest that emerin and lamin A are stable partners at the nuclear envelope and can form stable oligomeric complexes with either BAF or GCL, but not both. Interestingly, the stability of BAF-emerin-lamin A complexes might be increased by the low but direct affinity of BAF for lamin A. Based on our estimated physiological concentrations of BAF and GCL, we propose that BAF-mediated chromatin attachment to emerin will dominate and exclude GCL in the absence of modifications or regulators that change their measured affinities. Because GCL localizes to the nuclear envelope (20Nili E. Cojocaru G.S. Kalma Y. Ginsberg D. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Berger R. Shaklai S. Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 212-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we propose that its binding is regulated by posttranslational modifications of BAF, GCL, emerin, or all three, as discussed below. Our findings have important implications for emerin function and for the disease mechanism of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. The structures of GCL and emerin (outside the LEM domain) are not yet known. However, based on our analysis of 24 mutations distributed throughout the nucleoplasmic domain of emerin, we suggest that GCL might contact two surfaces on emerin, which we broadly designate repressor binding domain (RBD)-1 (residues 34–83) and RBD-2 (residues 175–217; Fig. 3 H). Alternatively, emerin might fold to form a single repressor binding domain surface (not depicted). As modeled in Fig. 3, the binding of GCL to emerin may recruit E2F-DP heterodimer-chromatin complexes to the nuclear envelope and thereby repress transcription (Fig. 3 H, model I). Alternatively, the recruitment of GCL to emerin may cause GCL-E2F-DP3 complexes to dissociate, allowing activation of E2F-DP-dependent genes (Fig. 3 H, model II). In either case, GCL or GCL-containing complexes can be competed by BAF (Fig. 3 H, model III). Interestingly, BAF was recently shown to bind directly to tissue-specific homeodomain transcription factors and block their activity (28Wang X. Xu S. Rivolta C. Li L.Y. Peng G. Swain P.K. Sung C.

GCL appears to be concentrated at the nuclear envelope inDrosophila (25Robertson S.E. Dockendorff T.C. Leatherman J.L. Faulkner D.L. Jongens T.A. Dev.

Amariglio N. Brok-Simoni F. Simon A.J. Rechavi G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3297-3307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our biochemical analysis of recombinant proteins suggests that emerin can form stable complexes with lamin A and GCL, but only in the absence of BAF. Because many nuclear envelope proteins are differentially phosphorylated during interphase, including lamin A, LAP2β, and emerin (29Otto D.M. Bengtsson L. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Ellis J.A. Craxton M. Yates J.R. Kendrick Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 781-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that GCL binding to emerin or displacement of BAF from BAF-emerin-lamin complexes is regulated by signal transduction in vivo. This predicted interplay between GCL and BAF for binding to emerin will be interesting to explore in living cells, where binding affinities may be further influenced by chromatin. For example, the affinity of BAF for LEM proteins appears to increase in the presence of DNA (14Shumaker D.K. Lee K.K. Tanhehco Y.C. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additional studies of BAF and its regulation are clearly important to understand how BAF affects chromatin attachment to the nuclear envelope. The discovery that emerin binds the transcriptional repressor GCL strongly supports gene expression models for the EDMD disease mechanism. Further supporting this model, the disease-causing mutation Δ95–99 potently disrupted emerin binding to both GCL and lamin A. Nevertheless, the loss or disruption of GCL binding to emerin is insufficient to explain disease, for two reasons. First, LAP2β is theoretically available as backup to bind GCL in skeletal muscle and heart, although we do not know whether GCL-LAP2β-lamin B complexes are functionally equivalent to GCL-emerin-lamin A complexes. Secondly, and more importantly, we and our collaborators recently identified two other transcription factors that bind emerin. 2T. Haraguchi, J. M. Holaska, M. Yamane, T. Koujin, N. Hashiguchi, K. L. Wilson, and Y. Hiraoka.

Emerin interacts with the splicing-associated factor YT521-B: implications for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, submitted for publication. We therefore suggest that EDMD disease results from the combined loss of emerin binding to multiple transcription factors, some of which may be more “important” than others in maintaining the function of a specific tissue. Our analysis of GCL-emerin interactions, presented here, suggests an important testable paradigm for the binding of many different transcription factors to emerin-lamin complexes.

In bone, it has been postulated that type I collagen acts as a structural matrix, whereas HA nucleation is mediated by an anionic phosphoprotein (1Gorski J.P. Calcif.

The highly anionic nature of BSP and its spatio-temporal pattern of expression have led investigators to propose a role of this protein in the mineralization of bone (1Gorski J.P. Calcif.

Mammalian BSPs contain an average of 327 amino acids, which includes a 16-residue signal sequence. The protein has a molecular mass of ∼33–34 kDa. However, post-translational modifications, including both N- and O-linked glycosylation, tyrosine sulfation, and serine and threonine phosphorylation, constitute 50% of the total mature protein weight of ∼75 kDa. Analysis of the mammalian BSP cDNAs reveals a 45% level of sequence identity, plus an additional 10–23% in conservative replacements. However, identity of up to 90% is observed in and around two polyglutamic acid sequences (poly[E]); an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cell-binding motif; sites of phosphorylation, sulfation, and glycosylation; and sequences near the amino and carboxyl termini, which are rich in tyrosine residues (5Ganss B.

Normally BSP expression is limited almost exclusively to mineralized connective tissues, and its expression is localized to areas of bone formation. By in situ hybridization, it has been shown that BSP expression occurs in osteoblasts actively engaged in bone formation and is found at low or undetectable levels in other regions of mineralized tissue (6Bianco P.

Bonucci E. Fisher L.W. Gehron Robey P. Bianco P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 57: 277-284Google Scholar). Transfection of BSP into nonmineralizing MC3T3-E1 osteoblast subclones was shown to restore their ability to form mineral deposits (12Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebshach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Google Scholar). Overexpression of BSP in a genetically engineered osteosarcoma cell line, K8, also resulted in an increase in mineral formation in vitro (13Gerstenfeld L.C. Shih S. George C. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery, Rosemont, IL2000: 143-148Google Scholar). It has also been observed that transgenic mice overexpressing BSP demonstrate more rapid healing of artificially induced wound sites in bone (14Thomas H.F. Jiang H. Chen J. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78 (abstr.): 455Google Scholar). On the basis of this information, BSP is likely to be involved with early mineral deposition in bone. Using a steady-state agarose gel system, BSP was found to nucleate HA (15Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Google Scholar, 16Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Google Scholar). Synthetic homopolymers of glutamic acid have also been shown to nucleate HA, indicating that the two poly[E] regions found within BSP may play a role in this function (17Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 175-179Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion of native porcine BSP produced a series of peptides, two of which contain one of the poly[E] sequences. Each of these peptides was found to possess nucleating activity, whereas the tryptic peptides without a poly[E] sequence were unable to nucleate HA (18Goldberg H.A. Warner K.J. Stillman M.J. Hunter G.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 385-392Google Scholar). Analysis of recombinant peptides of the two nucleating domains in porcine BSP revealed that only the peptide containing the first poly[E] sequence of porcine BSP was able to nucleate HA (19Harris N.L. Rattray K.R. Tye C.E. Underhill T.M. Somerman M.J. D'Errico J.A. Chambers A.F. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Bone. 2000; 27: 795-802Google Scholar). Knowledge of the secondary structure of BSP is limited. Based on the primary sequence BSP was believed initially to maintain an open, extended structure with regions that had the ability to form both α-helical and β-sheet structure (20Shapiro H.S. Chen J. Wrana J.L. Zhang Q. Blum M. Sodek J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 431-440Google Scholar). However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have indicated a loose open structure for a 55-residue peptide containing the RGD cell attachment sequence (21Stubbs III, J.T. Mintz K.P. Eanes E.D. Torchia D.A. Fisher L.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1210-1222Google Scholar), whereas more recent studies on full-length, fully modified BSP by one-dimensional NMR also showed an unstructured, flexible conformation in solution, with no α-helical and β-sheet structure present (22Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Google Scholar). In contrast, Wuttke et al. (23Wuttke M. Muller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Google Scholar) describe BSP as a globule linked to a thread-like structure, with 5% α-helix, 32% β-sheet, 17% β-turn, and 46% random coil. They propose that the carboxyl-terminal part of BSP, which is devoid of glycans, is globular in nature, whereas the highly glycosylated amino-terminal part of the protein is thread-like (23Wuttke M. Muller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to utilize a prokaryotic full-length rat BSP expression system to further investigate the domain(s) responsible for the HA nucleating activity of BSP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the poly[E] domains of full-length BSP was performed, and the importance of charge and conformation to the nucleating activity of BSP was examined. The conformation of the wild-type and mutated proteins was studied by circular dichroism and small angle x-ray scattering. In addition, two recombinant peptides, each encompassing one of the two poly[E] domains, were expressed and tested for nucleating activity. The first 51 base pairs of rat cDNA encoding the signal sequence as well as the first amino acid (Phe) were removed and replaced by two vector derived amino acids (Met and Val). In addition, two contiguous arginine codons at positions 9 and 10, which are low usage in Escherichia coli, were silently mutated to two high usage codons using the overlapping primer extension method (24Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 167-176Google Scholar). For purification purposes, a thrombin-cleavable pentahistidine tag (Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His) was added to the carboxyl terminus of the cDNA. The resulting rBSP-His cDNA was then subcloned into the pET28a expression vector (Novagen). The amino acid sequence of the final construct is shown in Fig.1. Two partial-length BSP polypeptides, corresponding to amino acids 3–100 and 101–314 of the rBSP-pET28 construct, were cloned by the introduction of novel restriction sites into the rat BSP sequence by Overlap Extension PCR (24Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 167-176Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen). The PCR product was initially subcloned into pGEM-T plasmid (Promega) and subsequently subcloned into pET28a giving rise to pET28a-rBSP (3–100) and pET28a-rBSP (101–314). Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out using methods described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning : A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The coding sequence of all plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The poly[E] domains of rBSP were mutated by introducing restriction sites as above. The restriction sites AvaI and AatII were engineered around the first poly[E] domain (residues 62–69), and the restriction sites NarI and AccI were engineered around the second domain (residues 139–148). Six mutants were created by removing the wild-type polyglutamic acid sequence(s) withAvaI and AatII or NarI andAccI and replacing it with an oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation. rBSP-pE1A and rBSP-pE1D replaced the first poly[E] domain with either a polyalanine (poly[A]) domain or a polyaspartic acid (poly[D]) domain while maintaining a glycine residue at amino acid position 65. rBSP-pE2A and rBSP-pE2D replaced the second poly[E] domain with poly[A] or poly[D], respectively. rBSP-pE1,2A and rBSP-pE1,2D had both poly[E] domains replaced by poly[A] and poly[D], respectively, while maintaining the glycine residue at position 65. The coding sequence of all mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A diagram depicting the mutations is shown in Fig.2. Native rat bone BSP was purified from the long bones of adult rats as described previously (26Goldberg H.A. Sodek J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 211-215Google Scholar). For recombinant proteins, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmids described above and grown in PO4-buffered Super Broth (SB) supplemented with 15 μg/ml kanamycin and 0.4% glucose to an A 600of 0.6–0.9. After induction with 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cultures were grown for a further 4 h. The bacterial cells were then fractionated by sonication in denaturing binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris/HCl, 6 murea, pH 7.9). The protein extract was loaded onto Poly-prep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) packed with 1.5 ml His-bind resin (Novagen) that had previously been charged with 50 mmNiSO4. Proteins were eluted by competition with 0.5m imidazole-containing elution buffer. Nickel affinity elution fractions were then pooled, and the full-length proteins were immediately subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) purification. The two expressed and His-bond affinity-purified rBSP peptides, rBSP-(43–101) and rBSP-(134–206), were incubated with trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 in trypsin digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8) for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Mono-Q buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 7m urea, pH 7.4). The trypsin-digested peptides were then purified by FPLC. All buffers and columns used for FPLC purification followed established protocols (26Goldberg H.A. Sodek J. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 211-215Google Scholar). Proteins were purified using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Fast Q) followed by size exclusion purification with a Superdex 200PG column (1.6 × 60 cm) (AmershamBiosciences). Chromatography buffers contained either 7 murea for ion exchange purification or 4 m urea for size exclusion purification. Protein containing fractions were analyzed using 12.5% or high density gels on the Phastgel system (Amersham Biosciences) and stained with Stains-all and silver nitrate as described previously (27Goldberg H.A. Warner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 227-233Google Scholar). The corresponding Stains-all cyan-positive protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed using Spectra/Por 3 (cut-off, 12–14 kDa) dialysis membrane (Spectrum) for the full-length proteins and Spectra/Por 3 (cut-off, 3.5 kDa) dialysis membrane for the peptides. The fractions were then aliquoted and lyophilized. Proteins were analyzed for protein content and purity by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Hydroxyapatite-nucleating activity was assayed with a modification of the steady-state agarose gel system described previously (15Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Google Scholar, 16Hunter G.K. Hauschka P.V. Poole A.R. Rosenberg L.C. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 59-64Google Scholar). Steady-state buffers contained either 7.1 mm of Ca(NO3)2or 4.3 mm Na2HPO4. Proteins were studied in triplicate over a range of concentrations, with the lowest concentration of protein capable of nucleating HA used as a means to compare nucleating activity between the different proteins. Total mineral formation was determined by measuring calcium and phosphate contents within the gels after ashing and were expressed as weight of Ca + PO4 per gel. Total phosphate content was quantified using the ammonium molybdate method (28Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Google Scholar), and calcium was quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a Varian SpectAA 30/40. The experimental data were compared with the negative control (no protein added) data using one-way analysis of variance. The far-UV spectra of rBSP, rBSP-pE1,2D, rBSP-pE1,2A, rBSP-(43–101), and rBSP-(134–206) were recorded in quartz cells of 1-mm optical path length using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter between 190 and 260 nm, in 0.5-nm steps. Proteins were studied at 0.2 mg/ml concentrations in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. A base line with buffer only was recorded separately and subtracted from each spectrum. The effect of calcium on the conformation of each protein was determined by the addition of 5 and 10 mm CaCl2. CaCl2 in buffer alone did not give measurable spectra within the 190–260 nm range. All spectra were recorded at room temperature. The molar ellipticity (θ) expressed in degrees cm2 dmol−1 was calculated on the basis of mean residue molecular mass. Estimates of protein secondary structure from the CD data were made using the Dicroprot package (29Deléage G.G.C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199Google Scholar), which incorporates the Contin (30Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar), K2D (31Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Google Scholar, 32Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Google Scholar), VARSLC (33Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Google Scholar) methods, as well as a calculation from [Φ]220 nm and a simple least squares method based on the Gauss-Jordan elimination. All measurements were made at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Outstation at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany), beamline X33, at 15 °C using radiation with a wavelength of 0.15 nm and a path length of 1 mm. A sample detector distance of 3 m (low angle) was used to cover the range of momentum transfer (S)2 sin θ/λ, where 2 θ is the scattering angle) from 0.003 to 0.085 Å-1. Fifteen successive 1-min exposures were recorded for each sample. Each protein sample was preceded and followed by recording of the buffer alone to ensure the cleanliness of the cell between readings of protein solutions. Averaging of frames, corrections for detector response and beam intensity, and buffer subtraction were done using the programs SAPOKO 2D. I. Svergun and M. H. J. Koch, unpublished observations. and OTOKO (36Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J. McLaughlin S. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1986; 249: 399-407Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Samples were run in the presence and absence of 5 mm CaCl2. Protein concentrations were rBSP, 4.7 mg/ml, and rBSP-pE1,2A, 7.4 mg/ml. Rat BSP was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified to an apparent 99%+ purity. The recombinant rat BSP with the thrombin cleavage site and 5×His tag was detected by electrospray mass spectrometry as a single peak at 34802 Da, corresponding to the theoretical mass of 34796 Da based on amino acid composition. SDS-PAGE showed a single band at 67 kDa. The mutant proteins and recombinant peptides were similarly assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry (data not shown). To determine whether the bacterially expressed BSP was capable of nucleating HA and to examine the involvement of post-translational modifications in HA nucleation, various concentrations of native and recombinant BSP were incorporated into steady-state agarose gels, and the lowest level of protein required to induce nucleation was determined (Fig.3). Although both native and recombinant forms of BSP were capable of nucleating HA, native BSP was found to nucleate HA at concentrations as low as 0.0025 nmol (0.087 μg/ml), whereas rBSP required 0.05–0.1 nmol (1.7–3.4 μg/ml). To examine the contribution that each domain makes to the nucleating activity of full-length rBSP, the single-domain mutants (rBSP-pE1D, rBSP-pE2D, rBSP-pE1A, and rBSP-pE2A) were tested at various concentrations to determine the minimum concentration required for HA nucleation (Table I). Each of these single domain mutants, as well as the double domain mutant rBSP-pE1,2D, was found to have nucleating activity at ∼0.1 nmol, comparable with unmutated rBSP (Table I). A decrease in activity was seen, however, with rBSP-pE1,2A, where both domains were mutated to poly[A]. rBSP-pE1,2A required 0.5 nmol of protein (Table I).Table IEffects of mutations in the polyglutamic acid regions of BSP on HA-nucleation in vitroProteinCCμg/mlnmolNative BSP0.0870.0025rBSP1.7–3.40.05–0.1rBSP-pE1A30.087rBSP-pE2A30.087rBSP-pE1,2A17.50.5rBSP-pE1D30.087rBSP-pE2D30.087rBSP-pE1,2D3.40.1The minimum concentration of protein required to nucleate HA is shown. Open table in a new tab The minimum concentration of protein required to nucleate HA is shown. To more clearly establish the nucleating activity of each poly[E] domain, two peptides were expressed, each incorporating one of the Glu-rich domains. The rBSP-(134–206) peptide was shown to have nucleating activity at a concentration of 0.25 nmol; however, the rBSP-(43–101) peptide did not promote nucleation at concentrations as high as 5 nmol (Fig. 4). This finding is consistent with our previous study on porcine BSP peptides, which showed different activities for each domain. The CD spectrum of rBSP at pH 7.4 is shown in Fig. 5 A. It has a pattern typical of an unfolded protein, as generally observed by a denatured protein in urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Because of the strong electrostatic repulsion of the high degree of negatively charged residues, 5 and 10 mm CaCl2 were added to determine whether rBSP could be transformed into a partially folded conformation (Fig. 5 A). The presence of calcium did not significantly alter the spectrum of rBSP. The two full-length, double domain mutants (rBSP-pE1,2A and rBSP-pE1,2D) were also studied by CD (Fig. 5 B). Although the rBSP and rBSP-pE1,2D spectra were different in intensity, they exhibited similar shape. The rBSP-pE1,2A, however, appears to have a different conformation; most noticeably, the minimum is shifted from ∼195 nm for rBSP and rBSP-pE1,2D to ∼204 nm for rBSP-pE1,2A. The addition of 5 and 10 mm CaCl2 did not effect the spectra of either rBSP-pE1,2A or rBSP-pE1,2D (data not shown). The CD spectra (Fig. 5 C) of the two peptides, rBSP-(43–101) and rBSP-(134–206), although differing in intensity, were similar in shape and were unchanged with the addition of 5 and 10 mmCaCl2 (data not shown). All CD spectra were analyzed for estimates of secondary structure using the Dicroprot program. Only the rBSP-pE1,2A mutant exhibited a spectrum similar enough to those found in the data bases for secondary structure estimates to be given. It is estimated that this protein exhibits 13.8% α-helix, 43.5% β-sheet, 10.8% β-turn, 8.1% poly-pro (II) helix, and 18.9% unordered structure. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) is a useful tool for investigating the conformation, shape, and dimensions of proteins in solution. The degree of unfolding of a protein is best viewed with a Kratky plot,S 2 I(S)versus (S is scattering wave vector;I(S) is scattering profile intensity), which emphasizes the high angle part of the scattering profile (37Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Google Scholar). Globular proteins scatter as S −4 at high Svalues, yielding a Kratky plot that is proportional toS −2 (38Porod G. Kolloid-Z. 1951; 124: 83Google Scholar), whereas a random coil scatters asS −1 at high angles, yielding a plot withS 1 dependence (39Kirste R.G. Oberthür R.C. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London, England1982: 387-431Google Scholar). Therefore, a Kratky plot of a native globular protein will have a characteristic maximum that is dependent on its radius of gyration (Rg), whereas unfolded and partially folded proteins give a plateau and then rise (37Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Google Scholar). Analysis of the x-ray scattering of rBSP and rBSP-pE1,2A in the form of a Kratky plot shows that neither has a well developed globular structure under any condition studied (Fig.6). The profile of the Kratky plots for both proteins at neutral pH, pH 4, and in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 (data not shown) is typical of a random coil. Studies on the structure and function of BSP have been hindered by difficulties in protein expression. Although full-length BSP has been successfully expressed eukaryotically, expression of full-length prokaryotic BSP has been problematic (40Stubbs III, J.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 393-399Google Scholar). A successful expression system for full-length prokaryotic rat BSP was established recently (41Rattray K.R. Currie D.M. Warner K.J. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Dent. Res. 2000; 79: 520Google Scholar, 42Razzouk S. Brunn J.C. Qin C. Tye C.E. Goldberg H.A. Butler W.T. Bone. 2002; 30: 40-47Google Scholar). This expression system was used to investigate the domains responsible for the nucleating activity of BSP and additionally to examine the contribution of charge and conformation to this nucleating activity. Using the bacterially expressed full-length rat rBSP, the nucleating activities of native BSP and rBSP were compared. Although the rBSP was capable of nucleating HA, it required approximately a 40-fold increase in protein concentration over native BSP. This decrease in activity is in agreement with previous studies on porcine peptides derived from both native bone extracts and prokaryotic expression, which indicated that although post-translational modifications are not necessary for nucleation, lack of these modifications does decrease the potency of the protein (19Harris N.L. Rattray K.R. Tye C.E. Underhill T.M. Somerman M.J. D'Errico J.A. Chambers A.F. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Bone. 2000; 27: 795-802Google Scholar). In this study it was shown that a native porcine BSP peptide encompassing residues 42–125 was capable of nucleating HA at concentrations as low as 0.3 nmol, whereas the recombinant form of the peptide required 1.6 nmol or higher to nucleate HA. The exact role of the post-translational modifications on BSP in HA nucleation remains unclear. Although it has been proposed that the post-translational modifications on BSP may stabilize a particular conformation for the protein, studies have shown that at least for the amino-terminal half of the eukaryotically expressed BSP, there is no defined secondary structure (22Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Google Scholar, 23Wuttke M. Muller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.G. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36839-36848Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the phosphate groups on the post-translationally modified BSP may provide a higher charge density, which allows for calcium ion accumulation at lower protein concentrations. Future studies utilizing eukaryotically expressed BSP will examine the role(s) the post-translational modifications may have in HA nucleation. Because chemical modification of the carboxylate groups has been shown to abolish the nucleation activity of BSP, and synthetic homopolymers of glutamic acid have demonstrated HA nucleating activity (17Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 175-179Google Scholar), the nucleation activity of BSP is believed to reside primarily in two poly[E] domains found in the amino-terminal half of the molecule. This belief has also been reinforced through the investigation of poly[E]-containing tryptic peptides and recombinant peptides of BSP (18Goldberg H.A. Warner K.J. Stillman M.J. Hunter G.K. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 385-392Google Scholar, 19Harris N.L. Rattray K.R. Tye C.E. Underhill T.M. Somerman M.J. D'Errico J.A. Chambers A.F. Hunter G."

The higher order chromatin structure is formed by arrangement of nucleosomes into an array. Such a higher order chromatin structure presents a barrier to cellular processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Therefore, controlling accessibility to the nucleosomal DNA provides an important regulatory point in these processes (1Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). One way to modulate nucleosomal structure is through enzymatic modification of histones by acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation. A number of transcriptional regulatory complexes have been identified that contain histone acetylation or deacetylation activities. It was previously shown that the hyperacetylated chromatin correlates with active genes whereas the repressed genes exhibit a pattern of hypoacetylation (2Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

This contention was strengthened by the discovery of the association of a number of transcriptional corepressors with histone deacetylation activity. The HDACs1 identified in mammalian cells can be divided into three classes. Homologs of the yeast protein Rpd3 are members of the Class I HDACs (4Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L.

The members of this class are homologs of the yeast Sir2 protein (10Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D.

In addition, a number of groups reported the isolation and characterization of a complex termed NuRD (also NURD and NRD) that not only contains histone deacetylases 1 and 2 but also a DNA-dependent ATPase subunit (20Tong J.K.

Here, we report the isolation of a new family of HDAC1,2 complexes that also contain the FAD-binding protein BHC110 (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Unique to this family of corepressor complexes is the presence of a distinct structural DNA-binding subunit defining different HDAC1/2-containing complexes. HeLa nuclear extract was fractionated according to the protocol described above using P11. Anti-BHC110 and anti-HDAC2 antibodies (500 μg each) were cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose (1 ml, Repligen) using standard techniques for affinity purification. The P11 0.3 m KCl fraction was incubated with 1 ml of antibody-Protein A beads for 4–5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed first with 1 m KCl in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm PMSF) followed by a wash with 0.5 m KCl in buffer A with 0.5% Tween 20. The beads were then washed with 100 mm KCl in buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1.0m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. FLAG-XFIM and a selectable marker for puromycin resistance were co-transfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Transfected cells were grown in the presence of 10 μg/ml puromycin, and individual colonies were isolated and analyzed for FLAG-XFIM expression. A cell line expressing FLAG-tagged XFIM, F-XFIM, was used for the affinity purification of the XFIM-containing complex as previously described for the FLAG-BRAF35 cell line (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extract (3 g) was loaded on a 500-ml column of phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) and fractionated stepwise by the indicated KCl concentration in buffer A. The P11 0.3m KCl fraction (700 mg) was loaded on a 80-ml DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.35 mKCl in buffer A. The 0.35 m KCl elution (500 mg) was dialyzed to 10 mm KxPO4 in buffer B (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl) and loaded on a 70-ml Bio-Gel HT column (hydroxyapatite, Bio-Rad). The column was resolved by using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 50–500 mmKxPO4. A pool of fractions 28–30 was dialyzed to 700 mm NH4SO4 in Buffer HB (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and loaded on a butyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was resolved using a linear 10-column volume gradient of 700 to 0 mm NH4SO4 in Buffer HB. TFII-I-containing fractions 12–16 were dialyzed to 100 mmKCl in Buffer A and loaded on Heparine-5PW (TosoHaas). The column was resolved using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in Buffer A. TFII-I containing fractions 12–16 was fractionated on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. Superose 6 was calibrated using molecular weight standards fromAmersham Biosciences. The void was determined according to the manufacturer's guidelines (one-third of column volume or 7 ml). Fractions 16–20 and 24–28 were used for immunoaffinity purification of the TFII-I-containing complexes. Excised bands were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography (a custom New Objective 50-μm column terminating in a nanospray 15-μm tip), directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ Deca quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of: full scan MS over alternating ranges of 395–800 m/z or 800–1300m/z, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scans. These dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30%, an isolation width of 2.5 daltons, and dynamic exclusion of ions from repeat analysis. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (24Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D.

Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Anti-BHC110, anti-BHC80, and anti-BRAF35 antibodies were described previously (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Anti-HDAC2 antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-TFII-I and XFIM antibodies were developed to a peptide corresponding to the amino acids IKETDGSSQIKQEPDPTW and DPLTLPEKPLAGDLP for TFII-I and XFIM, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed with alkaline phosphatase. HDAC assays were performed as described (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). ChIPs were performed as described (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). PCR of the c-fos promoter was performed on immunoprecipitated chromatin using oligonucleotides C-FOS/A (5′-AGCAGTTCCCGTCAATCC-3′) and C-FOS/B (5′-TGAGCATTTCGCAGTTCC-3′). 293 cells were transfected with 5XGAL4UAS-Tk-luciferase reporter in the presence of effector plasmids (GAL4(BD), fusion vectors GAL4(BD)/TFII-I, GAL4(BD)/SAP30, GAL4(BD)/HP1α, and GAL(BD)-VP16). Transfection efficiencies were normalized using β-galactosidase assay. Transfections were repeated at least six times in at least two separate experiments. Cell extraction, luciferase assays, and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The small interfering RNA (RNAi) sequence targeting TFII-I (AA GUU ACU CAG CCA AGA ACG A) or the control RNAi was purchased from Dharmacon. Transfections were performed on 2 × 106 HeLa cells with a final concentration of 200 mm small interfering RNA duplex using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. After two rounds of RNAi treatment followed by 12 h of starvation in 1% serum medium, cells were subsequently stimulated with 50 nm epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma) and left for the times indicated before harvesting (see Fig.6 b). We recently reported the isolation from HeLa nuclear extract of a BRAF35-HDAC complex (BHC) containing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding subunit, BHC110 (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This complex contains subunits similar to the CoREST complex described previously (26Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Howard B.H. J. Biol.

To determine whether there are other BHC110-containing complexes in HeLa cells, we developed anti-BHC110 antibodies and affinity-purified the BHC110-containing complexes following the scheme in Fig.1. The anti-BHC110 affinity eluate was subjected to ion trap mass spectrometric sequencing. In addition to other components of the BHC complex (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G.

These results indicate that these novel subunits are associated with both HDAC2 and BHC110, although these polypeptides most likely represent multiple distinct HDAC2/BHC110-containing complexes. To test this hypothesis we embarked on isolating other BHC110-containing complexes that are distinct from the BHC complex. To isolate other BHC110-containing complexes, we developed a 293-derived cell line stably expressing a FLAG-tagged XFIM (F-XFIM). FLAG-XFIM was affinity-purified from F-XFIM nuclear extract using anti-FLAG antibodies followed by elution of bound material with FLAG peptide (Fig. 3 a). A combination of ion trap mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of TFII-I, BHC110, and HDAC1/2 polypeptides (Fig.3 a). These polypeptides were absent in affinity-purified eluate of the parent 293 cell line (Fig. 3 a). Further analysis of the XFIM complex by Superose 6 gel filtration confirmed the association of XFIM, TFII-I, BHC110, and HDAC2 as a component of a single complex of about 1 MDa, although a small percentage of HDAC2 and TFII-I eluted at a smaller molecular mass (Fig.3 c). This complex was termed the XFIM complex (Fig.3 a). Moreover the XFIM complex displayed HDAC activity toward core histones (Fig. 3 c). It is noteworthy that analysis of the XFIM protein following gel filtration by colloidal staining revealed a higher stoichiometry for XFIM (∼4 XFIMs per complex) to other subunits of the complex. Taken together, these results establish BHC110 and HDAC2 as common subunits of at least two distinct (BHC and XFIM) histone deacetylase complexes (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To determine the fraction of TFII-I that associates with BHC110 we purified TFII-I by conventional column chromatography (Fig.4 a). Analysis of TFII-I on the gel filtration, the last step of purification, revealed the predominant peak of immunoreactivity at fraction 24, whereas a small portion (5–10%) of TFII-I eluted at a larger molecular mass coincident with BHC110 and HDAC2 (Fig. 4 a). Affinity purification using anti-TFII-I antibodies revealed the association of BHC110 and HDAC2 only with the TFII-I derived from the larger molecular mass fraction (Fig. 4 a, see fractions 18–20). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation using anti-HDAC2, anti-BHC110, and anti-TFII-I antibodies demonstrated the specific association of TFII-I with HDAC2 and BHC110 (Fig. 4, b and c). These results indicate that although TFII-I is predominantly monomeric, a fraction of TFII-I is in a stable complex with BHC110 and HDAC2. Because TFII-I was reported as a transcriptional coactivator for serum response factor (SRF) at the c-fos promoter (33Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we analyzed the c-fos promoter as a target of the XFIM complex. We first confirmed the responsiveness of the c-fos promoter to inhibitors of histone deacetylation. Consistent with previous reports c-fos displayed an increased transcription level following either sodium butyrate or trichostatin A treatment (34Yang S.H. Vickers E. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 a). Importantly, ChIP experiments established the presence of the components of the XFIM complex at the c-fos promoter in its basal state (Fig.5 b). In response to mitogens and growth factors such as serum or EGF, c-fos displays classical immediate-early gene activation kinetics, where it is induced within 15 min of stimulation, followed by return to basal levels within 2 h of stimulation. Therefore, three phases of c-fos expression can be identified: an initial repressed state, an activated state, and a return to a repressed state (34Yang S.H. Vickers E. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 c). To understand the role of the XFIM complex in each phase of c-fosresponsiveness, we used ChIP to examine the c-fos promoter following EGF stimulation. Similar to results in Fig. 5 b, analysis of the promoter in the initial repressed state revealed the presence of BHC110, HDAC2, and TFII-I in addition to that of the SRF protein (Fig. 5 d). However, although the SRF levels at the promoter were enhanced 30 min following the stimulation of c-fos transcription, HDCA2 and BHC110 were no longer detectable (Fig. 5 d). BHC110 and HDAC2 were returned to the promoter as the repressed state was reestablished (Fig. 5 d, 60 and 90 min). Interestingly, TFII-I occupancy of the promoter was unchanged following EGF stimulation (Fig. 5 d). Moreover, although the histone H3 acetylation state is not affected by EGF stimulation, there is an increase in acetylated histone H4 coincident with the absence of HDAC1,2 complex 30 min following EGF stimulation. These results suggest a role for the XFIM complex as a corepressor at the c-fos promoter and are consistent with the contention that TFII-I may play a dual role in that it participates as a component of a corepression complex in the basal repressed state of the promoter, but once the gene is activated it remains bound to the promoter to form a stable complex with the activator as previously described (33Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar,34Yang S.H. Vickers E. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To directly assess the role of TFII-I in transcription, we tethered TFII-I to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and tested its activity using a promoter containing five GAL4-binding sites (Fig. 6 a). Interestingly, although GAL4-VP16 resulted in a potent activation of transcription from this promoter, GAL4-TFII-I caused a moderate (∼50%) repression of transcription (Fig. 6 a). However, the transcriptional repression by Gal4-TFII-I was smaller than that obtained with either GAL4-SAP30 or GAL4-HP1α, two previously characterized transcriptional corepressors (35Zhang Y. Sun Z.W. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 36Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results point to a role for TFII-I in transcriptional repression. To further assess the role of TFII-I in transcription of an endogenous c-fos promoter, we utilized small interfering RNA-mediated depletion (RNAi) specific for TFII-I to inhibit its synthesis. Two rounds of RNAi treatment were necessary to see a substantial (larger than 80%) decrease in TFII-I mRNA levels (Fig. 6 b). Analysis of c-fos transcription following TFII-I RNAi indicated a pronounced and specific de-repression of basal transcription in the absence of TFII-I (Fig. 6 b). Moreover, the EGF-mediated activation of c-fos promoter still persisted. It is difficult to assess the change in the -fold stimulation following TFII-I RNAi because there is no basal activity in the absence of the RNAi treatment. These results point to a role for TFII-I in the maintenance of the basal repressed state of the c-fos promoter. We identify a new family of HDAC1,2-associated complexes containing BHC110. Moreover, we define the polypeptide composition of a novel member of this family containing the candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation XFIM and the initiator-binding protein TFII-I. A unique feature of HDAC1,2/BHC110-containing complexes is the presence of specific DNA-binding subunits as a component of each individual complex. Indeed, the majority of the novel subunits identified are either known DNA-binding proteins such as BRAF35 (23Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Chenoweth J. Lane W.S. Mandel G. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 2002; 99: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and TFII-I (this work) or are proteins with a putative role in DNA binding such as ZNF261/XFIM, ZNF198/FIM, and ZNF217 (Fig. 2). The presence of specific and different DNA-binding subunits in each corepressor complex also allows for specificity in targeting each complex to a unique promoter. For example, the TFII-I-containing corepressor complex is recruited to promoters that either contain TFII-I-binding sites and/or DNA-binding proteins such as SRF, which can form a cooperative interaction with TFII-I (31Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Yang S.H. Vickers E. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, upon activation and a consequent increase in the activator concentration at the promoter, the association of TFII-I with the activator prevails over that of the corepressor leading to a function for TFII-I in the coactivation process. The DNA-binding subunit of the corepressor complexes may also increase the cooperative binding of sequence-specific repressor to their regulatory sites. Although a number of the new HDAC1,2-associated subunits such as TFII-I and BHC80 are unique to mammalian species, others are evolutionarily conserved. Among these BHC110, ZNF261/XFIM, ZNF198/FIM, and BRAF35 have close homologs in Drosophila melanogaster, indicating that similar corepressor complexes may also be involved in gene-specific repression in D. melanogaster. Finally, the close association of a number of HDAC-associated subunits with specific disease states (Fig. 2) attests to the importance of this family of corepressor complexes in human health.

https://openalex.org/W2069117573,"Inhibins are endogenous antagonists of activin signaling, long recognized as important regulators of gonadal function and pituitary FSH release. Inhibin, in concert with its co-receptor, betaglycan, can compete with activin for binding to type II activin receptors and, thus, prevent activin signaling. Because bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) also utilize type II activin receptors, we hypothesized that BMP signaling might also be sensitive to inhibin blockade. Here we show that inhibin blocks cellular responses to diverse BMP family members in a variety of BMP-responsive cell types. Inhibin abrogates BMP-induced Smad signaling and transcription responses. Inhibin competes with BMPs for type II activin receptors, and this competition is facilitated by betaglycan. Betaglycan also enables inhibin to bind to and compete with BMPs for binding to the BMP-specific type II receptor BMPRII, which does not bind inhibin in the absence of betaglycan. Betaglycan can confer inhibin responsiveness on cells that are otherwise insensitive to inhibin. These findings demonstrate that inhibin, acting through betaglycan, can function as an antagonist of BMP responses, suggesting a broader role for inhibin and betaglycan in restricting and refining a wide spectrum of transforming growth factor β superfamily signals."
https://openalex.org/W2063619106,"Chk2 is a protein kinase intermediary in DNA damage checkpoint pathways. DNA damage induces phosphorylation of Chk2 at multiple sites concomitant with activation. Chk2 phosphorylated at Thr-68 is found in nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage (1Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar). We report here that Chk2 phosphorylated at Thr-68 and Thr-26 or Ser-28 is localized to centrosomes and midbodies in the absence of DNA damage. In a search for interactions between Chk2 and proteins with similar subcellular localization patterns, we found that Chk2 coimmunoprecipitates with Polo-like kinase 1, a regulator of chromosome segregation, mitotic entry, and mitotic exit. Plk1 overexpression enhances phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68. Plk1 phosphorylates recombinant Chk2 in vitro. Indirect immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy revealed the co-localization of Chk2 and Plk1 to centrosomes in early mitosis and to the midbody in late mitosis. These findings suggest lateral communication between the DNA damage and mitotic checkpoints. Chk2 is a protein kinase intermediary in DNA damage checkpoint pathways.

Defects in these processes cause genome instability and predispose to cancer. DNA damage is induced by several mechanisms, including exposure to exogenous mutagens and endogenously produced reactive oxygen species. DNA checkpoints actuated by DNA damage or by stalled replication delay cell cycle transitions, providing time for DNA repair, and concomitantly promote DNA repair (2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar). The protein kinase Chk2 is an important intermediary of vertebrate DNA damage checkpoint signaling pathways. Chk2 is activated in response to double-strand DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation (IR)1 through a mechanism primarily involving the phosphatidylinositol (3′-) kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) (3Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar). Chk2 is also activated in response to other DNA-damaging agents, including ultraviolet (UV) light, and by interference with DNA replication, for example by treatment with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) (3Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar). Activation of Chk2 by these agents can occur independent of ATM, probably through the related PIKK ATR (3Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar, 4Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A.

A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Google Scholar). The PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of Chk2 in response to DNA damage is required for its activation. Chk2 transmits the checkpoint signal to several downstream signaling pathways leading to an arrest of the cell cycle in G1, S, or G2/M phases (reviewed in Ref. 6Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Google Scholar). Mouse Chk2 −/− ES cells are defective in maintenance of G2 arrest and stabilization of p53 for initiation of G1 arrest (7Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Google Scholar). In response to IR, Chk2 phosphorylates p53 at Ser-20 and interferes with p53 binding to MDM2, thereby contributing to p53 stabilization and G1 arrest (8Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Google Scholar,9Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Google Scholar). If DNA damage occurs in S phase, Chk2 phosphorylates Cdc25A and targets it for degradation (10Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Google Scholar). Chk2 and the protein kinase Chk1 regulate the G2/M transition through phosphorylation of their common target Cdc25C at Ser-216 (3Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar). Checkpoint-induced phosphorylation of Brca1 at Ser-988 by Chk2 also plays a role in cell survival after DNA damage (11Lee J.S. Collins K.M. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Chung J.H. Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Google Scholar). In addition to its importance in the regulation of tumor suppressor genes TP53 and BRCA1, CHK2 is apparently a tumor suppressor gene itself. CHK2 is defective in a subset of families with variant Li-Fraumeni syndrome with wild type TP53 (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J.

Chk2 plays a role in maintenance of G2 arrest after exposure to IR, with Cdc25C being a likely effector in this pathway (3Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Google Scholar,7Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Google Scholar). Since Cdc25C knockout mice have an intact G2 checkpoint arrest (21Chen M.S. Hurov J. White L.S. Woodford-Thomas T. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3853-3861Google Scholar), it is possible that there are other Chk2 downstream effectors. Genetic studies suggest that the budding yeast Chk2 homolog Rad53 prevents anaphase entry after checkpoint activation through regulation of the Polo kinase Cdc5 (22Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Google Scholar). DNA damage induces Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc5 (23Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Google Scholar). Rad53 and Cdc5 regulate mitotic exit through independent modifications of Bfa1 (24Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Google Scholar). There are three Cdc5-homologous Polo-like kinases (PLKs) in mammals: Plk1, Snk, and Fnk/Prk/Plk3. Plk1 functions in mitosis and is most likely to be the mammalian Cdc5 ortholog (reviewed in Ref. 25Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Google Scholar). Plk1 regulates many aspects of mitosis, including centrosome maturation and orientation, chromosome adhesion, mitotic entry and exit (reviewed in Ref. 26Donaldson M.M. Tavares A.A. Hagan I.M. Nigg E.A. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2357-2358Google Scholar). Also, Plk1 is a target of the DNA damage checkpoint and is inhibited in an ATM-dependent manner after DNA damage (27Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Google Scholar,28van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Google Scholar). We have examined the localization of phosphorylated and presumably active forms of Chk2. The results suggest the existence of unanticipated links between Chk2 and mitotic checkpoint regulation. ATM-deficient (GM5849C) human fibroblasts were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ. Other cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of antibiotics in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were treated with nocodazole (Sigma) (250 ng/ml) for 16 h and adriamycin (Sigma) (0.5 μm) for 1 h. Cells were irradiated in a Mark I 137Cs irradiator (Shepard). Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and were analyzed after 40 h. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Thr-68-Chk2 previously described (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) was affinity-purified by phosphopeptide affinity chromatography. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Chk2 antibody was produced by immunization with recombinant GST-Chk2 produced inEscherichia coli. Mouse anti-Plk1 mAb mixture was obtained from Zymed Laboratories; mouse anti-Chk2 mAb (clone 2CHK01) from Neomarkers; and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Thr-26/PSer-28 antibody was a generous gift of Yi Tan (Cell Signaling Technology). Mouse anti-γ-tubulin mAb (clone GTU-88) and mouse anti-FLAG affinity agarose gel were obtained from Sigma; mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (16B12) from BabCo/Covance; horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rat anti-HA mAb (3F10) and rat anti-HA mAb (3F10) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce. pcDNA-HAChk2 and pcDNA-HAChk2T68A were previously described (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar). Plk1 coding sequences from an expressed sequence tag (EST) clone (GenBankTM accession no. BE 900300, obtained from Research Genetics) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA.3–3xFLAG vector, resulting in pcDNA.3-FLAGPlk1. Plk1 deletion mutants were generated by cloning of PCR-amplified DNA fragments into the pcDNA.3–3xFLAG vector. Plk1T82A was derived from pcDNA.3-FLAGPlk1 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. pGEX2TK-GSTChk2, pGEX2TK-GSTChk2 (D368A), pGEX2TK-Chk2-(1–221), and His-FLAG-Chk2(D347A) previously described (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar) were used for protein expression in E. coli. HEK 293-T cells were washed in PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were collected and centrifuged at 13 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubating 500 μg of protein lysate with 5 μg of anti-Chk2, 1.5 μg of anti-Plk1, 3 μg of anti-HA, and 10 μl of anti-FLAG affinity agarose gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. For immunoblot (IB) analysis, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 3% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.5% Tween-20, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with either anti-phospho-Thr-68-Chk2 (1:4000), anti-phospho-Thr-26/Ser-28-Chk2 (1:2000), anti-Plk1 antibody (1:500), mouse anti-Chk2 antibody (1:200), anti-HA-HRP antibody (1:1000), or anti-FLAG-HRP antibody (1: 2000) overnight at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce)(1:10,000) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblotted proteins were detected by ECLTMchemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Cells grown on poly-d-lysine coated culture slides (BD PharMingen) were washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min in PBS containing 4 or 0.5% paraformalaldehyde (PFA), and permeabilized in Triton buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS). Fixed cells were blocked in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween, PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Immunostaining was performed using anti-PThr-68-Chk2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml), anti-Plk1 antibody (1: 100), anti-γ-tubulin antibody (1:1000), anti-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 antibody (1:300), mouse anti-Chk2 antibody (1:50), mouse anti-HA mAb (16B12) (1:300), or rat anti-HA mAb (3F10) (1:300) for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber, followed by three washes in blocking buffer. Cells were incubated with anti-mouse Rhodamine (Rd) (1:1000), anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (1:100), anti-rabbit-FITC (1:100) secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in mounting solution (Vector Laboratories). IF microscopy was performed using a Nikon Microphot-FX microscope using ×40 and ×60 Plan Apo objectives. Images were captured with a Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and processed using Adobe Photoshop. For phosphatase treatment, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 s at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS, and one with phosphatase buffer, and then incubated with 4 units/μl λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 20 min at 30 °C. After treatment, cells were washed in PBS and fixed as in the basic protocol. Anti-Plk1 antibody (1:500) was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 500 μg of protein lysate. Plk1 immunoprecipitates were incubated with 10 μg of α-casein at 30 °C for 5 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm ATP) supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol, AA0018,Amersham Biosciences). The reactions were stopped with the addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. For detection of the kinase activity of exogenous FLAG-Plk1 protein, with phosphospecific antibodies, 300 μg of protein lysate was incubated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG affinity agarose gel. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of recombinant GST-Chk2-(1–221) or His-FLAG-Chk2D347A at 30 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer with 25 μm ATP. The samples were analyzed by IB with anti-phospho-Thr-68-Chk2 antibody (1:4000). Although Chk2 is activated by DNA damage, little is known about regulation of Chk2 during the normal cell cycle. The yeast homolog of Chk2, Rad53, is required for normal delay of late-firing replication origins, and timely induction of ribonucleotide reductase for the synthesis of nucleotide precursors (30Navas T.A. Sanchez Y. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2632-2643Google Scholar, 31Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Google Scholar). This suggests that mammalian Chk2 may have important functions in normal cell cycle progression. Damage-dependent activation of Chk2 is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a cluster of SQ/TQ sites near the N terminus of Chk2 termed the SCD (32Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 33Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

These sites are consensus targets for phosphorylation by PIKKs, including the Chk2 regulators Atm and Atr. Phosphorylation of Chk2 at one or more of the SCD sites is required for Chk2 activation after DNA damage (32Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Google Scholar, 33Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Google Scholar, 34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar, 35Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936Google Scholar). Atm and Atr have different preferences for phosphorylation within the SCD in vitro (34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar). The predominant site phosphorylated in response to double-stranded breaks is Thr-68, which is required for intact responses to DNA damage (33Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Google Scholar). ATM is the major Chk2 regulator in this response, and preferentially phosphorylates Thr-68 in vitro. In response to replication block or UV exposure, this site is phosphorylated independently of ATM, probably by ATR (34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar). In order to localize forms of Chk2 phosphorylated at this site, we produced and affinity-purified a phosphospecific antibody, α-PThr-68-Chk2, raised against a phosphopeptide containing the region surrounding phospho-Thr-68. In lysates from irradiated 293T cells, but not-mock-irradiated cells, α-PThr-68-Chk2 recognized endogenous Chk2 (lower band, Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and4) and transiently expressed HA-Chk2 (upper band, Fig. 1 A, lane 2). However, this antibody did not recognize transiently expressed HA-Chk2T68A, in which the target phosphorylation site has been replaced with A (Fig. 1 A,lane 4). In addition, the α-PThr-68-Chk2 antibody recognized endogenous Chk2 as a single band that increased in intensity with escalating radiation dose, while α-Chk2 antibody detected approximately equal amounts of Chk2 protein in all samples (Fig.1 B). Recombinant Chk2 undergoes autophosphorylation at multiple sites when expressed in bacteria (29Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Google Scholar). α-PThr-68-Chk2 recognized GST-Chk2-WT, but not GST-Chk2D368A, which has a mutation that eliminates kinase catalytic activity (Fig. 1 C). DNA damage induces phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 in nuclear foci at the sites of DNA damage (1Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Google Scholar). To determine if α-PThr-68-Chk2 can detect these foci, we immunostained irradiated 293T, HT-1080 and GM5849C cells. Immunoreactive foci were formed following exposure to IR in 293T and HT-1080 cells, but not in GM5849C cells, which lack functional ATM (Fig. 1 D). IF of untreated 293 cells with α-PThr-68-Chk2 antibody produced a staining pattern characteristic of proteins associated with centrosomes (Fig.2 A). Signals generally consisted of single or paired nuclear dots in interphase cells, separated dots flanking condensed chromatin in metaphase, and single dots adjacent to chromatin in telophase (Fig. 2 A). Similar staining patterns with α-PThr-68-Chk2 were observed with three additional cell lines: WI38, HT-1080, U2OS, and GM5849C (AT cells) (data not shown). The signal is ATM-independent since it was similar in ATM-deficient GM5849C cells. Additional controls were performed to verify specificity of the antibody. IF background was low with control nonspecific IgG as primary antibody (data not shown). Competition with the oligophosphopeptide used as antigen for production of α-PThr-68-Chk2 eliminated the IF signal (Fig. 2 D). γ-tubulin nucleates microtubule assembly and is concentrated at centrosomes (36Schiebel E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 113-118Google Scholar). To confirm the localization of Chk2 to the centrosome, we performed double IF using α-PThr-68-Chk2 and αγ-tubulin antibodies in U2-OS cells (Fig. 2 B). The PThr-68-Chk2 and γ-tubulin fluorescence signals overlapped at the strong, centrosome-like foci seen with α-PThr-68-Chk2, providing direct evidence for centrosomal localization of phosphorylated Chk2 (Fig. 2, B and D). However, in contrast to PThr-68-Chk2 signals, the γ-tubulin signal was not competed with the PThr-68-containing phosphopeptide (Fig. 2 D). In order to verify that the α-PThr-68-Chk2 signal is a result of Chk2 phosphorylation, rather than high local concentration of Chk2 or other artifact, we treated permeabilized U2-OS cells with λ-phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment eliminated the PThr-68-Chk2 signal, but the γ-tubulin signal remained although slightly reduced (Fig.2 E). Incubation with buffer did not change either γ-tubulin or PThr-68-Chk2 signals (data not shown). Two additional Chk2-reactive antibodies, αChk2, which should recognize all forms of Chk2, and α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2, were tested. Anti-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 should recognize additional Chk2 regulatory sites in the SCD (34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar). Although S28 does not seem to be a good substrate for either ATM or ATR, Thr-26 is evidently a good ATR substrate in vitro (34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Google Scholar). Treatment of 293 and U2OS cells with IR, UV, or hydroxyurea (HU)-induced reactivity of exogenously expressed HA-Chk2 with α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 antibody analyzed by IB (data not shown). The antibody detects endogenous Chk2 after exposure to IR and doxorubicin, but not in untreated cells (data not shown). Finally, α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 antibody recognizes wild-type HA-Chk2 but not HA-Chk2T26A/S28A with amino acid substitutions at the immunogenic sites (data not shown). IF with α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 in U2OS cells yielded a centrosome-like pattern (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, αChk2 detected a diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic localization that overlapped with focal α-PThr-68-Chk2 fluorescence at centrosomes (Fig.3 A). In addition to centrosome-associated staining, we detected phosphorylated Chk2 with α-PThr-68-Chk2 and α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 antibodies at the midbody, the central part of the cytokinetic bridge, in telophase (Fig. 2 C). Under basal conditions, the bulk of Chk2 is not phosphorylated, and Chk2 is characterized by a diffuse nuclear IF pattern. We hypothesized that a minor subset of Chk2 is phosphorylated without induced DNA damage, and it is this subset that is associated with discrete basal localization. Fixation at reduced PFA concentrations (1 and 0.5%) and pre-extraction of cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 permitted visualization of a subpopulation of overexpressed HA-Chk2 with centrosomal staining pattern and which colocalizes with γ-tubulin (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, αHA and α-PThr-68-Chk2 signals overlapped, including at the centrosomes (Fig. 3 C). Staining for HA-Chk2 with two different αHA antibodies yielded the same localization pattern (data not shown). On the basis of localization of Chk2 and Plk1 and suggested communication between their signaling pathways (22Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J.

HA-tagged Chk2 and FLAG-tagged Plk1 coimmunoprecipitated when transiently expressed in 293T cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and6), and endogenous Chk2 and Plk1 co-immunoprecipitated from 293T cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). There was more Plk1 protein in immunoprecipitates from nocodazole-treated cells, but this may simply reflect the higher expression of Plk1 in mitotic cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 9 and 10) (reviewed in Ref.25Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Google Scholar). The Chk2/Plk1 interaction was not affected by Adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced DNA damage (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). However, Adriamycin induced the Chk2 mobility shift associated with phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 4), and inhibited in vitro Plk1 kinase activity toward α-casein (Fig. 4 B, line 10). To understand further the functional interactions between Chk2 and Plk1, we co-expressed HA-Chk2 and FLAG-Plk1 in 293T cells and analyzed the cell lysates by IB with α-PThr-68-Chk2 and α-PThr-26/PSer-28-Chk2 (Fig. 5 B). Co-expression of HA-Chk2 and FLAG-Plk1 promoted phosphorylation of least at 2 sites (Thr-26 and/or Ser-28 and Thr-68) in the SCD of HA-Chk2 (Fig.5 B). We next expressed full-length and truncated forms of FLAG-Plk1 in 293-T cells. FLAG-Plk1-(1–330), FLAG-Plk1-(1–408), and FLAG-Plk1-(1–480) have deletions in the C terminus, that enhance their kinase activity (39Mundt K.E. Golsteyn R.M. Lane H.A. Nigg E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Two other proteins, FLAG-Plk1(K82A), a kinase defective (KD) mutant and FLAG-Plk1(330-CT), with a deleted kinase domain, have no apparent kinase activity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and7) (39Mundt K.E.

Fluorescence-activated sorter analysis of 293T cells co-expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) and FLAG-Plk1 wild type, FLAG-Plk1-KD and Plk1-(330-CT), showed accumulation of 34, 37, and 56% of transfected cells in G2/M in comparison to 19% of cells expressing GFP only (data not shown). However, expression of FLAG-Plk1-(1–330), FLAG-Plk1-(1–408), and FLAG-Plk1-(1–480) had no effect on cell cycle distribution of transfected cells, consistent with previous reports (39Mundt K.E.

Expressed FLAG-Plk1 wild type, FLAG-Plk1-(1–330), FLAG-Plk1-(1–408), and FLAG-Plk1-(1–480), which have normal or enhanced kinase activity, increased phosphorylation of endogenous Chk2 at Thr-68 (Fig. 5 A, lines 2,4,5, and 6). In contrast, phosphorylation of Chk2 Thr-68 was unchanged in the cells with expressed FLAG-Plk1-KD or FLAG-Plk1-(330-CT), which have no associated kinase activity (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and7). The correlation of Thr-68 phosphorylation with the kinase activity of FLAG-Plk1 mutants, but not with G2/M cell arrest, indicates that Thr-68 phosphorylation is dependent upon FLAG-Plk1 kinase activity. Immune complexes containing FLAG-Plk1 transiently expressed in 293T cells phosphorylated recombinant His-FLAG-Chk2-KD and GST-Chk2-(1–221) in vitro(Fig. 6). This was due to Plk1 activity in the immune complexes, since FLAG-Plk1-KD was not associated with kinase activity toward recombinant Chk2 (Fig. 6). Plk1 is associated with the kinetochores of condensed chromosomes, the centrosome in prophase and metaphase, and the midbody, later in mitosis (43Arnaud L. Pines J. Nigg E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2013147282,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of interleukin (IL)-10 transcription in monocytic cells by various stimuli during inflammation and the stress reaction are not fully understood. Recently, we provided evidence that stress-induced IL-10 promoter activation in monocytic cells is mediated by catecholamines via a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway including CREB/ATF (cAMP-responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor) binding to two CRE motifs. However, the mutation of these sites diminished cAMP responsiveness by only 50%, suggesting a role for additional transcription factors and elements in the cAMP-dependent regulation of the human IL-10 promoter. Here, we analyze the functional role of one such factor, C/EBP, in two cell lines of myelomonocytic origin, THP-1 and HL-60, which are known to differ in their differentiation status and C/EBP protein content. We show that the level of basal as well as cAMP-stimulated IL-10 transcription depends on the expression of C/EBPα and β and their binding to three motifs in the promoter/enhancer region. The C/EBP5 motif, which is located between the TATA-box and the translation start point, is essential for the C/EBP-mediated constitutive and most of the cAMP-stimulated expression as its mutation nearly abolished IL-10 promoter activity. Our results suggest a dominant role of C/EBP transcription factors relative to CREB/ATF in tissue-specific and differentiation-dependent IL-10 transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2156808526,"In this report we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor signals to promote activation of the p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) in granulosa cells. Results show that the ERK kinase MEK and upstream intermediates Raf-1, Ras, Src, and L-type Ca2+ channels are already partially activated in vehicle-treated cells and that FSH does not further activate them. This tonic stimulatory pathway appears to be restrained at the level of ERK by a 100-kDa phosphotyrosine phosphatase that associates with ERK in vehicle-treated cells and promotes dephosphorylation of its regulatory Tyr residue, resulting in ERK inactivation. FSH promotes the phosphorylation of this phosphotyrosine phosphatase and its dissociation from ERK, relieving ERK from inhibition and resulting in its activation by the tonic stimulatory pathway and consequent translocation to the nucleus. Consistent with this premise, FSH-stimulated ERK activation is inhibited by the cell-permeable protein kinase A-specific inhibitor peptide Myr-PKI as well as by inhibitors of MEK, Src, a Ca2+ channel blocker, and chelation of extracellular Ca2+.

For the classic receptor tyrosine kinase-initiated pathway, growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF) induce the autophosphorylation of their receptors and create specific binding sites for Src homology 2-containing proteins such as Grb2 (1Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Grb2 complexed to Sos associates with the receptor tyrosine kinase, and Sos stimulates GDP release from Ras, leading to Ras activation. Active Ras then binds to Raf-1, leading to its activation, and Raf-1 in turn catalyzes the serine phosphorylation and activation of the MAPK/ERK kinase MEK. MEK then catalyzes the phosphorylation of ERK on regulatory Thr and Tyr residues, resulting in ERK activation. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are also well known activators of ERK; however, there are a variety of pathways by which GPCRs promote ERK activation. Often, GPCRs such as those activated by lysophosphatidic acid or angiotensin II promote the transactivation of a receptor tyrosine kinase as evidenced by its increased tyrosine phosphorylation (2Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinase transactivation directs the tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as Shc, recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex, and subsequent Ras activation. It is less clear how GPCRs promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, although Src activation downstream of the Gβγ has been implicated in some cells (3Herrlich A. Daub H.

For those GPCRs whose activated Gα subunits promote increased intracellular Ca2+ and consequent activation of Pyk and Src leading to EGF receptor (EGFR) transactivation, Src appears to catalyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor tyrosine kinase (5Andreev J. Galisteo M.L. Kranenburg O. Logan S.K. Chiu E.S. Okigaki M. Cary L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). GPCRs can also stimulate EGFR activation by stimulating the proteolytic cleavage and resulting release of the soluble EGFR ligand, heparin binding EGF (6Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The G protein-regulated second messenger cAMP has also been shown to both inhibit and activate ERKs, depending on the cell type. In cells where cAMP inhibits growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation and ERK activation, cAMP via PKA inhibits Raf-1 activity, although the relevant PKA substrate has been controversial (7Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 8Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that the elusive PKA substrate in this pathway appears to be Src (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, PKA-catalyzed Src phosphorylation directs the activation of Rap1, which binds and sequesters Raf-1, thereby preventing Ras activation of Raf-1 (9Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Conversely, in PC12 cells, where cAMP stimulates differentiation, and in HEK293 cells transfected with the β2-adrenergic receptor, cAMP via PKA promotes Rap1 phosphorylation and activation of B-Raf, leading to MEK and ERK activation (10Grewal S.S.

J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). In melanocytes, where cAMP leads to cell differentiation, cAMP independent of PKA promotes Ras and B-Raf activation, leading to ERK activation independent of Rap1 and EPAC (15Busca R. Abbe P.

Thus, depending on the cell type, cAMP appears to utilize a variety of pathways to modulate ERK activity. Ovarian granulosa cells comprise a unique cellular model in which the majority of both the differentiation and proliferation responses to the agonist follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are mediated by cAMP (16Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The FSH receptor is a seven-transmembrane GPCR coupled to adenylyl cyclase (17Sprengel R. Braun T. Nikolics K. Segaloff D.L. Seeburg P.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 4: 525-530Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and is expressed exclusively on ovarian granulosa cells in female mammals (18Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). FSH stimulates both granulosa cell proliferation as well as differentiation to a preovulatory phenotype (16Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Although the induction of cyclin D2 can be stimulated in primary granulosa cell cultures by cAMP (19Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the proliferative response to FSH is poorly understood and likely includes a paracrine component from surrounding thecal cells since rat granulosa cells do not proliferate in serum-free media in the presence of FSH alone (16Hsueh A.J.W.

Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The differentiation response is readily induced in serum-free granulosa cells by FSH and is characterized by the induction of enzymes required for estrogen and progesterone biosynthesis, the luteinizing hormone receptor, the type II regulatory (RII) β subunit of PKA (16Hsueh A.J.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that FSH-stimulated activation of the immediate early genes c-Fos and serum glucocorticoid kinase as well as inhibin-α are mediated in part via the apparently direct phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser-10 by PKA (24Salvador L.M. Park Y. Cottom J. Maizels E.T. Jones J.C.R. Schillace R.V. Carr D.W. Cheung P. Allis C.D. Jameson J.L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40146-40155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, FSH leads to ERK activation in target ovarian granulosa cells in an apparently PKA-dependent manner, based on the ability of the PKA inhibitor H89 to inhibit FSH-stimulated ERK activation (24Salvador L.M. Park Y. Cottom J. Maizels E.T. Jones J.C.R. Schillace R.V. Carr D.W. Cheung P. Allis C.D. Jameson J.L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

Recent results using a transformed granulosa cell line support a role for PKA in FSH-stimulated ERK activation (26Seger R. Hanoch T. Rosenberg R. Dantes A. Merz W.E. Strauss III, J.F. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13957-13964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PKA leads to ERK activation in granulosa cells is not known. In this investigation we sought to identify the cellular pathway by which FSH promotes ERK activation in primary granulosa cells. Results show that MEK, Raf-1, Ras, and L-type Ca2+channels are already partially activated in vehicle-treated granulosa cells. This pathway appears to be restrained at the level of ERK by a 100-kDa phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that associates with ERK in vehicle-treated cells. FSH promotes the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of this PTP and its dissociation from ERK, leading to ERK activation and translocation to the nucleus. Consistent with this premise, FSH-stimulated ERK activation is inhibited by the cell-permeable PKA-specific inhibitor peptide PKI as well as by inhibitors of MEK, Src, EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, a Ca2+ channel blocker, and chelation of extracellular Ca2+. These results suggest that FSH enhances ERK activity in immature granulosa cells by relieving an inhibition imposed by a 100-kDa PTP. Ovine FSH (oFSH-19) was kindly provided by Dr. A. F.

Blots were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4° C, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). For immunofluorescence, cells were treated as indicated, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed, blocked for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, incubated overnight at 4° C with anti-histone H3 phosphorylated on Ser-10 (1:100 dilution, monoclonal antibody from New England Biolabs/Cell Signaling) and anti-ERK phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204 (1:100 dilution, polyclonal antibody from Promega) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were washed and incubated for 1 h at 37° C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells on coverslips were washed and mounted on slides in Vectashield™ mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were analyzed by a Zeiss LFM 510 confocal microscope. Raf activity was measured by an immunocomplex kinase assay using purified His6-MEK1 as substrate (35Dent P. Chow Y.H. Wu J. Morrison D.K. Jove R. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After treatment of cells (6 × 106cells/dish) with vehicle, FSH, or EGF for 2 min, cells were lysed in buffer A (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.23 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% deoxycholate), and insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min.

The soluble extract was incubated with control GST plus glutathione-agarose, GST-tagged Raf-1 Ras BD, or Ral GDS-Rap BD glutathione-agarose conjugates for 3 h at 4 °C, and agarose pellets were collected and washed 4 times with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm PMSF), mixed with SDS sample buffer, and heat-denatured. Active Ras bound to the Ras BD on Raf and active Rap1 bound to the Rap BD on Ral GDS were detected by Ras and Rap1 immunoblots, respectively (36Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr.

For anti-ERK-agarose pull-downs from soluble ovarian extracts enriched in PTP-SL, ovaries of 13 estrogen-treated rats (see above) were homogenized with 15 strokes using a ground glass homogenizer in buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml E-64). The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 15 min, supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column, the column was extensively washed with 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and PTP-SL was batch-eluted (along with RIIβ PKA holoenzyme (38Carr D.W.

Eluate was concentrated to 1.15 ml, an aliquot was taken and mixed with SDS sample buffer and heat-denatured (designated “input”), and equal volumes of the eluate were mixed with 0.08 ml of ADP-agarose as a control or anti-ERK-agarose, respectively. After mixing overnight at 4 °C, the flow-through (designated “FT”) was collected, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and heat-denatured, the agarose pellet was washed 4 times with RIPA buffer, 2 times with high salt RIPA buffer (containing 1 m NaCl), and 2 times with RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted (designated “eluate”) with 0.25 ml of SDS sample buffer and heat-denatured. For anti-ERK-agarose pull-downs, granulosa cells were sonicated for 1 min at 4° C in buffer D, extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 0.06 ml of ADP-agarose or anti-ERK-agarose and rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. The rest of the details are as described above. To detect active, Tyr-phosphorylated EGF receptor, 10 × 106 cells/dish were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by sonicating for 1 min at 4° C in buffer E (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm leupeptin, 100 μg/ml pepstatin). The membrane pellet was collected by centrifuging lysate at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was mixed with SDS sample buffer, heat-denatured, and probed with anti-phospho-Tyr antibody. Alternatively, granulosa cell extracts prepared by sonicating cells in buffer F (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate) were subjected to immunoprecipitations with either anti-phospho-Tyr or anti-EGFR antibody; immunoprecipitates were washed with buffer G (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and, after SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, probed with anti-EGFR or anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies, respectively. For PTP-SL immunoprecipitations, cells were treated as indicated, rinsed, and lysed by sonicating for 1 min at 4° C in buffer F. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was first precleared with protein A+G-agarose and then incubated with anti-PTP-SL antibody plus protein A+G agarose for 4 h at 4° C (31Pulido R. Zúniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The agarose pellet was collected, washed with buffer G, and heat-denatured. For Ca2+ channel immunoprecipitation, 24 × 106 cells were treated as indicated, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at −70 °C. Using an antibody (anti-FP1) that recognizes the 210-kDa α subunit of class C L-type Ca2+ channel independent of its phosphorylation state, the α1C subunit was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts solubilized in buffer H (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μmmicrocystin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 nm PMSF, and 8 μg/ml each calpain inhibitors I and II). The precipitated proteins were washed and mixed with SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (39Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Blots were first probed with affinity-purified anti-CH3P antibody to detect the relative level of phosphorylation at Ser-1928 on the α1C subunit. Blots were then stripped and reprobed with anti-FP1 antibody to detect total α1Csubunit precipitated (39Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

RNA (5 μg each) was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde and electrophoresed through formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel in NorthernMax™ MOPS gel running buffer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). RNA was blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and the membrane was cross-linked and hybridized with NorthernMax™ prehybridization/ hybridization buffer using PTP-SL cDNA (3 × 106 cpm/ml) as a probe. PTP-SL cDNA (429 base pairs) corresponding to nucleotides 441–864 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Rediprime™ II DNA-labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was washed 2 times with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and subjected to autoradiography. An in-gel PTP assay in which [32P]poly(glutamic acid-tyrosine) was incorporated into the gel was performed (40Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). [32P]Poly(glutamic acid-tyrosine) (1 mg) was phosphorylated with 50 units of active Src (Upstate Biotechnology), partially purified (40Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal.

We have investigated the mechanism by which full-length hGrb10γ inhibits signaling through the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Overexpression of hGrb10γ in CHO/IR cells and in differentiated adipocytes significantly reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Inhibition occurred rapidly and was sustained for 60 min during insulin stimulation. In agreement with inhibited signaling through the IRS/PI 3-kinase pathway, we found hGrb10γ to both delay and reduce phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 in response to insulin stimulation. Decreased phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 may arise from impaired catalytic activity of the receptor, since hGrb10γ directly associates with the IR kinase regulatory loop. However, yeast tri-hybrid studies indicated that full-length Grb10 blocks association between IRS proteins and IR, and that this requires the SH2 domain of Grb10. In cells, hGrb10γ inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect IR catalytic activity toward Tyr972 in the juxtamembrane region and Tyr1158/1162/1163 in the regulatory domain. We conclude that binding of hGrb10γ to IR decreases signaling through the IRS/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway by physically blocking IRS access to IR.

Ligand binding results in the autophosphorylation of the IR on multiple tyrosine residues (1White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Kentmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Google Scholar, 2Hubbard S.R. Lei W. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, these residues serve as docking sites for specific intracellular effectors central to the transmission of the insulin signal. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family (IRS-1 through IRS-4) is one such group of proteins that recognizes the phosphorylated IR via their phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB) (3Wolf G. Trub T.

The IRS-PTB domain associates with the NPXY motif surrounding tyrosine 972 in the juxtamembrane region of the IR, which promotes the IR-IRS interaction (5Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Google Scholar). Once in contact with the receptor, IRS is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues by the IR tyrosine kinase. Numerous adaptor proteins and enzymes then associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and convey the insulin signal downstream (6Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.

The insulin receptor-binding protein Grb10 is of considerable interest due to its potential to positively or negatively affect receptor-tyrosine kinase signaling. Grb10 is a member of a superfamily of adaptor proteins, which includes Grb7 and Grb14. This family of proteins shares several structural features, including a SH2 and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (8Liu F. Roth R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 73-78Google Scholar). The C-terminal SH2 domain has been shown to associate with the IR (9He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Google Scholar, 10Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1757-1765Google Scholar), and mutation of a critical arginine residue in this region of full-length Grb10 disrupts IR-Grb10 association in cells (11Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Google Scholar). A second domain termed the BPS (forbetween the Pleckstrin and SH2) has also been suggested as a second independent IR-interacting domain (9He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Google Scholar). Grb10 interacts with the regulatory kinase loop of the IR (10Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8882-8886Google Scholar). Several human Grb10 isoforms exist and most likely arise from alternative splicing. Two isoforms of hGrb10 differ in the PH domain. hGrb10γ encodes for the full-length protein, while Grb10α (previously named Grb-IR) lacks an intact PH domain as it contains a 46-amino acid deletion in this region (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Google Scholar, 17Dong L.Q. Du H.-Y. Porter S. Kolakowski J.L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J.B. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Google Scholar). A third isoform, hGrb10β is identical to hGrb10γ with the exception of 58 amino acids at the extreme N terminus of the γ isoform (12Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Google Scholar, 17Dong L.Q. Du H.-Y. Porter S. Kolakowski J.L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino L.J. Fan J.B. Yee D. Liu F. J.

Grb10 has been shown to positively stimulate insulin-induced mitogenesis (18Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Swamy O.R. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6217-6228Google Scholar). Microinjection of a peptide fragment including the BPS and SH2 domain of Grb10 inhibited insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis (13O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W.

Several studies have indicated an inhibitory role for Grb10 as well. Overexpression of hGrb10α negatively regulates insulin receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase-activated protein (GAP)-associated protein p60 and IRS-1 (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl.

Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 15-27Google Scholar). Stable expression of hGrb10α in CHO/IR reduces insulin-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Google Scholar), although a direct effect of full-length Grb10 on IRS-1/2 and downstream effectors of the insulin signal, such as Akt, has not been reported. However, several studies indicate that Grb10 may regulate downstream events in various signaling pathways. Overexpression of hGrb10γ (Grb10ζ) in rat hepatocytes inhibits insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase activity, through a proposed novel pathway outside of the classical PI 3-kinase to Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling (21Mounier C. Lavoie L. Dumas V. Mohammad-Ali K. Wu J. Nantel A. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 15-27Google Scholar). Grb10 has also been found to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-kit receptor, and synergistically promote Akt activation. This study indicated Grb10 forms a constitutive complex with Akt and proposed that Grb10 positively influenced Akt activity by promoting its translocation to the cell membrane leading to the phosphorylation and activation of this kinase (22Jahn T. Seipel P. Urschel S. Peschel C. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 979-991Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins induces the association of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase and subsequently results in an increase in PI 3-kinase activity (23White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Google Scholar). As an IR-interacting protein, Grb10 has the potential to influence signaling through this IRS/PI 3-kinase pathway and moderate the actions of downstream effectors such as Akt. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms linked to the effects of Grb10 on insulin signaling. We find that hGrb10γ both delays and decreases Akt phosphorylation. This inhibition stems from a rapid and sustained inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Our studies suggest that the mechanism for Grb10-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling results from a physical disruption of IRS association with phosphorylated residues of the IR kinase domain and/or the NPXY motif (Tyr972). The SH2 domain of Grb10 is essential for IR/IRS disruption. In addition, this region is required to facilitate Grb10 association with the IR and inhibition of IRS tyrosine phosphorylation in cells. This physical disruption of IR/IRS interaction by Grb10 functions to slow signaling relayed through tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing both the human insulin receptor and hGrb10γ have been previously described (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

The forward PCR primer 5′- GCTCTAGATGGCCTTGCTGTCCCCGTTC-3′ and the reverse PCR primer 5′-CGGAATTCCACTCGGATGCAGTGGTG-3′ were used to amplify the BPS/SH2 fragment using pBex/Grb10γ or pBex/Grb10γR520G as template. The reverse PCR primer 5′-GCGAATTCGTGCTGTGTCCTGTGAATC-3′ was used to amplify the ΔSH2 fragment. The PCR products were inserted in-frame with the HA tag using the XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites of the mammalian expression vector pBex (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

The individual PCR products were separately subcloned into an intermediate vector using theXbaI/SalI and SalI/EcoRI restriction sites. The resulting chimeric fragment was inserted in-frame with the HA tag using the XbaI/EcoRI restriction sites of pBex. A plasmid encoding Myc-tagged IRS-1 was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Roth (26Li J. DeFea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding full-length human IRS-2 was a generous gift from Dr. Klein-Hitpass (27Vassen L. Wegrzyn W. Klein-Hitpass L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 485-494Google Scholar). Adenoviruses encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP, as an adenovirus control) and hGrb10γ were produced by using the AdEasy system (The AdEasy system is a generous gift of Drs. Tong-Chuan He and Bert Vogelstein, Ref. 28He T.-C. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding HA-tagged Grb10γ was cloned into the pAdTrack-CMV transfer vector using EcoRV and XbaI restriction sites. The hGrb10γ-HA encoding sequence was then transferred into the pAdEasy viral DNA plasmid by homologous recombination in the BJ5183Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant adenoviral construct was transfected into HEK293 cells to produce viral particles. Adenoviruses were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. The infection efficiency was estimated for GFP expression using an Olympus IX70 immunofluorescence microscope. CHO/IR cells were maintained in Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluency 24 h prior to transfection using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to confluency and then differentiated with the addition of 500 μmisobutylmethylxanthine, 25 μm dexamethasone, and 4 μg/ml insulin for 3 days, followed by 3 days in supplemental media with 4 μg/ml insulin added. Cells were cultured an additional 3–4 days in supplemental media to complete differentiation. For adenovirus experiments, cells were transduced with GFP (control) or Grb10γ viral stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 20. Twenty-four hours post-transfection/post-transduction cells were serum-starved for 4–18 h, treated with 10 nm (CHO/IR) or 100 nm(adipocytes) insulin, and lysed in ice-cold Buffer A (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 10 mmNaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and the supernatants used for immunoprecipitation or Western blot experiments. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies bound to either protein A or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 6–18 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with ice-cold Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X). Proteins bound to beads were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 4 min in SDS sample loading buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with specific antibodies. Quantitation of the relative increase in Akt phosphorylation was performed by analyzing Western blots using the Scion Image program and normalized to the level of Akt expression in each experiment. The yeast MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system reagents were purchased from Clontech. The yeast Saccharyomyces cerevisiae strain GUSEGY48 (Matα, trp1, his3, urs3, 6LexAop-LEU2, LYS2) and the pLexA-IR, and various pB42AD Grb10 constructs were generous gifts from Dr. Thomas A. Gustafson. GUSEGY48 was sequentially transformed with plasmid constructs by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method according to the Clontech protocol. Transformants were grown on SD-HisTrp agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked onto SD-HisTrp agar plates, grown overnight, replica-plated onto SD galactose/raffinose -HisLeuTrp agar plates and incubated for 5 days at 30 °C to induce expression of B42 fusion proteins and to determine interacting partners. GUSEGY48 was sequentially transformed as described above with pLexA-IR, pB42AD IRS-1 1–1242aa/IRS-2 3–1321aa/IRS-2 5–591aa/IRS-2 591–1321aa (generous gifts from Dr. Thomas A. Gustafson), and a third plasmid (pDIS) containing various Grb10 constructs. Transformants were grown on SD-HisTrpUra agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked onto SD-HisTrpUra agar plates, incubated overnight, and then replicated onto SD galactose/raffinose-HisLeuTrpUra agar plates and incubated for 5 days at 30 °C to induce the expression of B42 and pDIS fusion proteins and promote growth. In the insulin signaling cascade, elevated phospholipid levels result from PI 3-kinase activity and provide for the activation of downstream mediators, such as Akt (29Stokoe D. Stephens L.R.

Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Google Scholar). To test the effects of hGrb10γ on Akt activation, Myc-tagged Akt was expressed in CHO/IR cells together with HA-tagged hGrb10γ. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was detected using phosphospecific antibodies to AktT308 and AktS473. Significant phosphorylation on both AktT308 and AktS473 was seen with a 5-min insulin stimulation (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1 and 2, first and third panel), which is consistent with published results (31Kohn A.D. Kovacina K. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Google Scholar). The presence of hGrb10γ greatly reduced phosphorylation on AktT308 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and4, top panel). Phosphorylation at AktS473 was also decreased with hGrb10γ overexpression (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4, third panel). Quantitative analyses indicated that hGrb10γ reduced AktS473 phosphorylation by ∼50–60% and virtually abolished AktT308 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Previous reports indicated that insulin rapidly induces phosphorylation of AktT308 and that this is stable during extended stimulation (31Kohn A.D. Kovacina K. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Google Scholar, 32Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Google Scholar). Furthermore, limited AktS473phosphorylation in the basal state rapidly increases following growth factor stimulation (33Williams M.R. Arthur J.S.C. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Google Scholar). Since hGrb10γ significantly inhibits AktT308 and partially inhibits insulin-stimulated AktS473 phosphorylation, we hypothesized that hGrb10γ might have a temporal effect on Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation. Akt was overexpressed in CHO/IR cells in the absence or presence of hGrb10γ. Cells were treated with 10 nm insulin for increasing times, and phosphorylation was detected in whole cell lysates using phosphospecific antibodies. hGrb10γ delayed Akt phosphorylation at both sites, while concurrently decreasing the overall extent of phosphorylation for up to 1 h of insulin treatment (Fig. 1 C). The IRS proteins are rapidly phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation. Since tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1/2 increases PI 3-kinase activity in the cell by binding the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (7Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers M.G.J. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Google Scholar), we considered whether Grb10-mediated inhibition of Akt phosphorylation might arise from decreased signaling through IRS-1/2. A partial inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS has been observed with hGrb10α (the isoform that lacks a PH-domain) (16Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Google Scholar), although the effects of full-length hGrb10γ have not been investigated. hGrb10γ and IRS-1 were co-expressed in CHO/IR cells and insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was measured. In the absence of Grb10, IRS-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated after 5 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was substantially inhibited when hGrb10γ was co-expressed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B, lane 2 versus lanes 3–6). We also examined the effects of hGrb10γ on IRS-2 phosphorylation. Since little endogenous IRS-2 was detected in CHO/IR cells (data not shown), we co-expressed IRS-2 and hGrb10γ in CHO/IR cells. We found that treatment of cells with insulin led to a significant increase in IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C, lane 2 versus lane 1). The insulin-stimulated IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was greatly inhibited by overexpressing hGrb10γ (Fig. 2 C, lane 4 versus lane 2). These findings demonstrate that the Grb10-mediated inhibition is not specific for IRS-1. To determine if hGrb10γ inhibits phosphorylation of endogenous IRS and Akt in physiologically relevant cells, we used an adenovirus system to express hGrb10γ in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Infection efficiency was 85–90% as assessed by visualization of green fluorescence emitted from co-expressed GFP (data not shown). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous IRS-1 was inhibited (Fig.3 A), and Akt Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation significantly reduced in adipocytes expressing hGrb10γ (Fig. 3 B). Because hGrb10γ delayed and sustained reduced levels of insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C), we investigated the temporal effects of hGrb10γ on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Time course studies indicated that hGrb10γ inhibited IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation as early as 30 s after insulin stimulation, and that hGrb10γ-mediated inhibition continued through an hour of insulin stimulation (Fig.4 A,top panel). Since hGrb10γ inhibits insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation over an extended period, we studied the kinetics of hGrb10γ binding to the IR. CHO/IR cells transiently expressing HA-tagged hGrb10γ were stimulated with insulin for varying times, and hGrb10γ was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with antibody to the HA tag. Bound IR was detected using an antibody specific to the β-subunit of IR. hGrb10γ rapidly associated with the IR within 30 s of insulin stimulation, and the association persisted through 60 min of hormonal treatment (Fig. 4 B), which mirrors the speed and duration of hGrb10γ inhibition of insulin stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). We observed a decrease in Grb10γ association following a 10-min insulin stimulation, which may result from subsequent dephosphorylation of the IR by activated tyrosine phosphatases. IRS interacts directly with the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY972 (34Ebina Y. Ellis L. Jarnagin K. Edery M. Graf L. Clauser E. Ou J.-H. Masarz F. Kan Y.W. Goldfine I.D. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 747-758Google Scholar) motif in the IR juxtamembrane (4Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that autophosphorylation of the IR initiates at tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163 in the core catalytic domain (35Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Google Scholar), and phosphorylation in the C-terminal and juxtamembrane domains rapidly follows. Since Grb10 associates with the regulatory kinase domain of the IR (10Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1757-1765Google Scholar, 12Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Google Scholar, 13O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Google Scholar), we considered that the effects of Grb10 on IRS tyrosine phosphorylation might arise from a decrease or loss in receptor autophosphorylation. The insulin receptor was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of either CHO/IR or CHO/IR stably expressing hGrb10γ and the extent of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at Tyr972, Tyr1158, and Tyr1162/1163 was determined using phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylation at Tyr972 was not significantly reduced in cells that stably expressed hGrb10γ (Fig.5, lanes 2 versus 4,first panel), suggesting that the reduction in IRS tyrosine phosphorylation is not a direct consequence of an impaired IRS docking site on the IR. Phosphorylation of the IR on the three critical tyrosine residues in the regulatory loop were similarly unaffected by expression of hGrb10γ (Fig. 5, lanes 2 versus 4,second and third panels). While the presence of Grb10 has been shown to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrates in vitro (19Bereziat V. Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Cariou B. Girard J. Burnol A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4845-4852Google Scholar, 20Stein E.G. Gustafson T.A. Hubbard S.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 106-111Google Scholar, 21Mounier C. Lavoie L. Dumas V. Mohammad-Ali K. Wu J. Nantel A. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 15-27Google Scholar), it is unclear whether this is directly related to impaired catalytic activity. We considered that if Grb10γ does not significantly impair IR catalytic activity in cells, then an alternative mechanism for Grb10-mediated inhibition of substrate phosphorylation may exist. The results in Fig. 5 illustrate that the catalytic activity of IR, at least toward itself, is not significantly hindered by Grb10γ overexpression in cells. To determine the mechanism behind Grb10-mediated inhibition of IRS-1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation, a yeast tri-hybrid disruption assay was performed using IR as bait, IRS-1 or IRS-2 as prey and various Grb10 constructs (Fig.6 A) as disrupters. The interaction between IR and IRS-1 (36O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar) and IRS-2 (37Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Google Scholar, 38He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Google Scholar) in yeast, as determined by growth on selective media, has been well characterized. Co-expression of full-length hGrb10β in the yeast tri-hybrid system prevented growth on selective media, indicating that IR/IRS-1/2 interactions were inhibited (Fig. 6 B). Since interactions between Grb10 and IR are mediated by two separate “domains,” the BPS and SH2 (9He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Google Scholar), we set out to determine which is responsible for the disruption of IR/IRS-1/2 interactions. A truncated construct containing the BPS and SH2 domains (342–536) blocked growth on selective media (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the N terminus and PH domain are not required for inhibition of IR/IRS-1/2 binding. To block SH2 domain function, the critical arginine residue at 462 was replaced with alanine (R462A) in the full-length and truncated (BPS/SH2) hGrb10β proteins. Both constructs interacted with IR (Fig. 6 A and Ref. 9He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Google Scholar) and both also disrupted the IR/IRS-1/2 interactions similar to wild-type Grb10 (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that the BPS domain may be respo"

Like almost all other members, TGF-β1 is synthesized as a precursor structure (pre-pro-TGF-β1) and gives rise to its mature peptide by cleaving off the N-terminal part. In the first step, the signal peptide is released during translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by dimerization by way of cysteine bridges and cleavage at the dibasic protease site by furin (10Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell.

This homodimer, in which the latency-associated peptide (LAP) and the mature peptide are non-covalently linked, is secreted and stored in the extracellular matrix as a latent complex, either alone (as small latent complex) or in conjunction with a latent TGF-β-binding protein as a large latent complex (10Gentry L.E.

Because TGF-β1 and its receptors are ubiquitously expressed, latency is the most important means of controlling the biological effects of this protein. Several activation mechanisms in vivo have been described, including the action of plasmin and thrombospondin (14Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J.

This binding recruits the type I receptor (TβRI) and induces the formation of a heteromeric complex (16Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). TβRI is phosphorylated and activated and in turn phosphorylates the R-Smads 2 or 3. Activated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus, where they can bind directly to DNA or interact with other transcription factors to regulate gene transcription (17ten Dijke P.

Radiologically, it is characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones and sclerosis of the skull base. Patients suffer mainly from bone pain, muscle weakness, a waddling gait, and fatigue (18Sparkes R.S. Graham C.B. J. Med. Genet. 1972; 9: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations in TGFB1 were found to underlie this bone disorder (19Janssens K. Gershoni B. Guañabens N. Migone N. Ralston S. Bonduelle M. Lissens W. Van Maldergem L. Vanhoenacker F. Verbruggen L.

With one exception, a duplication of three Leu residues in the signal peptide, all of them are missense mutations in the LAP. An earlier study suggests a disruption of the association of the LAP and mature TGF-β1 in the case of domain-specific mutations in exon 4 as the cause for CED (21Saito T. Kinoshita A. Yoshiura K.

This study aims at further unraveling the effect of these and other mutations on the action of TGF-β1 in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this paper illustrate that the pathogenic mechanism underlying the sclerosing bone phenotype in CED patients is increased TGF-β1 signaling as a result of disturbed activation or secretion of the mutant protein. The experimental results suggest the existence of two distinct mechanisms leading to increased TGF-β1 activity in CED patients depending on the underlying mutation. In the first, illustrated by the R218C, H222D, and C225R mutations in exon 4 of TGFB1, secretion is normal, but the percentage active TGF-β1 is elevated. These mutations are located close to the two cysteine residues (Cys223 and Cys225) that form the intrachain disulfide bonds. We hypothesized that the resultant destabilization of the dimerization process would facilitate the activation of latent TGF-β1. Our assumption was partly based on a study by Brunner et al. (24Brunner A.M. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13660-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that site-directed mutagenesis of Cys223 or Cys225 led to a 2.4- to 4.3-fold increase in active TGF-β1 prior to acidification without altering secretion and was recently suggested by Saito et al. (21Saito T. Kinoshita A. Yoshiura K. Makita Y. Wakui K. Honke K. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 276: 11469-11472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis was confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay, the immunostaining for pSmad2 in cell lysates, and the ELISA on supernatants of transfected cells; when corrected for the transfection efficiency and the total amount of TGF-β1 secreted, a significant greater amount of TGF-β1 already active prior to acidification is present in the supernatants of cells transfected with a construct mutated in exon 4. The minor variations in total TGF-β1 production show that this is not the result of overproduction of the mutant protein but reflects the instability of the precursor protein, facilitating activation. The observation that the presence of approximately two times more active TGF-β1 leads to such a strong Smad-dependent transcriptional response can be explained by the fact that in the ELISA, the active TGF-β1 present in the medium of the transfected cells at the moment of collection is measured, whereas the Firefly luciferase activity measured in the reporter assay reflects the amount of active TGF-β1 produced by the cells and bound to its receptor over a time period of 24 h.In the second mechanism, illustrated by the LLL12–13ins and Y81H mutations, secretion is disturbed, leading to intracellular accumulation of TGF-β1. This is not unexpected for the mutation in the signal peptide. The first step in the processing of the pre-pro-TGF-β1 is the signal peptide cleavage at the Gly29-Leu30 peptide bond during transit through the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Although insertion of three Leu residues does not change the predicted site of signal peptide cleavage (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar), this calculation does not take into account the critical length of the central hydrophobic stretch (h region). Nilsson et al. (26Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) constructed signal sequences with poly-Leu h regions ranging in length from 8 to 29 residues and found that the critical length for cleavage lies around 17–19 residues. The insertion extends the h region of the signal peptide of TGF-β1 from 14 to 17 residues and thus might indeed hinder the proper cleavage of the signal peptide. This probably affects the translocation of the protein through the cell, resulting in a sharp decrease in secretion. However, disulfide bond formation and cleavage at the dibasic site do not seem to be disturbed, because under non-reducing conditions, disulfide bound mature TGF-β1 can be detected in the lysate of transfected cells (data not shown). In the case of the Y81H mutation, we were unable to experimentally prove the intracellular accumulation of the protein, but several arguments are in favor of a disturbed secretion. The Y81H mutation is located next to the first of three glycosylation signals in the LAP. Mutagenesis of this mannose 6-phosphate-containing site results in an 85% decrease in the amount of TGF-β1 secreted (27Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. Malacko A.R. Wang W.C. Shapiro R.A. Neubauer M. Cook J. Madisen L. Purchio A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, by using different inhibitors of glycosylation or maturation of oligosaccharide chain formation, Sha et al.(28Sha X. Brunner A.M. Purchio A.F. Gentry L.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that these events play an important role in secretion. Furthermore, substitution of Tyr81 for a stretch of five amino acids led to a decrease in secretion to 13–33% of the normal values (29Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Despite the decreased secretion in this second group of mutations, our experimental data show that there is enhanced signaling by the mutant TGF-β1 proteins (Fig. 2 A). This observation led us to formulate a hypothesis of intracrine signaling; the intracellular accumulation of (aberrant) TGF-β1 could account for the increased transcriptional response by inducing the signaling pathway without the need for ligand binding to the membrane bound receptor. Our theory is partly based on the requirement for receptor internalization in TGF-β signaling. Although receptor down-regulation requires binding of ligand to a heteromeric receptor complex (30Anders R.A. Arline S.L. Doré J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Zwaagstra J.C. El-Alfy M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27237-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), several researchers report the constitutive endocytosis of the TGF-β receptor complex in the absence of ligand (32Doré J.J.E. Yao D. Edens M. Garamszegi N. Sholl E.L. Leof E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Ehrlich M. Shmuely A. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the Y81H mutation, we assume that the mutated LAP is no longer able to bind the mature peptide, releasing it as soon as the covalent bond is broken by furin; this assumption is again based on the presumed influence of the mutation on the first glycosylation signal and is supported by the finding by Miyazono et al. (34Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Nature. 1989; 338: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) that treatment of latent TGF-β1 with endoglycosidase F, which removes complex and oligomannose N-linked carbohydrate complexes, generates active TGF-β1, demonstrating the importance of these side chains in latency. Once released, the active, mature dimer could then form an intracellular complex with the internalized receptor complex, preventing it from recycling back to the plasma membrane. The absence of mature TGF-β1 in the lysate and the presence of LAP (Fig.4 C) could thus be explained by the instability and rapid degradation of this complex through lysosomes or the proteasomal pathway. Future experiments will have to prove the presence of such an intracellular complex with the receptor or show whether mature TGF-β1 forms a complex with another yet unidentified protein. Although intracrine signaling is a rare phenomenon, it has been described previously for the v-sis oncogene, whose gene product, p28v-sis, is homologous to the platelet-derived growth factor B chain. Several investigators (35Bejcek B.E. Li D.Y. Deuel T.F. Science. 1989; 245: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36Fleming T.P. Matsui T. Molloy C.J. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc.

Chem. 2002; 267: 3289-3293Google Scholar) have reported that its transforming capacities are at least partly attributable to internal activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Another report (38Fernandez T. Amoroso S. Sharpe S. Jones G.M. Bliskovski V. Kovalchuk A. Wakefield L.M. Kim S.J. Potter M. Letterio J.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) makes mention of the formation of an intracellular TGF-β1-TβRII complex in plasma cell tumors. Despite the absence of mutations in TGF-β1 or TβRII and normal expression of TβRII, the receptor does not localize to the plasma membrane but is abundant in the cytosol, were it is captured by active, intracellular TGF-β1. The absence of phosphorylated Smad2 led them to conclude that this intracellular complex is incapable of signaling (38Fernandez T. Amoroso S. Sharpe S. Jones G.M. Bliskovski V. Kovalchuk A. Wakefield L.M. Kim S.J. Potter M. Letterio J.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our experimental results show, however, that signaling does occur through the Smad pathway (Fig. 2 C).In the case of the LLL12–13ins mutation, a comparable intracrine signaling mechanism might exist, but the presence of a major part of the intracellular TGF-β1 in the latent state could account for the limited enhanced transcriptional response. Our hypothesis of intracrine signaling is experimentally supported by the data presented in Fig. 6; the absence of signaling in the case of the Y81H and LLL12–13ins mutations shows the need for the intracellular TGF-β1 generated by these mutant constructs. However, extensive experimental evidence is still needed to further prove this theory, and alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded at present.Because TGF-β1 acts as a coupling factor between bone resorption and formation, the presence of activating mutations in TGF-β1 in CED patients will unbalance this process, resulting in decreased bone resorption and increased bone formation. This is in agreement with the radiological observations in CED patients; the narrowing of the medullary canal at the endosteal side and the modeling defect at the periosteal side of the diaphyses of the long bones suggest that both the resorption capacity of the osteoclasts and the bone formation process by the osteoblasts are disturbed. Although we mainly looked at the effect of the mutations after overexpression, the results obtained with the sera of patients with the LLL12–13ins or Y81H mutation illustrate that the mutations do have a physiological effect (Fig. 5). Further experiments will have to be performed to establish the exact role of the mutant protein in vivo. Because of the diverse nature of the mutations, we looked at the genotype-phenotype relationship in our families but found no evidence for a correlation. The occurrence of high intrafamilial variability indicates that other factors might influence the outcome of this disorder.In conclusion, the mutations in the signal peptide and LAP of TGF-β1 give rise to the pathologic phenotype in Camurati-Engelmann disease by altering the activation or secretion of the protein, leading to enhanced signaling. The present study shows that this not only occurs through the well known extracellular pathway but suggests the existence of an alternative, possibly intracrine pathway for TGF-β1 signaling. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)1 has a versatile role in our body; it regulates cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis and has an influence on embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, immune suppression, and many other biological processes (1Roberts A.B.

https://openalex.org/W2030811134,"We recently demonstrated that thrombin induces the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in endothelial cells by an NF-κB- and GATA-dependent mechanism. In the present study, we describe the signaling pathways that mediate this response. Thrombin stimulation of the VCAM-1 gene and promoter in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by preincubation with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, the protein kinase C (PKC)-δ inhibitor, rottlerin, a PKC-ζ peptide inhibitor, or by overexpression of dominant negative (DN)-PKC-ζ. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, thrombin-mediated induction of NF-κB p65 binding to two NF-κB motifs in the upstream promoter region of VCAM-1 was blocked by LY294002 and rottlerin, whereas the inducible binding of GATA-2 to a tandem GATA motif was inhibited by LY294002 and the PKC-ζ peptide inhibitor. In co-transfection assays, thrombin stimulation of a minimal promoter containing multimerized VCAM-1 NF-κB sites was inhibited by DN-PKC-δ but not DN-PKC-ζ. In contrast, thrombin-mediated transactivation of a minimal promoter containing tandem VCAM-1 GATA motifs was inhibited by DN-PKC-ζ but not DN-PKC-δ. Finally, thrombin failed to induce VCAM-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the endothelial cell-specific effect of thrombin on VCAM-1 expression involves the coordinate activity of PKC-δ-NF-κB and PKC-ζ-GATA signaling pathways."

The 40 S preinitiation complex contained, in addition to eIF3, both eIF1 and eIF1A in a 1:1 stoichiometry with respect to the bound Met-tRNAi. These three initiation factors also bind to free 40 S subunits, and the resulting complex can act as an acceptor of the ternary complex to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A·Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP). The stable association of eIF1 with 40 S subunits required the presence of eIF3. In contrast, the binding of eIF1A to free 40 S ribosomes as well as to the 40 S preinitiation complex was stabilized by the presence of both eIF1 and eIF3. These studies suggest that it is possible for eIF1 and eIF1A to bind the 40 S preinitiation complex prior to mRNA binding. We have examined the role of the mammalian initiation factor eIF1 in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex using in vitro binding of initiator Met-tRNA (as Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA.

These three initiation factors also bind to free 40 S subunits, and the resulting complex can act as an acceptor of the ternary complex to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A·Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP). The stable association of eIF1 with 40 S subunits required the presence of eIF3. In contrast, the binding of eIF1A to free 40 S ribosomes as well as to the 40 S preinitiation complex was stabilized by the presence of both eIF1 and eIF3. These studies suggest that it is possible for eIF1 and eIF1A to bind the 40 S preinitiation complex prior to mRNA binding. The initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells occurs by a sequence of partial reactions that require a number of specific proteins called eukaryotic (translation) initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic (translation) initiation factor According to the currently accepted view of translation initiation, primarily derived from in vitro studies with purified initiation factors, an obligatory intermediate step in the overall initiation reaction is the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi as the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to a 40 S ribosomal subunit containing bound initiation factor eIF3. This interaction leads to the production of the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP). The 40 S preinitiation complex then binds to the 5′-capped end of mRNA and scans the mRNA in a 5′→3′ direction until the 40 S complex encounters the initiating AUG codon to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·eIF3·mRNA·Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP). This reaction requires the participation of three other initiation factors eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B. Subsequently, the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins the 40 S complex in a reaction dependent on two other factors, eIF5 and eIF5B, to form a functional 80 S initiation complex (80 S·mRNA·Met-tRNAi) (for review, see Refs. 1Kozak M.

In addition to the initiation factors described above, the 17-kDa eIF1A and the 12-kDa eIF1 are also known to play essential roles in the overall initiation process (1Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Google Scholar, 2Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar, 3Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B.

Earlier biochemical studies demonstrated that both eIF1 and eIF1A have a weak stimulatory effect on the binding of Met-tRNAi and mRNA to 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes in the presence of other factors (6Schreier M.H. Erni B. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 727-753Google Scholar, 7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Google Scholar, 8Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

The presence of eIF1A in the 40 S initiation complex was also shown in one of these earlier studies (9Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Google Scholar). In vivo studies inSaccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that the genes encoding these two small initiation factors are essential for initiation of protein synthesis and required for cell growth and viability (12Wei C.-L. Kainuma M. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22788-22794Google Scholar, 13Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Google Scholar, 14Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue T.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2307-2313Google Scholar). These observations are in accord with genetic studies in S. cerevisiae (15Huang H.K. Yoon H. Hannig E.M. Donahue T.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2396-2413Google Scholar, 16Cui Y. Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1506-1516Google Scholar) that indicate that eIF1 (SUI 1) plays an essential role in the fidelity of start site selection. In a purified mammalian translation initiation system, Pestova et al. (17Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Google Scholar), using toe-printing analysis on natural β-globin mRNA, have reported that eIF1 in concert with eIF1A, promotes stable 40 S complex formation with ribosomes positioned at the correct AUG codon. The requirements of eIF1 and eIF1A in AUG selection were also observed by Algire et al. (18Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 382-397Google Scholar) in a reconstituted yeast translation initiation system containing a 43-nucleotide-long RNA with an AUG codon in the middle. However, the step at which eIF1 and eIF1A associate with the 40 S ribosomal subunits remains unclear. Are these initiation factors recruited following binding of the 40 S preinitiation complex to the 5′-capped end? Or, are both these factors recruited to the 40 S ribosomal subunit prior to the binding of the preinitiation complex to the 5′-end of the mRNA? Recently we described (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) an in vitro translation initiation assay that specifically measures the transfer of Met-tRNAi (as Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA or an AUG codon to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. Using this assay, we observed that both eIF1A and eIF3 were essential for the efficient transfer of Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form a stable 40 S preinitiation complex (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar). However, analysis of the 40 S preinitiation complex showed that, although eIF3 was bound to the complex, eIF1A was not. It was of interest, therefore, to examine whether eIF1 has any role in the formation of the preinitiation complex as well as in the stable association of eIF1A to this complex. In the present work, we have used a modified initiation assay to show that, although eIF1, by itself, does not stimulate the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, at low concentrations of initiation factors, all three factors eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3 are required for the quantitative binding of the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the stable 40 S preinitiation complex. Furthermore, analysis of the in vitroassembled 40 S preinitiation complex shows that both eIF1 and eIF1A are present in a near 1:1 stoichiometry with respect to bound Met-tRNAi. We also demonstrate that these three initiation factors bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex and the resulting 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A can then bind the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A·Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP). The implications of these results in relation to 40 S preinitiation complex formation are discussed. The preparation of 35S- or3H-labeled rabbit liver initiator Met-tRNAi(10,000 and 66,000 cpm/pmol, respectively) and 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits from Artemia salina eggs were as described previously (21Raychaudhuri P. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7723-7728Google Scholar). Purified eIF2 and eIF3 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates and bacterially expressed recombinant human eIF1A protein (unlabeled or labeled with 35S) were isolated as described elsewhere (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar). Rabbit IgG antibodies specific for mammalian eIF1A were obtained as described previously (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar), and total IgY antibodies specific for mammalian eIF3 subunits were isolated from egg yolks of laying hens immunized with purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF3 (22Chaudhuri J. Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30975-30983Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against purified denatured eIF1 were prepared in rabbits following a procedure similar to that used previously for preparation of anti-eIF1A antibodies (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was as described previously (23Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Google Scholar). The mixture of protease inhibitors added to buffer solutions used during purification of recombinant proteins from bacterial cell extracts consisted of leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (0.7 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The open reading frame of eIF1 cDNA (24Fields C. Adams M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 288-291Google Scholar) was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of HeLa poly(A)+ RNA using the Invitrogen kit and appropriate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the eIF1 open reading frame. These primers hadNdeI/EcoR1 overhangs. The PCR product was sequenced to ensure error-free DNA synthesis and cloned into theNdeI/EcoRI sites of pET-5a plasmid (Novagen). This pET-5a-eIF1 expression vector was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Transformants were then grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 of about 1.2, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and grown for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 0.9% NaCl, quick-frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C. For purification of recombinant eIF1, frozen E. coli cells (5 g) were disrupted by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and the postribosomal supernatant was prepared as described previously for the isolation of recombinant eIF5 from overproducing E. coli cells (26Chaudhuri J. Das K. Maitra U. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Google Scholar). The postribosomal supernatant (170 mg of protein in 16 ml of total volume) was loaded onto a 60-ml bed volume of DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) plus 50 mm KCl, and the column was washed with buffer A plus 50 mm KCl. eIF1 was virtually unretarded under these conditions and appeared in the initial wash along with the unretarded protein peak. Fractions containing the protein peak were pooled (26 mg of protein), adjusted to 0.1 m KCl and loaded onto a 9-ml bed volume of a phosphocellulose column equilibrated in buffer A plus 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with the same buffer until A 280 of the effluent was below 0.1. Bound eIF1 was then eluted from the column with a linear gradient (total volume, 72 ml) in buffer A from 100 mm KCl to 800 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIF1 (eluting at about 450 mm KCl) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A plus 50 mm KCl to reduce the ionic strength to that of buffer A plus 100 mm KCl, and then applied to a 1-ml bed volume fast-protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A plus 100 mm KCl, and bound proteins were eluted by a gradient elution (12.5 ml of total volume) from buffer A plus 100 mm KCl to buffer A plus 400 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIF1 (eluting at about 150 mm KCl) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol), and stored at −20 °C. The yield was about 1 mg of homogeneous protein. eIF1 was monitored at different purification steps by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining as well as by immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF1 antibodies (data not shown). E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the pET-5a-eIF1 expression plasmid was grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of M9 medium (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to A 600 of about 1.0, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and then grown for an additional hour. The culture was then supplemented with 5 mCi of [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences), and the cells were allowed to grow with vigorous aeration for an additional hour. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, and then quick-frozen. Homogeneous [3H]eIF1 (∼800 cpm/pmol of protein) was isolated from the frozen cells using the purification protocol described above for the isolation of non-radioactive recombinant eIF1. 40 S preinitiation complex formation was measured by the binding of35S- or 3H-labeled Met-tRNAi (as the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits at 1 mm Mg2+ in the absence of mRNA or AUG as follows. Reactions were carried out in two stages. In Stage 1, reaction mixtures (100 μl each) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 400 μm GTP, 1.2 μg of purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF2, and 8 pmol of either [35S]Met-tRNAi (30,000–60,000 cpm/pmol) or [3H]Met-tRNAi (10,000 cpm/pmol) were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min to promote the formation of the [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP or the [3H]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. Reaction mixtures were then chilled in an ice-water bath, and a 5-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was subjected to nitrocellulose membrane filtration to determine the amount of the ternary complex formed (27Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6845-6848Google Scholar). In Stage 2, another set of reaction mixtures (50 μl each) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Buffer B), 0.6A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits and, where indicated, 1.5–15 μg of eIF3, 50 ng to 1 μg of eIF1A, and 50–500 ng of eIF1 were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min and then supplemented with 95 μl of the Stage 1 reaction mixture containing about 4 pmol of35S- or 3H-labeled Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. The Mg2+ concentration of each reaction mixture (now 175 μl each) was adjusted to 1 mm, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 min, chilled in an ice-water bath, and then layered onto a 5-ml 7.5–30% (w/v) sucrose density gradient containing buffer B and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 105 min in a SW 50.1 rotor. Fractions (200–300 μl) were collected from the bottom of each gradient, and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The efficiency of the 40 S preinitiation complex formation was calculated relative to35S- or 3H-labeled Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. The 40 S preinitiation complex containing [3H]- or [35S]methionine-labeled Met-tRNAi was formed as described above under “Assay for Formation of the 40 S Preinitiation Complex,” except that either [35S]eIF1A (1900 cpm/pmol) or [3H]eIF1 (820 cpm/pmol) replaced unlabeled eIF1A or eIF1, respectively. In reaction mixtures containing [35S]eIF1A, [3H]Met-tRNAi was used for the ternary complex formation in Stage 1 and unlabeled eIF3 and eIF1 were used in Stage 2 reactions. In reactions containing [3H]eIF1, [35S]Met-tRNAi was used for ternary complex formation in Stage 1 and unlabeled eIF3 and eIF1A were used in Stage 2. Following incubation to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, the reactions were analyzed either by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described above or by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. For analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation, 0.2- to 0.3-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of each tube following centrifugation, and the radioactivity in each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The presence of eIF3 in each fraction was determined by Western blotting. For analysis by Sephadex G-75 gel filtrations, chilled reaction mixtures were each applied to a 12-ml bed volume column of Sephadex G-75 previously equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The column was then developed with the same equilibrating buffer at 4 °C. Fractions of 250 μl were collected and assayed for 3H and/or35S radioactivity by counting each fraction in Aquasol in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The elution positions of the 40 S preinitiation complex, free eIF1A, eIF1, or eIF3 proteins, and free Met-tRNAi were determined separately in the same column. We have previously used an in vitro assay that measures the binding of Met-tRNAi (as the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of mRNA or AUG codon to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar). Although these initiation assays were carried out in reactions containing 1 mm Mg2+, they were subsequently analyzed for the binding of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomes employing sucrose gradients in buffers containing 5 mm Mg2+. Elevated levels of Mg2+ are known to stabilize ribosomal binding of Met-tRNAi and have been used by all investigators to analyze 40 S and 80 S initiation complexes in vitro by sucrose gradient centrifugation (7Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Google Scholar, 8Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Google Scholar, 9Thomas A. Goumans H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 39-45Google Scholar, 10Peterson D.T. Merrick W.C. Safer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Google Scholar, 11Thomas A. Spaan W. van Steeg H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 67-71Google Scholar, 19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar). Using such an assay, we showed that two initiation factors, eIF1A and eIF3, are required for efficient formation of a stable 40 S preinitiation complex. Although eIF1A promotes the transfer of Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, the presence of eIF3 bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunits is required to stabilize the resulting complex under a variety of experimental conditions (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar). To determine if eIF1 has a role in the formation and/or stability of the 40 S preinitiation complex, we used a similar assay system (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) except that both the initiation reactions and the subsequent sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis were carried out in buffers containing 1 mm Mg2+. We reasoned that the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ in sucrose gradient buffers might artificially stabilize the bound Met-tRNAi and thus prevent the identification of additional factors involved in the 40 S preinitiation complex formation. For this reason a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex (3.5 pmol) was incubated, at physiological 1 mmMg2+ with 40 S ribosomal subunits and saturating levels of each of the three initiation factors, eIF1A, or eIF1, or eIF3, either alone or in combination. The products were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation in buffers containing 1 mm Mg2+(Fig. 1). When tested alone, eIF1A was the most effective of the three initiation factors in supporting binding of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Although eIF1A, by itself, promoted the transfer of about 1.6 pmol of Met-tRNAi, eIF3 or eIF1, when used alone, supported binding of only 0.6 and 0.35 pmol of Met-tRNAi, respectively, to 40 S ribosomes. When both eIF1A and eIF3 were present in the preinitiation reaction, the binding of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits was increased to about 2.4 pmol. Surprisingly, although eIF1, by itself, did not promote significant 40 S preinitiation complex formation, its presence in the eIF1A-mediated reaction caused a marked stimulation of preinitiation complex production. About 2.9 pmol of the Met-tRNAi was bound to 40 S ribosomes under these conditions accounting for >80% of the input Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex (Fig. 1). In the presence of all three initiation factors, eIF1A, eIF1, and eIF3, Met-tRNAi was quantitatively transferred to the 40 S particle to form the 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig. 1). Omission of eIF1A from such a reaction markedly decreased the binding of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1). These results suggest that, although eIF1A is primarily responsible for transferring Met-tRNAi (as Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomes, the efficiency of this reaction is maximal in the presence of all three initiation factors. It should be noted that, in the experiments presented in Fig. 1, the binding of Met-tRNAi (present as [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits was monitored. To demonstrate that this binding corresponds to the entire ternary complex, we carried out these reactions with [3H]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·[γ-32P]GTP in lieu of [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP. Under these conditions, nearly identical molar amounts of 3H and32P were bound to 40 S ribosomes (data not shown). The above results were obtained using saturating levels of each of the three initiation factors. However, in vivo, these factors are presumably present in much lower concentrations. The stimulatory effect of eIF1 on eIF1A-promoted transfer of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomes became more pronounced when 40 S preinitiation complex formation was measured in the absence of eIF3 as a function of eIF1 and eIF1A concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2, lower concentrations of either eIF1A or eIF1, when used alone, supported the 40 S preinitiation complex production inefficiently. However, the presence of both eIF1A and eIF1 in preinitiation reactions caused a marked increase in the level of the 40 S preinitiation complex. The reactions described above were performed with isolated 40 S ribosomal subunits. However, in vivo, both 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits are present in the same milieu. Thus, to investigate stable 40 S preinitiation complex formation under more physiological conditions, i.e. in the presence of both 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex was incubated with 40 S ribosomal subunits and various combinations of eIF1A, eIF1, and eIF3 to form the 40 S preinitiation complex. The products were then treated with 60 S ribosomal subunits after raising the Mg2+ concentration to 5 mm, conditions that favor spontaneous association of the ribosomal subunits. Analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that the 40 S preinitiation complex formed with either eIF1A or eIF1 was disrupted nearly completely by 60 S ribosomal subunits, whereas the preinitiation complex formed with eIF3 alone was moderately stable (Fig.3). Furthermore, although eIF1A and eIF1 together promoted significant 40 S preinitiation complex formation, nearly 60% of the resulting complex was not stable in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 3). In contrast and in keeping with previous results from this laboratory (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar), when eIF1A and eIF3 were used to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, ∼70% of the complex was stable in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. However, when all three initiation factors were used to form the 40 S preinitiation complex, 60 S ribosomal subunits failed to destabilize the complex formed and nearly 100% of the preinitiation complex was stable (Fig.3). To determine the fate of eIF1 and eIF1A during factor-dependent formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex, we purified recombinant 3H-labeled eIF1 and35S-labeled eIF1A (“Experimental Procedures”). Experiments were carried out in which a 40 S preinitiation complex was formed by incubating [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex with 40 S ribosomal subunits and [3H]eIF1 in the presence of unlabeled eIF1A and eIF3. In a separate experiment, another 40 S preinitiation complex was formed by incubating the [3H]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex with 40 S ribosomal subunits and [35S]eIF1A in the presence of unlabeled eIF1 and eIF3. Each reaction product was then subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig.4, a fraction of labeled eIF1 (panel A) and eIF1A (panel B) co-sedimented with Met-tRNAi bound to the 40 S particle. Based on the level of radioactive eIF1 and eIF1A bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex, each of these factors was present in the 40 S preinitiation complex in a stoichiometry of ∼1:1 with respect to the bound initiator Met-tRNA (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis using anti-eIF3 antibodies also detected eIF3 in the preinitiation complex in agreement with previous results (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 C). These findings indicate that all three initiation factors, eIF3, eIF1A, and eIF1, can associate with the 40 S preinitiation complex. The requirements for the binding of eIF1 and eIF1A to the 40 S preinitiation complex were also examined using a similar assay (Fig.5). The binding of eIF1 was dependent on the simultaneous presence of eIF3. Although omission of eIF1A resulted in a moderate decrease in the binding of eIF1 relative to Met-tRNAi bound in the 40 S preinitiation complex, in the absence of eIF3 the amount of bound eIF1 was drastically reduced (Fig.5). In contrast, eIF1A, in the presence of eIF1, can bind the 40 S preinitiation complex in the absence of eIF3, although the efficiency of binding was greatly reduced as compared with the binding in the presence of eIF3. Additionally, omission of eIF1 led to a near-complete abolition of eIF1A binding to the 40 S ribosomes. These findings agree with our previous results (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar), showing that, when the 40 S preinitiation complex was formed in reactions containing eIF1A and eIF3 but lacking eIF1, eIF1A did not associate with the 40 S preinitiation complex. In the experiments described above, it was somewhat surprising that, although eIF1, in the absence of eIF3, stimulated the eIF1A-promoted transfer of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits, eIF1 was not associated with the resulting 40 S complex. Likewise, in the absence of eIF1, eIF1A was also not bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex. The possibility exists that the association of eIF1 and eIF1A to the 40 S preinitiation complex in the absence of eIF3 or eIF1, respectively, was much weaker than when all three factors were present. Because the binding analysis (Fig. 5) was carried out by sucrose gradient centrifugation, conditions known to exert considerable hydrostatic pressure on the sedimenting particles, it was likely that in the absence of eIF3 and eIF1, respectively, both eIF1 and eIF1A dissociated from the 40 S complex during the sucrose gradient centrifugation. To examine this possibility, binding analyses were also performed using gel filtration. For this purpose, the 40 S preinitiation complex was formed by incubating (a) the [35S]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex with 40 S ribosomes, [3H]eIF1, and unlabeled eIF1A and eIF3 and (b) the [3H]Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex with 40 S ribosomes, [35S]eIF1A, and unlabeled eIF1 and eIF3. Each reaction product was then subjected to Sephadex G-75 gel filtration (Fig. 6). In each case, as expected, labeled Met-tRNAi bound to the 40 S ribosomes eluted from the column in the excluded volume (data not shown). In agreement with the results obtained by sucrose gradient analysis (Fig.5), both [3H]eIF1 and [35S]eIF1A were detected in the excluded fraction (Fig. 6, A andD) consistent with their association with the 40 S preinitiation complex. In the absence of 40 S ribosomal subunits, neither radiolabeled Met-tRNAi (not shown) nor [3H]eIF1 or [35S]eIF1A was detected in the excluded material (Fig. 6, B and E). However, when the preinitiation complex was formed in the absence of eIF3, [3H]eIF1 was still detected in the excluded material, although the amount of bound [3H]eIF1 was drastically reduced in this case (Fig. 6, compare C with A). Likewise, in reactions containing [35S]eIF1A, omission of eIF1 did not abolish the binding of [35S]eIF1A. Rather, the binding was somewhat reduced (Fig. 6, compare F withD). In sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis (see Fig.5), neither eIF1 nor eIF1A was associated with the 40 S preinitiation complex under these conditions. Taken together, these results show that eIF1 and eIF1A were still associated with the 40 S preinitiation complex in the absence of either eIF3 or eIF1, respectively. However, their association was considerably weakened under these conditions, resulting in the dissociation of eIF1 and eIF1A from the 40 S preinitiation complex during sucrose gradient centrifugation (due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the sedimenting particles during the centrifugation). Several laboratories have reported that mammalian eIF3 binds to 40 S ribosomal subunits in vitro in the absence of all other initiation components and the resulting 40 S·eIF3 complex is stable to sucrose gradient centrifugation (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar, 28Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Google Scholar, 29Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 565: 305-314Google Scholar). There is also evidence that, in vivo, the majority of native 40 S ribosomal subunits contain bound eIF3 (30Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Google Scholar, 31Smith K.E. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6880-6884Google Scholar). We examined whether both eIF1 and eIF1A can also associate with free 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. Experiments were carried out in which free 40 S ribosomal subunits were incubated with either [3H]eIF1 and unlabeled eIF1A and eIF3, or with [35S]eIF1A and unlabeled eIF1 and eIF3, in the absence of Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, and the products were analyzed by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. Under these conditions, both [3H]eIF1 and [35S]eIF1A were detected in the excluded fractions (Fig. 7,A and F). In the absence of 40 S ribosomal subunits, neither 35S nor 3H radioactivity was eluted in the excluded fractions (Fig. 7, B andG). These results suggest that both eIF1 and eIF1A bind to 40 S particles in the absence of bound Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. Analysis of the requirements for the binding of eIF1 to 40 S ribosomal subunits shows that, in the absence of eIF3, binding of [3H]eIF1 was abolished almost completely (Fig. 7 D). In contrast, in reactions containing eIF3 but no eIF1A, there was still significant but reduced binding of [3H]eIF1 to 40 S ribosomes (Fig.7 C). No detectable binding of [3H]eIF1 to 40 S ribosomes was observed in the absence of both eIF1A and eIF3 (Fig.7 E). The requirements for eIF1A binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits were also examined. In this case, the binding of [35S]eIF1A was only somewhat reduced in the absence of either eIF1 (Fig.7 H) or eIF3 (Fig. 7 I). Even in the absence of both eIF1 and eIF3, low but detectable levels of eIF1A were still bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 7 J). Taken together, these results suggest that the binding of eIF1 to 40 S ribosomal subunits requires the presence of eIF3 and that, although eIF1A alone can bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits, this binding is stimulated markedly in the presence of both eIF1 and eIF3. It should be noted that when the binding analyses presented in Fig. 7 (A andF) were carried out by sucrose gradient centrifugation, no binding of either [3H]eIF1 or [35S]eIF1A was observed (data not shown). These results indicate that the association of eIF1 and eIF1A with free 40 S ribosomal subunits is relatively weak. This is also reflected by the trailing of the radioactivity of eIF1 and eIF1A in the elution profiles from gel filtrations presented in Fig. 7. To investigate whether preformed 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A complex can serve as an acceptor for the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex, we isolated 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A free of unreacted reaction components by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. Incubation of this isolated complex with Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP resulted in the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig.8). Furthermore, all three initiation factors, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3, remained bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig. 8). In the initiation of protein synthesis, the binding of the initiator Met-tRNA (as Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) to 40 S ribosomal subunits is an obligatory intermediate step in the selection of a start codon in mRNA. This binding, which occurs in the absence of mRNA, leads to the formation of the 40 S preinitiation complex. In studies presented here, we have investigated the initiation factor requirements for formation of a stable 40 S preinitiation complex using translation initiation assays that differed from those used previously (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) in that, following initiation reactions at 1 mmMg2+, subsequent analyses of 40 S preinitiation complex formation were performed at 1 mm Mg2+ rather than 5 mm Mg2+. We show that, although eIF1A and eIF3 together (in the absence of eIF1) promoted efficient formation of the stable 40 S preinitiation complex, the transfer of Met-tRNAi (as Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex) was not quantitative. Quantitative transfer of Met-tRNAi was only observed when eIF1 was also present. Under the modified conditions described here, all three factors were associated with the 40 S preinitiation complex. Furthermore, the 40 S preinitiation complex formed in the presence of all three factors was completely stable even in the presence of 60 S ribosomal subunits. It appears that, at 1 mm Mg2+, eIF1 plus eIF1A promotes the transfer of Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, and this effect of eIF1 becomes more evident when lower concentrations of the factors are used in the assays. At these lower concentrations, although eIF1A and eIF1 by themselves cannot promote transfer of Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits, the presence of both these factors leads to a marked stimulation in 40 S complex formation. However, in the absence of eIF3, eIF1 was not detected in the resulting 40 S preinitiation complex (analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation). These observations indicated that, although eIF1 can carry out its function in the absence of eIF3, the presence of eIF3 is required for the stable association of eIF1 with the 40 S preinitiation complex. These results are in agreement with the observation (14Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue T.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2307-2313Google Scholar, 32Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Google Scholar) that, in S. cerevisiae, eIF3 and eIF1 interact and are present in a multifactor complex (33Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar). Similar interaction between mammalian eIF1 and eIF3 has also been observed in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays (34Fletcher C.M. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Wagner G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2631-2637Google Scholar). In contrast to eIF1, the stable eIF1A binding to the 40 S preinitiation complex, measured by sucrose gradient centrifugation, was not observed when the complex was formed in the presence of eIF1A and eIF3. Rather, binding of eIF1A to the 40 S preinitiation complex was dependent on the presence of eIF1. This observation explains our previous results (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) that, although eIF1A, by itself or in the presence of eIF3, can promote significant 40 S preinitiation complex formation, the resulting 40 S complex did not contain eIF1A, because these assays were carried out in the absence of eIF1. The results presented in this report show that eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A can also bind to free 40 S ribosomal subunits to form the 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A complex (Fig. 7). Here again, the binding of eIF1 to free 40 S subunits appears to be dependent on the presence of eIF3. Likewise, although eIF1A, by itself, can bind weakly to 40 S ribosomal subunits, maximal binding of eIF1A requires the presence of both eIF1 and eIF3. Finally, it is important to note that the 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A complex, itself, can act as an acceptor of the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to form a stable 40 S preinitiation complex (Fig. 8). These findings suggest the possibility that the 40 S·eIF3·eIF1·eIF1A complex may act as an intermediate in the binding of the Met-tRNAi·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to the 40 S subunits to generate the 40 S preinitiation complex. Furthermore, it is possible that both eIF1 and eIF1A, like eIF3, can bind the 40 S ribosomal subunit prior to message binding. An important outcome of the present studies is the role of eIF3 and eIF1A in ribosomal subunit anti-association. Mammalian eIF3 has been reported to bind free 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of initiator Met-tRNA and other initiation factors (28Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Google Scholar) and prevent the Mg2+-dependent association between 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits to form 80 S ribosomes (29Trachsel H. Staehelin T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 565: 305-314Google Scholar, 30Thompson H.A. Sadnik I. Scheinbuks J. Moldave K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2221-2230Google Scholar, 35Goss D.J. Rounds D. Harrigan T. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1489-1494Google Scholar). We have, however, observed (20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar) that, although eIF3 binds stably to free 40 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of all other initiation components, the addition of 60 S ribosomal subunits to the 40 S·eIF3 complex resulted in the release of eIF3 from the 40 S ribosomal subunits with the concomitant formation of 80 S ribosomes. This was true even when eIF1A was included in the reaction (19Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Google Scholar, 20Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Google Scholar). These results suggested that eIF3 and eIF1A may not be directly involved in the generation of free ribosomal subunits. The results presented in this report, however, show that eIF3 does have anti-association factor activity in the context of the 40 S preinitiation reactions. In the absence of eIF3, 60 S subunits can displace the 40 S subunits present in the 40 S preinitiation complex and presumably associate with these 40 S subunits to form 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 3). The presence of eIF3 (along with eIF1A and eIF1) bound to the 40 S preinitiation complex prevents the displacement of 40 S subunits from the preinitiation complex by the 60 S subunits (Fig. 3). Thus, under these conditions, 80 S ribosomes cannot be formed.

However, data from our laboratory and others show that signals from integrins alone are sufficient for attachment and spreading but not FA formation (1Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Hook M.

Integrin signals are thought to be modulated through lateral associations within the plasma membrane with other transmembrane proteins (15Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

The direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol esters in cells spread on the cell binding domain of fibronectin also bypasses the need for full-length fibronectin in the formation of FAs and SFs (31Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V region of syndecan-4 binds PKCα and potentiates its enzymatic activity (32Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas expression of syndecan-4 truncated within its V region prevents their formation (34Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is clear that syndecan-4 plays an important role in FA and SF formation, a direct role for the molecule in cytoskeletal organization has remained elusive. Here, we present novel evidence that syndecan-4 is linked to the microfilament cytoskeleton by association with the microfilament bundling protein α-actinin. Originally characterized in muscle cells, α-actinin cross-links actin stress fibers in both muscle and non-muscle cells (36Lazarides E. Burridge K.

Polyclonal antibodies include anti-α-actinin (Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant syndecan-2 extracellular domain (47Klass C.M. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 493-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-actin antisera (48Badley R.A. Lloyd C.W. Woods A. Carruthers L. Allcock C. Rees D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 117: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in ice-cold H2O, and sonicated to form micelles. To bind PI(4,5)P2 to α-actinin, 1 μg of α-actinin was incubated with 10 μg of PI(4,5)P2 in PBS for 30 min on ice. Rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cells and human foreskin fibroblast cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Mediatech; Fisher) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals; Norcross, GA, or Summit Biotechnology, Ft. Collins, CO) in 10% CO2. Cells were used before passage 20 and were shown to be free of mycoplasma by labeling with Hoechst 33258. All cell culture equipment was from Fisher. For immunostaining, cells were seeded onto 12-mm-diameter coverslips; for extractions and immunoprecipitations, cells were cultured in 25-, 75-, or 150-cm2 culture flasks. For some experiments, cells were allowed to adhere to substrates coated with fibronectin (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) at either 100 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature or 50 μg/ml for 2–3 h in serum-free medium. No differences were seen in the results between the two coating concentrations. Confluent cells (for immunoblotting) or 50–75% confluent (for immunocytochemistry) were extracted for 20 min at 37 °C in extraction buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (TX100) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 100 mm ε-amino caproic acid, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (49Woods A. Couchman J.R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10872-10879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After extraction, detergent-resistant fractions were washed three times with PBS. Some cells were treated with 200 nm PMA for 15 min at 37 °C as indicated in the figures. PMA was diluted into medium from 4 mm stocks in Me2SO. Control cells were treated with Me2SO alone. For staining with 150.9 antibody against syndecan-4, cells were fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 20 min and blocked with 2% whole goat serum (ICN/Cappel; Aurora, OH) for 45 min. Cells stained with all other antibodies were fixed for 10 min at 37 °C with 3.5% paraformaldehyde. Nonextracted cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) after fixation. Primary antibodies were incubated with fixed cells (1:50 in PBS) for 45 min at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated goat-anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:50, Organon Tekenika Corp., Durham, NC) were added for 45 min at 37 °C. Preparations were examined on a Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and images were recorded on Ilford HP-5 film. Co-localization studies were performed using a combination of 150.9 and rabbit anti-α-actinin. Co-localization was analyzed on a Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence, and digital images were captured with a Vario-Orthomat II (High Resolution Imaging Facility, University of Alabama at Birmingham). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed on confluent monolayers of REFs (∼107cells/immunoprecipitation). Cells were scraped into lysis buffer containing 1% TX100 and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine in PBS, incubated on ice for 30 min, then cleared by centrifugation (1000 × g). Before immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1:5000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by protein-A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) preblocked in 10% fetal bovine serum to pre-clear the lysate. Immunoprecipitations were performed by sequentially incubating lysates with primary antibody followed by rabbit-anti-mouse antibodies and fresh preblocked protein-A-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed 4 times in lysis buffer, once with 1 m NaCl, and 3 times with PBS. Some cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 1% TX100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.2% SDS. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To identify proteins resistant to TX100 extraction, extracted cells were scraped into SDS sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 100 V. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS by incubating at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with 1% milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 for 150.9, 1:1000 for anti-α-actinin, anti-paxillin, anti-PKCα, anti-talin, and anti-vinculin, and 1:500 for anti-PI(4,5)P2) in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing for 3 × 5 min, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxide-conjugated goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) at 1:3000 dilution. Detection was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Binding studies with synthetic peptides (Synpep, Dublin, CA) coupled to Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) were performed in 1 ml of REF cells lysed in 1% TX100 immunoprecipitation lysis buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding assays using 0.5 μg of chicken gizzard α-actinin (Sigma) were performed at room temperature in 0.01% TX100 in PBS. Bound material was eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. In competition experiments, V region peptides (50Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) were added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to cells immediately after lysis and were present throughout. Syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 are involved in cell-ECM communication; syndecan-2 modulates the assembly of the ECM (47Klass C.M. Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 493-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and syndecan-4 regulates FA and SF formation (19Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Echtermeyer F. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Ge Y. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When REF cells are examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, syndecan-2 labeling revealed a punctate pattern on the cell body (Fig.1 A). In contrast, syndecan-4 staining is restricted to FAs and the membrane overlying SFs (Fig.1 B). The amount of labeling over stress fibers is variable, dependent on cell type, and also dependent on whether the syndecan-4 antibody is directed against the cytoplasmic domain (29Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or the extracellular domain (19Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Yung S. Woods A. Chan T.M. Davies M. Williams J.D. Couchman J.R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1631-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 also show differential susceptibility to TX100 extraction. After TX100 extraction of live cells, syndecan-2 labeling is lost (Fig. 1 C), but most syndecan-4 remains (Fig. 1 D). These results confirm that syndecan-4 resides in the TX100-resistant cytoskeleton and matrix residue, whereas syndecan-2 does not. Because syndecan-4 is resistant to TX100 extraction, we attempted to determine whether the FA proteins α-actinin, paxillin, talin, and vinculin were also resistant. α-Actinin staining decorates FAs and SFs (Fig.2 A), whereas paxillin (Fig.2 C), talin (Fig. 2 E), and vinculin (Fig.2 G) staining is localized exclusively to FAs. After TX100 treatment, most α-actinin labeling remains (Fig. 2 B), but paxillin (Fig. 2 D), talin (Fig. 2 F), and vinculin (Fig. 2 H) does not. These results were confirmed by immunoblotting the TX100-resistant fractions (data not shown). These data suggest that syndecan-4 and α-actinin share a similar subcellular localization within the cell. To verify this, we employed double labeling and immunofluorescence microscopy. Antibodies directed against α-actinin (Fig.3 A) and syndecan-4 (Fig.3 B) label FAs and SFs in nonextracted cells, and the merged image (Fig. 3 C) shows co-localization of the two molecules. Triton X-100 extraction decreases FA staining of α-actinin (Fig.3 D) and syndecan-4 (Fig. 3 E), although syndecan-4 and α-actinin labeling remains colinear with SFs. The merged image (Fig. 3 F) confirms preserved co-localization after detergent treatment. To test whether α-actinin and syndecan-4 interact, we immunoprecipitated syndecan-4 and α-actinin from cells and examined the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting. We first analyzed syndecan-4 immunoprecipitates with antibodies against paxillin (Fig.4 A), since an indirect association between syndecan-4 and paxillin through syndesmos has been demonstrated (52Denhez F. Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S. French B. Neveu W. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12270-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the presence of TX100, paxillin co-immunoprecipitates with syndecan-4. However, when RIPA buffer is used to lyse the cells, paxillin is no longer detected in syndecan-4 immunocomplexes. Syndecan-4 immunoprecipitates were also analyzed for α-actinin and vinculin (Fig. 4 B). In both Triton and RIPA buffers, α-actinin co-immunoprecipitates with syndecan-4, whereas vinculin does not. To corroborate the association with syndecan-4, α-actinin immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blotting with syndecan-4 antibodies (Fig. 4 C). Syndecan-4 co-immunoprecipitated with α-actinin in either TX100 or RIPA buffers.Figure 4Syndecan-4 and α-actinin co-immunoprecipitate. The detergent present in the lysis buffer as well as whether each lane is a sample of beads used to pre-clear (PC) or immunoprecipitate (IP) is listed above each blot (WB).A, paxillin co-immunoprecipitates with syndecan-4 in TX100 but not RIPA buffer.

https://openalex.org/W1996320892,"PDZ domains bind to short segments within target proteins in a sequence-specific fashion. Glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP)/ABP family proteins contain six to seven PDZ domains and interact via the sixth PDZ domain (class II) with the C termini of various proteins including liprin-α. In addition the PDZ456 domain mediates the formation of homo- and heteromultimers of GRIP proteins. To better understand the structural basis of peptide recognition by a class II PDZ domain and PDZ-mediated multimerization, we determined the crystal structures of the GRIP1 PDZ6 domain alone and in complex with a synthetic C-terminal octapeptide of human liprin-α at resolutions of 1.5 and 1.8 Å, respectively. Remarkably, unlike other class II PDZ domains, Ile-736 at αB5 rather than conserved Leu-732 at αB1 makes a direct hydrophobic contact with the side chain of the Tyr at the −2 position of the ligand. Moreover, the peptide-bound structure of PDZ6 shows a slight reorientation of helix αB, indicating that the second hydrophobic pocket undergoes a conformational adaptation to accommodate the bulkiness of the Tyr side chain, and forms an antiparallel dimer through an interface located at a site distal to the peptide-binding groove. This configuration may enable formation of GRIP multimers and efficient clustering of GRIP-binding proteins. PDZ domains bind to short segments within target proteins in a sequence-specific fashion. Glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP)/ABP family proteins contain six to seven PDZ domains and interact via the sixth PDZ domain (class II) with the C termini of various proteins including liprin-α. In addition the PDZ456 domain mediates the formation of homo- and heteromultimers of GRIP proteins.

Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Google Scholar). One of the most abundant molecular recognition elements, these globular domains each contain two α-helices and six β-strands. They usually bind selectively to the C terminus or a short internal segment of interacting proteins (1Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Google Scholar) and are categorized into four classes according to their specificity for the C-terminal target sequences (2Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Google Scholar). Class I PDZ domains bind to a C-terminal motif with the sequence X-Ser/Thr-X-Val/Leu-COOH, whereX represents any residue, while class II PDZ domains preferX-Φ-X-Φ-COOH, where Φ is usually a large hydrophobic residue. Both class I and II domains have a preference for a hydrophobic residue at the 0 position of the ligand. Class III PDZ domains prefer the sequenceX-Asp-X-Val-COOH in which a negatively charged amino acid is at the −2 position (3Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Google Scholar), while class IV domains prefer the sequence X-Ψ-Asp/Glu-COOH in which an acidic residue is at the C-terminal position and where Ψ represents an aromatic residue (4Vaccaro P. Brannetti B. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Philipp S. Citterrich M.H. Cesareni G. Dente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42122-42130Google Scholar). In addition, there are other classes of PDZ domains that do not fall into any of the aforementioned classes (5Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Google Scholar, 6Borrell-Pages M. Fernandez-Larrea J. Borroto A. Rojo F. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4217-4225Google Scholar), and there are minor discrepancies in the proposed classifications of PDZ domains (7Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 457-462Google Scholar, 8Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Google Scholar). Members of the GRIP1 family proteins (GRIP1 and GRIP2/ABP) contain six to seven PDZ domains (9Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S. Abagyan R.

GRIP PDZ45, which is classified as a class II PDZ domain (1Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Google Scholar), binds to the C terminus of the GluR2/3 subunit of AMPA glutamate receptors (9Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B. Daly C. DeSouza S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Google Scholar), while GRIP PDZ6, also a class II PDZ domain, interacts with the C terminus of ephrin-B1 ligand and EphB2/EphA7 receptor tyrosine kinases (13Bruckner K. Pablo Labrador J. Scheiffele P. Herb A. Seeburg P.H. Klein R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 511-524Google Scholar, 14Lin D. Gish G.D. Songyang Z. Pawson T. J. Biol.

GRIP PDZ6 also interacts with the C terminus of the liprin-α family of multidomain proteins (16Wyszynski M. Kim E. Dunah A.W. Passafaro M. Valtschanoff J.G. Serra-Pages C. Streuli M. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 39-52Google Scholar), which interact with the leukocyte antigen-related protein family of receptor tyrosine phosphatases (17Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Google Scholar, 18Serra-Pages C. Medley Q.G. Tang M. Hart A. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15611-15620Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PDZ456 region also reportedly mediates homo- and heteromultimerization of GRIPs (11Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Google Scholar), suggesting that the PDZ domain is a module mediating multimerization as well as peptide recognition. The first reported crystal structure of a class II PDZ domain (from hCASK) revealed the presence of a second hydrophobic pocket not seen in class I PDZ domain (19Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Google Scholar). In addition, this study showed that hCASK PDZ forms a homotetramer by binding to the truncated C-terminal tail of a neighboring PDZ domain that partially mimics the specific peptide ligand, though the self-associated structure does not faithfully represent the actual binding mode of class II PDZ domains due to differences in the amino acid sequences of the true target peptides and the truncated C-terminal tail (19Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Google Scholar). Another structure of a class II PDZ domain in InaD revealed its association with the −1 position of the ligand via a distinctive intermolecular disulfide bond (20Kimple M.E. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4414-4422Google Scholar), which is not a canonical non-covalent peptide-PDZ interaction. To better understand the structural basis of peptide recognition by class II PDZ domains and the mechanisms underlying PDZ-mediated GRIP multimerization, we determined the crystal structures of the GRIP1 PDZ6 domain alone and in complex with a synthetic C-terminal octapeptide of liprin-α1 at resolutions of 1.8 and 1.5 Å, respectively. This is the first description of the crystal structure of a class II PDZ domain non-covalently complexed with its specific peptide ligand, showing an additional role of PDZ domains in the multimerization of PDZ-containing proteins. Recombinant GRIP1 PDZ6 (residues 665–761) from Rattus novergicus with a cleavable glutathione S-transferase tag was expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, cleaved, purified, and crystallized as previously described (21Park S.H. Im Y.J. Rho S.H. Lee J.H. Yang S. Kim E. Eom S.H. Acta Cryst. D. 2002; 58: 1063-1065Google Scholar). The C-terminal octapeptide (ATVRTYSC) of the human liprin-α1 used for PDZ-peptide cocrystallization was chemically synthesized. The mutants Y671D and R718D were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the plasmid carrying theGRIP-PDZ6 gene using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Invitrogen. The expression and purification of the mutants were done by same procedures with the wild type protein. A native data set was collected from a peptide-free frozen crystal to 1.5 Å resolution using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at beamline X8C in the National Synchrotron Light Source. Since bromine is a convenient anomalous scatterer for MAD phasing, a bromine MAD data set was collected from a single crystal soaked for 30 s in cryoprotection solution containing 1m NaBr (22Dauter Z. Dauter M. Rajashankar K.R. Acta Cryst. D. 2000; 56: 232-237Google Scholar). A data set was collected from a PDZ-peptide complex to 1.8 Å Bragg spacing using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at beamline BL-18B at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The structure of the peptide-free PDZ6 domain was determined by MAD using bromine as an anomalous scatterer. The positions of three bromines in the asymmetric unit were located and refined using the program SOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Cryst. D. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Google Scholar). The initial phases (overall figure of merit, 0.51) were improved by solvent flattening using the program DM (24Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Cryst. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The resultant map was readily interpretable, and model building proceeded using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Cryst. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), after which the initial model was refined using the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). When the crystallographic R value for the model was 28.3%, the coordinates were used in the refinement procedures against the 1.5-Å native data set. The final crystallographic R value for the peptide-free PDZ6 model using data from 15 to 1.5 Å was 25.4% (R free = 27.8%). The structure of the PDZ6-octapeptide complex was determined using standard molecular replacement methods using the structure of peptide-free PDZ6 as a starting model. There were two PDZ6 domains related by NCS in the asymmetric unit. After applying a simulated annealing procedure using data to 1.8 Å, the location of the two bound peptides was determined from a fo − fc difference electron density map. Densities of all eight residues of the peptide were obvious, indicating they were well ordered within the structure. The octapeptide was modeled using the program O, and the peptide-bound PDZ6 domain was refined to a final crystallographic R value of 20.0% and a free R value of 22.2%. The refined model of the peptide-bound PDZ6 domain consisted of a PDZ domain dimer (Ala-668-Gln-753) related by 2-fold NCS, two octapeptides, and 240 water molecules. Because of disorder, the N-terminal three and C-terminal eight residues were not modeled. The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed with PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar); no residues were found in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in TableI. The coordinates and structure factors of PDZ6 and peptide-PDZ6 complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1N7E and 1N7F, respectively.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData setPeptide-free (Br-MAD)aDerivatized by soaking in the reservoir solution containing 1 m NaBr for 30 s.Peptide-freeComplexCrystal formP6522P6522R32X-ray sourceNSLS X8CNSLS X8CPF18BWavelengthλ 1 0.9202λ 2 0.9192λ 3 0.9000.9001.000Resolution (Å)34.5–1.934.5–1.934.5–1.915–1.515–1.8R symbR sym = Σ ‖ 〈I〉 − I ‖ /Σ 〈I〉.(%)5.5 (17.4)5.3 (17.9)5.3 (13.8)4.5 (36.0)8.8 (56.6)Data coverage total/final shell (%)98.8/89.199.0/91.999.7/98.798.3/93.399.6/97.3Phasing (34.5–1.9 Å)0.52 (SOLVE)Overall figure of merit refinementResolution (Å)15–1.515–1.8R crystcR cryst = Σ ‖ ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ ‖ /Σ‖F o‖. total (%)25.420.1R freedR free calculated with 10% of all reflections excluded from refinement stages using high resolution data.total (%)27.822.2R.m.s. bond length (Å)1.201.26R.m.s. bond angle (°)0.0050.005Average B vale (Å2)25.229.4a Derivatized by soaking in the reservoir solution containing 1 m NaBr for 30 s.b R sym = Σ ‖ 〈I〉 − I ‖ /Σ 〈I〉.c R cryst = Σ ‖ ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ ‖ /Σ‖F o‖.d R free calculated with 10% of all reflections excluded from refinement stages using high resolution data. Open table in a new tab GRIP1 PDZ6 is a compact, globular domain containing eight segments of secondary structure: six β-strands that form an antiparallel β-barrel and two α-helices (Fig. 1 A). Within the crystal structure of the PDZ6-peptide complex, all eight amino acid residues of the peptide ligand were well defined, as shown by the difference electron density map calculated without inclusion of the peptide (Fig. 1 B), and the strong electron density indicates that the octapeptide was highly ordered. As is typical of most PDZ complexes, the ligand was positioned in the groove between the βB strand and the αB helix, oriented anti-parallel to βB as an additional strand. In addition, the carboxylate-binding loop contained a PLGI sequence (residues 681–684), often referred to as the “GLGF motif.” GRIP1 PDZ6 binds to the liprin-α C-terminal TYSC sequence (X-Φ-X-Φ-COOH) via a class II hydrophobic PDZ interaction; it contains two hydrophobic pockets that can accommodate bulky hydrophobic residues at the 0 and −2 positions of the ligand. In the peptide-bound state, PDZ6 domain forms an antiparallel dimer in an asymmetric unit of the crystallized complex, whereas peptide-free PDZ6 forms a similar dimer through a crystallographic 2-fold axis in its crystal. As was seen in the crystal structures of the hCASK and NHERF PDZ domains, the peptide binding pocket of peptide-free PDZ6 is occupied by the C-terminal end (PASS-COOH) of a neighboring molecule mimicking the recognition of the peptide ligand (19Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Google Scholar, 28Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Google Scholar). Superposition of the crystal structures of the peptide-free and peptide-bound PDZ6 domains shows a slight shift in the αB helix, which widens the peptide binding pocket and enables accommodation of the bulky side chain of tyrosine from the ligand. The free and peptide-bound structures of the PDZ6 domain showed an α-carbon root-mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.1 Å when the six structurally conserved β-strands were used for the superposition. With an r.m.s.d. of 1.57 Å for the residues spanning positions 732–742, helix αB showed the highest structural variance among secondary elements. Because the amino acid sequence of the rat GRIP1 PDZ6 domain used in this study is identical to human GRIP1 PDZ6, we used a synthetic octapeptide (ATVRTYSC) that mimics the C terminus of human liprin-α1 as a ligand. The last five residues of liprin-α are identical among known isoforms, and the residues at the 0 and −2 positions are well conserved as compared with those from other known PDZ6 binding partners, e.g. EphB2 receptor (Fig. 2 B). The C terminus of the ligand binds as an additional strand to the anti-parallel β-sheet of the PDZ domain and makes hydrophobic contacts with helix αB, while the peptide backbone of the C-terminal four residues is anchored to strand βB by hydrogen bonds. Despite variations in the sequences of many PDZ domains, their carboxylate-binding loops are highly conserved in terms of overall structure and the hydrogen-bonding pattern to the ligand carboxylate group. The C-terminal carboxylate group of our octapeptide formed hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide groups of Leu-682, Gly-683, and Ile-684 in the carboxylate-binding loop, and was within hydrogen-bonding distance of two fully occupied water molecules (Fig.3 A). The amino acid residues at ligand positions 0 and −2 are key to the specific recognition by the PDZ domain. The side chain of Cys-0 is situated at the center of the first hydrophobic cavity, which is composed of Leu-682, Ile-684, Ile-686, and Leu-739 (Fig. 3 B) and is of sufficient size to accommodate various hydrophobic side chains ranging from those of Ala to Phe, but not hydrophilic residues. The second hydrophobic pocket, which accommodates the Tyr residue at ligand position −2, is composed of Ile-686 from the βB strand and Ile-736 and Ile-739 from helix αB. Within the structures of previously described class I and class II PDZ domains, the residue at ligand position −2 usually binds to the side chain of a residue located at the N-terminal end of helix αB (position αB1) of the PDZ (7Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 457-462Google Scholar, 29Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Google Scholar). In class I PDZ domains, serine or threonine at the −2 position forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of a polar residue at the start of the αB helix. In class II PDZ domains, the corresponding residue at the αB1 position is highly conserved (mostly hydrophobic) and considered to be critical for determining the specificity of ligand binding. In hCASK PDZ, for example, Val at αB1 recognizes the residue at ligand position −2 (19Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Google Scholar). Another known class II PDZ domain, the crystal structure of InaD, showed that the Cβ and Cγ atoms of Glu at αB1 take part in the hydrophobic interactions with Phe at the ligand −2 position (20Kimple M.E. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4414-4422Google Scholar). Within the structure of the GRIP1 PDZ6-peptide complex, by contrast, the side chain of Tyr-2 did not make a direct contact with the conserved Leu-732 at αB1. Instead, the Tyr aromatic ring was oriented toward the first hydrophobic cavity and stacked with the side chain of Ile-736 located at second turn of the helix αB (position αB5). Still, Leu-732 appeared to indirectly contribute to the ligand binding by offering the hydrophobic environment necessary accommodate a bulky hydrophobic residue at ligand position −2. This finding suggests a novel mode of peptide recognition in which a hydrophobic residue at the αB5 position can supersede the role of the conserved hydrophobic residue at the αB1 position in class II PDZ domains. Interestingly, superposition of peptide-free and peptide-bound structures showed that a slight reorientation of the αB helix occurs to accommodate the side chain of Tyr-2 (Fig. 3 C). The B-factor plots of the structures showed helix αB to have the highest B values among the secondary structure elements in both the peptide-free and peptide-bound structures. Gly-743, which is located in the βF-αB loop, adjacent to Ala-742 in the C-terminal end of helix αB, exhibited the largest positional shift upon peptide binding. The resultant shift in the C-terminal end of helix αB enlarged the second hydrophobic pocket, suggesting that Gly-743 plays a key role in the conformational adaptation of helix αB by providing geometrical freedom to the preceding residues. In addition, a positional shift of 1.25 Å in the Cβ atom of Leu-736 at αB5, which interacts with ligand Tyr-2 likely avoids steric hindrance due to the bulkiness of the Tyr side chain (Fig. 3 D). Supporting this view, the four peptide backbone positions of the ligand PASS-COOH in the self-associated structure and TYSC in the PDZ-peptide complex were identical in both structures; however, there was a positional difference of 1.25 Å in the Cβ atom of Leu-736, which interacts with Tyr-2, due to the difference of the bulkiness of the side chain at that position (Fig. 3 D). Thus, the shift of helix αB is determined by the difference in the size of the residue at ligand position −2. This structural flexibility may explain the ability of GRIP1 PDZ6 to bind various target peptides with different hydrophobic amino acids at the −2 position (Fig. 2 B). Within the structure of the PDZ6-peptide complex, ligand residues at the −1 and −3 positions also appear to contribute to its recognition. Ser-1 hydrogen bonds with Thr-685 in the βB strand in one protomer of the dimer, while Thr-3 hydrogen bonds with Ser-687 in the other protomer. The residues at the −3 position of known PDZ6 ligands are highly conserved and all contain hydroxyl groups (Fig. 2 B), implying direct contribution to the specificity and affinity for the GRIP1 PDZ6 domain. The side chain of Arg at ligand position −4 also participates in water-mediated hydrogen bonding with Glu-690 at the terminus of the βB strand. Although there is no conserved pattern of interaction at the −1, −3, and −4 positions among PDZ domains, it likely fine tunes the specificity of PDZ-ligand recognition. PDZ domain-mediated multimerization is a common feature for a number of PDZ domain proteins. Such multimerization of Drosophila InaD, which is mediated by its PDZ3 or PDZ4 domain, does not disturb the binding of target proteins (30Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Google Scholar) nor does oligomerization of NHERF/EBP50, which is mediated by its two PDZ domains (31Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these studies provide no structural evidence for the mechanism of multimerization or why it does not affect ligand binding. At present, the structures of InaD PDZ3 or PDZ4 remain unknown, and the crystal structures of the NHERF PDZ1 domains provide no clues (28Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Google Scholar, 29Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19683-19686Google Scholar). GRIP/ABP proteins reportedly form homo- or heteromultimers through their PDZ456 domains (11Dong H. Zhang P. Song I. Petralia R.S. Liao D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6930-6941Google Scholar). Although it is not known how these three PDZ domains mediate multimer formation, our preliminary results from size exclusion chromatography, and dynamic light-scattering experiments indicate that GRIP1 PDZ6 forms a dimer whether free or complexed, which suggests that GRIP1 PDZ6, itself, has the ability to mediate dimer formation. Consistent with that idea, the crystal structure of peptide-bound GRIP1 PDZ6 showed formation of a tightly associated PDZ6 dimer related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4 A). The dimeric interface between the two PDZ domains involves a βA strand and an αA-βD loop from each protomer; the βA strands form anti-parallel β-sheets around the center of the 2-fold axis, with the N and C termini of each PDZ domain pointing in opposite directions. The peptide binding pockets were located at the distal sides of the dimeric interface, situated in anti-parallel fashion, which enabled spatially independent binding of target ligands. This dimeric interaction was supported by six hydrogen bonds between the two anti-parallel βA strands and hydrophobic forces between non-polar atoms in the interface. The amount of surface area buried upon dimer formation is 619.0 Å2, or 12.3% of the total surface area of each monomer. Such independent target binding by PDZ multimers was also detected with InaD and NHERF proteins using biochemical analyses (30Xu X.Z. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Google Scholar, 31Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Google Scholar). In the peptide-free crystal structure with the space group P6522, there was one molecule in the asymmetric unit. However, the same dimeric interaction described above was observed via a crystallographic 2-fold axis. It is possible that the dimer in the solution can arrange into a crystallographic symmetry axis in a different crystallographic environment because it shows little difference of the r.m.s.d. for all Cα atoms (0.6 Å) between the two protomers in the asymmetric unit of a peptide-bound crystal. Another intermolecular interaction with a symmetry-related molecule in the peptide-free crystal structure is the association through C-terminal exchange into the ligand binding pockets between two monomers (Fig.4 B). In this case C termini serve as ligands for neighboring PDZ molecules, which is reminiscent of the crystal structures of NHERF PDZ1 and hCASK PDZ domains (19Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Google Scholar, 28Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the PDZ6 construct (PASS-COOH) differs from the usual class II PDZ target peptides (X-Phe/Tyr-X-Phe/Val/Ala-COOH). The backbone atoms of the C-terminal four residues of the neighboring molecule, located in the ligand-binding groove, shows little positional difference from the location C-terminal octapeptide of liprin-α1 complexed with the PDZ6. Apparently, hydrophobic pockets of GRIP1 PDZ6 accommodated smaller hydrophobic residues or the residues that partly mimic a hydrophobic moiety. Most likely, the self-association observed in the peptide-free crystal structure is not dimeric interaction but molecular packing interaction within the crystal lattice. Consistent with this idea, a PDZ6 construct in which the last seven residues (residues 665–754 lacking DAQPASS) were deleted still formed a dimer in solution identified by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). To further confirm the presence of PDZ6 dimer in solution, which is shown in Fig. 4 A, we did mutational analysis on the residues at the dimeric interface and measured the molecular weights of the mutants and wild type PDZ domains in solution using size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4). The Y671D mutant, which was expected to disrupt the hydrophobic interaction in the dimeric interface, was eluted as a monomer, while the wild type PDZ6 was a dimer in solution (Fig. 4 C). It indicates that Tyr-671 is located at the dimeric interface and plays an important role in hydrophobic interaction of the interface. However, the disruption of salt-bridge by the mutation R718D on the residue participating in self-association of the domains in the crystalline state did not affect the oligomeric state of the PDZ domains. These results together with the dimerization of peptide-bound PDZ6 in both the crystalline state and in solution strongly suggests that the dimeric structure of PDZ6 shown in Fig.4 A is representative of dimeric PDZ6 in vivo. We therefore propose that the GRIP PDZ6 domain plays a crucial role in heteromultimerization of GRIPs. GRIP2, a homolog of GRIP1, has 58% overall amino acid sequence identity with GRIP1, and the two isoforms share 84% identity in the region containing the PDZ456 domains and 91% identity (95% similarity) in the PDZ6 domain. Notably, the residues in the region of the dimeric interface (βA strand and αA-βD loop) are identical except for one conserved change (Ile-669 in GRIP1 and Val-655 in GRIP2) (Fig. 4 C). Collectively, these findings indicate that GRIP PDZ6 dimers use the same dimeric interface for both homo- and heterodimerization. In summary, we observed a novel mode of peptide recognition by the class II GRIP PDZ6 domain. Ile-736 at the αB5 position was involved in specific recognition of the ligand, and the conformational adaptation of the αB helix induced by ligand binding accommodated the hydrophobic moiety at ligand position −2. In addition, the dimeric PDZ6 structure described in this study is the first example of a functional role of PDZ domains in multimerization. Formation of antiparallel PDZ6 domain dimers is mediated by an interface located at a site distinct from the peptide-binding groove, resulting in independent target binding by the PDZ multimer. This mechanism could enable efficient clustering of various target proteins though multimerization of GRIP proteins. We thank Professor N. Sakabe and Drs. M. Suzuki and N.

https://openalex.org/W1999600672,"Abstract NDR1 (nuclearDbf2-related) is a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to subfamily of kinases implicated in the regulation of cell division and morphology. Previously, we demonstrated that the activity of NDR1 is controlled by phosphorylation of two regulatory residues, Ser-281 and Thr-444. Moreover, we found that NDR1 becomes activated through a direct interaction with EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins of the S100 family. In this work, we characterize this regulatory mechanism in detail. We found that NDR1 autophosphorylates in vitro predominantly on Ser-281 and to a lesser extent on Thr-74 and Thr-444. All of these residues proved to be crucial also for NDR1 activity in vivo; however, in contrast to Ser-281 and Thr-444, Thr-74 seems to be involved only in binding to S100B rather than directly regulating NDR1 activity per se. When we added Ca2+/S100B, we observed an increased autophosphorylation on Ser-281 and Thr-444, resulting in stimulation of NDR1 activity in vitro. Using phosphospecific antibodies, we found that Ser-281 also becomes autophosphorylated in vivo, whereas Thr-444 is targeted predominantly by an as yet unidentified upstream kinase. Significantly, the Ca2+-chelating agent BAPTA-AM suppressed the activity and phosphorylation of NDR1 on both Ser-281 and Thr-444, and specifically, these effects were reversed when we added the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump inhibitor thapsigargin."

TR belongs to a class of nuclear receptors that includes the retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), vitamin D receptor, and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar). TR isoforms, TRα and TRβ, are encoded by two separate genes (3Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Google Scholar). Generally, TR binds as a heterodimer with RXR and regulates transcription by binding to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) located in the promoters of target genes. The T3 stimulation of gene expression involves the interaction of TR with other transcription factors bound to the promoter as well as the recruitment of coactivators such as SRC-1/p160, CBP/p300, and TRAP220/DRIP205/PBP to the liganded receptor (3Zhang J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). CPT-I, which is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, transfers the fatty-acyl moiety from acyl-CoA to carnitine (5Indiveri C. Iacobazzi V. Giangregorio N. Palmier F. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 713-719Google Scholar). The acylcarnitine is transported across the mitochondrial inner membrane by carnitine acylcarnitine translocase and re-esterified to acyl-CoA by CPT-II (4McGarry J.D. Evans N.F. Eur. J.

Two isoforms of CPT-I have been identified: the “liver” isoform (CPT-Iα) and the “muscle” isoform (CPT-Iβ). We have shown that expression of the CPT-Iα gene in the liver is elevated in hyperthyroidism, fasting, and diabetes (6Mynatt R.L. Park E.A. Thorngate F.E. Das H.K. Cook G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 932-937Google Scholar). The α-isoform is induced in the hearts of fasted or diabetic rats. However, CPT-Iα gene expression is increased far more in the liver than in the heart of hyperthyroid animals (8Cook G.A. Edwards T.L. Jansen M.S. Bahouth S.W. Wilcox H. Park E.A. J. Mol. Cell.

The transcriptional start site of the CPT-Iα gene is denoted +1, and the 5′-flanking DNA has been analyzed to nucleotide −6839. Exon 1 contains nucleotides +1 through +27, and exon 2 begins at nucleotide +1201. The CPT-Iα TRE consists of a direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4) (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). The TRE is located in the promoter of the CPT-Iα gene between nucleotides −2938 and −2923. Mutation of this DR4 motif results in the complete loss of T3 responsiveness (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar, 12Barrero M.J. Marrero P.F. Haro D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 279: 81-88Google Scholar). Interestingly, the first intron of the CPT-Iα gene is also necessary for full T3 induction (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). Removal of the first intron reduces the T3 induction by 80%. Induction of CPT-Iα-luciferase by T3 is more robust in HepG2 hepatoma cells compared with L6 myoblasts and cardiac myocytes. The first intron is required for the induction in transfected HepG2 hepatoma cells and not in L6 myoblasts and cardiac myocytes, suggesting that the intron contributes to the enhanced T3 induction in the liver (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to examine more extensively the role of the first intron in liver-specific T3 induction of CPT-Iα. We identified regions within the first intron that are necessary to achieve the full T3 induction. Elements within these regions bind proteins that participate in the T3 response, including CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) and upstream stimulatory factor (USF-1 and USF-2). TR physically interacts with USF-1, USF-2, and C/EBPα. Our data suggest that C/EBP is responsible for the liver-specific component of the induction of CPT-Iα by thyroid hormone. Our findings show that the TR in the promoter and C/EBP and USF bound in the first intron comprise a T3 response unit that mediates the liver-selective T3 induction of CPT-Iα. CPT-Iα probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays were created by labeling double-stranded oligonucleotides using Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. The oligonucleotides contained sequences from the first intron and XbaI or MluI overhangs. Double-stranded unlabeled wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides were used as competitors (See Table I for oligomer sequences). Rat liver nuclear extract was prepared as described (13Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Google Scholar). The protein-DNA binding mixtures contained labeled probe (30,000 cpm) and proteins isolated from rat liver nuclei in 80 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). Poly(deoxyinosine-deoxycytidine) (double-stranded homopolymer) was added to each binding reaction as a nonspecific competitor. Antibodies for TRα/β, USF-1, USF-2, Sp1, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, Oct-1, COUP-TF, and CREB (Santa Cruz) were added to binding reactions for supershift assays. Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and resolved on 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gels (80:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in Tris-glycine running buffer (22 mm Tris and 190 mm glycine). Electrophoresis was carried out at 180 volts for 80 min at 4 °C (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the intron for potential transcription factor binding sites was performed using the TESS transcription factor search.Table IOligomers used in electrophoretic mobility shift assaysCPT-Iα regionOligomer sequence+653/+682 WTCTAGAAAGGGCCAGGTGGGTGTCCAGAGACTTGCT+653/+682 Mut #1CTAGAAAGGGCGCTAGCGGTGTCCAGAGACTTGCT+653/+682 Mut #2CTAGAAAGGGCCAGGTGGGTGTCCAGAAGATCTCT+674/+707 WTCTAGACTTGCTCAAGGTCGCGCTGGGACCAGAGCCCT+674/+707 Mut #3CTAGAGCTAGCCAAGGTCGCGCTGGGACCAGAGCCCT+674/+707 Mut #4CTAGACTTGCTCGCTAGCGCGCTGGGACCAGAGCCCT+674/+707 Mut #5CTAGATAATTTTAAGGTCGCGCTGGGACCAGAGCCCT+674/+707 Mut #6CTAGACTTGCTCTTTTATGCGCTGGGACCAGAGCCCT+674/+707 Mut #7CTAGACTTGCTCAAGGTCGCGCTGGGTTTTTTTCCCT+701/+744 WTCTAGAGCCCGGGAGGGTGGGGGTGTCACGTGACCCGGCCTGAGTGAT+824/842 WTCGCGTCTGGCTTTCGTTGATGTCACAGAACAOligomers corresponding to sequences within the +628/+707 region were constructed as listed for electromobility shift assays.

Regions of the CPT-Iα promoter and intron 1 were ligated into the pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega). Construction of −4495/+19 CPT-Iα-Luc, −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc, and ΔSma −4495/+1240 has been described previously (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). Internal deletions within intron 1 were constructed by digesting −1653/+1240-Luc at +199 and +707 with SmaI, followed by ligation of PCR products that contained a SmaI restriction site at each end and decreasing lengths of intron 1 sequence. The forward primer corresponded to nucleotides −16/+6 (TCGGACTCAGCTCGCTCATTCCG). The reverse primers corresponded to nucleotides +282/+309 (5′-CACCCGGGGTTTTGGGGTCCTCATTACC-3′), +431/+459 (5′-CTTTTCCCGGGTCTTTCCATTCGCCATCC-3′), +680/+655 (5′-CAGTCCCGGGACACCCACCTGGCC-3′), and +700/+677 (5′-GGTCCCGGGGCGACCTTGAGCAG-3′). PCR products were ligated into pCR-4-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). PCR products were removed from pCR-4-TOPO by digestion with SmaI. The CPT-Iα intron fragments were gel-purified and ligated into the SmaI sites within intron 1 in the −1653/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector. These deletion constructs and −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase were digested with EcoRI and BglII, which cleaves at −1653 and at the 3′-end of CPT-Iα in the multicloning site of the luciferase vectors. Finally, the −1653/+1240 fragment containing a deletion was ligated into the EcoRI and BglII sites within −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase. Serial deletions from the 3′-end of intron 1 were constructed by digesting −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase with MluI, which cuts at +130 and +1066, and BglII, which digests at the 3′-end of CPT-Iα in the multicloning site of the luciferase vectors. CPT-Iα intron fragments were made by PCR amplification using primers that correspond to regions within intron 1. The forward primer corresponded to nucleotides −16/+6 (TCGGACTCAGCTCGCTCATTCCG). The reverse primers contained BglII restriction sites and corresponded to nucleotides +1076/+1052 (5′-CTAAATACGAGATCTAAAAAGCTTC-3′), +1012/+990 (5′-GCAGTTTTCGACTAAAATCTGTC-3′), +864/+839 (5′-CGTGAGCATAGATCTGTGTTCTGTG-3′), and +803/+778 (5′-GGCTGTTAGGGCAGATCTGGGCTGC-3′). Each PCR reaction contained 1.0 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μg of forward and reverse primers, 2.5 units of Amplitaq GoldTMpolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 ng of −1653/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase template. PCR reactions were conducted in a Thermo Cycler 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were digested with MluI and BglII and ligated into theMluI site at +130 in CPT-Iα and BglII at the 3′-end of CPT-Iα in the pGL3-basic luciferase multicloning site. Gal4-SV40-luciferase vectors were constructed by digesting Gal4-SV40-luciferase vector and −1653/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase withSmaI (+707) and MluI (+1066). The +707/+1066 fragment was ligated into the SmaI and MluI sites within Gal4-SV40-luciferase. Site-directed mutations of protein binding sites were created within the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Protein binding sites were mutated to NheI restriction enzyme sites for identification of mutated clones. The forward and reverse primers used in mutagenesis reactions corresponded to nucleotides +642/+683 (5′-GCCCGAGGTTCAAGGGCGCTAGCGGTGTCCAGAGACTTGCTC-3′), +656/+700 (5′-GGCCAGGTGGGTGTCCAGAGAGCTAGCCAAGGTCGCGCTGGGACC-3′), +659/+704 (5′-CAGGTGGGTGTCCAGAGACTTGCTGCTAGCCGCGCTGGGACCAGAG-3′) and +710/+750 (5′-GAGGGTGGGGGTGTGCTAGCACCCGGCCTGAGTGAACTTGG-3′). Mutagenesis reactions were conducted using the +130/+1066 Gal4 SV40 vector as a template (11Jansen M.S. Cook G.A. Song S. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34989-34997Google Scholar). After introduction of mutations into the +130/+1066 Gal4-SV40-luciferase vector, mutated vectors as well as the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector were digested withMluI, which digests the CPT-Iα gene at nucleotides +130 and +1066. The mutated +130/+1066 fragments were ligated into the +130 and +1066 sites within the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector. All mutations and deletions were confirmed by sequence analysis. CPT-Iα-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells by the calcium phosphate method (9Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 217-224Google Scholar). Transfections included 3 μg of CPT-Iα-luciferase vectors along with RSV-TRβ and TK-renilla vectors. Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% calf serum/5% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the medium was replaced by DMEM containing no serum. Cells were treated with 100 nm T3 for 24 h. After T3 treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were frozen and thawed to facilitate cell lysis. Luciferase assays were conducted on extracts from cells in serum-free media and cells treated with T3. Both luciferase and renilla activity was measured. Protein content in each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Luciferase activity was corrected for both protein content and renilla activity to account for cell density and transfection efficiency, respectively. Data are expressed as -fold induction of luciferase in cells exposed to T3 as compared with cells that received no hormone (Fig. 3) or relative induction of luciferase in mutant construct as compared with the induction of wild-type −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase (Figs. 1, 4, and 6).Figure 1Localization of regions within the first intron that enhance T3 responsiveness.

(14Yin L. Zhang Y. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19554-19565Google Scholar).35S-labeled chicken TRα and human RXRα were expressed using TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega). GST-pull down assays were conducted as described (14Yin L. Zhang Y. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19554-19565Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by storage phosphor autoradiography. GST·TRα fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol (14Yin L. Zhang Y. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19554-19565Google Scholar).35S-labeled USF-1 and USF-2 were expressed using PROTEINscript II reticulocyte lysates (Ambion). Bound proteins were eluted with 2.5 mm glutathione and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Rat hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (15.Deng, X., Cagen, L. M., Wilcox, H. G., Park, E. A., Raghow, R., and Elam, M. B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 290, 256–262.Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were conducted with minor modification as described by Jurado et al. (16Jurado L.A. Song S. Roesler W.M. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27606-27612Google Scholar). PCR reactions were conducted in the iCycler (Bio-Rad) using ThermolAce DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 μl of template, and 1 μg of each primer. The primers used for PCR corresponded to nucleotides −6473/−6450 (5′-CTCTGGTGTCCTGTAACCTGTGG-3′), −6076/−6099 (5′-GAAGGCTGGAATTACACTGGTCAG-3′), −3079/−3056 (5′-GACAGGCAGGGTACATTTCACAG-3′), −2802/−2825 (5′-GAAGGCA- GTGCTTTTCCCTAC-3′), +200/+220 (5′-GACGGGAGGAAAGATGCTTG-3′), and +750/+730 (5′-CCAAGTTCACTCAGGCCGGGTC). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 74 °C for 1 min, followed by one final extension for 10 min at 74 °C. PCR products were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained 3% NuSeive-agarose gel. Restriction fragments containing −6938/+1240 or −6839/+19 CPT-Iα-Luc genes were isolated and injected into the pronuclei of one-cell C57BL/6J × SJL/JF2 hybrid (B6/SJL) mouse zygotes to produce transgenic mice (17Disch D.L.

Transgenic Animal Technology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 15-68Google Scholar). The founders were bred with B6/SJL mates to obtain a second generation of transgenics. Mice containing the luciferase gene constructs were identified by Southern analysis of genomic DNA obtained from the tail (17Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Google Scholar). Two transgenic mouse lines of each CPT-Iα gene construct were selected for use in the T3 experiments based on initial characterization for transgene expression (data not shown). Mice were injected with 0.33 mg/Kg body weight of triiodothyronine (T3) 24 and 48 h prior to sacrifice (6Mynatt R.L. Park E.A. Thorngate F.E. Das H.K. Cook G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 201: 932-937Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed, and pieces of the liver and heart were homogenized in luciferase assay buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays and protein determinations were conducted as described above. Fig.1 illustrates the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector containing 4495 base pairs of the promoter, exon 1, intron 1, and a segment of exon 2. Deletion of nucleotides between +199/+707 in the first intron reduced the T3 induction of CPT-Iα by 50% (Fig. 1). To define smaller regions in the intron that contribute to the T3 stimulation, additional internal deletions were made in the context of the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-Luc vector. Removal of the +515/+707 region decreased the T3 response ∼50%, as did deletion of the 80-base pair +628/+707 region (Fig. 1). Deletion of the +628/+707 region did not alter the basal expression of the CPT-Iα-Luc vector (data not shown). These data indicate that sequences within the +628/+707 region are required for a full response to T3. Our next studies focused on the +628/+707 region of the first intron. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted using double-stranded oligonucleotides that corresponded to nucleotides +628/+655, +653/+682, and +674/+707 in the CPT-Iα gene. Only the +653/+683 and +674/+707 regions bound proteins isolated from rat liver nuclei (Fig. 2, A andB). A consensus E-box motif (CANNTG) was found at nucleotides +659/+664. The E-box motif binds a family of proteins that contain helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper dimerization domains, including c-Myc, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), and upstream stimulatory factor (19Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Google Scholar). Supershift assays were conducted using antibodies that recognize Sp1, C/EBPβ, Oct-1, USF-1, and USF-2. Protein binding to the +653/+682 region was completely disrupted by USF-1 and USF-2 antibodies, whereas the other antibodies did not alter the binding of nuclear proteins (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis confirmed that USF-1 and USF-2 are present in RLNE as well as in HepG2 cells, which was the cell type used in transient transfection experiments (data not shown). Competition analysis revealed that a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild type +653/+682 oligomer completely competed for nuclear protein binding to the labeled probe, whereas an oligomer that contained a mutation in the E-box motif (Table I, Mut. #1) was unable to compete for protein binding (Fig. 2 A). However, competition with unlabeled oligomer that contained a mutation 3′ to the E-box (Mut. #2) reduced protein binding as effectively as the wild type oligomer. Our data show that USF-1 and USF-2 bind within intron 1 of CPT-Iα at the E-box motif located at +659/+664. Gel shift mobility assays were conducted with an oligomer representing the +674/+707 region. Several complexes were formed indicating that either multiple proteins or a family of proteins bind at this site (Fig. 2 B). We analyzed the binding of nuclear factors to this site by the addition of antibodies to the gel shift assays. Antibodies to C/EBPα and C/EBPβ disrupted the binding of nuclear factors (Fig. 2 B). COUP-TF and TR antibodies did not alter protein binding. The +677/+689 region contains an AGGTCA-like motif that might interact with nuclear receptors. However, antibodies to hepatocyte nuclear factor-4, RXR, and peroximal proliferator-activated receptor α did not alter the binding of nuclear proteins (data not shown). Our results indicated that C/EBP proteins could bind to this site. Competition analyses were conducted using unlabeled oligomers that corresponded to the wild type +674/+707 sequence as well as oligomers that contained mutations across the +674/+707 region. A 100-fold excess of wild type oligomer or an oligomer that contained a mutation in nucleotides +695/+700 (Mut. #7) competed effectively for protein binding to the labeled oligomer. However, oligomers that contained mutations in the +677/+682 (Mut. #3 and #5) and +684/+689 (Mut. #4 and #6) sites did not compete for protein binding. Therefore, we conclude that nucleotides within the +677/+689 element are necessary for protein binding within the +674/+707 region. To investigate the importance of elements within the +628/+707 region, we removed these sites from the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector by making Δ+680/+707 and Δ+653/+707 deletions within the intron. These vectors were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells along with RSV-TRβ. Deletion of the +680/+707 and the +653/+707 regions caused a 35% reduction in the T3 induction (Fig. 3), which was identical to the Δ+628/+707 vector in this set of experiments (data not shown). These data demonstrated that the elements contributing to the T3 response are located in the +680/+707 region. In addition to the +653/+707 region, sequences between +707 and +1066 also participated in the T3 induction (Fig.4). To assess the contribution of the 3′-end of the intron to the T3 induction of CPT-Iα, serial deletions were created from the second exon in the −4495/+1240 CPT-Iα-luciferase vector. These vectors were cotransfected with RSV-TRβ into HepG2 cells and tested for T3 responsiveness (Fig. 4). The full T3 effect was maintained with deletion of nucleotides +803 to +1240. However, the T3 response decreased upon deletion of the additional nucleotides between +803 and +707. Deletion of the +707/+1240 region modestly decreased basal expression of the gene (data not shown). This stimulation was reduced further upon delet"

To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms we investigated the potential regulation of Rac1 by E2 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells with angiotensin II as well as overexpression of the constitutively active mutant RacL61 increased ROS release as assessed by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, whereas inhibition of Rac1 byClostridium sordellii lethal toxin or overexpression of dominant-negative RacN17 inhibited ROS production. Treatment with E2 (100 nm) completely prevented angiotensin II-induced NAD(P)H oxidase activity and ROS production. E2 time and concentration dependently decreased angiotensin II-induced and basal Rac1 mRNA and protein expression as well as Rac1 activity. Down-regulation of Rac1 expression by E2 was mediated by inhibition of gene transcription (nuclear run-on assays), but E2 had no effect on Rac1 mRNA stability. Regulation of Rac1 was mediated by estrogen receptors since co-incubation with ICI 182.780 prevented down-regulation of Rac1. To test these observations in vivo, ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with E2 or vehicle. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed reduction of aortic Rac1 mRNA and protein by 32 and 58%, respectively. Furthermore, down-regulation of Rac1 by E2 was observed in human mononuclear cells of women with elevated E2 levels after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.

Rac1 GTPase gene-transcription and activity is regulated by 17β-estradiol, which may be an important molecular mechanism contributing to the cardiovascular effects of estrogens. Rac1 belongs to the small (21 kDa) Rho GTPase family that binds to and hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Rho proteins have been shown to be central regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho proteins function as transducers between mechanical forces, cell morphology, and gene regulation. In its active GTP-bound state, Rac1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell shape, adhesion, movement, endocytosis, secretion, and growth (1Aktories K. J. Clin.

Oxygen radicals impair endothelial function and accelerate the progression of atherosclerotic lesions by promoting lipid oxidation, the expression of proinflammatory genes, and by oxidative inactivation of endothelial nitric oxide (6Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1423-1424Google Scholar, 7Nickenig G. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 393-396Google Scholar, 8Heitzer T. Schlinzig T. Krohn K. Meinertz T. Münzel T. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2673-2678Google Scholar). The NAD(P)H oxidase complex in vascular smooth muscle cells is regarded the most important source of the primordial oxygen radical, superoxide, in the vessel wall (9Sorescu D. Szocs K. Griendling K.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 124-131Google Scholar). Rac1 GTPase plays a pivotal role in the assembly and activation of the NAD(P)H enzymatic system, which is composed of several subunits including p22phox, the flavoprotein p91phox (or its homologues, such as nox1 in VSMC), and the cytoplasmic subunits p47phox and p67phox (3Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar,10Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of Rac1 activity has been shown to inhibit oxygen radical release in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as well as in phagocytes (3Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 5Wagner A.H. Kohler T. Ruckschloss U. Just I. Hecker M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 61-69Google Scholar). In addition to vascular superoxide production, activation of Rac1 signaling leads to cellular hypertrophy cardiac myocytes (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Google Scholar). Despite the importance of Rac1 GTPase for vascular ROS release, the regulation of Rac1 in the cardiovascular system is only partially understood. It is thought that the reduced prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women is based on atheroprotective effects of estrogens. The latter are potentially mediated directly through binding to vascular estrogen receptors (12Nickenig G. Baumer A.T. Grohe C. Kahlert S. Strehlow K. Rosenkranz S. Stablein A. Beckers F. Smits J.F.

Although the antioxidative properties of estrogens are among the most prominent vasoprotective functions of sex steroids, the underlying molecular mechanisms are only partially known. Furthermore, it is not known whether small GTPases are regulated by steroid hormones. We hypothesized that 17β-estradiol may regulate Rac1 GTPase expression and activity and, thereby, inhibit the release of ROS from VSMC. Angiotensin II, l-mevalonate and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. [32P]dCTP and Hybond N-nylon membranes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. [35S]GTPγS was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. H2DCF-DA was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibiotics, calf serum, and cell culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen. RNA-clean was purchased from AGS (Heidelberg, Germany).Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin was kindly provided by K. Aktories (Freiburg, Germany) (1Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 827-829Google Scholar). RhoN19 and RacN17 were a kind gift from A. Hall (London, UK) (2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar). VSMC were isolated from female rat thoracic aorta (strain, male Sprague-Dawley, 6–10 weeks old, Charles River Wega GmbH, Sulzfeld, Germany) by enzymatic dispersion and cultured over several passages. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium without phenol supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids (100×), and 10% fetal calf serum (free of steroid hormones, S-15-M, c.c.pro GmbH). Experiments were performed with cells from passage 5–10. Cells were kept in quiescent medium without fetal calf serum 24 h prior to treatment. Cellular viability under all treatment conditions was determined by cell count, morphology, and trypan blue exclusion. Female, spontaneously hypertensive rats put on a standard chow and were ovariectomized or sham-operated (control group) 16 weeks after birth. For treatment, 17β-estradiol pellets (containing 1.7 mg of estradiol each, 60-day release, Innovative Research) were implanted subcutaneously. E2 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (DPC Biermann, Bad Nauheim, Germany). The thoracic aorta was harvested 5 weeks after surgery. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance to the German animal protecting law. Female VSMC were harvested and resuspended in electroporation medium (Optimem 1, Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml. The following constructs were transfected: insertless vector (pcDNA3) as control, pRK5-myc-Rac1-L61 (constitutively active Rac1 mutant), and pRK5-myc-Rac1-N17 (dominant-negative Rac1 mutant) (18Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar, 19Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Google Scholar). 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 200 μl of cell suspension were placed in a 0.4-cm cuvette, mixed, and incubated for 30 min on ice. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 s, the cuvette was pulsed with 300 V and 500 μF (Electro Cell Manipulator, BioRad). The pulse length was determined by the electroporator based on capacitance, field strength, and resistance of the medium. Upon electroporation the cuvette was incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min. The cells were plated at tissue culture plates and cultured for 48 h before treatment with angiotensin II, E2, and vehicle as indicated. Immunoblotting was performed using Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., 1:250 dilution). ERα and ERβ monoclonal antibodies were from Dianova (1 μg/ml). β-Actin was used to control for equal protein loading (Santa Cruz Actin H-196 polyclonal antibody, 1:250 dilution). Northern blotting in the presence and absence of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) (Sigma) using [32P]dCTP-labeled, full-length Rac1 cDNA and p22phox cDNA was performed as described previously (19Laufs U. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24266-24271Google Scholar). Intracellular reactive oxygen species production was measured by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy techniques. Dishes of subconfluent cells were washed and incubated in the dark for 30 min in the presence of 10 mmol/liter 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein-diacetate (H2DCF-DA). Culture dishes were transferred to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), equipped with a 25×, numerical aperture 0.8, oil-immersion objective (Plan-Neofluar, Carl Zeiss) and Zeiss LSM 410 confocal attachment, and reactive oxygen species generation was detected as a result of the oxidation of H2DCF (excitation, 488 nm; emission longpass LP515-nm filter set). 512 × 512 pixel images were collected by single rapid scans, and identical parameters, such as contrast and brightness, were used for all samples. Five groups of 25 cells for each sample were randomly selected from the image, and fluorescent intensity was taken. The relative fluorescence intensity are average values of all experiments. For measurement of superoxide release in intact vessel segments, aortas were excised carefully and placed in chilled, aerated Krebs-HEPES buffer as described (20Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Strehlow K. van Eickels M. Grohe C. Ahlbory K. Rosen R. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2001; 103: 435-441Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence of aortic rings was assessed over 10 min in the presence of 5 μmol/liter lucigenin in a scintillation counter (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) in 1-min intervals. Superoxide release is expressed as relative chemiluminescence per mg of aortic tissue. NADH or NADPH oxidase activity was measured by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay in a 50-mmol liter−1 phosphate buffer (buffer A), pH 7.0, containing 1 mmol liter−1 EGTA, protease inhibitors (Complete®, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 150 mmol liter−1 sucrose, 5 μmol liter−1 lucigenin, and either 100 μmol liter−1 NADH or 100 μmol liter−1 NADPH as substrate (21Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Google Scholar). Cell cultures were treated as indicated, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and scraped from the dishes. After a step of low spin centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A, lacking lucigenin and substrate. Then, the cells were mechanically lysed by using a glass/Teflon potter on ice. The total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (BioRad) and adjusted to 1 mg ml−1. 100-μl aliquots of the protein sample were measured over 10 min in quadruplicates using NADH or NADPH as substrate in a scintillation counter (Berthold Lumat LB 9501) in 1- min intervals. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with the TaqMan system (Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, PE Biosystems). For rat Rac1 the primers were 5′-GTA AAA CCT GCC TGC TCA TC and 5′-GCT TCG TCA AAC ACT GTC TTG. The nox1 primers were 5′-CCC GCA ACT GTT CAT ACT C and 5′-CAT TGT CCC ACA TTG GTC TC. For 18 S the primers were 5′-TTG ATT AAG TCC CTG CCC TTT GT and 5′-CGA TCC GAG GGC CTA ACTA. For quantification, Rac1 mRNA expression was normalized to the expressed housekeeping gene 18 S. A glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-PAK-CD (PAK-CRIB domain) fusion protein, containing the Rac1 binding region from human PAK1B (22Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar) was used to determine Rac1 activity as described (23Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Google Scholar).Escherichia coli transformed with the GST-PAK-CD construct were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.3. The construct was a kind gift of R. C. Roovers and J. G. Collard, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mmol/liter isopropyl thiogalactoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter Na2S2O, 10% glycerol, 20% sucrose, 2 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and then sonicated. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 45,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein bound to the beads was washed three times in lysis buffer, and the amount of bound fusion protein was estimated using Coomassie-stained SDS gels. Vascular smooth muscle cells were treated as indicated and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated 5 min on ice in lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and then centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 ×g at 4 °C. Aliquots were taken from the supernatant to compare protein amounts. Equal amounts of supernatant protein were incubated with the bacterially produced GST-PAK-CD fusion protein bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads and proteins bound to the fusion protein were washed three times in an excess of lysis buffer, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (60 mmol/liter Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerin, 0.1% bromphenol blue), and then analyzed for bound Rac1 molecules by Western blotting. Vehicle- and E2-treated VSMC were collected and washed. After lysis for 10 min on ice, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation through 0.6 mol/liter sucrose (4Wassmann S. Laufs U. Baumer A.T. Muller K. Konkol C. Sauer H. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 646-654Google Scholar, 24Laufs U. Endres M. Custodis F. Gertz K. Nickenig G. Liao J.K. Böhm M. Circulation. 2000; 19: 3104-3110Google Scholar). The nuclei (∼3–5 × 108/reaction) were used to carry out the in vitro transcription in a reaction mixture containing 40% glycerol, 50 mmol/liter Tris/HCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmol/liter levels of CTP, GTP, ATP, and UTP at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of RNA-clean. Immediately before transcription a sample of each condition was removed. Total RNA before and after transcription was isolated and Rac1 and 18 S mRNA were quantitated using real-time RT-PCR (see above). The extent of Rac1 mRNA transcription was determined by subtracting the amount of Rac1 mRNA standardized to 18 S mRNA prior to transcription from the amounts post transcription. For some experiments, transcription was performed in the presence of 0.2 μmol/liter [32P]UTP (>3000 μCi/mmol). The transcribed radioactive RNA was hybridized with nylon membranes dotted with linearized pKS+ BlueScript, Rac1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, 5 μg of each, as described in detail previously (4Wassmann S. Laufs U. Baumer A.T. Muller K. Konkol C. Sauer H. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 646-654Google Scholar, 24Laufs U. Endres M. Custodis F. Gertz K. Nickenig G. Liao J.K. Böhm M. Circulation. 2000; 19: 3104-3110Google Scholar). Quantification using dot-blots did not differ from quantifications by real-time RT-PCR. Blood samples of patients from the gynecology outpatient clinic scheduled for planned in vitrofertilization were investigated. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation following the long-protocol was initiated in all patients with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue triptorelin, 0.1 mg subcutaneously daily, starting in the midluteal phase of the previous cycle until pituitary desensitization was achieved. Then gonadotropin therapy (recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone 150–200 IE subcutaneously daily, Gonal-F; Serono) was given to induce follicular growing. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue injection was continued up to and including the day of ovulation induction (day 10–12). 30 ml of EDTA plasma were taken before and after 6–10 days of follicle-stimulating hormone treatment. Estradiol levels were evaluated, and mononuclear cells were separated immediately by standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Band intensities were analyzed by densitometry. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared with controls. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons were employed. Post-hoc comparisons were performed with the Newman-Keuls test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. To test the effect of Rac1 and E2 on ROS release, VSMC were treated with angiotensin II, 1 μmfor 3 h. DCF fluorescence laser microscopy showed a 2-fold up-regulation of ROS production (208 ± 22%, p < 0.005), which was prevented by pretreatment with E2, 100 nm. Pretreatment with E2 for 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h time dependently inhibited angiotensin II-induced ROS release (167 ± 22, 135 ± 17, 99 ± 8, 95 ± 23, and 79 ± 23% of control, respectively) (representative microscopic scan is shown in Fig. 1 A, data analysis inB). E2 alone had no significant effect on basal ROS production. In addition, VSMC intracellular superoxide anion formation in the presence of NADPH and NADH was detected by lucigenin assays as described by Griendling et al. (21Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Google Scholar). Angiotensin II mediated an up-regulation of both NADH (243 ± 109%) and NADPH oxidase activity (307 ± 126%), which was inhibited after pretreatment with E2 (100 nm, 16 h) (n = 3, *p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 C). Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin inhibits Rac1 activity by specific glucosylation (1Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 827-829Google Scholar). Treatment with lethal toxin (200 ng/ml, 16 h) completely abolished angiotensin II-stimulated oxygen radical release (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, overexpression of the dominant-negative RacN17 reduced angiotensin-mediated ROS production (Fig. 2 B). Transfection with the constitutively active mutant RacL61 increased ROS release by 2-fold (Fig. 2 B). E2 completely reversed angiotensin II-mediated ROS release in cells transfected with empty vector but had no significant effect after transfection with RacL61. These data show that E2 inhibits angiotensin II-stimulated free radical release from VSMC and that Rac1 activity is both necessary and sufficient for ROS production. The experiments suggest that Rac1 is involved in E2-induced decrease of oxidative stress. Western analysis demonstrated time-dependent down-regulation of Rac1 expression by E2, 100 nm, by 28 ± 12%, 39 ± 6.7%, 46 ± 6%, 61 ± 7%, and 78 ± 10% after 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, respectively (p < 0.05 after 12 h) (Fig. 3, A andB). Similarly, treatment with E2 (0.01–10 μm) for 24 h concentration dependently reduced Rac1 protein levels to 91 ± 8.4%, 54 ± 6%, 33 ± 4%, and 49 ± 10% of control, respectively (p < 0.05 for E2 ≥ 100 nm) (Fig. 3 C). As shown previously, angiotensin II (1 μm, 3 h) increased Rac1 protein expression by 2-fold (4Wassmann S. Laufs U. Baumer A.T. Muller K. Konkol C. Sauer H. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 646-654Google Scholar). In the presence of E2, 100 nm, the angiotensin II effect was completely abolished (Fig. 3, D andE). Next, the effects of E2 on Rac1 mRNA levels were studied. Northern blots showed significant concentration-dependent as well as time-dependent down-regulation of Rac1 mRNA levels similar to the effects of E2 on Rac1 protein (Fig.4, A–C).Figure 4A, representative Northern blot of Rac1 mRNA expression with corresponding 18 S below and B, quantification of the time-dependent effects of 17β-estradiol (E, 100 nm). C,Concentration-dependent effects of E on Rac1 mRNA after 24 h. D, effect of 17β-estradiol (1 μm, 24 h) on nox1 mRNA and E, on p22phox mRNA expression. n = 4–5 each; *,p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the down-regulation of Rac1 mRNA, the expression the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22phox and nox1 was not significantly altered by E2 (1 μm, 16 h, n = 5) (Fig. 4,D and E). Rac1 activity was assessed using GST-PAK Crib domain pull down assays (22Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar, 23Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Google Scholar). Angiotensin II (1 μm, 3 h) up-regulated Rac1 activity to 175 ± 21% (Fig. 5), which was time dependently inhibited by pretreatment with 100 nm E2 for 6, 12, and 24 h. E2 alone (24 h) down-regulated basal Rac1 GTP-binding activity by 52 ± 18% (p < 0.05). To elucidate the mechanism of down-regulation of Rac1 mRNA expression by E2, the rate of Rac1 gene transcription and mRNA stability were studied in the presence and absence of E2 (1 μm, 16 h). Nuclear run on assays showed a reduction of Rac1 transcription to one-third compared with untreated cells (34.5 ± 10%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, DRB studies showed no significant alteration of Rac1 mRNA half-life in the presence of estrogen (Fig. 6 B). Down-regulation of Rac1 expression by E2 is mediated by inhibition of gene transcription. To study whether the effects of E2 on Rac1 were receptor-mediated, VSMC were treated with E2 (0.01–1 μm, 16 h) in the presence of ICI 182.780, 1 μm. Co-treatment with ICI showed complete inhibition of E2-induced down-regulation of Rac1 expression, suggesting receptor-mediated signaling (Fig.7 A). To verify the expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ) in vascular smooth muscle cells, Western analysis was performed. Both receptor subtypes were expressed abundantly. Treatment with E2 (0.01–10 μm, 16 h) lead to concentration-dependent up-regulation of ERα and ERβ expression (Fig. 7, B and C). To investigate a possible regulation of Rac1 by E2 in vivo, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were ovariectomized and were treated with 17β-estradiol pellets (containing 1.7 mg of estradiol each, 60-day release) for 5 weeks. E2 plasma levels dropped to 1.6 ± 0.5 pg/ml in ovariectomized SHR compared with 35.7 ± 12 pg/ml in sham-operated rats and to 61 ± 21 pg/ml after estrogen replacement. Aortic superoxide production (20Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Strehlow K. van Eickels M. Grohe C. Ahlbory K. Rosen R. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2001; 103: 435-441Google Scholar) was up-regulated (160 ± 27%, p < 0.05) in the ovariectomized animals, which was completely reversed by E2 replacement (Fig.8 A). To test the effects of E2 on Rac1 expression in vivo, real-time PCRs were performed in the aortas of these animals (Fig. 8 B). In E2-deficient rats, there was a trend toward up-regulation of Rac1 mRNA (126 ± 33% of control, n = 5, p = non-significant). Treatment of ovariectomized rats with E2 down-regulated vascular Rac1 expression (58 ± 19%,n = 4, p < 0.05). Similarly, aortic protein expression was reduced (42 ± 12%) after treatment with E2 (n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig.8 C). These data suggest that estrogen regulates vascular Rac1 expression in vivo. To assess whether the cell culture and animal studies may have significance in humans, mononuclear cells were collected from women before and during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation prior to in vitro fertilization, leading to significant increase of 17β-estradiol blood levels (Fig.9 A). Real-time PCR showed down-regulation of Rac1 mRNA levels to 51 ± 36% in the presence of elevated estrogen levels (n = 6,p < 0.05) (Fig. 9 B). This study shows that 17β-estradiol inhibits the expression and activity of Rac1 GTPase leading to inhibition of free radical production in vascular smooth muscle cells. Similar effects were observed in the vessel wall in vivo. Down-regulation of Rac1 by E2 was not limited to VSMC but was observed in mononuclear cells of women with elevated E2 levels after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. An important step in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and the progression of atherosclerosis is the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase enzyme complex in VSMC by angiotensin II, the primary source of superoxide production in the vessel wall (25Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265Google Scholar). Rac1 GTPase plays a pivotal role during the assembly of the NAD(P)H system (3Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Google Scholar, 10Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Google Scholar, 26Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Itan M. Sigal N. Pick E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14557-14566Google Scholar). Here we show, using overexpression of dominant-negative and active Rac1 mutants, that Rac1 activity is both necessary for ROS production in vascular smooth muscle cells and sufficient for ROS release. In agreement with previous studies (27Nickenig G. Strehlow K. Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Albory K. Sauer H. Böhm M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1828-1833Google Scholar), E2 effectively and completely inhibited angiotensin II-mediated ROS release. More specifically, E2 prevents angiotensin II-mediated NADH and NADPH oxidase activity. But E2 did not significantly reduce ROS after transfection with the active RacL61, pointing toward a role of Rac1 for the anti-oxidative effects of E2. Indeed, Western and Northern analyses demonstrated that E2 concentration and time dependently down-regulated Rac1 protein and mRNA expression, both alone and in the presence of angiotensin II. Similarly, E2 inhibited basal and stimulated Rac1 activity. The molecular mechanism is the inhibition of Rac1 gene transcription, whereas E2 had no significant effect on Rac1 mRNA half-life. The estrogen receptors α and β were abundantly expressed in VSMC and up-regulated by treatment with E2. Down-regulation of Rac1 expression by E2 was completely blocked in the presence of the nonselective estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182.780, demonstrating a receptor-mediated event. To test the relevance of these findings in vivo, a well characterized animal model of estrogen deficiency by ovariectomy and E2 replacement therapy was studied (20Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Strehlow K. van Eickels M. Grohe C. Ahlbory K. Rosen R. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Circulation. 2001; 103: 435-441Google Scholar). In the aortas of ovariectomized SHR significant down-regulation of Rac1 mRNA and protein expression by E2 was observed. Depression of Rac1 by estrogen replacement strongly correlates with reduced vascular oxidative stress. The presented cell culture data assign an essential role to Rac1 in NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated radical release. Thus, it may be suggested that estrogen-induced inhibition of Rac1 reduces production of ROS in vitro as well as in vivo. To further extend these findings to the human situation, mononuclear cells of young women with elevated estrogen levels undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation prior to in vitrofertilization were studied. Elevation of serum 17β-estradiol correlated with a decrease of Rac1 mRNA expression. These data suggest that estrogen may regulate Rac1 GTPase in humans, but additional studies are needed before conclusions regarding a potential effect of estrogen replacement therapy, especially in combination with progesterone, should be drawn (27Nickenig G. Strehlow K. Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Albory K. Sauer H. Böhm M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1828-1833Google Scholar). In the vascular wall, estrogens exert anti-oxidant effects in addition to the inhibition of Rac1 GTPase in VSMC, which are primarily located in the media of the arterial wall. ROS release from the endothelium as well as the adventitia may play an important role in vivo. 3-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity as well as expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit gp91(phox) have been shown to increase in the endothelium and adventitia of mice treated with angiotensin II (28Wang H.D. Xu S. Johns D.G. Du Y. Quinn M.T. Cayatte A.J. Cohen R.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 947-953Google Scholar,29Wang H.D. Johns D.G. Xu S. Cohen R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1697-H1702Google Scholar). Importantly, recent work by Wagner et al. shows that E2 decreases the function of the NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial cells, which is mediated by down-regulation gp91phox (30Wagner A.H. Schroeter M.R. Hecker M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2121-2130Google Scholar). The expression of its homologue in vascular smooth muscle cells, nox1, was not significantly altered by E2, suggesting a potential dichotomy between endothelial cells and VSMC, which may help to address the cell-specific function of NAD(P)H oxidases in different cell types in further studies. Down-regulation of gp91phox in the endothelium and Rac1 in the media are likely complementary effects in vivo. In addition, estrogen reduces oxidative stress by down-regulation of the AT1 receptor (7Nickenig G. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 2002; 105: 393-396Google Scholar, 12Nickenig G. Baumer A.T. Grohe C. Kahlert S. Strehlow K. Rosenkranz S. Stablein A. Beckers F. Smits J.F. Daemen M.J. Vetter H. Böhm M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2197-2201Google Scholar, 27Nickenig G. Strehlow K. Wassmann S. Baumer A.T. Albory K. Sauer H. Böhm M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1828-1833Google Scholar). The estrogen-induced reduction of ROS is closely connected to another beneficial action of estrogen on vascular cells, namely the up-regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity (12Nickenig G. Baumer A.T. Grohe C. Kahlert S. Strehlow K. Rosenkranz S. Stablein A. Beckers F. Smits J.F. Daemen M.J. Vetter H. Böhm M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2197-2201Google Scholar, 30Wagner A.H. Schroeter M.R.

Therefore, the well established increase of NO bioavailability is caused by increased NO production and decreased superoxide release. It is thought that the putative vasoprotective effects of estrogens are at least in part mediated via reduction of oxidative stress. Decreased Rac1 expression and activity may resemble a novel and important mechanism by which estrogens interfere with free radical production. In addition, recent evidence suggests an important role for Rac1 GTPase for the control of oxygen radical release outside the vascular wall in several cell types, including leukocytes, fibroblasts, and cardiac myocytes (10Gorzalczany Y. Sigal N. Itan M. Lotan O. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40073-40081Google Scholar, 32Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rac1 by expression of dominant-negative N17rac1 has been shown to protect from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death in a variety of cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and ventricular myocytes (33Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Google Scholar). In cardiomyocytes, Rac1 has been identified as a mediator of hypertrophy (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I.

Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Google Scholar). Inhibition of Rac1 activity in the heart, e.g. by inhibition of Rac1 isoprenylation using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, has been shown to prevent the hypertrophic phenotype as well as cardiac ROS production (36Laufs U. Kilter H. Konkol C. Wassmann S. Böhm M. Nickenig G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 911-920Google Scholar, 37Takemoto M. Node K. Nakagami H. Liao Y. Grimm M. Takemoto Y. Kitakaze M. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1429-1437Google Scholar). Interestingly, estrogen has been reported to prevent cardiac hypertrophy by a mechanism yet unknown (16van Eickels M. Grohe C. Cleutjens J.P. Janssen B.J. Wellens H.J. Doevendans P.A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1419-1423Google Scholar, 38Hayward C.S. Webb C.M. Collins P. Lancet. 2001; 357: 1354-1356Google Scholar). We speculate that the antihypertrophic effects of estrogen could at least in part be mediated by regulation of Rac1 GTPase. In summary, Rac1 GTPase gene transcription and activity are regulated by E2, which may be an important molecular mechanism contributing to the cardiovascular effects of estrogens. We thank I.

To dissect eEF3 function and its link to the A-site activities of eEF1A, we have identified a temperature-sensitive allele of the YEF3 gene.

Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 89-126Google Scholar). During elongation, eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)1 1A or its prokaryotic homologue EF-Tu, recruit aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A site of ribosome. The eEF1B complex or EF-Ts, in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, respectively, are the nucleotide exchange factors functioning to maintain the active pools of their respective G-proteins. eEF2 in eukaryotes or EF-G in bacteria are the GTP-driven translocases that move the mRNA and peptidyl-tRNA following peptide bond formation. Most protein synthesis factors are highly conserved between single cell eukaryotes and metazoans. For example, human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae eEF1A are 81% identical. Fungi are different in their absolute requirement of a third factor, eEF3. eEF3 of S. cerevisiae is essential for cell-free translation systems (2Skogerson L. Wakatama E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immun. 1992; 60: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A structural homolog of eEF3 has also been reported to be present in the chlorella virus CVK2(12Yamada T. Fukuda K. Tamura S. Furukawa P. Songari P. Virology. 1993; 197: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Some evidence indicates there may be an eEF3-like ATPase activity tightly associated with ribosomes in prokaryotes (13Kiel M.C. Akoi H. Ganoza M.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This ATPase, RbbA, cross-reacts with anti-eEF3 antibody and exhibits inhibition of polyphenylalanine synthesis as well as ribosome-associated ATPase activity in the presence of anti-eEF3 antibody. The 1044-amino acid sequence of eEF3 reveals multiple structural motifs spanning the protein, some possessing homology to proteins of established functions related to translation (Fig. 1 A). A 200-amino acid motif near the N terminus bears ∼30% homology with the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S5. rpS5 binds to the 16 S rRNA and is an important constituent of the “decoding center” (14Belfield G.P. Ross-Smith N.J. Tuite M.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant peptide derived from the N terminus of eEF3 interacts with 18 S rRNA and inhibits the ribosome-dependent eEF3 ATPase activity (15Gontarek R.R. Li H. Nurse K. Prescott C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10249-10252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 51-amino acid stretch at the C terminus comprises highly basic amino acids containing at least three lysine-rich clusters, which are absolutely required for binding to yeast ribosomes (16Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6377-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Kambampati R. Pelligrino C. Paiva A. Huang L. Mende-Mueller L. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16963-16968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). eEF3 also possesses a highly conserved sequence found in tRNA-binding proteins, termed ELVES, residing in the intervening region of the “A” and “B” motifs of the second ATP binding cassette and has been hypothesized to assist the removal of deacylated tRNA from the ribosome (14Belfield G.P. Ross-Smith N.J. Tuite M.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the various sequence motifs of eEF3 exhibit conservation to proteins known to interact with tRNA and rRNA and may indicate similar functions for eEF3. eEF3 possesses both intrinsic and ribosome-dependent ATPase and GTPase activities by virtue of a repeated bipartite nucleotide binding domain characteristic of the ATP-binding superfamily of proteins possessing ATP binding cassettes (ABCs) or Walker boxes (reviewed in Ref. 18Chakraburtty K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). eEF3, Gcn20p, and UvrA, unlike other members of the ABC family of proteins, are a subfamily of soluble proteins and do not function as membrane bound translocators, the larger part of this family (18Chakraburtty K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rather, eEF3 relies upon its ATP hydrolytic activity to perhaps induce a conformational change within the ribosome, facilitating the exit of deacylated tRNA from the E-site and subsequent binding of charged aa-tRNA to the A-site (19Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The two ABCs are distinct, as the first has the classic 70–90-amino acid spacing between the A and B motifs, whereas the second has a 188-amino acid insertion. However, eEF3 does bind two molecules of ATP in a cooperative manner (20Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 266: 133-140Crossref Google Scholar). A protein lacking amino acids 689–793, including the A motif of the second ATP binding cassette, however, maintains intrinsic ATPase activity, indicating for this function both cassettes are not essential (18Chakraburtty K. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More subtle mutations in the conserved glycines (G463V and G701V), and lysines (K469R and K707R), in the A motif of the ATP binding cassettes (G XXXXGKST) abolish ribosome-dependent ATPase activity, polyphenylalanine synthesis, and cell growth (21Yang H. Hamada K. Terashima H. Izuta M. Yamaguchi-Shita E. Kondoh O. Satoh H. Miyazaki M. Arisawa M. Miyamoto C. Kitada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the function or consequences of altered ATPase activity in vivoor in the individual steps of eEF3 function. Overall, the many distinct sequence motifs of the eEF3 protein may perform different functions; however, there appears to be an interaction among different domains to govern the overall catalytic action of the eEF3 protein. Previous studies show that, functionally, eEF3 stimulates the delivery of only cognate aa-tRNA by eEF1A at the A site (22Uritani M. Miyazaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Kamath A. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in a manner that appears to be codon-dependent (24Uritani M. Miyazaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The role of eEF3 in an allosteric interaction between the A and E sites of the ribosome has been demonstrated (19Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Further, there is evidence that eEF3 is an E site factor controlling the removal of deacylated tRNA to facilitate binding of the cognate (aa-tRNA·GTP·eEF1A) ternary complex to the A site. In fact, eEF3 binds eEF1A in vitro (25Kovalchuke O. Kambampati R. Pladies E. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although the functional consequences on elongation and eEF1A function remain unknown. In the current study we report that mutation of Phe-650 to Ser in the intervening region of the two ATP binding cassettes of S. cerevisiae eEF3 is conditionally lethal at 37 °C. The F650S mutant strain demonstrates reduced global translation, slower run-off of polyribosomes, reduced intrinsic and ribosome-stimulated ATPase activities, and reduced interaction with eEF1A. The eEF3 mutant strain of yeast does not affect +1 ribosomal frameshifting or nonsense suppression, but has moderate effects on sensitivity to translation inhibitors. eEF3 also exhibits alterations in both genetic and physical interactions with a G-domain mutation in eEF1A in a highly allele-specific fashion. The present study demonstrates a direct allele-specific genetic interaction between the two translation elongation factors and shows intact and functional nucleotide binding domains of both proteins are necessary for their physical association. Taken together these results provide in vivo evidence supporting a functional link between these two factors. S. cerevisiae strains and their genotypes used in this study are listed in Table I.E. coli DH5α was used for plasmid preparation. Procedures for cell growth and genetic manipulations were according to standard protocols (26Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in either YEPD (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or in defined synthetic complete medium (C or C−) supplemented with 2% dextrose as the carbon source unless noted. Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate method (27Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity was assayed by growing strains containing wild type (TKY597) or the mutant form of eEF3 (TKY599) to anA 600 of 1.0. Serial 10-fold dilutions (5 μl each) were spotted on YEPD, followed by incubation at 13, 24, 30, and 37 °C for 3–7 days. Phenotypic suppression of a nonprogrammed +1 frameshift allele (met2–1 and his4–713) were determined by spotting 10 μl of the same dilutions onto complete medium lacking methionine or histidine, respectively, and incubating for 5 days at 30 and 33 °C. Halo assays for sensitivity to cycloheximide, paromomycin, and hygromycin B were as previously described (28Dinman J.D. Kinzy T.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 870-881PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to paromomycin in conditions where eEF3 is overexpressed relative to wild type levels was determined in liquid culture for at least two independent colonies of each strain grown at 30 °C in C−Ura to mid-log phase, diluted toA 600 of 0.05, and grown in triplicate in a 96-well microtiter assay plates with varying concentrations of paromomycin. Plates were incubated with shaking at 30 °C and growth monitored as the mean of the triplicate A 600 at 22 h.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeSourceMC213MATαura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2 URA337MC214MATαura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2 TRP137TKY111MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–2 URA3(E317K)28TKY112MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–3 URA3(E40K)28TKY113MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–4 URA3 (E122K)28TKY114MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–7 URA3 (T142I)28TKY115MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–9 URA3 (E295K)28TKY116MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–10 URA3 (E122Q)28TKY117MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–13 URA3 (D130N)28TKY225MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ ptef2–17 TRP1 (D156N)30TKY226MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ ptef2–19 TRP1 (N153T)30TKY229MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ ptef2–17 TRP1(N153T/D156E)30TKY252MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–4 TRP1(E122K)This studyTKY554MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 met2–1 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pYEF3 URA35TKY588MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 met2–1 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–1 TRP1(E286K)38TKY597MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 met2–1 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pYEF3 TRP1This studyTKY599MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 met2–1 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pyef3 TRP1 (F650S)This studyTKY621MATαura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 MET2 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2 TRP1This studyTKY622MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 MET2 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–1 TRP1 (E286K)This studyTKY623MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 MET2 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pYEF3 TRP1This studyTKY625MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 MET2 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pyef3 TRP1 (F650S)This studyTKY696MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1-Δ1 lys2–20 MET2 his4–713 tef1::LEU2 tef2Δ pTEF2–4 TRP1 (E122K)This studyTKY702MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 met2–1 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pYEF3 TRP1 2μ(His6 wild type)This studyTKY707MATαura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–7 lys2 met2–1 his4–713 yef3::LEU2 pyef3 TRP1 2μ (His6 F650S)This study Open table in a new tab A screen for temperature-sensitive (Ts−) alleles of YEF3 was performed by passage of pYEF3 through XL1-Red E. coli (Stratagene), transformation of TKY554, and replica plating on 5-fluoroorotic acid to monitor for slow growing colonies at 34 °C. The mutated YEF3 plasmid was recovered from yeast and transformed into E. coli DH5α, and isogenic wild type and mutant eEF3 strains were constructed by transforming pTKB594 (YEF3 TRP1) or pTKB595 (yef3 F650STRP1) into yeast TKY554 (29Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1997; 10: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Loss of the YEF3 URA3 plasmid was monitored by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid, producing strains TKY597 (wild type) and TKY599 (F650S). β-Galactosidase-based assays for nonsense suppression and programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies on the yeast L-A virus signal were performed. Nonsense suppression assays were performed on strains TKY597 and TKY599 using aURA3 wild type lacZ control plasmid (pUKC815tail) or a URA3 plasmid with an in-frame UAA nonsense codon inlacZ; (pUKC817tail (UAA)) as described previously (30Carr-Schmid A.

For −1 frameshifting assays, URA3-based pT125 (0 frame) and pT124 (L-A virus −1 frame) plasmids were used (31Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Yeast polyribosome preparation was performed as previously described (32Baim S.B. Pietras D.F. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with the following specifications. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C toA 600 of 0.8–1.0, divided, and extracted with and without cycloheximide added to the cells and lysis buffer. Cell extracts (40 A 260) were layered on 35 ml of 7–47% sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 4 h at 27,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor. The A 254 was monitored and recorded using a model 185 density gradient fractionator (ISCO, Inc., Lincoln, NE). His6-tagged wild type and F650S mutant eEF3 proteins were purified from the strains TKY702 and TKY707, respectively, on a Ni2+ HiTrap chelating column (AmershamBiosciences). Total yeast cell extracts were clarified and loaded on the column in buffer A (50 mm KPO4, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm PMSF) with 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole. The protein peak was dialyzed into buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 100 mm KCl). ATP hydrolysis was performed as previously described (29Kambampati R. Chakraburtty K. Protein Exp. Purif. 1997; 10: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard assay mixture contained 0.5 A 260 units of yeast ribosomes and 150 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 30 °C, and Pi release determined. ATP hydrolysis levels were calculated after subtracting the background for buffer alone. Yeast extracts for GST pull-down analysis were prepared by glass bead lysis in TEDG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmPMSF) from eEF1A wild type (MC214) or mutant (TKY229, TKY252, and TKY588) strains expressing either GST alone (pMA210) or GST-eEF3 (pTKB546) fusion plasmids under the GAL4 promoter and induced by growth in C−Ura+galactose (25Kovalchuke O. Kambampati R. Pladies E. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Reactions containing 50 μg of total protein (determined by Bradford reagent, Bio-Rad) and 20 μl of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry (Sigma) in a 200-μl final volume in KETN 150 buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet, 1 mm PMSF) were mixed at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with KETN buffer (either 150 mm KCl or 300 mm KCl), samples resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins detected with a polyclonal antibody to yeast eEF1A by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). Ni2+-NTA pull-down of eEF1A with His6-tagged eEF3 were performed on extracts from strains TKY702 and TKY707, expressing wild type and F650S His6-tagged eEF3 expressed from a 2-μm TRP1plasmids as the only form of eEF3, respectively, as described previously (33Andersen G.R. Valente L. Pedersen L. Kinzy T.G. Nyborg J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To apply a genetic approach to understanding eEF3 function, a screen for randomly generated Ts− alleles of theYEF3 gene was performed. A mutation lethal at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C (Fig.1 B), substituting phenylalanine 650 with serine, was identified. Additionally, there are two substitutions, I153F and V332L, in both the wild type and mutant plasmid-borne alleles relative to the published (6Qin S. Xie A. Bonato M.C.M. McLaughlin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and annotated yeast genome sequences. These two substitutions likely reflect polymorphisms between yeast strains and are in residues of low conservation between fungal eEF3 sequences (10Blakely G. Hekman J. Chakraburtty K. Williamson P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2241-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To help determine the mechanism causing the Ts− phenotype, the levels of wild type and F650S eEF3 proteins were analyzed following a shift to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C. At 30 °C, eEF3 of the expected molecular mass (∼116 kDa) along with several degradation products were detected in both the wild type and mutant strains (Fig. 1 C). After 5 h at 37 °C, no significant change was observed in the total eEF3 protein in either strain, indicating the tight Ts−phenotype is not a result of instability and loss of eEF3 at 37 °C but rather a loss of function. The F650S mutation is between the two ATP binding cassettes of eEF3 (Fig. 1 A). This location is of interest as the presence of bipartite ABCs or ATPase domains in tandem is found in a series of proteins including the ABC transporters. The cross-talk between the two domains is critical for the ATPase function of these proteins (reviewed in Ref. 34Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9609-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the presence of this mutation in the intervening region of the two motifs could potentially affect the proper alignment of these two domains. Thus, it was predicted that the F650S mutation would interfere with hydrolytic activity. As seen in Fig. 2, wild type eEF3 hydrolyzes 0.82 nmol of ATP/pmol of eEF3. The presence of ribosomes stimulates the hydrolysis 2-fold. In comparison, F650S eEF3 protein shows only background levels of hydrolysis in the presence or absence of ribosomes. Thus, the mutation severely compromises an eEF3 activity, ATP hydrolysis, previously shown to be critical for elongation in vitro. To identify changes in protein synthesis caused by the F650S mutation, the wild type and mutant strains were tested for sensitivity to translation inhibitors. Altered sensitivity to aminoglycosidic drugs such as paromomycin and hygromycin B typically correlates with reduced translational fidelity (35Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas cycloheximide is a general translation elongation inhibitor. At the permissive temperature, the F650S mutant eEF3 strain showed increased sensitivity to paromomycin and hygromycin, but not cycloheximide (TableII). To further analyze potential effects on fidelity, the ability of the wild type and mutant strains to suppress two chromosomally encoded +1 frameshift mutations (met2–1 and his4–713) was monitored by the ability of strains to grow on medium lacking the corresponding amino acid. Compared with the wild type, the mutant strain did not grow better on C−Met or C−His media at either permissive or semipermissive temperatures, indicating that the mutant allele does not reduce fidelity to allow phenotypic suppression of a +1 frameshift mutation (data not shown). These results were corroborated by several quantitative measurements of translational fidelity. Suppression of the −1 frameshift signal from the yeast L-A virus or a UAA stop codon was determined using lacZ-based assays of read-through. There was no significant increase in the β-galactosidase activity levels of either the −1 frameshift signal (6.4 ± 1% for wild typeversus 7.7 ± 2% for the mutant), or UAA stop codon read-through (0.15 ± 0.02% for wild type versus0.12 ± 0.04% for the mutant) reporter system. Thus, even though paromomycin sensitivity usually correlates with altered translational fidelity in yeast, this effect is not manifest on frameshifting or nonsense suppression.Table IISensitivity of wild type and F650S eEF3 expressing S. cerevisiae strains to translation inhibitorscEF3Cycloheximide (5 mm)Paromomycin (500 mg/ml)Hygromycin B (25 mm)Wild type16.5 ± 1.5aDrug sensitivity is the average of at least three experiments and represents the radius of inhibition of growth of a lawn of cells in mm plated on YEPD and grown at 30 °C, with 10 μl of the indicated drug spotted on a BBL filter blank.2.0 ± 0.26.0 ± 0.4F650S16.0 ± 0.26.0 ± 0.29.0 ± 0.2a Drug sensitivity is the average of at least three experiments and represents the radius of inhibition of growth of a lawn of cells in mm plated on YEPD and grown at 30 °C, with 10 μl of the indicated drug spotted on a BBL filter blank. Open table in a new tab To monitor the effects of the F650S mutation on total protein synthesis, [35S]methionine incorporation was monitored at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. A strain expressing the mutant eEF3 protein shows an ∼50% decrease in total translation over 60 min of growth (Fig.3 A). This is similar to the level of reduction seen for a strain bearing the eEF1A E286K mutant (Fig. 3 B), which also dramatically affects cell growth (37Sandbaken M.G. Culbertson M.R. Genetics. 1988; 120: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38Anand M. Valente L. Carr-Schmid A. Munshi R. Olarewaju O. Ortiz P. Kinzy T.G. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To identify the step in protein synthesis affected, standard polyribosome profiles were analyzed for the wild type and mutant eEF3 strains at the permissive temperature and following a 2-h shift to 37 °C. No significant differences between the profiles of wild type or F650S mutant strain extracts were noted (Fig. 3C for 30 °C and data not shown). A similar analysis of the E286K eEF1A mutant, which also shows a significant reduction in total translation, similarly shows no significant polyribosome profile alterations (Fig.3 D for 30 °C and data not shown). Consequently, to look more specifically at the elongation step, identical experiments were performed at the permissive temperature of 30 °C except that cycloheximide was omitted from all steps of the standard experimental protocol. Because cycloheximide freezes ribosomes on the mRNA, the lack of this drug would allow ribosomes to continue elongating and run-off. Slower run-off would be seen as enhanced retention of polyribosomes, thus providing a better monitor of effects on elongation. The F650S mutant eEF3 strain exhibits a much higher population of polyribosomes as compared with the wild type eEF3 strain (Fig. 3 C, −CH), indicating a retardation of the disassembly of the ribosome and hence a slower translation elongation rate. Similarly, analysis of the eEF1A E286K mutant strain shows a significant increase in polyribosomes at 30 °C compared with wild type yeast (Fig. 3 D, −CH). It has been shown previously (25Kovalchuke O. Kambampati R. Pladies E. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 986-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that eEF1A and eEF3 physically interact. To decipher the cause of the translation defect seen in the F650S eEF3 mutant, plasmids expressing His6-tagged wild type and F650S eEF3 proteins were prepared, and shown to function in place of the untagged wild type eEF3 with essentially identical growth to their untagged counterparts (data not shown). Using a Ni2+-NTA pull-down from total cell extracts, the native eEF1A associates with wild type His6eEF3 (Fig. 4). When the His6F650S eEF3 mutant is expressed as the only form of eEF3, however, it shows essentially no binding of eEF1A (Fig. 4). Thus, these results demonstrate that"

However, the mechanisms by which cells regulate intracellular levels of these lipids as well as their localization and mechanisms of action are largely unknown. The level of S1P is regulated by the metabolic enzymes responsible for its formation, which is catalyzed by sphingosine kinase (6Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J.

Although sphingosine kinase type 1 (SPHK1) and type 2 (SPHK2) have a high degree of homology, they have differential tissue expression, temporal developmental expression, and properties, suggesting that they have distinct cellular functions and may regulate levels of S1P differently. Furthermore, SPHK1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme, whereas SPHK2 has several predicted transmembrane regions, suggesting that it is a membrane protein (3Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol.

Another study suggested the presence of additional sphingosine kinases in mammalian tissues: one cytosolic and two membrane-bound activities that are associated with the ER and with plasma membrane (12Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two genes that encode related sphingosine kinases, named LCB4 andLCB5, have been identified (13Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). They display 53% amino acid identity. The gene products, referred to as LCB (long chain sphingoid base) kinases, phosphorylate several LCBs, including dihydrosphingosine (DHS), phytosphingosine (PHS), and sphingosine. These predicted cytosolic kinases appear to have similar substrate specificities. Like mammalian kinases, two-thirds of the Lcb4p and one-third of the Lcb5p kinase activity are also found in the membrane fraction, although neither protein contains a membrane localization signal (13Nagiec M.M.

Yeast also expresses a conserved S1P lyase encoded by the DPL1 gene (14Saba J.D. Nara F. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26087-26090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Additionally, LCB3and YSR3 encode LCB phosphate phosphatases (15Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Both phosphatases are localized to the ER but appear to be functionally distinct (18Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the functions of LCB kinases in yeast are largely unknown, a study using yeast strains with deletions of LCB kinase genes showed that LCB kinases are important regulators of heat-induced cell cycle arrest, and that Lcb4p and Lcb5p function redundantly in this process (19Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests specific roles for the two LCB kinases. Lcb4p has a function in growth inhibition and cell death (20Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Zhang X. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Lcb5p plays a role in heat-stress resistance during induced thermotolerance (22Ferguson-Yankey S.R. Skrzypek M.S. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Yeast. 2002; 19: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This difference implicates a complexity in the mechanisms in which the two LCB kinases control diverse cellular processes. Earlier studies showed that deletion of LCB3 leads to failure of incorporation of exogenous DHS into sphingolipids, suggesting a possible role for LCB phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in sphingolipid synthesis (16Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that incorporation of exogenous DHS into ceramide requires both Lcb4p and Lcb3p. Using an in vitro ceramide synthesis assay, we showed a specific role for membrane-associated Lcb4p in ceramide synthesis. Although membranes lacking LCB kinases had normal LCBP phosphatase activity, they could not support ceramide synthesis from DHS-1P, suggesting that the actions of Lcb4p and Lcb3p must be concerted on the ER membrane. Our observations provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the cell might functionally separate biosynthetic and signaling pools of LCBP. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. For the deletion strains, the entire open reading frames were deleted and replaced with the designated genes. Deletions were confirmed by PCR. Three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were introduced at the COOH terminus of Lcb4p and Lcb5p using a histidine selection as described previously (23Levine T.P. Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2267-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). RH4950 and RH5257 strains were obtained from RH4946 and RH4953, respectively, by plating onto SD plates without histidine. Expression of Lcb3p tagged with FLAG peptide was performed with the same construct (pYSR2) as described previously (16Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Strains containing pYSR2 were grown overnight in SD (synthetic minimal, 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 20 g/liter glucose, supplemented with the appropriate amino acids)-uracil (SD-ura) medium containing 2% glucose and resuspended in SD-ura medium containing 2% galactose. Expression of the tagged Lcb3p was then induced by incubating cells with SD-ura medium containing 2% galactose and detected by Western analysis using a mouse mAb M2 against FLAG (Sigma).Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeRH4402MATαlcb4Δ∷URA3 lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 bar1–1RH4423MATα pep4–3 ura3 leu2 bar1–1RH4427MATαlcb3Δ∷KanMx pep4–3 ura3 bar1–1RH4464MATα lcb3Δ∷KanMx lcb4Δ∷URA3 lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 bar1–1RH4835MATαysr3Δ∷URA3 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 bar1–1RH4836MATα lcb3Δ∷KanMx ysr3Δ∷URA3 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 bar1–1RH4946MATα lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH4948MATαpep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH4950MATα lcb4∷LCB4 3xHA HIS5Sp lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH4951MATαlcb4Δ∷TRP1 lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH4953MATαlcb4Δ∷TRP1 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH4978MAT a dpp1Δ∷HIS3 lpp1Δ∷TRP1 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 bar1–1RH4981MAT a dpp1Δ∷HIS3 lpp1Δ∷TRP1 lcb3Δ∷KanMx ysr3Δ∷URA3 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH5243MATαdpp1Δ∷HIS3 lpp1Δ∷TRP1 lcb4Δ∷URA3 lcb5Δ∷LEU2 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1RH5244MATαdpp1Δ∷HIS3 lpp1Δ∷TRP1 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 bar1–1RH5257MATαlcb5∷LCB5 3xHA HIS5Sp lcb4Δ∷TRP1 pep4–3 ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 bar1–1 Open table in a new tab Cell cultures, labeling of lipids with [3H]DHS (American Radiolabeled Chemical Inc., St Louis, MO), or [3H]DHS-1P prepared as below, lipid extraction, and treatment by mild alkaline hydrolysis with NaOH were performed as previously described (24Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The labeled lipids were separated on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (20 × 20, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), which were developed in solvent system I (chloroform/methanol/4.2 n NH4OH = 9/7/2, v/v). Radiolabeled lipids were visualized and quantified on a Cyclone Storage phosphor system using a tritium-sensitive screen (Packard, Meriden, CT). Wild-type and mutant cytosol were prepared essentially as described previously (25Salama N.R. Yeung T. Schekman R.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4073-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The preparation of total membranes was performed as described previously (26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In brief, spheroplasts (from 0.5 A 600units of cells in log phase) were broken in lysis buffer (0.1m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain)). Subsequently, unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to collect the membrane fraction. The pellet was washed twice and resuspended in B88 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mmsorbitol). Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. [3H]DHS-1P was synthesized enzymatically from [3H]DHS by incubation with wild-type yeast cytosol in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). The synthesized [3H]DHS-1P was separated on TLC plates, which were developed in solvent system I, and then isolated from the TLC plates by scraping, and eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (10/10/3, v/v). The isolated [3H]DHS-1P was dried under nitrogen and partitioned between n-butanol and water as described (24Zanolari B. Friant S. Funato K. Sutterlin C. Stevenson B.J. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2824-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The butanol phase was dried under nitrogen, and lipids were dissolved in ethanol. In vitro ceramide synthase activity was determined as described previously (26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Membranes (200 μg), cytosol (100 μg), an ATP-regenerating system (1 mmATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), GDP-mannose (50 μm), and either a mix of [3H]DHS and unlabeled DHS (10 and 40 pmol, respectively, 0.5 μCi) or [3H]DHS-1P (0.25 μCi) were first incubated for 15 min at 10 °C. Subsequently, CoA (50 μm) and a mix of liposomes containing hexacosanoic acid (C26) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) (50 μm/250 μm, respectively) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 24 °C in a final total volume of 50 μl of B88. The reaction was stopped by addition of 333 μl of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v). The organic phase was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was re-extracted with 250 μl of chloroform/methanol/water. The extracted lipids were submitted to a mild alkaline treatment with NaOH and then partitioned between n-butanol and water and analyzed by TLC with solvent system II (chloroform/acetic acid = 9/1, v/v). LCBP phosphatase activity was measured by adding [3H]DHS-1P (0.25 μCi) to the membranes (200 μg) in 50 μl of B88 containing apyrase (10 units/ml) and incubating at 24 °C for 60 min. The lipids treated with NaOH were analyzed by TLC with solvent system I as described above. To characterize the nature of membrane association of proteins, cells were grown in SD-ura medium, washed, and resuspended with TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were disrupted with glass beads, and the cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 720 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. One volume of TNE buffer containing 2m NaCl, 5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 2% SDS, or 200 mm Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) was added to the supernatants (27Nishikawa S. Nakano A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1093: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting using a rat mAb 3F10 against HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland), a mouse mAb M2 against FLAG, or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against End3p. For determination of the subcellular localization of proteins, spheroplasts were broken in lysis buffer as described above, and unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifuging again at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatants (1 ml) were layered onto 1-ml steps of 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, and 60% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2(28Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 140 min at 4 °C in a TST41.14 rotor. Eleven fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top of the gradient. Aliquots from each fraction were diluted with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were then resuspended in B88. For analysis by immunoblotting, samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer by vortexing and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using a rat mAb 3F10 against HA, a rabbit polyclonal Ab against Wbp1p or Emp47p, or a mouse mAb against the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase 100-kDa subunit (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands). The amount of protein in the fractions was quantified by densitometric scanning on a computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Indirect immunofluorescence on whole fixed yeast cells was performed as described by Beck et al. (29Beck T. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For double labeling, a mouse mAb 12CA5 against HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) followed by an indocarbocyanine, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and a rabbit polyclonal Ab against Kar2p (kindly provided by R. Schekman) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (100× objective). LCB3 and its homologue, YSR3, encode LCBP phosphatases in yeast (15Qie L. Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16110-16117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that lcb3 deletion mutant cells fail to incorporate exogenously added DHS efficiently into ceramide and subsequently into sphingolipids, whereas endogenously synthesized LCBs are still converted to sphingolipids (16Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B.

J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results suggest a possible role for a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of exogenous LCB in ceramide synthesis. However, this has not been tested directly. To test whether LCB kinase is required for incorporation of exogenous DHS into sphingolipids, we constructed multiple deletion strains for the two LCB kinases encoded by LCB4 and LCB5 (13Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and measured sphingolipid synthesis by labeling with [3H]DHS at 24 °C. The doublelcb4/5 deletion mutant cells could not synthesize DHS-1P (Fig. 1, A andB). This phenotype indicates that Lcb4p and Lcb5p are the only LCB kinases in yeast, as described previously (13Nagiec M.M. Skrzypek M. Nagiec E.E. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19437-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As expected,lcb3 mutant cells accumulated DHS-1P. The lcb3mutant cells showed an 8-fold increase in DHS-1P synthesis after a short time labeling (labeling for 30 min) and a 5-fold increase after a long time labeling (labeling for 120 min) when compared with wild-type cells. Quantitative analysis also revealed that incorporation of [3H]DHS into glycerolphospholipids (GPLs: PE, PC, and PI) in the lcb3 mutant was increased 2- to 6-fold compared with wild-type cells throughout the 120-min labeling time. The decrease in DHS-1P in wild-type and lcb3 mutant cells as GPL levels increase is consistent with a previous study, which suggested that DHS is incorporated into GPLs through phosphorylation of DHS and subsequent cleavage by the LCBP lyase, Dpl1p (16Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This idea is further supported by our finding that the lcb4/5 mutant, which fails to produce DHS-1P, could not synthesize GPLs from exogenously added DHS. Consequently, the lcb4/5 mutant cells accumulated more PHS than lcb3 mutant or wild-type cells (Fig. 1 A). Importantly, when the lcb4/5 mutant cells were labeled with [3H]DHS for 30 min, the incorporation of [3H]DHS into sphingolipids (IPC-C and M(IP)2C) was hardly detectable (Fig. 1 B) or was obviously reduced compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1 C). After longer labeling times, 120 min (Fig. 1 B) and 90 min (Fig. 1 C), the lcb4/5 mutants showed 40–50% of the amount of sphingolipid synthesis found in wild-type cells. In contrast, when lcb4/5 mutant cells were labeled with [3H]myo-inositol for 15 or 30 min at 24 °C, almost normal levels of all sphingolipids were observed (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous finding thatde novo synthesis of sphingolipids is only slightly, if at all affected by deletion of both LCB3 and YSR3genes (18Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results suggest that exogenous DHS must undergo a cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation to be efficiently incorporated into sphingolipids. We observed that the lcb4 mutant cells could not make any detectable DHS-1P, as well as GPLs from exogenously added [3H]DHS, but the lcb5 mutant cells could (data not shown). Therefore, we tested whether Lcb4p is the major kinase responsible for sphingolipid synthesis from exogenous DHS. To test this, we quantified the amount of synthesized sphingolipid in the single lcb4 and lcb5 mutant cells. Thelcb4 mutant cells showed 20–30% of the amount of sphingolipid synthesis found in wild-type cells, whereas thelcb5 mutant cells showed only a slight reduction during a long time period of labeling (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that Lcb4p but not Lcb5p is required for an efficient sphingolipid synthesis from exogenous DHS. During a long labeling period, lcb4/5 mutant cells can synthesize detectable amounts of sphingolipids from exogenous DHS. In contrast, lcb3 mutant cells synthesize no detectable sphingolipid during this time (Fig. 1, A and B). These results raised the question of whether Lcb3p is only required if exogenous DHS become phosphorylated. Indeed, a mutant lacking both the LCB kinases and the major phosphatase (lcb3/4/5) synthesized similar amounts of sphingolipids as wild-type cells in a long term labeling experiment (Fig. 1, A and B). After a shorter labeling time, the lcb3/4/5 mutant resembled thelcb3 or lcb4/5 mutant in the incorporation of exogenous DHS into sphingolipids. Phenotypes in DHS-1P, GPLs, and PHS synthesis observed for thelcb3/4/5 mutant are identical to thelcb4/5 mutant. These results suggest that, if exogenous LCB does not get phosphorylated, it can bypass the normal route for incorporation into sphingolipid, which is dependent upon Lcb3p. The above data suggest that Lcb4p is required for an efficient ceramide synthesis from exogenous DHS. Therefore, we decided to measure ceramide synthase activity directly in an in vitro system that we recently developed (26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezman H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).In vitro ceramide synthase activity with [3H]DHS requires a membrane fraction, ATP, and cytosol (26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, the reaction is temperature- and CoA-dependent (26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Schorling S. Vallee B. Barz W.P. Riezman H. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). When wild-type membranes were incubated with wild-type cytosol, an ATP-regenerating system, GDP-mannose, CoA, and a mix of liposomes containing C26 and PI, dihydroceramide (DH-Cer) was preferentially synthesized (Fig.2 A). Under the same conditions, very little phytoceramide was synthesized (Ref. 26Funato K. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and data not shown). This DH-Cer synthesis was completely inhibited by fumonisin B1 (FuB), a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase (31Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not by aureobasidin A (AbA), a specific inhibitor of IPC synthase (32Zhong W. Murphy D.J. Georgopapadakou N.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Membrane and cytosol derived from the doublelcb3/ysr3 mutant cells failed to synthesize DH-Cer. The single lcb3 mutant showed a strong reduction of the incorporation of DHS into DH-Cer when compared with wild-type components, whereas ysr3 mutant components showed normal synthesis (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that Lcb3p and Ysr3p do not have redundant functions in ceramide synthesis. This is consistent with previous studies (18Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Membrane and cytosol from either the lcb4/5 mutant or thelcb3/4/5 mutant had no detectable ceramide synthase activity. The complete lack of in vitroceramide synthesis (Fig. 2 A) and in vitrosphingolipid synthesis (data not shown) withlcb3/ysr3, lcb4/5, andlcb3/4/5 mutants suggests that thein vitro assay measures only the efficient pathway for ceramide and sphingolipid synthesis that is mediated by LCB phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

(21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that a temperature-sensitive mutant of YDJ1 was defective for translocation at the nonpermissive temperature. However, Atencio and Yaffe (22Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) showed that ppαF is translocated normally in deletion mutants of YDJ1. Translocation of ppαF was defective in a strain expressing a mutant form of Ydj1p that cannot be farnesylated indicating that the lipid-modified version of Ydj1p plays a role in protein translocation (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl.

DnaK and GrpE together relieved the DnaJ-dependent inhibition, but neither alone had any effect. Export of certain precursor proteins was defective in somednaK and dnaJ mutant strains of E. coli (24Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Functional interactions between yeast Hsp70s and DnaJ homologs have been studied in vitro and in vivo (13Becker J. Walter W.

Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) explored the in vivo interactions of SSA1 and YDJ1 in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. A temperature-sensitive SSA1 mutant was synthetically lethal with a YDJ1 deletion mutant suggesting that SSA1and YDJ1 genetically interact (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments showed that ppαF, which had accumulated at the nonpermissive temperature, could not be translocated. These results suggested that the chaperones maintain translocation competence by binding to ppαF co-translationally, but they cannot rescue aggregated ppαF. Strains containing mutant versions of Ssa1p with defective ATP-binding pockets fail to interact productively with Ydj1p and accumulate ppαF (27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We undertook the following study to gain insight into the mechanism by which Ssa1p and Ydj1p contribute to the post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. To avoid the effects of endogenous chaperones and other proteins contaminating earlier preparations of ppαF, which was synthesized in wheat germ extracts or reticulocyte lysates, we used a histidine-tagged, affinity purified version of ppαF (AP-ppαF6H) in translocation assays. We clarified the contributions of membrane-bound and cytosolic Ydj1p, by comparing the translocation efficiencies of the chaperones using wild-type and Ydj1p-deficient microsomal membranes. We demonstrate that Ssa1p stimulates translocation by preventing the aggregation of AP-ppαF6H. Although Ydj1p stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for Ssa1p-dependent protein folding of luciferase in vitro (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we show that it is not essential for post-translational protein translocation. However, Ydj1p alone stimulates post-translational translocation by preventing AP-ppαF6H aggregation.DISCUSSIONWe explored the roles of cytosolic chaperones in post-translational translocation in vitro using AP-ppαF6H. In the absence of chaperones, urea-denatured AP-ppαF6H was rapidly translocated into wild-type or Ydj1p-deficient microsomes upon dilution into reactions. In the absence of microsomes and chaperones, AP-ppαF6H aggregated and became translocation incompetent. Ssa1p, Ydj1p, or both chaperones prevented aggregation and maintained the translocation competence of some AP-ppαF6H. These results provide the first biochemical evidence supporting the notion that Ssa1p and Ydj1p stimulate post-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing the aggregation of presecretory proteins. Ydj1p, however, is not essential for translocation and its farnesylated, membrane-bound version provides no substantial benefit. Although the chaperones alone or together maintained translocation competence of AP-ppαF6H, their ability to restore the translocation competence of aggregated precursor was negligible.Genetic (12Deshaies R.J.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2875-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) studies have shown that cytosolic Hsp70s stimulate the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Insight into the mechanism by which Ssa1p stimulates translocation is provided by the experiments reported here demonstrating that Ssa1p acts by preventing ppαF aggregation. Further insight was obtained using NEM-Ssa1p, which has defective nucleotide-binding and ATPase activities (31Liu Q. Levy E.J. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29937-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NEM-Ssa1p prevented the aggregation of AP-ppαF6H, but failed to maintain its translocation competence. This is consistent with the idea that NEM-Ssa1p can bind AP-ppαF6H, but its subsequent release, if any, is inadequate to support translocation. Similarly, NEM-Ssa1p can prevent the aggregation of denatured luciferase, but cannot refold it (33Hermawan A. Chirico W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ssa1p likely prevents aggregation by directly interacting with AP-ppαF6H. We previously reported that cytosolic Hsc70 associates with ppαF in wheat germ extracts (16Chirico W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, others have shown that Hsc70 can be photocross-linked to ppαF translated in reticulocyte lysates (15Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The translocation competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins is also maintained by cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones likely through direct association (44Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Ydj1p was previously shown to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to facilitate the release of bound polypeptides from Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to prevent the aggregation of rhodanese (10Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and to cooperate with Ssa1p in the folding of denatured luciferase (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 45Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although we found that Ydj1p hindered AP-ppαF6H aggregation and maintained its translocation competence, it, unlike Ssa1p, did not stimulate translocation of AP-ppαF6H upon dilution into complete reactions containing microsomes. This result suggests that Ydj1p may prevent AP-ppαF6H aggregation less effectively than Ssa1p. Results reported here demonstrating that AP-ppαF6H can be post-translationally translocated into microsomes isolated fromydj1 null strains indicate that membrane-bound Ydj1p is not essential for this process. These results are consistent with those obtained from in vivo experiments showing that ppαF is efficiently exported from ydj1 null strains (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In such strains, however, ppαF also has the option of entering the endoplasmic reticulum co-translationally via the SRP-dependent pathway. Although our results do not support the notion that membrane-bound Ydj1p acts as a release factor for ppαF·Ssa1p complexes, this hypothesis requires further study.Using chaperones isolated from E. coli, Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) reported that E. coli DnaJ completely inhibited the in vitro post-translational translocation of reticulocyte lysate-translated ppαF into yeast microsomes. DnaK and GrpE reversed the inhibition. In contrast, we found that Ydj1p only partially inhibited translocation of AP-ppαF6H even when present at high concentrations. Ydj1p may inhibit post-translational translocation by competing with Ssa1p for binding sites on ppαF6H or by stabilizing ADP forms of the Ssa1p·ppαF6H complexes. Perhaps the lack of agreement between the two studies arises from the difference in the source of reaction components. All components used in our system were derived from yeast, whereas those used by Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were derived from three different organisms. Furthermore, we used an affinity purified version of ppαF, whereas the ppαF used by Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was not purified after synthesis in a crude reticulocyte lysate.An important issue is whether Ssa1p and Ydj1p work together or in parallel in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results support the idea that they work in parallel. However, the low cellular concentration of Ydj1p and the higher maintenance of translocation activity of Ssa1p suggest that Ssa1p would monopolize this pathway if they recognized overlapping sites on ppαF. Three reports support the idea that Ydj1p and Ssa1p cooperate in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). First, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ydj1p accumulated ppαF at the nonpermissive temperature and the mutant protein, ydj1–151p, only weakly stimulated the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Second, Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) found a synthetically lethal relationship between SSA1 andYDJ1. Furthermore, a strain expressing Ssa1p, but lacking Ssa2p, Ssa3p, Ssa4p, and Ydj1p accumulated ppαF and its glycosylated intermediates at 23 °C (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Third, mutants of Ssa1p containing amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding domain failed to bind unfolded polypeptides, did not stimulate post-translational translocation of ppαF into microsomes, and their ATPase activity could not be stimulated by Ydj1p (27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains possible, however, that cells expressing high levels of unfolded proteins at nonpermissive conditions (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or lacking the full complement of cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones at permissive temperatures (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), contain insufficient amounts of Ssa1p to support post-translational translocation. In ourin vitro experiments, Ydj1p did not enhance the ability of Ssa1p to prevent ppαF aggregation, to maintain translocation competence of ppαF, or to stimulate post-translational translocation. The normally beneficial cooperation between Ssa1p and Ydj1p during protein folding (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) may be unnecessary and counterproductive in the post-translational translocation of unfolded ppαF. Hsp701 molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones work together in a variety of cellular compartments to guide the folding of proteins and to aid the translocation of proteins across membranes (reviewed in Ref. 1Bukau B.

Hsp40s stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70s (8Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1988; 332: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) showed that yeast cytosolic Hsp70s stimulated the in vitro translocation of prepro-α-factor (ppαF) into yeast microsomes. Complexes containing Hsp70s and presecretory and mitochondrial precursor proteins have been identified in wheat germ extracts and reticulocyte lysates (15Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Chirico W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Lain B. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15588-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to stimulate post-translational translocation is not shared by all Hsp70s or by other stress protein families. Neither Hsp60 (18Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann M. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7414-7421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stimulates translocation. However, DnaK can partially substitute for yeast cytosolic Hsp70s in vitro(19Brodsky J.L. Hamamoto S.

Stress-induced Proteins. 96. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 163-174Google Scholar). Several laboratories have explored the role of DnaJ homologs in protein translocation. Caplan et al. (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that a temperature-sensitive mutant of YDJ1 was defective for translocation at the nonpermissive temperature. However, Atencio and Yaffe (22Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) showed that ppαF is translocated normally in deletion mutants of YDJ1. Translocation of ppαF was defective in a strain expressing a mutant form of Ydj1p that cannot be farnesylated indicating that the lipid-modified version of Ydj1p plays a role in protein translocation (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that Escherichia coli DnaJ completely inhibited post-translational translocation of ppαF in vitro. DnaK and GrpE together relieved the DnaJ-dependent inhibition, but neither alone had any effect. Export of certain precursor proteins was defective in somednaK and dnaJ mutant strains of E. coli (24Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Functional interactions between yeast Hsp70s and DnaJ homologs have been studied in vitro and in vivo (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

Ydj1p stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and together they constitute a protein folding machinery capable of refolding denatured luciferase (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) explored the in vivo interactions of SSA1 and YDJ1 in protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. A temperature-sensitive SSA1 mutant was synthetically lethal with a YDJ1 deletion mutant suggesting that SSA1and YDJ1 genetically interact (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments showed that ppαF, which had accumulated at the nonpermissive temperature, could not be translocated. These results suggested that the chaperones maintain translocation competence by binding to ppαF co-translationally, but they cannot rescue aggregated ppαF. Strains containing mutant versions of Ssa1p with defective ATP-binding pockets fail to interact productively with Ydj1p and accumulate ppαF (27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook the following study to gain insight into the mechanism by which Ssa1p and Ydj1p contribute to the post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. To avoid the effects of endogenous chaperones and other proteins contaminating earlier preparations of ppαF, which was synthesized in wheat germ extracts or reticulocyte lysates, we used a histidine-tagged, affinity purified version of ppαF (AP-ppαF6H) in translocation assays. We clarified the contributions of membrane-bound and cytosolic Ydj1p, by comparing the translocation efficiencies of the chaperones using wild-type and Ydj1p-deficient microsomal membranes. We demonstrate that Ssa1p stimulates translocation by preventing the aggregation of AP-ppαF6H. Although Ydj1p stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for Ssa1p-dependent protein folding of luciferase in vitro (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we show that it is not essential for post-translational protein translocation. However, Ydj1p alone stimulates post-translational translocation by preventing AP-ppαF6H aggregation. DISCUSSIONWe explored the roles of cytosolic chaperones in post-translational translocation in vitro using AP-ppαF6H. In the absence of chaperones, urea-denatured AP-ppαF6H was rapidly translocated into wild-type or Ydj1p-deficient microsomes upon dilution into reactions. In the absence of microsomes and chaperones, AP-ppαF6H aggregated and became translocation incompetent. Ssa1p, Ydj1p, or both chaperones prevented aggregation and maintained the translocation competence of some AP-ppαF6H. These results provide the first biochemical evidence supporting the notion that Ssa1p and Ydj1p stimulate post-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing the aggregation of presecretory proteins. Ydj1p, however, is not essential for translocation and its farnesylated, membrane-bound version provides no substantial benefit. Although the chaperones alone or together maintained translocation competence of AP-ppαF6H, their ability to restore the translocation competence of aggregated precursor was negligible.Genetic (12Deshaies R.J. Koch B.D. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2875-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) studies have shown that cytosolic Hsp70s stimulate the post-translational translocation of precursor proteins into endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Insight into the mechanism by which Ssa1p stimulates translocation is provided by the experiments reported here demonstrating that Ssa1p acts by preventing ppαF aggregation. Further insight was obtained using NEM-Ssa1p, which has defective nucleotide-binding and ATPase activities (31Liu Q. Levy E.J. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29937-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NEM-Ssa1p prevented the aggregation of AP-ppαF6H, but failed to maintain its translocation competence. This is consistent with the idea that NEM-Ssa1p can bind AP-ppαF6H, but its subsequent release, if any, is inadequate to support translocation. Similarly, NEM-Ssa1p can prevent the aggregation of denatured luciferase, but cannot refold it (33Hermawan A. Chirico W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ssa1p likely prevents aggregation by directly interacting with AP-ppαF6H. We previously reported that cytosolic Hsc70 associates with ppαF in wheat germ extracts (16Chirico W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, others have shown that Hsc70 can be photocross-linked to ppαF translated in reticulocyte lysates (15Plath K. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The translocation competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins is also maintained by cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones likely through direct association (44Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Ydj1p was previously shown to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to facilitate the release of bound polypeptides from Ssa1p (25Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to prevent the aggregation of rhodanese (10Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and to cooperate with Ssa1p in the folding of denatured luciferase (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 45Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although we found that Ydj1p hindered AP-ppαF6H aggregation and maintained its translocation competence, it, unlike Ssa1p, did not stimulate translocation of AP-ppαF6H upon dilution into complete reactions containing microsomes. This result suggests that Ydj1p may prevent AP-ppαF6H aggregation less effectively than Ssa1p. Results reported here demonstrating that AP-ppαF6H can be post-translationally translocated into microsomes isolated fromydj1 null strains indicate that membrane-bound Ydj1p is not essential for this process. These results are consistent with those obtained from in vivo experiments showing that ppαF is efficiently exported from ydj1 null strains (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Atencio D.P. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In such strains, however, ppαF also has the option of entering the endoplasmic reticulum co-translationally via the SRP-dependent pathway. Although our results do not support the notion that membrane-bound Ydj1p acts as a release factor for ppαF·Ssa1p complexes, this hypothesis requires further study.Using chaperones isolated from E. coli, Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) reported that E. coli DnaJ completely inhibited the in vitro post-translational translocation of reticulocyte lysate-translated ppαF into yeast microsomes. DnaK and GrpE reversed the inhibition. In contrast, we found that Ydj1p only partially inhibited translocation of AP-ppαF6H even when present at high concentrations. Ydj1p may inhibit post-translational translocation by competing with Ssa1p for binding sites on ppαF6H or by stabilizing ADP forms of the Ssa1p·ppαF6H complexes. Perhaps the lack of agreement between the two studies arises from the difference in the source of reaction components. All components used in our system were derived from yeast, whereas those used by Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were derived from three different organisms. Furthermore, we used an affinity purified version of ppαF, whereas the ppαF used by Hendrick et al. (23Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was not purified after synthesis in a crude reticulocyte lysate.An important issue is whether Ssa1p and Ydj1p work together or in parallel in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results support the idea that they work in parallel. However, the low cellular concentration of Ydj1p and the higher maintenance of translocation activity of Ssa1p suggest that Ssa1p would monopolize this pathway if they recognized overlapping sites on ppαF. Three reports support the idea that Ydj1p and Ssa1p cooperate in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). First, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ydj1p accumulated ppαF at the nonpermissive temperature and the mutant protein, ydj1–151p, only weakly stimulated the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Second, Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) found a synthetically lethal relationship between SSA1 andYDJ1. Furthermore, a strain expressing Ssa1p, but lacking Ssa2p, Ssa3p, Ssa4p, and Ydj1p accumulated ppαF and its glycosylated intermediates at 23 °C (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Third, mutants of Ssa1p containing amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding domain failed to bind unfolded polypeptides, did not stimulate post-translational translocation of ppαF into microsomes, and their ATPase activity could not be stimulated by Ydj1p (27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains possible, however, that cells expressing high levels of unfolded proteins at nonpermissive conditions (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or lacking the full complement of cytosolic Hsp70 chaperones at permissive temperatures (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), contain insufficient amounts of Ssa1p to support post-translational translocation. In ourin vitro experiments, Ydj1p did not enhance the ability of Ssa1p to prevent ppαF aggregation, to maintain translocation competence of ppαF, or to stimulate post-translational translocation. The normally beneficial cooperation between Ssa1p and Ydj1p during protein folding (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) may be unnecessary and counterproductive in the post-translational translocation of unfolded ppαF. We explored the roles of cytosolic chaperones in post-translational translocation in vitro using AP-ppαF6H. In the absence of chaperones, urea-denatured AP-ppαF6H was rapidly translocated into wild-type or Ydj1p-deficient microsomes upon dilution into reactions. In the absence of microsomes and chaperones, AP-ppαF6H aggregated and became translocation incompetent. Ssa1p, Ydj1p, or both chaperones prevented aggregation and maintained the translocation competence of some AP-ppαF6H. These results provide the first biochemical evidence supporting the notion that Ssa1p and Ydj1p stimulate post-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum by preventing the aggregation of presecretory proteins. Ydj1p, however, is not essential for translocation and its farnesylated, membrane-bound version provides no substantial benefit. Although the chaperones alone or together maintained translocation competence of AP-ppαF6H, their ability to restore the translocation competence of aggregated precursor was negligible.

Three reports support the idea that Ydj1p and Ssa1p cooperate in post-translational translocation of presecretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). First, a temperature-sensitive mutant of Ydj1p accumulated ppαF at the nonpermissive temperature and the mutant protein, ydj1–151p, only weakly stimulated the ATPase activity of Ssa1p (21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Second, Becker et al. (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) found a synthetically lethal relationship between SSA1 andYDJ1. Furthermore, a strain expressing Ssa1p, but lacking Ssa2p, Ssa3p, Ssa4p, and Ydj1p accumulated ppαF and its glycosylated intermediates at 23 °C (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Third, mutants of Ssa1p containing amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding domain failed to bind unfolded polypeptides, did not stimulate post-translational translocation of ppαF into microsomes, and their ATPase activity could not be stimulated by Ydj1p (27McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains possible, however, that cells expressing high levels of unfolded proteins at nonpermissive conditions (13Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 21Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G.

Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), contain insufficient amounts of Ssa1p to support post-translational translocation. In ourin vitro experiments, Ydj1p did not enhance the ability of Ssa1p to prevent ppαF aggregation, to maintain translocation competence of ppαF, or to stimulate post-translational translocation. The normally beneficial cooperation between Ssa1p and Ydj1p during protein folding (26Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) may be unnecessary and counterproductive in the post-translational translocation of unfolded ppαF.

https://openalex.org/W2032955631,"Although large amounts of epidermal growth factor (EGF) are found in the synovial fluids of arthritic cartilage, the role of EGF in arthritis is not clearly understood. This study investigated the effect of EGF on differentiation and on inflammatory responses such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in articular chondrocytes. EGF caused a loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotype as demonstrated by inhibition of type II collagen expression and proteoglycan synthesis. EGF also induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.

Neither the inhibition of COX-2 expression and PGE2 production nor the addition of exogenous PGE2 affected EGF-induced dedifferentiation. However, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production were significantly enhanced in chondrocytes that were dedifferentiated by serial subculture, and EGF also potentiated COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, although these cells were less sensitive to EGF. Dedifferentiation-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2production were mediated by ERK1/2 and p38 kinase signaling.

Physiol. 2002; 192: 102-112Google Scholar), the role of EGF in the pathophysiology of arthritic disease is not fully understood. EGF is known to inhibit chondrocyte differentiation in Meckel's cartilage (3Ishizeki K. Takahashi N. Nawa T. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 304: 67-80Google Scholar) and chondrogenesis in chick limb bud mesenchymal cells (4Dealy C.N. Scranton V. Cheng H.C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 43-55Google Scholar, 5Yoon Y.-M.

EGF is also known to inhibit accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan in articular chondrocytes (6Prins A.P.A. Lipman J.M. McDevitt C.A. Sokoloff L. Arthritis Rheum. 1982; 25: 1228-1238Google Scholar, 7Verschure P.J. Joosten L.A. Van der Kraan P.M. Van den Berg W.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 455-460Google Scholar), suggesting that EGF not only inhibits chondrocyte differentiation but also causes loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotype. Articular chondrocytes are characterized by their synthesis of cartilage-specific structural macromolecules such as type II collagen and aggrecan, and loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotype or dedifferentiation causes cessation of type II collagen expression and induction of fibroblastic types I and III collagens (8Sandell L.J. Aigner I. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar). Although the contribution of dedifferentiation in the pathophysiology of arthritis is poorly understood, chondrocyte dedifferentiation is observed in arthritic cartilage, suggesting that EGF contribute to arthritis. EGF stimulates expression of inflammatory molecules such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2(PGE2) in various cell types including cell lines originating from chondrocytes (9Sakai T.

However, there are no published data regarding EGF effects on COX-2 expression and PGE2production in primary culture articular chondrocytes. Although the role of EGF in PGE2 production is not clear, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cause PGE2production, which is found in arthritic joints in large amounts. PGE2 is a major mediator of cartilage inflammation, cartilage and juxta-articular bone erosion, and angiogenesis (10Robinson D.R. Tashjian A.H.J. Levine L. J. Clin.

The rate-limiting steps in PG synthesis are hydrolysis of phospholipids to produce free arachidonic acid (catalyzed by phospholipase A2) and conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2,which is catalyzed by the two isoforms of COX (16Smith W.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is rapidly induced in response to a wide variety of cytokines such as IL-1β and growth factors including EGF. COX-2 expression is regulated at both transcription and post-transcription levels (18Miller C. Zhang M. He Y. Zhao J. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. Di Battista J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 392-413Google Scholar, 19Newton R. Seybold J. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Barnes P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32312-32321Google Scholar, 20Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G.

Although the molecular mechanism underlying COX-2 expression is not fully understood, several studies indicate that its expression is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subtypes including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, depending on the types of extracellular stimuli and cells (20Lasa M.

In addition to regulation of COX-2 expression and/or activity, ERK and p38 MAPK are involved in the regulation of chondrocyte dedifferentiation caused by serial subculture (25Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar) or nitric-oxide production (26Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Google Scholar), suggesting these MAPKs regulate both dedifferentiation and inflammatory responses such as COX expression and PGE2 production. The current study investigated the role of EGF in the maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype, COX-2 expression, and PGE2production. We also examined the functional relationship between EGF-induced dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression and characterized signaling pathways involved in EGF action. We report that EGF stimulates dedifferentiation, COX-2 expression, and PGE2production in articular chondrocytes via ERK1/2 and p38 kinase signaling and that EGF-induced dedifferentiation further potentiates inflammatory responses in articular chondrocytes. Articular chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage slices of 2-week-old New Zealand White rabbits by enzymatic digestion as described previously (25Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar). Cartilage slices were dissociated enzymatically in 0.2% collagenase type II (381 units/mg, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Individual cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells were plated on culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and cells were confluent after approximately 5 days. The 2.5-day cell cultures were treated with EGF (Invitrogen). The following pharmacological agents were added 1 h prior to EGF: PD98059 (Calbiochem) to inhibit MEK1/2 (28Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar); SB203580 (Calbiochem) to inhibit p38 kinase (29Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar); and tyrphostin AG1478 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) to antagonize EGF receptors (30Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar). In some experiments, passage (P) 0 cells were subcultured to P3 by plating cells at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. Differentiation status of articular chondrocytes was determined by examining the accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycan with Alcian blue staining or expression of type II collagen by immunoblot analysis as described previously (25Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar). Dedifferentiated chondrocytes at P4 were three-dimensionally cultured in alginate gel beads or as pellets as described previously (25Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 1.25% sodium alginate prepared in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl at a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cell suspension was slowly dropped into a gelatin solution (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 102 mmCaCl2). Cells in alginate gel beads were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and refed every other day and were recovered by solubilizing alginate with 2 volumes of 50 mm EDTA and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). For pellet culture, dedifferentiated cells were resuspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and 1 ml of aliquots was pelleted by centrifugation. Cells in alginate gel beads and pellets were incubated for up to 8 days. Rabbit joint cartilage explants (∼125 mm3) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm slices as described previously (31Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. Development. 2002; 129: 5541-5550Google Scholar). The sections were stained by standard procedures using Alcian blue or antibody against type II collagen or COX-2 and visualized by developing with a kit purchased from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). Whole cell lysates were prepared by extracting proteins using a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mmNa3VO4). The proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose sheet was then blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. COX-2 was detected using antibody purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and type II collagen was detected using antibodies purchased from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). The bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence. ERK1/2 activation was examined using immunoblot analysis as described previously (25Yoon Y.-M. Kim S.-J. Oh C.-D. Ju J.-W. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar) using antibodies specific to activated threonine 202- and tyrosine 204-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). p38 kinase activity was determined by immune complex kinase assays as described previously (26Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Google Scholar, 27Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases as described above. Total cell lysates were precipitated with polyclonal anti-p38 kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of activating transcription factor-2 protein as a substrate (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C, and phosphorylated activating transcription factor-2 was detected by autoradiography following gel electrophoresis. PGE2 production was determined by measuring the levels of cellular and secreted PGE2 using an assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). P0 cells or dedifferentiated P4 cells were seeded in standard 96-well microtiter plates at 2 × 104 cells/well. After the indicated treatments, total PGE2 was quantified according to the manufacturer's protocol. PGE2 levels were calculated against a standard curve of PGE2 and normalized against the amount of genomic DNA. To examine the effects of EGF on articular cartilage chondrocyte differentiation, cartilage explant cultures were treated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 48 h, and expression of cartilage-specific matrix molecules were determined. EGF caused a dramatic loss of type II collagen and sulfated proteoglycan as determined by immunohistochemical staining and Alcian blue staining, respectively (Fig.1 A). EGF also inhibited type II collagen expression in primary culture articular chondrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and this inhibition was blocked when cells were pretreated with the EGF receptor antagonist AG1478 (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, EGF treatment of primary culture cells blocked the accumulation of sulfated proteoglycan in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C), and the inhibition was also prevented by AG1478 (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that EGF induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes in both cartilage explants and primary culture cells. The effect of EGF on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production was investigated using both cartilage explant cultures and primary culture chondrocytes. In cartilage explants, EGF stimulated COX-2 expression as determined by immunohistochemical staining (Fig.2 A). In primary culture chondrocytes, EGF increased protein levels of COX-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 B). COX-2 was detected 1 h after EGF treatment, and levels peaked at 12 h. The EGF effects on primary culture chondrocytes were completely blocked by AG1478 pretreatment (Fig.2 B). Consistent with the induction of COX-2 expression, EGF stimulated PGE2 production (Fig. 2 C) that was detectable 1 h after EGF addition (Fig. 2 D) and was blocked by AG1478 (Fig. 2 E). These data indicate that EGF not only causes dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes but also stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. EGF (5 ng/ml) activated both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase in articular chondrocytes (Fig.3 A, upper panel), and activation of both kinases was inhibited by AG1478 (Fig.3 A, lower panel). To determine whether ERK1/2 activation is associated with dedifferentiation and/or COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, chondrocytes were treated with EGF in the absence or presence of PD98059, which inhibits ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). PD98059 blocked EGF-stimulated dedifferentiation as indicated by the resumption of type II collagen expression (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) and sulfated proteoglycan accumulation (Fig. 3 C). PD98059 partially blocked EGF-stimulated COX-2 expression (Fig. 3 B,upper panel) but completely blocked PGE2production (Fig. 3 D). Inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) completely blocked both EGF-stimulated COX-2 expression (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) and PGE2 production (Fig. 3 D). In contrast to the effects of ERK inhibition, the inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 did not significantly alter the EGF-induced decrease in type II collagen expression (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) and synthesis of proteoglycans (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these results indicate that EGF-induced dedifferentiation is regulated by ERK1/2 activity but not by p38 kinase activity, whereas both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase regulate COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Because EGF in articular chondrocytes causes both dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression/PGE2production, we next examined the functional relationship between EGF-induced dedifferentiation and inflammatory responses. Differentiation status-dependent COX-2 expression and PGE2 production were examined first. Serial subculturing of chondrocytes caused dedifferentiation as demonstrated by cessation of type II collagen expression (Fig.4 A). This chondrocyte phenotype loss was accompanied by significantly increased levels of COX-2 protein (Fig. 4 A) and PGE2 production (Fig. 4 B). When these dedifferentiated P3 cells were redifferentiated into chondrocytes by three-dimensional culture in alginate gel (Fig. 4 C) or by pellet culture (Fig.4 D), COX-2 protein levels dropped to those observed in differentiated P0 cells. Therefore, COX-2 expression and PGE2 production were inversely related to the differentiation status of articular chondrocytes. Because PGE2 production is known to modulate chondrocyte differentiation (32Goldring M.B. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Lai W.F. Am. J. Ther. 1996; 3: 9-16Google Scholar, 33Schwartz Z. Gilley R.M. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1825-1834Google Scholar, 34Goldring M.B. Berenbaum F. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 386-388Google Scholar), we next examined whether COX-2 expression and the resulting PGE2production in EGF-treated cells are involved in dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. The COX-2 inhibitors indomethacin or NS398 (35Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Google Scholar) significantly blocked EGF-induced PGE2 production as expected (Fig. 5 A). However, EGF-induced inhibition of sulfated proteoglycan accumulation (Fig.5 B) and type II collagen expression (Fig. 5 C) were not affected by indomethacin or NS398. In addition, treatment of P0 cells with exogenous PGE2 did not significantly affect proteoglycan synthesis (Fig. 5 B) or type II collagen expression (Fig. 5 C). These data indicate that COX-2 expression and PGE2 production are not involved in EGF-induced dedifferentiation of chondrocytes. We examined the effect of EGF on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in dedifferentiated cells. We found that EGF further increased COX-2 expression (Fig.6 A) and PGE2production in dedifferentiated P3 cells (Fig. 6 B). Although the sensitivity of dedifferentiated chondrocytes to EGF was much less than that of P0 cells, the levels of COX-2 and PGE2 were much higher in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. In an attempt to reveal the mechanisms underlying increased expression of COX-2 and PGE2 production in dedifferentiated cells, the differentiation status-dependent activity of MAPK subtypes was examined. Serial subculture of chondrocytes to P3 caused sustained activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 kinase (Fig.7 A). The inhibition of ERK activity with PD98059 but not p38 kinase activity with SB203580 partially maintained type II collagen expression in P3 cells (Fig.7 B). Blocking ERK activity did not significantly affect dedifferentiation-induced increase of COX-2 protein level (Fig.7 B), but it did inhibit COX-2 activity as demonstrated by the inhibition of PGE2 production (Fig. 7 C). The inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 blocked both dedifferentiation and EGF-induced potentiation of COX-2 expression (Fig. 7 B) and PGE2 production (Fig. 7 C). The above results suggest that dedifferentiation-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase causes increased COX-2 expression and PGE2production in articular chondrocytes.Figure 7ERK1/2 and p38 kinase mediates dedifferentiation-induced increase of COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. A, chondrocytes were subcultured to P3, and ERK1/2 and p38 kinase activity were determined by immunoblot analysis and immune complex kinase assay, respectively.B and C, differentiated P0 chondrocytes or dedifferentiated P3 cells were either untreated (Con) or treated with 20 μm PD98059 (PD) or 20 μm SB203580 (SB) for 1 h and then exposed to vehicle alone or 5 ng/ml EGF for 24 h. Type II collagen and COX-2 were detected using immunoblot analysis (B). PGE2 production was measured using an assay kit and normalized by determining the amount of total genomic DNA. The data represent results of a typical experiment or mean value ± S.D. from at least four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Chondrocytes in normal articular cartilage are a unique cell type in that their differentiated phenotype is reversible. Chondrocyte phenotype is regulated by a balance of anabolic and catabolic molecular reactions that are involved in maintaining homeostasis of cartilage tissue (8Sandell L.J. Aigner I. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar). Differentiated chondrocytes lose their phenotype and transform into fibroblast-like cells upon exposure to soluble factors such as IL-1β (36Goldring M.B. Birkhead J. Sandell L.J. Kimura T. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2026-2037Google Scholar), retinoic acid (31Ryu J.-H. Kim S.-J. Kim S.-H. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Chun C.-H. Oh S.-H. Seong J.-K. Huh T.-L. Chun J.-S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8412-8420Google Scholar, 39Benya P.D. Padilla S.R. Nimni M.E. Cell. 1978; 15: 1313-1321Google Scholar). Such a destruction of homeostasis is believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis (8Sandell L.J. Aigner I. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Google Scholar, 40Gay S. Gay R.E. Koopman W.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 39-47Google Scholar). Because large amounts of EGF are found in the synovial fluid of arthritic cartilage (1Satoh K. Kikuchi S. Sekimata M. Kabuyama Y. Homma M.K. Homma Y. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 260-265Google Scholar, 2Lui K.E. Panchal A.S. Santhanagopal S. Dixon S.J. Bernier S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 102-112Google Scholar), it is likely that EGF contributes to the disease, although the role of EGF is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that EGF caused both dedifferentiation and inflammatory responses such as COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. We also demonstrated that dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by serial subculture caused significant increases in COX-2 expression and PGE2production, even though COX-2 expression and PGE2production did not affect differentiation status. Therefore, our results indicate that EGF-induced dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes amplifies EGF-induced inflammatory responses and suggest that dedifferentiation of chondrocytes may worsen arthritic cartilage inflammation. A significant finding of this study is that EGF caused both dedifferentiation and COX-2 expression/PGE2 production in articular chondrocytes and that dedifferentiation itself also resulted in these COX-2 and PGE2 responses. Previous reports (41Lemare F. Steimberg N. Griel C.L. Demignot S. Adolphe M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 303-313Google Scholar,42Thomas B. Thirion S. Humbert L. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Bereziat G. Berenbaum F. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 367-373Google Scholar) indicate that dedifferentiation of chondrocytes caused reduction in responsiveness to the inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β with respect to COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Our current results also indicate that dedifferentiated cells are much less sensitive to EGF-induced increases in PGE2 production. For instance, PGE2 production increased >5-fold in differentiated P0 cells following EGF treatment, whereas only a ∼2-fold increase was observed in dedifferentiated P3 cells (Fig. 6). The amount of PGE2 produced per well by dedifferentiated cells either in the absence or presence of EGF was much less than that observed in differentiated P0 cells. However, when the amount of PGE2 produced was normalized against genomic DNA to quantify PGE2 production per cell, significantly higher amounts of PGE2 were produced by dedifferentiated cells (Fig. 6). Similar results were observed when chondrocytes were treated with IL-1β (data not shown). Therefore, our observations clearly indicate that dedifferentiated chondrocytes produce more PGE2, although sensitivity to EGF or IL-1β is much lower. In addition to PGE2 production, the levels of COX-2 protein were much higher in serially subcultured dedifferentiated cells compared with differentiated P0 cells (Fig. 4). We also observed that dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by exposure to phorbol ester, nitric oxide, or retinoic acid caused significantly elevated expression of COX-2 (data not shown). The results of this study are different to those reported by Thomas et al. (42Thomas B. Thirion S. Humbert L. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Bereziat G. Berenbaum F. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 367-373Google Scholar) in which IL-1β-treated differentiated and dedifferentiated immortalized chondrocytes showed similar COX-2 mRNA levels. This discrepancy may be the result of different cell origins and culture systems. Those studies compared responses of an immortalized human articular chondrocyte cell line with responses of cells cultured as monolayers and three-dimensionally. This study used primary rabbit articular chondrocytes cultured in monolayers. Indeed, although EGF is known to induce COX-2 expression in various cell types including cell lines originating from chondrocytes (9Sakai T. Kambe F. Mitsuyama H. Ishiguro N. Kurokouchi K. Takigawa M. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 12721-12780Google Scholar), no data are available regarding the responses of primary culture articular chondrocytes to EGF. Thus, our current observation is the first to characterize the effect of EGF on primary chondrocytes. In this study, we also demonstrated that EGF-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production is regulated by ERK1/2 and p38 kinase signaling. The regulation of COX-2 expression has been shown to occur at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and structural information on the COX-2 gene promoter revealed binding sites for several transcription factors found in many cell types such as NFκB and CAAT enhancer-binding protein, which are involved in transcription regulation of COX-2 (18Miller C. Zhang M. He Y. Zhao J. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. Di Battista J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 392-413Google Scholar, 19Newton R. Seybold J. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Barnes P.J. J. Biol.

The stability of COX-2 mRNA regulated by sequences within the 3′-untranslated region is also an important regulatory mechanism of COX-2 expression (20Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 21Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31720-31731Google Scholar). In addition, several studies linked COX-2 expression with MAPK subtypes including ERK1/2, p38 kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (20Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 21Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol.

Subbaramaiah K. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Dannenberg A.J. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Arata J. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29138-29148Google Scholar, 24Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28678Google Scholar). Therefore, our observation that EGF-induced expression and activity of COX-2 are regulated by ERK1/2 and p38 kinase signaling is consistent with the observations of others (20Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 21Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol.

Subbaramaiah K. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Dannenberg A.J. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Arata J. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29138-29148Google Scholar, 24Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28678Google Scholar). The increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in dedifferentiated chondrocytes are mediated by the dedifferentiation-dependent activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase (Fig. 7). It has been shown that dedifferentiation of chondrocytes by exposure to IL-1β οr retinoic acid significantly increased the number of cell surface EGF receptors without changing receptor affinity (43Kinoshita A. Takigawa M. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 14-20Google Scholar). This finding suggests that dedifferentiating chondrocytes by serial subculture may increase EGF receptor expression and serum factors such as EGF may stimulate COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. The effect of PGE2 on chondrocytes depends on the culture system, microenvironment, and physiological conditions (14Amin A.R. Dave M. Attur M. Abramson S.B. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2000; 2: 447-453Google Scholar, 33Schwartz Z. Gilley R.M. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1825-1834Google Scholar). PGE2 exerts anabolic effects such as synthesis of proteoglycan and type II collagen and catabolic effects such as enhancing matrix degradation (14Amin A.R. Dave M. Attur M. Abramson S.B. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2000; 2: 447-453Google Scholar, 15Abramson S.B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 380-381Google Scholar). For example, PGE2has been shown to promote chondrocyte differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation by increasing type II collagen expression (32Goldring M.B. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Lai W.F. Am. J. Ther. 1996; 3: 9-16Google Scholar, 33Schwartz Z. Gilley R.M. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1825-1834Google Scholar, 34Goldring M.B. Berenbaum F. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 386-388Google Scholar). However, the expression and activation of COX-2 and resultant PGE2 production are also believed to contribute to cartilage destruction by altering matrix degradation via matrix metalloproteinases (15Abramson S.B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1999; 7: 380-381Google Scholar). Indeed, the administration of a COX-2 inhibitor can repress joint inflammation and cartilage destruction in animal models of arthritis (44Gilroy D.W. Tomlinson A. Greenslade K. Seed M.P. Willoughby D.A. Inflammation. 1998; 22: 509-519Google Scholar, 45Myers L.K. Kang A.H. Postlethwaite A.E. Rosloniec E.F. Morham S.G. Goorha S.S. Ballou L.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2687-2693Google Scholar). In our culture system, we observed that neither the inhibition of COX-2 expression and PGE2production nor the addition of exogenous PGE2 affected EGF-induced modulation of chondrocyte phenotype, whereas dedifferentiation potentiated inflammatory responses, i.e.COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Therefore, it is likely that EGF-induced dedifferentiation further elevates COX-2 expression and PGE2 production and that EGF found in arthritic cartilage synovial fluid contributes to inflammation and cartilage destruction during arthritic disease."

This process requires the functions of BiP/Kar2p, a member of the Hsp70 family in the endoplasmic reticulum, and its partner protein, Jem1p. To investigate further the role of BiP and Jem1p in nuclear fusion, we screened for partner proteins for Jem1p by the yeast two-hybrid system and identified Nep98p. Nep98p is an essential integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope and is enriched in the spindle pole body (SPB), the sole microtubule-organizing center in yeast. Temperature-sensitivenep98 mutant cells contain abnormal SPBs lacking the half-bridge, suggesting the essential role of Nep98p in the organization of the normal SPB. Additionally, nep98 mutant cells show defects in mitotic nuclear division and nuclear fusion during mating. Because Jem1p is not required for nuclear division, Nep98p probably has dual functions in Jem1p-dependent karyogamy and in Jem1p-independent nuclear division.

In the sexual phase of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, haploid cells of opposite mating types mate to produce diploid cells. After cell fusion, the two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus (1Rose M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 663-695Google Scholar). This process, karyogamy, can be dissected into two steps: nuclear congression and nuclear fusion (1Rose M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 663-695Google Scholar, 2Kurihara L.J. Beh C.T. Latterich M. Schekman R. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 911-923Google Scholar). Analyses of yeast mutants defective in nuclear fusion have revealed the involvement of BiP/Kar2p, an Hsp70 molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SPB, spindle pole body; ts , temperature-sensitive; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; 3HA, three tandem repeats of the HA epitope; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (3Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Google Scholar). BiP also performs functions including protein import into the ER and ER-related protein degradation (4Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Google Scholar, 5Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Google Scholar). BiP has three functional partner proteins in the DnaJ family: Scj1p, Sec63p, and Jem1p (6Sadler I. Chiang A. Kurihara T. Rothblatt J. Way J. Silver P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2665-2675Google Scholar, 7Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Google Scholar), and the functions of BiP are specified by different DnaJ-like proteins. Protein import into the ER lumen is mediated by BiP and Sec63p, and protein aggregation is prevented in the ER lumen by BiP with Scj1p and Jem1p (9Nishikawa S. Fewell S.W. Kato Y. Brodsky J.L. Endo T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1061-1069Google Scholar). Nuclear fusion is facilitated by the Sec63p complex and Jem1p; the zygotes ofkar2, sec63, and jem1 mutants contain two closely opposed haploid nuclei that do not fuse (2Kurihara L.J. Beh C.T. Latterich M. Schekman R. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 911-923Google Scholar, 8Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Google Scholar, 10Ng D.T.W. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 499-509Google Scholar). As a step toward understanding the mechanism of nuclear membrane fusion by BiP with Jem1p, we have screened for proteins that interact with Jem1p using the yeast two-hybrid system. The identified protein, Nep98p, is an essential integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope and is enriched in the spindle pole body (SPB), the sole microtubule-organizing center of budding yeast and a functional homologue of the centrosome in mammalian cells (11Adams I.R. Kilmartin J.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 329-335Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive (ts) nep98 mutant cells have abnormal SPBs lacking the half-bridge and show defects in both mitotic nuclear division and karyogamy, suggesting that Nep98p is essential for SPB organization and function. Yeast strains SEY6210 (MATα ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 lys2 suc2) and SEY6211 (MAT a ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2 suc2) (12Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Google Scholar) were used as the parental strains for the mutants constructed in this study. SEY621D was constructed by mating SEY6210 with SEY6211. PJ69-4A (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 gal4 gal80 GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (13James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) was used for the yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose) or in SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose) supplemented appropriately as described previously (14Rose M.D. Winston F.D. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). SCD medium is SD containing 0.5% casamino acids. A sulfate-free synthetic minimal medium was used for metabolic labeling of yeast cells. A quantitative mating assay was performed as described previously (14Rose M.D. Winston F.D. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). A bait plasmid for two-hybrid screening, pNY6, was constructed by cloning a 2.0-kbScaI/XhoI fragment of pSNJ2 (8Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Google Scholar) into theSalI and SmaI sites of pGBD-C2 (13James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar). Strain PJ69-4A carrying plasmid pNY6 was transformed with the yeast two-hybrid library. About 1 × 108 colonies were screened for the His+ and Ade+ phenotype. The NEP98 gene was cloned by PCR from the yeast genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GCGCTCGAGCCTTCAATTTTGGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGAGCTCTGGTGGTAATTCGAG-3′. The amplified 3.2-kb fragment was digested with XhoI andSacI and introduced into pRS316 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) to generate pSNY3. pSNY5 and pSNY6 were constructed by introducing a 3.2-kbXhoI/SacI fragment of pSNY3 into pRS314 (15Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) and pYO326 (16Qadota H. Ishii I. Fujiyama A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 735-741Google Scholar), respectively. pNTY5, a plasmid for theNEP98-GFP fusion gene, was constructed by introducing the 3.1-kb fragment containing the entire NEP98 open reading frame and its promoter. The fragment was PCR-amplified from pSNY3 using the primers 5′-GCGGAGCTCCTTCAATTTTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCGAGTGATCTAGCTCATCTTG-3′ and was digested with XhoI and SacI into pAK13, which was constructed from pAK2 (17Kawai A. Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Endo T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3565-3574Google Scholar) by replacing the GFP gene with the EGFP-myc fusion gene. The 3HA epitope tag, comprised of three tandem repeats of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA), was introduced at the N terminus of Nep98p at the DNA level by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). A series of deletion mutants of the NEP98gene were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and introduced into pRS314. pSNJ21 was constructed by introducing the 2.4-kb SacI/XhoI fragment of pSNJ2 into theSacI and XhoI sites of pYO324 (16Qadota H. Ishii I. Fujiyama A. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 735-741Google Scholar). A 2.2-kb fragment containing the NEP98 gene was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GCGGCATGCATGAATAACTCAAATGAGC-3′ and 5′-GTTCAAGGTTGGAATTCAG-3′ and was introduced into the SphI and EcoRI sites of pUC119 to yield pUCNEP98. A null allele of NEP98, nep98::HIS3, was constructed by replacing the 1.2-kb StuI/XbaI fragment of pUCNEP98 with the 1.8-kb SmaI/XbaI fragment of pJJ215 (19Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pUCDnep98, was digested with SphI and EcoRI and introduced into a diploid strain, SNY621D. His+ colonies were selected, and disruption of the NEP98 gene was confirmed by PCR. TheNEP98/Δnep98 heterozygous diploid was named SNY1054. SNY1061-1D (MAT a nep98::HIS3 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 lys2 suc2 YCp[NEP98 URA3]), SNY1061-2B (MAT a nep98::HIS3 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 suc2 YCp[NEP98 URA3]), and SNY1061-3C (MATα nep98::HIS3 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2 suc2 YCp[NEP98 URA3]) were constructed by dissecting the spores of SNA1054/pSNY3. To screen tsalleles of the NEP98 gene, pSNY5 mutagenized with hydroxylamine (14Rose M.D. Winston F.D. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) was introduced into SNY1061-2B. Trp+colonies were replica-plated onto SCD (−Trp) plates containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid, and colonies that grew at 23 °C but did not grow at 37 °C were selected. The ts phenotype was confirmed by introducing the mutagenized plasmids recovered from the putative mutants into SNY1061-2B. Construction of thenep98-7 strain was performed as follows. Thenep98-7 mutant gene was cloned into pBluescript II SK+, and an 0.8-kb SmaI/StuI fragment of pJJ281 (19Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Google Scholar) containing the TRP1 gene was introduced into theNdeI site (blunted) of the above plasmid to yield pYT13. pYT13 was digested with ClaI and introduced into SNY1054. Trp+His− transformants were selected, and the introduction of the nep98-7 mutation was confirmed by PCR. YTE8-1B (MATα nep98-7::TRP1 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 suc2) and YTE8-3A (MAT a nep98-7::TRP1 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2 suc2) were constructed by dissecting the spores of the above diploid strain, and the ts growth phenotype was confirmed. A DNA fragment corresponding to codons 238–682 of Nep98p was amplified by PCR and introduced into theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET21a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, pET-NEP98, was introduced into BL21(DE3), and expression of the C-terminal region of Nep98p was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture. The protein was recovered as an inclusion body, solubilized with 2 m urea, and used for immunizing rabbits. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously with the anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (20Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1129-1143Google Scholar). Cells were viewed on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with suitable filter sets. Images were captured by a MicroMax cooled CCD camera (Princeton Research Instruments) and analyzed by IPLab software (Scanalystics). Preparation of thin sections of yeast cells by the freeze-substituted fixation method was carried out as described previously (20Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1129-1143Google Scholar). The sections were examined and photographed on a JEOL2010 and H-7600 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV. The procedures were described previously for the preparation of yeast microsomal fraction (21Rothblatt J.A. Meyer D.I. Cell. 1986; 44: 619-628Google Scholar), the extraction and trypsin digestion of membrane proteins (8Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Google Scholar), and the metabolic labeling of yeast cells and immunoprecipitation (20Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1129-1143Google Scholar). For cross-linking experiments, spheroplasts labeled with 35S-amino acids were broken open via the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and were incubated with various concentrations of dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) for 20 min on ice. The cross-linking was quenched through the addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the reaction mixtures were subjected to immunoprecipitation. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening to look for possible partner proteins for Jem1p in nuclear membrane fusion. A fusion between Jem1p and the DNA binding domain of Gal4p was used as bait to screen 1 × 108 colonies, isolating 323 positive clones. Of the 270 positive clones sequenced, 50 clones were found to contain a part of the open reading frame YJL019w of unknown function. DNA sequencing of this region revealed insertion of guanine downstream of G1851 in the YJL019w open reading frame of the yeast genome data base, leading to a frameshift and fusion with YJL018w to yield a new open reading frame for 682 amino acid residues (Fig.1 A). We named the geneNEP98 (the 98-kDa nuclear envelopeprotein) on the basis of the properties of its gene product described below. Tetrad analysis of theNEP98/nep98::HIS3heterozygous diploid showed that, among 21 tetrads dissected, all produced two viable spores and that all viable spores showed the His− phenotype, indicating that the NEP98 gene is essential for yeast cell growth (data not shown). Two-hybrid analyses with deletion mutants of Nep98p showed that residues 431–650 are essential for its interaction with Jem1p (data not shown). A fusion protein consisting of Nep98p followed by GFP is fully functional as Nep98p because it complemented the nep98-null mutant when expressed from a single-copy plasmid (data not shown). The expressed Nep98p-GFP fusion protein exhibits perinuclear staining of GFP fluorescence with one or two bright dots (Fig. 1 B,panels a and c). The anti-Nep98p antibodies recognized a 98-kDa protein in the total cell extract, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with the antibodies showed a similar pattern of perinuclear staining (data not shown). Immunofluorescence microscopy with the anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody showed that the bright dots represent the ends of the spindle microtubule (Fig.1 B, panel b). These results suggest that Nep98p is a nuclear envelope protein and is enriched in the SPB. Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Nep98p antibodies showed that Nep98p was recovered in the microsome fraction (data not shown). The nuclear envelope localization of Nep98p was not affected by the nup133 mutation, which causes clustering of the nuclear pore complex (22Doye V. Wepf R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1995; 13: 6062-6075Google Scholar), suggesting that Nep98p is not a component of the nuclear pore complex (data not shown). Nep98p possesses a possible membrane-spanning segment of residues 155–175 (Fig. 1 A). We thus treated the yeast microsome fraction with various reagents and analyzed proteins by immunoblotting with the anti-Nep98p antibodies after centrifugation (Fig.2 A). Nep98p was resistant to extraction with 1 m NaCl, 2 m urea, or 0.1m sodium carbonate, whereas soluble and peripheral membrane proteins such as BiP and Jem1p were extracted under the same conditions (data not shown), indicating that Nep98p is indeed an integral membrane protein. Nep98p was not extracted with 1% Triton X-100 but was extracted with 1% Triton X-100 plus 1 m NaCl, suggesting that protein-protein interactions are involved as well in the membrane association of Nep98p. Because Nep98p was digested with externally added trypsin to generate a 78-kDa fragment that was recognized by the antibodies to the C-terminal region of Nep98p (−TX-100, Fig.2 B), the C-terminal part of Nep98p, including the Jem1p-interacting domain, is exposed to the ER lumen. Endoglycosidase H treatment of the microsome fraction converted Nep98p, which contains three C-terminal putative N-glycosylation sites (residues 278, 303, and 304; Fig. 1 A), to a 93-kDa fragment (data not shown), supporting the fact that Nep98p is a type II integral membrane protein. Physical interactions between Nep98p and Jem1p were confirmed by cross-linking. Cells expressing Nep98p and Jem1p-3HA were converted to spheroplasts, labeled with 35S-amino acids, lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100, and treated with a homobifunctional cross-linker, DSP. The proteins subsequently were extracted and subjected to the first round of immunoprecipitation with the anti-Nep98p antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were treated with dithiothreitol to cleave a disulfide bond of the cross-linker and were subjected to the second round of immunoprecipitation with the anti-Nep98p antibodies or the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Jem1p-3HA was precipitated with the anti-HA antibody only when cells were treated with DSP (Fig. 2 C), indicating that Nep98p indeed interacts with Jem1p in yeast cells. To analyze the functions of Nep98p, we constructedts alleles of the plasmid-borne NEP98 gene. One mutant allele, nep98-7, contained a mutation of Asn597 → Lys in the Jem1p-interacting domain of Nep98p. We constructed a nep98-7 mutant strain by introducing the Asn597 → Lys mutation into the chromosomalNEP98 locus for further analyses. When nep98-7cells were shifted to the restricted temperature of 37 °C, the fraction of large budded cells increased to 67%, whereas the fraction of small budded cells decreased to 9% (TableI). This phenotype is characteristic of yeast mutants that have defects in the G2/M progression. We also observed an increase in the cell size of nep98-7cells at both 23 and 37 °C (data not shown).Table IThe nep98–7 mutant is defective in G2 /M progressionStrainTemperatureNo budSmall budLarge bud°CNEP982328252737412237nep98–7233931503724967SEY6211 (NEP98) and YTE8–3A (nep98–7) cells were grown at 23 °C to log phase and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h.

At least 300 cells were analyzed for each condition. The results are presented in percentages. We analyzed the nuclear morphology of the large budded cells by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. ≈70% of large budded wild-type cells contained two nuclei, and ≈30% contained a dividing nucleus at both 23 and 37 °C (Table II). In contrast, only 36% of large budded nep98-7 cells contained two nuclei at 23 °C, and this fraction decreased to 8% at 37 °C. The fraction of large budded nep98-7 cells containing one nucleus was 43 and 59% at 23 and 37 °C, respectively. Nuclei frequently were observed near the bud neck in these cells, but 17–19% of the mononucleate cells showed asymmetric nuclear staining (arrow, Fig.3 d) at both 23 and 37 °C. Similar defects in the nuclear division also were observed when Nep98p was overexpressed from the GAL1 promoter (data not shown).Table IIThe nep 98-7 mutant is defective in nuclear divisionStrainTemperature2 nucleiDividing nucleus1 nucleus°CNEP9823692923766340nep98–7233621433783359The nuclear morphology of large budded cells in Table I was analyzed by DAPI staining. The results are presented in percentages. Open table in a new tab The nuclear morphology of large budded cells in Table I was analyzed by DAPI staining. The results are presented in percentages. We next analyzed the spindle morphology in nep98-7 cells at restrictive temperatures. Four h after a shift from 23 to 37 °C, wild-type and nep98-7 cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-α-tubulin antibody. In wild-type cells, two nuclei were located on the distal sides of both of the dividing cells, and the spindle microtubules were elongated with their axis parallel to the long axis of the cell (Fig. 3 a). On the other hand, in nep98-7 cells, short spindles were observed in mononucleate large budded cells, and their axis was not parallel to the long axis of the cell (Fig. 3 c). We also observed aberrant microtubule organization in nep98-7 cells at 37 °C. A significant portion of the nep98-7 cells contained a focus of microtubule staining that was not in close contact with the DNA depicted by DAPI staining (arrowhead, Fig.3 c). These results indicate that nep98-7 cells have defects in the spindle organization during nuclear division. The SPB spans both of the nuclear envelope membranes and is composed generally of three major layers, an outer plaque on the cytoplasmic side, the inner plaque on the nucleoplasmic side, and the central plaque. The half-bridge is a specialized region of the nuclear envelope and is continuous to one side of the SPB. Electron microscopy analyses allowed us to examine in more detail the defects in the SPB organization of nep98-7 cells. Enlarged SPBs with elaborated inner plaques are observed in nep98-7 cells at both 23 and 37 °C (Fig. 4, C–F). We analyzed the 24 SPBs in the nep98-7 cells by serial sectioning and did not find the half-bridge in the mutant SPBs, although we did observe the half-bridge in 16 of 25 SPBs in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4 A). The SPBs often were observed apparently inside the nucleus in nep98-7 mutant cells (Fig.4, C–F). The half-bridge and the outer plaque function as the sites for cytoplasmic microtubule attachment, and the inner plaque is the site for spindle microtubule attachment (11Adams I.R. Kilmartin J.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 329-335Google Scholar). The lack of the half-bridge and the elaboration of the inner plaque in the nep98-7 SPBs likely affected the balance of forces exerted by cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules and pulling on the SPB. An imbalance in these forces led to an increase in the inward force, thereby making the SPB collapse in the nucleus. Fig.4 G shows an electron micrograph of a section of a large budded nep98-7 cell with a dividing nucleus at 37 °C. In contrast to wild-type cells, the SPB is localized around the bud neck in nep98-7 cells, and the serial thin sections show that the axis of the short spindle is formed perpendicular to the long axis of the cell (Fig. 4, G-1–G-3). Nucleation of microtubules at both ends of the spindle indicates the presence of the SPB at both ends, suggesting that the defects of the mutant occurred after SPB duplication. To analyze the functional domain organization in Nep98p, we constructed a series of partial deletion mutants of Nep98p as shown in Fig. 5 A. Nep98p takes the Nout-Cin topology in the nuclear envelope membrane, and immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-HA-tagged monoclonal antibody showed that all of the deletion mutants are localized to the nuclear envelope as well (data not shown). Although the deletion mutant lacking 32 C-terminal residues (Δ651–682) complemented the lethality of the nep98-null mutant at both 23 and 37 °C, the deletion of 66 C-terminal residues (Δ617–682) or of residues 431–460 (Δ431–460) within the Jem1p-interacting domain (residues 431–650) abolished the complementing ability of Nep98p (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, the Jem1p-interacting domain is essential for the Nep98p function. In contrast, two putative coiled-coil domains in the luminal part of Nep98p (residues 241–274 and 374–401) are dispensable for the Nep98p function, as the deletion of this segment did not affect the complementing ability of Nep98p. The cytoplasmic N-terminal part of Nep98p contains a cluster of acidic residues. Cells expressing the deletion mutant lacking these residues (Δ65–145) instead of expressing wild-type Nep98p could grow normally at 23 °C but could grow only slowly at 37 °C (Fig.5 A). Deletion of 63 N-terminal amino acid residues (Δ2–64) did not affect the complementing ability of Nep98p. The effects of the deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain of Nep98p could not be analyzed because this deletion significantly affected the stability of Nep98p. Therefore, the N-terminal acidic domain appears to be important for the Nep98p function at elevated temperatures. Because Nep98p was isolated as a Jem1p-interacting protein, we tested whether Nep98p plays a role in nuclear fusion during mating. Wild-type or nep98-7 mutant cells of the opposite mating types were mated at 23 °C, and the nuclei of the zygotes were stained with DAPI. Whereas >90% of the wild-type zygotes contained a single nucleus (Kar+), 59% of the nep98-7zygotes contained two or more nuclei that had failed to fuse; 37% had nuclei close to each other (fusion−), and 22% had nuclei in distant positions (congression−) (Fig. 5 B). Zygotes with mutant Nep98p lacking the N-terminal acidic region (Δ65–145) showed defects in nuclear fusion; 17% contained two or more fusion− nuclei, and 28% contained congression− nuclei. Zygotes with mutant Nep98p lacking residues 240–430 (Δ240–430) were affected slightly in nuclear fusion; 12% contained two or more fusion− nuclei. We could not test the effects of deletion on the entire Jem1p-interacting domain because the Jem1-interacting domain is essential for normal cell growth. We thus conclude that Nep98p plays a role in both the nuclear congression and nuclear membrane fusion steps of karyogamy. In the present study, we have identified Nep98p as a partner protein for Jem1p, a DnaJ-like protein of the yeast ER lumen. Nep98p is a nuclear envelope protein that is enriched in the SPB. The ts nep98 mutant strain exhibits defects in the SPB organization and fails to achieve both nuclear division at restrictive temperatures and nuclear fusion during mating, even at permissive temperatures. Because the SPB has essential functions in nuclear division as well as nuclear fusion, Nep98p likely mediates these processes through fabrication of the SPB. Jem1p facilitates the nuclear membrane fusion during mating (8Nishikawa S. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12889-12892Google Scholar, 23Brizzio V. Khalfan W. Huddler D. Beh C.T. Andersen S.S.L. Latterich M. Rose M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 609-626Google Scholar), and the present results raise the possibility that Jem1p plays a role in nuclear fusion through regulating the functions of Nep98p. It is to be noted that deletion of the Jem1p-interacting domain of Nep98p is lethal for yeast cell growth, whereas Jem1p is not essential for yeast cell growth. Moreover, the jem1-null mutant does not show defects in nuclear division (data not shown). In the nuclear fusion process, two SPBs of haploid nuclei fuse to produce a single SPB of a diploid nucleus. The SPB fusion is observed only during mating, and this process appears to start from the satellite on the half-bridge (24Byers B. Goetsch L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that Nep98p requires Jem1p and BiP only in the SPB fusion process. Electron microscopy showed that the Δjem1 zygotes are not defective in the outer nuclear envelope fusion but are defective in the SPB fusion and the inner nuclear envelope fusion, 2S. Nishikawa, A. Hirata, and T. Endo, unpublished data. supporting this hypothesis. Because the half-bridge structure is present on both sides of the nuclear envelope, it is possible that Nep98p resides in both the outer and the inner nuclear envelope membranes. Further analysis of the localization of Nep98p in the nuclear envelope and the identification of Nep98p-interacting proteins other than Jem1p will reveal the function of Nep98p in SPB functions. The nep98-7 mutant showed defects in the nuclear congression in addition to the nuclear fusion in karyogamy. The nuclear congression step is dependent on cytoplasmic microtubules, which nucleate from the outer plaque of the SPB in vegetative cells (11Adams I.R. Kilmartin J.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 329-335Google Scholar, 24Byers B. Goetsch L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Google Scholar). Mating pheromones induce the rearrangement of cytoplasmic microtubules at the SPB, and the half-bridge functions as the site for cytoplasmic microtubules to organize into mating cells (24Byers B. Goetsch L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Google Scholar, 25Pereira G. Grueneberg U. Knop M. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4180-4195Google Scholar). The nuclear congression defect in nep98-7 cells probably occurs because of the aberrant SPB structure that lacks a visible half-bridge structure. Nep98p thus is a multifunctional organizer of the SPB. Note Added in Proof-After acceptance of the present manuscript, we learned that Mark Winey and co-workers found the same protein (Nep98p) independently and named it Mps3p (Jaspersen, S. L., Giddings, T. H., Jr., and Winey, M. (2002) J. Cell Biol. 159, 945–956). We thank E. A. Craig for the yeast two-hybrid system, S.

Biophys. 1999; 367: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The exact biological function of CDH has been a subject of lively debate, but recent results suggest that the enzyme is important for invasion and colonization of wood (6Dumonceaux T. Bartholomew K. Valeanu L. Charles T. Archibald F. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 478-489Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The catalytic site is located in the flavoprotein domain, where the reductive half-reaction proceeds by oxidation of β-cellobiose (apparent k cat 15.7 s−1and K m 0.11 mm, see Ref. 7Henriksson G. Sild V. Szabo I.J. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to yield cellobiono-1,5-lactone (Fig. 1) and the concomitant two-electron reduction of FAD. In dilute aqueous solution, cellobionolactone hydrolyzes to cellobionic acid. Results from1H NMR spectroscopy show that the product from cellobiose oxidation by CDH is unequivocally cellobionolactone, and thus, cellobionic acid is not formed on the enzyme (8Higham C.W. Gordon-Smith D. Dempsey C.E. Wood P.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). During the ensuing oxidative half-reaction, the flavin is re-oxidized by an electron acceptor, either directly or via the cytochrome domain (9Cohen J.D. Bao W. Renganathan V. Subramaniam S.S. Loehr T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At present, the most favored mechanism for in vivo degradation of biopolymers by CDH is the reduction of ferric compounds present in wood in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton-type reaction (2Mansfield S.D. de Jong E. Saddler J.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3804-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cytochrome domain has been implicated in this reaction (10Kremer S.M. Wood P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) since the generation of hydroxyl radicals proceeds by one-electron reduction; however, the flavin domain is also able to generate hydroxyl radicals (1Henriksson G. Ander P. Pettersson B. Pettersson G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 42: 790-796Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Besides cellobiose, soluble cellodextrins, mannobiose and lactose, are good or acceptable substrates for CDH, whereas monosaccharides are poor substrates (7Henriksson G. Sild V. Szabo I.J. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CDH can use a large number of electron acceptors; however, reduction of oxygen is slow (11Bao W. Usha S.N. Renganathan V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We recently reported the crystal structure of the dehydrogenase fragment of CDH without ligand (DHcdh) showing that it is closely related to that of members of the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of oxidoreductases (12Hallberg B.M.

Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GOx catalyzes the oxidation of β-d-glucose to d-glucono-1,5-lactone. Thus, GOx and CDH perform similar chemistry in the reductive half-reaction. The bifunctional enzyme ChOx, however, catalyzes the oxidation and isomerization of cholesterol to 4-cholesten-3-one. Although CDH and GOx catalyze similar chemical reactions, the structural details of the catalytic site in the immediate vicinity of the flavin ring in CDH is more similar to those in ChOx; that is, two conserved residues (His and Asn) at the re face of the flavin ring in a similar conformation and with near identical geometry relative to the flavin N5 (12Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In GOx, however, the asparagine is replaced by a histidine residue. Based on modeling of cellobiose in the DHcdhactive site, we suggested two glucosyl-binding sites at there face of the isoalloxazine ring with the reducing end of cellobiose bound to the innermost site C close to the flavin ring and the non-reducing end of cellobiose residing in the distant site B (12). Over the years, the most widely accepted reaction mechanisms for flavin-assisted dehydrogenation include the carbanion mechanism (17Walsh C.T. Schonbrunn A. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 248: 6855-6866Google Scholar,18Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In general, crystallographic data are not sufficientper se to conclusively discriminate between these mechanisms. However, with the increasing number of available ligand complexes for redox-active enzymes, the hydride-transfer mechanism is gaining in popularity as a general mechanism for dehydrogenation, although the radical mechanism has not been disproved. The only structure available for a GMC enzyme-ligand complex is that ofBrevibacterium sterolicum ChOx with bound dehydroisoandrosterone (16Li J. Vrielink A. Brick P. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11507-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The authors propose a radical mechanism, although the structural details of ligand binding did not exclude any of the possible mechanisms. The situation is, at least partly, complicated by the dual activity of ChOx. We have used the inhibitor 5-amino-5-deoxy-cellobiono-1,5-lactam (Cblm;K i ∼0.25 mm at 35 °C, data not shown), which has a geometry similar to that of the product and of a possible transition state (TST), to study the active-site interactions and delineate a possible reaction mechanism for CDH. This is the first crystal structure of a CDH with a ligand bound in the active site. The reaction mechanism for enzymatic oxidation of cellobiose by CDH is discussed in the light of the present structure of a complex between the dehydrogenase fragment of CDH and Cblm, determined at 1.8-Å resolution. DHcdh was purified and crystallized as described elsewhere (7Henriksson G. Sild V. Szabo I.J. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Biochim. Biophys.

The model contains 2 protein molecules (residues 215–755), two 6-hydroxylated FAD molecules; 5N-acetylglucosamine residues (3 in molecule A and 2 in B), 2 Cblm molecules, and 1007 water molecules (533 for A, 473 for B, and 1 located on a non-crystallographic symmetry 2-fold axis). The bending angle of the isoalloxazine ring was calculated as described previously (12Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Divne C. J. Mol.

Cellobiose was modeled manually in the active site of DHcdh guided by the observed binding pattern for Cblm. To relieve geometric strain and impose favorable van der Waals contacts, the model was subjected to energy minimization with CNS (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) without the x-ray pseudo-energy term. During the energy minimization, only atoms within a sphere of 5.5 Å from the linking oxygen in the glycosidic bond were allowed to move. Atoms within a cushion of 3.5 Å around the sphere were refined with harmonic restraints. The 1.5-Å crystal structure of DHcdh (Protein Data Bank code 1KDG) has been reported elsewhere (12Hallberg B.M. Henriksson G. Pettersson G. Divne C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brief, DHcdh consists of an FAD binding subdomain and a substrate binding subdomain (Fig.2 a). The entrance to the active site is located at the subdomain interface, where a 12-Å-long tunnel leads down to the flavin ring. The structures of DHcdh and DHcdh·Cblm are nearly identical with root mean square deviation values (all atoms) of 0.35 and 0.34 Å for pair-wise least-squares comparisons of A and B molecules, respectively. The electron density for the protein as well as for the inhibitor is of excellent quality (Fig. 2 b). The average residual B factor for the ligand (all atoms) is 8.2 and 8.4 Å2 for the A and B molecule, respectively. As observed for DHcdh, the non-covalently bound flavin cofactor in DHcdh·Cblm is present as 6-hydroxylated FAD. The butterfly bending angle of the flavin ring is less pronounced in DHcdh·Cblm (molecule A, 7°; molecule B, 11°) compared with DHcdh(22°). The flattening of the flavin ring appears to result from an induced fit where the N5 moves into the isoalloxazine plane to accommodate the incoming C1 atom of the lactam ring. The angle defined by the flavin N5 and N10 with the backbone nitrogen atom of Gly-310 is 136° and the N5-Gly-310 N distance is 3.2 Å. Inhibitor interactions are outlined in Fig. 3, a andb. The glucosyl-binding sites and the substrate-binding residues are located at the re face of the isoalloxazine ring. The lactam moiety of Cblm, corresponding to the reducing end of cellobiose, is bound in site C with four protein residues and three solvent molecules within hydrogen-bonding distance of its exocyclic carbonyl and hydroxyl groups: O1-His-689 Nε2, O1-Asn-732 Nδ2, O2-Ser-687 O, O2-His-689 Nε2, and O3-Asn-688 Nδ2. The C3 and C6 hydroxyl groups can form one and two water-mediated hydrogen (H) bonds, respectively. Thus, a total of eight H-bonds are possible in siteC. The endocyclic lactam nitrogen is positioned near the flavin N5 (3.2 Å) and O4 (2.9 Å). The C1 atom of the lactam moiety, which corresponds to the site of oxidative attack in cellobiose, binds in a position 2.9 Å in front of and below the N5-C4a locus of the isoalloxazine ring, defining an angle of 108° (molecule A) and 110° (molecule B) with the N5-N10 atoms of the flavin ring. These values are in agreement with those typically observed in flavoenzymes (30Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the lactam C1 and O1 are almost perfectly aligned with the flavin N5 and C4a, respectively (C1-N5, 2.9 Å; O1-C4a, 2.9 Å). The short distance (molecule A, 2.5 Å; molecule B, 2.6 Å) of the H-bond formed between the lactam O1 and His-689 Nε2suggests that this interaction is strong and that His-689 is suitably positioned to deprotonate the substrate hydroxyl group. The glucosyl moiety of the ligand resides in site B where it forms a total of five ligand-protein H-bonds: O2-Glu-279 Oε2, O2-Arg-586 Nε, O3-Glu-279 Oε1, O3-Arg-586 Nη2, and O6-Asn-688 Nδ2. The aromatic ring of Phe-282 has rotated (molecule A, 7°; molecule B, 11°) compared with the DHcdh structure to stack more planar with the B-site pyranose ring. Five solvent-mediated H-bonds are observed, one each for O2, O3, and O6 and two for O4. A total of 10 H-bonds and one planar hydrophobic stacking interaction contribute to binding in site B. Judged solely from the number of possible interactions, site B is likely to make substantial contribution to the binding of cellobiose, which is in line with reported kinetic constants for di- and monosaccharides (7Henriksson G. Sild V. Szabo I.J. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Only two residues undergo conformational change in response to inhibitor binding (Fig.3 b). In the non-liganded DHcdh structure, Tyr-609 is kept out of the C-site by H-bonds formed by its hydroxyl group with backbone atoms of Asn-732 and the Gln-582 side chain. The active-site tunnel is filled with solvent molecules, of which one water molecule binds in front of the flavin ring within H-bonding distance from His-689 Nε2. In the DHcdh·Cblm complex, however, the tyrosine side chain has discarded its H-bonding partners and moved into siteC (Fig. 3 b). In the new position, Tyr-609 resides below the lactam ring where Oη coordinates two ordered water molecules not present in the non-liganded structure. One water is located below the lactam O6, where it is involved in a H-bond network with Tyr-609 Oη, Thr-581 Oγ, Asn-732 Nδ2, and the C6 hydroxyl group. The second water molecule is below the lactam C3 hydroxyl group and forms H-bonds to Tyr-609 Oη, the lactam O3, and another water molecule. The tyrosine and its two coordinated water molecules (colored yellow in Fig. 3, b andc) elevates the “floor” of site C. The flipping of the tyrosine side chain imposes two additional changes in the active site as follows. (i) To accommodate the Tyr-609 side chain in its new position, the side chain of Ser-519 also flips and thereby exchanges its two H-bonding partners (Ser-519 Oγ-Ser-687 Oγ, and Ser-519-water) for two new ones (Ser-519 Oγ-Met-685 O, and Ser-519 Oγ-new water). The concomitant flips of Tyr-609 and Ser-519 give rise to a local backbone-Cα displacement of 0.6 Å and 0.8 Å at residue 609 and 519, respectively; (ii) the re-positioning of the Tyr-609 side chain together with the presence of the ligand effectively traps a water molecule (Wat1366) in a position 3 Å from the Cε1-Nδ1 edge of the His-689 imidazole ring (Fig. 3, a–c), i.e. the imidazole side opposite to that interacting with the C1 hydroxyl in cellobiose. This water molecule is not present in the non-liganded structure. Structurally, cellobionolactam resembles the product cellobionolactone, with the only difference that the endocyclic O5 oxygen is replaced by an N-H function (Fig. 1). In both compounds C1 is coplanar with O1, C5, and O5 (or lactam nitrogen). We thus assume that the tetrahedral configuration of the anomeric center of cellobiose is changing toward a planarized intermediate during its transition to asp 2-hybridized carbon in cellobionolactone. Based on the Cblm binding pattern, we have produced a docking model of cellobiose in DHcdh. Minor steric restraints near the flavin N5 and His-689 Nε2 enable the planar lactam C1=O to penetrate somewhat farther (0.3–0.4 Å) into site Ccompared with the equatorial O1 group of cellobiose (Fig.3 c). The C1-N5 distance is 2.9 Å in the cellobiose model, and the shortest distance that the C1 hydrogen (1-H) would need to traverse to bind covalently to N5 is, thus, roughly 0.9–1.0 Å. In the Cblm complex, the corresponding transfer distance (imagining a 1-H as in the TST) would be slightly less, 0.8–0.9 Å. Although these distances do not differ significantly, the precise geometry of the 1-H relative to N5 is slightly different in cellobiose as compared with a TST in that 1-H in a TST would be closer to being aligned so as to interact with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the flavin (Fig. 3 c). The assumption that the observed inhibitor binding is also valid for a TST implies that upon approaching the TST the substrate slides slightly deeper into the active site. This results in a better alignment of the 1-H with the flavin lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. Similar to what has been suggested for several other flavoproteins (30Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), the resulting negatively charged flavin hydroquinone may be stabilized at the N1-C2=O locus of the isoalloxazine ring by the positive dipole of the C-terminal α helix. These small but distinct differences in binding may be interpreted as the oxidative site favoring a partially planar TST mimicked by the lactam ring in our structure. Similar specific relative geometry of the substrate and cofactor-reactive groups has been observed in crystal structures of ligand complexes for nicotinamide-dependent (31Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), flavin-dependent (32Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and quinone-dependent (33Oubrie A. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Duine J.A. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5187-5194Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) oxidoreductases, all of which have been assigned a hydride-transfer mechanism. From a purely structural viewpoint, the close proximity between C1 and N5 together with the relative geometry of the atoms appears to favor a general base-catalyzed hydride-transfer mechanism (Scheme FS1, panel a). General base-assisted deprotonation of the C1 hydroxyl group by His-689 in concert with the expulsion of 1-H as hydride via a planar or nearly planar TST would be entirely consistent with the experimentally observed binding of Cblm and modeled cellobiose. The carbanion mechanism in its classical implementation requires that His-689 abstracts 1-H as a proton, resulting in a substrate carbanion. The carbanion then performs a nucleophilic attack at N5 to form a covalent C1-N5 adduct. The subsequent elimination reaction proceeds by the concomitant formation of a double bound between C1-O1 and uptake of the O1 hydroxyl proton by the flavin O4 and ultimately by N5. To accommodate the carbanion reaction, the C-site glucosyl residue would need to tilt forward toward His-689 by at least 45–90° to position the 1-H for proton abstraction. Such a conformational change in the spatially restricted active site is unlikely, structurally and energetically. The non-reducing end of the substrate is anchored in site B (Fig. 3 b), and the conformational change would introduce unreasonable strain in the glycosidic bond between sites B and C. The intimate interaction between His-689 and O1 makes it difficult to find any reasonable incentive for this residue to abstract the more distant 1-H. The carbanion mechanism is also highly unlikely from a purely chemical point of view in that the generated substrate carbanion would be conjugatively destabilized, as has been well established by work of Eliel and co-workers (34Abatjoglou A.G. Eliel E.L. Kuyper L.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 8262-8269Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the carbanion mechanism is incompatible with cellobiose oxidation by CDH. Apart from a hydride-transfer mechanism, a radical mechanism is compatible with the present structure (Scheme FS1, panel b). In this reaction, one electron may be transferred from the substrate O1 to the flavin C4a or N5 concomitantly with the abstraction of the O1-H as a proton by His-689, resulting in a flavin radical and a substrate radical. The subsequent step involves a transfer of the 1-H as a hydrogen radical to N5. Although the structure is compatible with the radical mechanism, the two radical species implied have not been demonstrated. The failure to detect the radical species spectroscopically does not, however, provide conclusive evidence against the radical mechanism. The formation of a cellobiosyl radical may be slow and its subsequent decomposition rapid, making detection of an electron spin resonance signal difficult. We may conclude that a physically meaningful differ"

We attempted to determine the downstream pathways involved in IGF-IR-mediated radioresistance and used mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in endogenous IGF-IR (R−) as recipients for a number of mutant IGF-IRs. Mutational analysis revealed that the tyrosine at residue 950 (Tyr-950) of IGF-IR, as well as the C-terminal domain, are required for radioresistance and that both domains must be mutated to abrogate the phenotype. Furthermore, the contribution of downstream pathways was analyzed by combining the use of wild-type or Tyr-950 and C-terminal mutants with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-K) or mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK). Radioresistance could be induced by IGF-IR as long as the ability of the receptor to stimulate the MEK/ERK pathway was retained. This was confirmed by the expression of constitutively active MEK in R− cells. The ability to stimulate the PI3-K pathway alone was not sufficient, but PI3-K activation coupled with MEK/ERK pathway-independent signals from the C terminus was able to induce radioresistance.

It has been suggested that stimulation of survival signals such as the PI3-K and MAPK pathways following EGFR activation contributes to radioresistance (13Todd D.G. Mikkelsen R.B. Rorrer W.K.

The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the amino acid sequence of which is highly homologous to that of the insulin receptor (IR) (15Ullrich A. Gray A.

It is a generally held view that IGF-IR activation plays a key role in cell growth, establishment, and maintenance of a transformed phenotype, cell survival, and differentiation (16Sell C. Rubini M.

Cancer. 2001; 85: 2017-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), directed study of this receptor is likely to shed light on the downstream pathways leading to this phenomenon. Comprehensive study from such a viewpoint has not been previously conducted, except that antisense targeting of IGF-IR reduces the activity of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), a necessary factor for proper double strand break repair, resulting in enhanced radiosensitivity (27Macaulay V.M. Salisbury A.J. Bohula E.A. Playford M.P. Smorodinsky N.I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4029-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Direct connection, however, between the IGF-IR pathway and ATM has not been established to date. Two major pathways are thought to originate from IGF-IR, one through insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which activates the PI3-K/Akt pathway, and the other through Shc, which activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (28Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These two substrates bind to the NPXY950 motif in the juxtamembrane domain, and Tyr-950 plays an important role in binding as revealed by a yeast two-hybrid assay (29Tartare-Deckert S.

The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is also activated through 14-3-3 proteins, which bind to the C terminus of IGF-IR, a site not available on the IR (31Dews M. Prisco M. Peruzzi F. Romano G. Morrione A. Baserga R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Furlanetto R.W. Dey B.R. Lopaczynski W. Nissley S.P. Biochem.

In addition to these main pathways, activation of c-Raf kinase by 14-3-3 proteins bound to the IGF-IR also results in its translocation to the mitochondria, where it exerts a survival effect with Nedd4 (28Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 34Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Morrione A.

How these downstream pathways of IGF-IR influence radioresistance is not known. In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of the different downstream pathways of IGF-IR to IGF-IR-mediated radioresistance. For this purpose, we used a series of mutant IGF-IRs, potentially relevant to PI3-K and MEK/ERK activation, expressed in R− cells deficient in endogenous IGF-IR (17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Radiosensitivity was further analyzed in combination with specific inhibitors of PI3-K and MEK. Here, we show that IGF-IR mediates clonogenic radioresistance through a number of redundant survival signals of differently weighted relevance, including PI3-K, MEK/ERK, and signals stemming from the C terminus domain, presumably through 14-3-3 proteins. Wortmannin, LY294002, and PD98059 were purchased from Sigma.

A plasmid containing constitutively active MEK was kindly provided by Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Wild-type, Y950F, Y1316F, and Δ1245 receptor mutants were derived from human IGF-IR cDNA (15Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. le Bon T. Kahuria S. Chen E. Jakobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar) as described previously (35Miura M. Li S. Baserga R.

For Y950F/1316F, theHindIII-BamHI fragment of pBluescript SK Y950F (35Miura M. Li S. Baserga R.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar) and was designated pBluescript SK Y950F/Y1316F. The XhoI-NotI fragment of pBPV IGF-IR (17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), an expression plasmid for the wild-type (WT) receptor, was then replaced with the XhoI-NotI fragment of pBluescript SK Y950F/Y1316F, including the double mutation. For the Y950F/Δ1245 mutant, the HindIII-BamHI fragment of pBluescript SK Y950F was replaced by the corresponding fragment from pBluescript SK Δ1245 (36Hongo H. D'Ambrosio C. Miura M. Morrione A. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the XhoI-NotI fragment of pBPV IGF-IR was replaced by theXhoI-NotI fragment of the Y950F/Δ1245 cDNA in pBluescript SK. For the construction of IGF-IR truncated at residue 950, the XhoI-BamHI fragment of pBPV IGF-IR was transferred into the vector pEGFP-C1. TheScaI-BamHI fragment of the IGF-IR cDNA in this vector was replaced by the following double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides: 5′-ACTGAGAATTCG and 3′-TGACTCTTAAGCCTAG. The oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to terminate translation at residue 950 followed by the stop codon TGA, and they contained aBamHI restriction overhang for ligation to theBamHI site of the IGF-IR cDNA in pEGFP-C1 and anEcoRI restriction site for confirmation. TheXhoI-BamHI fragment of pBluescript SK IGF-IR was replaced by the corresponding fragment of truncated IGF-IR cDNA in vector pEGFP-C1. The XhoI-NotI fragment of pBPV IGF-IR was then replaced with the corresponding fragment containing Δ950 in pBluescript SK. R− cells were obtained from mouse embryo fibroblasts possessing a null mutation of the IGF-IR gene (17Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing WT or mutant IGF-IR cDNAs were stably transfected into R− cells with a pPDV6+ plasmid carrying the puromycin resistance gene (37de la Luna S. Soria I. Pulido D. Ortin J. Jimenez A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 62: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were selected in 4 μg/ml puromycin, and the resultant clones were mixed and sorted as described previously (38Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mixed populations or clones were used in the present study. For transient expression of constitutively active MEK in R− cells, a plasmid containing LA-SDSE MAPK kinase cDNA (39Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32642-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was transfected into R− cells, and the cells were prepared for Western blotting and a colony-forming assay 48 h after transfection. Mock-transfected R− cells were treated similarly as a control. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells were used for all experiments. Radiosensitivity was determined by colony-forming assay as described previously (25Tezuka M. Watanabe H. Nakamura S. Yu D. Aung W. Sasaki T. Shibuya H. Miura M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3206-3214PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the effect of exogenously added IGF-I or inhibitors of PI3-K or MEK, cells in plastic flasks grown for roughly 10 h were treated with inhibitors for 1 h and then γ-irradiated. Cells were transferred to a 37 °C incubator and rendered to form colonies. Surviving fraction was calculated based on the plating efficiency determined from the IGF-I- or inhibitor-treated cells. Cell survival was corrected using the equation S = 1 − (1 −f)1/N, where S is the single cell survival rate, f is the measured surviving fraction, and N is the multiplicity determined by the average number of cells per microcolony at the time of irradiation. Multiplicity ranged from 1.1 to 1.2 for all cell lines under the described conditions. Cells were digested in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a Tris-glycine buffer containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Filters were probed with primary antibodies against target proteins for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed three times in TBST, incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times in TBST. Proteins were visualized using the ECL system. For the detection of activated proteins, cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin overnight. Serum-starved cells either treated or untreated with indicated concentrations of IGF-I for 10 min were processed as described above. The number of IGF-I binding sites was determined in each cell line as described previously (38Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells grown on six-well cell plates were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (Eagle's minimal essential medium plus 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.5 ng/ml 125I-IGF-I and/or increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I. After washing with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, cells were lysed with 0.03% SDS, and cell-associated radioactivities were measured by an autowell γ-counter. Specific binding was expressed by subtracting nonspecific binding as determined in the presence of excess unlabeled IGF-I (200 ng/ml). Relative number of specific binding sites in cells incubated in buffer containing 0.5 ng/ml 125I-IGF-I alone was determined in each cell line with values of WT 11 cells normalized to 1.0. Receptor number per cell and dissociation constants (K d) were also estimated in some cell lines by Scatchard analysis as described previously (38Miura M. Surmacz E. Burgaud J.L. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22639-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Activity of PI3-K was measured as described previously (40Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Iwasaki T. Yanagihara K. Saitoh I. Karouji Y. Ihara S. Fukui Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4874-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, IGF-I-treated or untreated cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) bound to Protein A/G-agarose. PI3-K activity in the immunoprecipitates was measured in a reaction mixture containing phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP. After 10–40 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of a solution (chloroform:methanol:HCl = 2:1:0.1) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. γ-Irradiation was performed using a60Co γ-ray therapeutic machine, RCR-120 (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan), at a dose rate of 1.4–1.6 Gy/min. Statistical comparison of mean values was performed using the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference. Differences with a p value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. We previously reported that introduction of IGF-IR into R− cells, which are deficient in endogenous IGF-IR, confers clonogenic radioresistance (25Tezuka M. Watanabe H. Nakamura S. Yu D. Aung W. Sasaki T. Shibuya H. Miura M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3206-3214PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this, we newly established several clones and their radiosensitivities were determined by colony-forming assay. Of these, mixed populations (WTmix), clones 9 and 11, which expressed similar levels of IGF-IR, exhibited a significant radioresistance (to a similar extent) compared with R− or R−(puro) cells expressing a marker gene alone (Fig.1, A and B). Because the extent of radioresistance was relatively modest, we attempted to examine whether radioresistance was increased when cells were stimulated with exogenously added IGF-I, although growth medium already contained IGF-I in serum. Addition of 10, 20, and 50 ng/ml IGF-I in growth medium 1 h before irradiation, however, did not confer any further significant increase in survival fractions at 6 Gy in WTmix and WT 11 cells (Fig. 1 C). One may argue that the structure of IGF-IR per se, irrespective of its signaling function, could somehow affect the radiosensitivity of R− cells. We therefore tested R− cells expressing Δ950 IGF-IR, which lack most of the β-subunit including the tyrosine kinase domain. The expression levels of Δ950 clones 5 and 7 are shown in Fig. 1 D. An antibody specific for the α-subunit of IGF-IR detected levels of receptor similar as or even higher than clone WT 9. The proreceptor could rarely be distinguished because of overlapping with the α-subunit, and the observed size of β-subunit was small because of the large deletion. When an antibody specific for the C terminus of the β-subunit was used, only WT receptors were detected. Both Δ950 clones displayed the same radiosensitivity as R− or R−(puro) cells (Fig. 1 E), demonstrating that the IGF-IR-mediated clonogenic radioresistance is attributable to signal transduction via the tyrosine kinase of the receptor. Furthermore, considering that IGF-IR kinase activation was not clearly detectable in the growth medium following a 6-Gy irradiation (data not shown), a very low level of receptor activation should be sufficient to saturate clonogenic radioresistance in WT cells, because no further radioresistance was obtained by exogenously added IGF-I (Fig. 1 C). We next attempted to determine which domains of the IGF-IR β-subunit are necessary for clonogenic radioresistance. For this purpose, we made various mutant receptors with specific mutations potentially relevant to activation of downstream pathways. For clarity, the mutant receptors used in this study are shown in Fig. 2. The tyrosine residue at position 950 is part of the NPXY950motif, a major binding site for IRS-1 and Shc, which is conserved in IR (41White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Dull T.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). IRS-1 activates PI3-K, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphates, converting PtdIns 4,5-P2 to PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. This lipid activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinases 1 and 2, which in turn activate Akt (43Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 8684-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Shc strongly activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (44Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J.

Tyrosine 1316 is a constituent of the Y1316 XXM motif, a binding site for the regulatory subunit p85 of PI3-K, and is able to stimulate its activity (46Seely B.L. Reichart D.R. Staubs P.A. Jhun B.H.

This is also conserved in IR (47van Horn D.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because each tyrosine, Tyr-950 and Tyr-1316, is reported to play a critical role in each binding function (29Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

The C terminus of IGF-IR includes a quartet of serine residues 1280–1283, which is a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins (33Craparo A. Freund R. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11663-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that in turn lead to activation of c-Raf and the MAPK pathway. c-Raf undergoes mitochondrial translocation and exerts a survival effect in cooperation with Nedd4 (34Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Morrione A. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25990-25996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We will refer to this pathway as 14-3-3/c-Raf hereafter to differentiate this c-Raf signaling event as separate from its activation of the MAPK pathway. To eliminate the binding site of the 14-3-3 proteins, the receptor was truncated at residue 1245. Double mutation at Tyr-950 and the C terminus was also introduced to exclude both signals. Mutant receptors were expressed in R− cells, and their expression levels were assayed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the IGF-IR α- or β-subunit (Fig.3 A). Clones expressing levels of receptor almost similar to those of WT 9 or 11 were selected. To assess the number of mature cell-surface receptors,125I-IGF-I-binding assay was also done (Fig.3 B). Although there were some variations in the number of IGF-I binding sites among cell lines, all the mutants possessed levels of binding sites at least more than WT 11 cells. Specific binding was undetectable in R− cells. As an example, 125I-IGF-I binding competition in WT 11 and Y950F/Δ1245 clone 3 cells is shown in Fig. 3 C, exhibiting similar displacement properties (IC50 = ∼1 nm).

The yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems showed physical associations between epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 and E2A, both of which were present in the nuclei. The bHLH domains mediated this association. Ectopic expression of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 inhibited E2A-dependent activation of the exogenous and endogenous expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor,p21(WAF1/Cip1) gene, and the muscle creatine kinase gene that encodes the predominant creatine kinase isoform expressed in mammalian skeletal muscle. Transfection with epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 small interfering RNA abolished the epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1-mediated suppression of E12-dependent activation of the p21 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 was physically associated with the muscle creatine kinase promoter in vivo. Moreover, terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts was inhibited by exogenous introduction of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1. These inhibitory functions of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 closely resemble those of the bHLH inhibitor Twist protein. These results indicate that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 functions as a negative regulator of differentiation of myoblasts through transcription in at least two distinct steps, cell growth arrest and lineage-specific differentiation.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 transcription factors have been demonstrated to play critical roles in cell fate determination including differentiation in a variety of tissues of both vertebrates and invertebrates (1Olson E.N.

The bHLH proteins form homodimers or heterodimers through the helix-loop-helix domains and enable the basic regions to form a bipartite DNA-binding motif that recognizes the so-called E-box sequences, CANNTG (3Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Typically, tissue-specific bHLH factors, such as MyoD and BETA2/NeuroD, dimerize with ubiquitously expressed bHLH factors, such as E2A gene products, and promote cell fate determination to differentiate into specific lineages (3Massari M.E.

Although epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 seems to be involved in organogenesis in vivo, little is known concerning the functions of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 in controlling tissue-specific gene expression and differentiation. bHLH factors are involved in at least two distinct steps, cell cycle arrest and tissue-specific gene expression. The E2A proteins, another bHLH factor Twist, and the dominant negative-type helix-loop-helix proteins Ids regulate expression of the gene for an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) p21(WAF1/Cip1) (13Prabhu S.

In addition, the combination of p21 and a related molecule p57 has been shown to be essential for muscle differentiation during embryonic development in mice (19Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J. Elledge S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). bHLH factors also regulate expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and muscle creatine kinase (MCK) genes (14Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which are responsible for differentiation of osteoblasts and myoblasts, respectively (21Chen L. Adar R. Yang X.

Biol. 1985; 5: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To investigate the implication of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 in differentiation, we examined how epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle arrest and lineage-specific gene expression. Ectopic expression of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 inhibited E12- and MyoD-induced transactivation of p21. This is also the case in the regulation of MCK expression, demonstrating that common transcriptional regulation controls cell cycle arrest and differentiation of myoblasts. Furthermore, introduction of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 hampered terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. These functional characteristics indicate that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 is a negative transcriptional regulator of differentiation-related genes similar to Twist. All plasmids and strains for two-hybrid analysis were obtained from the Matchmaker System-3 kit (Clontech). The bHLH domain of E12 (amino acids 510–654) was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in pGBKT7 (Clontech), yielding pGBKT7-E12 (bHLH). An MG63 cDNA library in the pGADT7 prey plasmid was co-transfected with the pGBKT7-E12 (bHLH) bait plasmid into AH109 yeast cells. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech Matchmaker Two-hybrid Protocol). For conditional growth assays, yeast cells transfected with the expression plasmids for pGAL4DBD-fusion constructs and pGAL4AD-epicardin were grown on the appropriate selective medium at 30 °C for 5 days. All plasmids and strains for mammalian two-hybrid assays were obtained from Promega. Subconfluent cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells (2 × 105 cells/dish of a 60-mm diameter) were transfected with 2 μg of pG5luc reporter, pGAL chimeras, and pVP16 chimeras together with pCMV-β-Gal by the calcium-phosphate method. After incubation overnight with the DNA precipitate, cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2% horse serum for a further 48 h for the luciferase assay. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were done. The human osteosarcoma osteoblast-like cell line MG63, which is negative for p53 (23Chandar N. Billig B. McMaster J. Novak J. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (Riken Cell Bank), and myoblast cell line C2C12 (Riken Cell Bank) were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. E12 and E47 cDNAs were kindly given by C. Murre (University of California, San Diego). Expression vectors pCMV-E12, pCMV-E47, pCMV-Twist (14Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), pCMV-Id1 and pCMV-Id2 (24Hara E. Hall M. Peters G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were used. Reporter plasmids p21-luc (25Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) and pMCK-luc were generous gifts from B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University), and S. D. Hauschka and J. Buskin (University of Washington), respectively. The expression vectors, pCMV-MyoD (26Lassar A. Buskin J. Lockshon D. Davis R. Apone S. Hauschka S. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and pRSV-CBP, were generous gifts of S. J. Tapscott (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) and T. Nakajima (St. Marianna University), respectively. The epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 cDNA fragment was recovered from the pGADT7 prey plasmids by digestion with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), generating pCMV-epicardin. Epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 cDNA was fused to pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) for expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), generating the vector pGFP::epicardin. Epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 cDNA was fused to pCMV-Myc (Clontech) or pCMV-HA (Clontech) for expression of the Myc- or HA-tagged epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1, generating the vector pMyc-epicardin or pHA-epicardin, respectively. Subconfluent cultures of MG63 cells, C3H10T1/2 cells, or C2C12 myoblasts (2 × 105 cells/dish of a 60-mm diameter) were transfected with a total of 10 μg of expression and reporter plasmids by the calcium-phosphate method together with the β-galactosidase expression vector, pCMV-β-Gal, which was used as an internal control to monitor the transfection efficiency. After incubation overnight with the DNA precipitate, cells were then cultured in DMEM containing 2 or 10% FBS or 2% horse serum for a further 48 h for the luciferase assay and 10% FBS for a further 24 or 72 h for immunostaining. Luciferase activity was assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was determined by the method of Rose and Botstein (27Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at least three times in duplicate, and representative data are presented. The results are the mean of different experiments ± S.E. Cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%) in PBS, and then treated with goat or horse serum to block nonspecific binding sites. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against E2A (sc-349, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human p21 (sc-817, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. After permeabilization, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the above-mentioned primary antibodies at the respective dilutions of 1:100 to 1:250. Immune complexes containing E2A and p21 were detected with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon), respectively. DNA in the nuclei was detected with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. In the quantitative analysis, a minimum of 150 positive cells was examined in each transfection under an Olympus fluorescence microscope (BX-FLA) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). The myoblast differentiation assays were performed as described previously (28Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected in DMEM containing 10% FBS (growth medium) with 2.5 μg of pCMV-β-Gal together with or without 2.5 μg of pCMV-epicardin per 30-mm well. The total amount of DNA added to C2C12 cells was adjusted to 2.5 μg by addition of empty pCMV vector. After culture in DMEM containing 2% horse serum (differentiation medium) for 96 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-troponin T (TnT) antibody (Sigma). Differentiation was evaluated by counting the number of TnT-positive cells relative to that of β-galactosidase-positive cells. The coding strand sequence of the siRNA for epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 wasTTAAGGCCTTCTCCAGACTCAAG. siRNA duplexes were prepared by annealing two pairs of 21 oligonucleotides synthesized by Qiagen. As a control, non-silencing siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. Twenty four hours before transfection, mammalian cells were trypsinized and transferred to 6-well plates (5 × 105cells/well). Reporter plasmids and expression plasmids were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method. Cells were incubated for 5 h and then transfected with 0.5 μg of siRNA duplexes using TransMessenger Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer for adherent cell lines. Forty eight hours later, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting and luciferase assay, respectively. Total cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% gel according to standard protocols, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Polyclonal antibodies against β-galactosidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and mouse monoclonal antibodies to Myc epitope (Clontech), p21 (sc-817; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MHC (MY-32; Sigma), and α-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma) were used at the respective dilutions of 1:400 to 1:1000 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) at room temperature for 2 h, and immune complexes were detected by the ECL method as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). ChIP assays were done as described previously by Shang et al. (29Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 C2C12 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pMCK-luc and 15 μg of pHA-epicardin by the calcium-phosphate method and cultured in DMEM containing 2% horse serum for 48 h. After washing twice with PBS, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, rinsed with ice-cold PBS twice, and collected into ice-cold PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated three times for 15 s each (Tomy Ultrasonic disrupter, model UD-201) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted in a dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitor mixture followed by immunoclearing with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and protein G-Sepharose (45 μl of 50% slurry in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-Myc antibody (Clontech). After immunoprecipitation, 45 μl of protein G-Sepharose and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA were added, and incubation was continued for another 1 h. Precipitates were washed sequentially for 5 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), further washed three times with TE buffer, and extracted with 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3. Elutes were heated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick Spin Kit (Qiagen, CA). A portion (4%) of purified DNA extraction was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR with primers specific for either the MCK enhancer ((+), 5′-GACACCCGAGATGCCTGGTT-3′; (−), 5′-GATCCACCAGGGACAGGGTT-3′). As a control for DNA content, PCRs were performed with samples without immunoprecipitation. A portion (20%) of PCR product of each reaction mixture was resolved through a 5% native acrylamide gel. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that bind to E12, using the E12-bHLH region fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain as bait. In a screen of 2 × 106human MG63 cell library clones, 35 clones specifically interacted with E12-bHLH. DNA sequence analysis of these clones revealed that half of them encoded epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 fused in-frame to the transcriptional activation domain in the prey plasmid. We confirmed interaction of intact epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 with either full-length E12 or the bHLH domain of E12 (E12-bHLH) in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1, A and B). The result is consistent with the observation that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 heterodimerizes with the ubiquitous bHLH protein E12 (8Lu J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mech. Dev. 1998; 73: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 did not bind to the Twist bHLH domain (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the association of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 with E12 was specific. Similar observations were made in mammalian cells. The pG5luc vector contains five tandem copies of the GAL4-binding site upstream of a minimal TATA box linked to the firefly luciferase gene (Fig.1 C). Cotransfection of this reporter plasmid with the expression vectors for the fusion proteins of GAL4DBD-epicartdin bHLH and VP16-E12 effectively induced profound activation of the promoter, whereas introduction of each of GAL4DBD-epicardin bHLH and VP16-E12 showed slight and little, if any, activation, respectively (Fig.1 D). These results clearly indicate that E12 physically interacts with the bHLH domain of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1. This conclusion was further supported by colocalization of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 and E12 in the nuclei. GFP alone was in both the cytoplasm and nuclei in MG63 cells (Fig.2 b), whereas the epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1-GFP fusion protein from pGFP::epicardin were found in the nuclei (Fig.2 e). Expression of p21 has been shown to parallel the irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle, following the induction of MyoD in myogenic differentiation (17Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar,18Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that there is a close link between p21 induction and cell cycle arrest in MG63 cells. The MyoD/E12 heterodimer has been shown to bind to specific E-box DNA sequences and activate muscle-specific genes (5Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N.

To gain insight into the biological significance of the interaction of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 with E12, we tested the role of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 in E2A-dependent activation of p21 transcription with MG63 cells, in which we have previously shown the inhibitory effects of Twist on E2A-dependent p21 promoter activation (14Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). MG63 cells were cotransfected with p21-luc, an E2A expression plasmid (pCMV-E12 or pCMV-E47) and/or pCMV-epicardin and luciferase activities were determined after 48 h of culture. Concentrations of the epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 plasmid were equivalent to those for Twist, at which muscle differentiation is inhibited (20Spicer D.B. Rhee J. Cheung W.L. Lassar A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 1476-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 32Hebrok M. Wertz K. Fuchtbauer E.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When p21-luc was transfected along with pCMV-epicardin, a major reduction in luciferase activities was observed in either E12 or E47 expressing cells over a range of pCMV-epicardin concentrations used, similar to Twist (Fig.3 B). The magnitude of inhibition by epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 was equivalent to those induced by Twist and Id1 except for the case of Id1 in E47-driven transcription (Fig. 3 A). The inhibition of the E2A-dependent p21 promoter activation by epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 was further enhanced by the addition of Twist or Id1 (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1, Twist, and Id1 inhibit p21 expression in a cooperative manner. These results demonstrate that the epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 functions as a negative transcriptional regulator in the E2A-dependent p21 promoter activation in MG63 cells, like Twist and Id1. We further tested if epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 protein could inhibit the expression of the endogenous p21 gene. MG63 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for E12 with or without epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 and then examined for p21 expression by immunostaining. Upon introduction of E12, endogenous p21 expression was induced in cells expressing high levels of E12 even when cultured in high serum (Fig.4 A) as reported previously (14Funato N. Ohtani K. Ohyama K. Kuroda T. Nakamura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7416-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Overexpression of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 abolished the endogenous p21 expression induced by E12 (Fig. 4 B and TableI), confirming the antagonistic function of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 in E12-induced gene expression.Table IEffects of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 on E12-dependent p21 expressionTransfectionE12+cellsE12− cellsp21+p21−p21+p21−%%E1288.311.70.199.9E12 + epicardin43.656.40.495.9MG63 cells were transiently cotransfected with pCMV-E12 and pCMV-epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1.

The coactivator p300/cyclic AMP-responsive element binding factor CREB-binding protein (CBP) harboring histone acetyltransferase activity has been shown to interact with E12 (33Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferase activity is important for decondensing the chromatin (34Ogryzko V.V.

Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2096-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To analyze the functional implications of the interactions between E12-CBP complex and epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1, we studied the effects of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 on E12-CBP-dependent transcriptional activation of the p21 gene. Epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1-induced inhibition of p21 promoter activation in response to E12 was partly overcome by the addition of CBP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these findings support the view that epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 suppresses transcriptional activity conferred by a combination of E12 and CBP. To confirm involvement of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 in regulation of p21 gene expression, the effect of loss of function of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 was examined using siRNA specific to epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1. Transfection of MG63 cells with epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 siRNA along with the epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 expression vector relieved epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1-mediated suppression of E12-dependent activation of the p21 promoter (Fig. 3 F), in agreement with reduction of the expression of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 at the protein level (Fig. 3 E). Introduction of epicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 siRNA alone induced little, if any, change in p21 expression (Fig. 3 F). Expression ofepicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 andMyoR has been shown to overlap in head muscle precursors, and the lack of an appreciable change in phenotype of the head musculature inepicardin/capsulin/Pod-1 mutant mice (36Robb L.

https://openalex.org/W2045387257,"We demonstrate that the C-terminal truncation of hIK1 results in a loss of functional channels. This could be caused by either (i) a failure of the channel to traffic to the plasma membrane or (ii) the expression of non-functional channels. To delineate among these possibilities, a hemagglutinin epitope was inserted into the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains S3 and S4. Surface expression and channel function were measured by immunofluorescence, cell surface immunoprecipitation, and whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Although deletion of the last 14 amino acids of hIK1 (L414STOP) had no effect on plasma membrane expression and function, deletion of the last 26 amino acids (K402STOP) resulted in a complete loss of membrane expression. Mutation of the leucine heptad repeat ending at Leu406 (L399A/L406A) completely abrogated membrane localization. Additional mutations within the heptad repeat (L385A/L392A, L392A/L406A) or of the a positions (I396A/L403A) resulted in a near-complete loss of membrane-localized channel. In contrast, mutating individual leucines did not compromise channel trafficking or function. Both membrane localization and function of L399A/L406A could be partially restored by incubation at 27 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that leucine zipper mutations do not compromise multimer formation. In contrast, we demonstrated that the leucine zipper region of hIK1 is capable of co-assembly and that this is dependent upon an intact leucine zipper. Finally, this leucine zipper is conserved in another member of the gene family, SK3. However, mutation of the leucine zipper in SK3 had no effect on plasma membrane localization or function. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the C-terminal leucine zipper is critical to facilitate correct folding and plasma membrane trafficking of hIK1, whereas this function is not conserved in other gene family members.

Indeed, hIK1 has been shown to possess all the biophysical and pharmacological hallmarks of the endogenously expressed channel, including (i) slight inward rectification in symmetrical K+, having a chord conductance of ∼35 pS at −100 mV and 10 pS at +100 mV; (ii) time- and voltage-independent gating kinetics; (iii) activation by Ca2+, ATP, 1-EBIO, and DCEBIO in excised, inside-out patches; and (iv) inhibition by both extracellular charybdotoxin and clotrimazole (2Devor D.C.

Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611Google Scholar). hIK1 is a member of the KCNN gene family, having 40–42% identity at the amino acid level with the other members of the gene family, including the small conductance, apamin-sensitive, Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK1–3) (11Ishii T.M.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Google Scholar). These channels are structurally similar to the voltage-gated family of K+ channels, possessing 6 transmembrane domains (S1–S6), a single pore region, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails. The second messenger-dependent regulation of hIK1 has been extensively investigated at the molecular level during the past several years. That is to say both IK and SK channels are known to constitutively bind calmodulin and both have Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent calmodulin binding domains within the first 100 amino acids of the C-terminal tail (13Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Google Scholar, 16Xia X. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T.

Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Google Scholar). Indeed, it is the binding of Ca2+ to EF hands 1 and 2 of calmodulin that results in the Ca2+-dependent gating of these channels (17Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of calmodulin bound to the proximal C terminus of rSK2 was determined, demonstrating that calmodulin cross-links two C-terminal tails in the presence of Ca2+ (18Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bächinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently (19Gerlach A.C. Gangopadhyay N.N. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 585-598Google Scholar) that the IK, but not the SK, channel was activated by ATP-dependent phosphorylation and that this was independent of consensus kinase phosphorylation sites on hIK1. We further mapped the domain for this kinase-dependent regulation to a 14-amino acid region (Arg355–Met368) overlapping the Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding domain, suggesting this may be the site of additional protein-protein interactions (20Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Google Scholar). Similarly, PKC has been shown to acutely regulate IK1, and this is independent of consensus PKC phosphorylation sites (21Wulf A. Schwab A. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 187: 71-79Google Scholar). In contrast to these results on the second messenger regulation of IK1, the molecular motifs required for tetramerization of hIK1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and the sorting motifs required for correct plasma membrane localization have been little studied. We demonstrated previously that truncation of the 427-amino acid hIK1 at Lys402 resulted in the complete loss of channel function, as assessed by patch clamp techniques (20Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Google Scholar). This loss of function could result from either a failure of hIK1 to traffic to the plasma membrane or the expression of non-functional channels. To delineate among these possibilities an HA epitope was inserted into the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains S3 and S4 such that cell surface expression could be monitored by immunofluorescence (IF) and cell surface immunoprecipitation (CS-IP) techniques, whereas the function of hIK1 could be measured using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. We demonstrate that a C-terminal leucine zipper, distal to the calmodulin-binding domain, is required for the trafficking of hIK1 to the plasma membrane and that mutations of the leucine zipper alter the assembly of the distal C-terminal tail of hIK1. In contrast, this conserved leucine zipper is not required for the correct trafficking of another gene family member, SK3, to the plasma membrane. pBF plasmid containing the cDNAs for full-length hIK1 and rSK3 were kindly provided by J. P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University). These cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) using theEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. A hemagglutinin (HA; YPYDVPDYA) epitope was inserted into hIK1 (HA-hIK1) between Gly132 and Ala133, i.e. the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains S3 and S4, by sequential overlap extension PCR using plasmid-specific primers in conjunction with the primers: forward, 5′-TATCCGTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGCGCCGCTGACCTCCCCGCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTACGGATACCCTAAATCCTGCACGCACGGCGGG-3′, where the HA epitope is highlighted in boldface. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) using EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites. All mutations in HA-hIK1, L414STOP, K402STOP, L378A/L385A (ZIP1,2), L385A/L392A (ZIP2,3), L392A/L406A (ZIP3,5), L399A/L406A (ZIP4,5A), L399P/L406F (ZIP4,5P), I396A/L403A (A-POS), L378A (ZIP1), L385A (ZIP2), L392A (ZIP3), L399A (ZIP4), L406A (ZIP5), and L409A/L410A as well as rSK3 (L660A/L667A; L667A/L674A), were generated using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis strategy developed by Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. hIK1 was tagged with a C-terminal myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) through PCR amplification of hIK1 in pcDNA3.1(+) and then subcloned in-frame into pcDNA4/myc (Invitrogen) by utilizingEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Addition of either the Xpress (DLYDDDDK) or V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) epitope tag to the last 59 amino acids of the C terminus of hIK1 (Val369–Lys427; C59) were generated by PCR amplification of the C59 fragment and subcloning into either pcDNA4/HisMax for Xpress or pcDNA3.1-V5/His-TOPO for V5 (Invitrogen). In total, 45 amino acids were added during the generation of the V5-C59 construct, whereas 35 amino acids were added in generating the XP-C59 construct, thereby allowing separation via SDS-PAGE. The fidelity of all constructs utilized in this study was confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer, University of Pittsburgh) and subsequent sequence alignment (NCBI BLAST) with hIK1 (GenBankTM accession number AF022150) or rSK3 (GenBankTM accession number U69884). Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were generated for all constructs by subjecting cells to antibiotic selection (1 mg/ml G418) 48 h post-transfection. Selection was typically complete within 14 days post-transfection. Following selection the concentration of G418 was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml. Note that clonal cell lines were not subsequently selected from this stable population of cells in order to avoid clonal variation. During whole-cell patch clamp recording, the bath contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained (in mm) 144 KCl, 7.6 CaCl2, 5.6 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH) to achieve an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of 300 nm. For whole-cell recording of SK channels, the bath contained (in mm) 164.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH). The pipette solution contained (in mm) 135 KCl, 8.7 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH) to achieve an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Currents were recorded using a List EPC-7 amplifier (Medical Systems, Greenvale, NY). Electrodes were fabricated from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), pulled on a vertical puller (Narishige, Long Island, NY) and had a resistance of 1–4 megohms. Following establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage steps were applied from a holding potential of −60 mV at 250-ms pulses every 2 s from −100 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments to generate a current-voltage (I-V) relationship. Current was sampled at steady state (50 ms) for the purpose of evaluating current density. Similar I-Vs were generated following stimulation with DCEBIO (15Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611Google Scholar) (10 μm) and inhibition with clotrimazole (CLT; 3 μm) or apamin (30 nm) for hIK1 or rSK3 channels, respectively. The pharmacological opener, DCEBIO, was utilized to eliminate any variability that could be caused by artificially raising Ca2+ in the presence of pipette EGTA. Current density (pA/pF) was calculated by dividing the difference between DCEBIO-stimulated and CLT- or apamin-blocked current (pA) by the cell capacitance (pF) at a voltage of −20 or +40 mV for hIK1 and rSK3 channels, respectively. Data analysis was performed using pCLAMP (version 5.5, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For all HA-hIK1 constructs, whole-cell current densities were obtained on at least 10 cells to account for any variation in expression across the stable cell lines. To detect HA-hIK1 and rSK3 in immunofluorescence (IF), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunoblotting (IB), experiments antibodies were obtained from the following sources (dilutions used are indicated): V5 and Xpress (XP) (1:5,000; Invitrogen), polyclonal HA (1:150) and monoclonal (1:1,000) HA (HA.11, Covance, Richmond, CA), c-myc (clone 9E10, 1:1,000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and polyclonal rSK3 antibody directed against residues 2–21 of human SK3 (1:1,000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from various sources as follows: biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), streptavidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:500; Molecular Probes), Cy3.18-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000; Amersham Biosciences), HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000; BD Biosciences). For IF labeling, HEK293 stable cell lines were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips for 24 h prior to labeling. For detection of cell surface HA-hIK1, the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, blocked in 1% BSA (3 × 5 min) followed by goat serum (10% for 20 min). HA-hIK1 was then labeled sequentially by incubating in 1° (primary) monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000; 90 min) and 2° (secondary) biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; 90 min) followed by streptavidin conjugated to Alexa-488 (1:500) for 90 min. Each labeling step was followed by 3–5 washes with 1% BSA (5 min each) to remove unbound Ab. All steps were performed at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis of the channel. Following cell surface labeling, the cells were again washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/2% paraformaldehyde/PBS, blocked with 1% BSA and 10% goat serum as above, and then intracellular localized HA-hIK1 was labeled sequentially with 1° monoclonal HA antibody (1:1,000; 90 min), and 2° Cy3.18 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000) antibody. Finally, nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). This approach allowed us to detect both cell surface and intracellular HA-hIK1 in the same cells. Cells were then subjected to laser confocal microscopy using a Leica TCSNT 3 laser 4 PMT system. To ensure maximal X-Y spatial resolution, sections were scanned at 1024 × 1024 pixels, using sequential 2-color image collection to minimize cross-talk between the channels imaged. All images shown in a single figure were scanned on the same day using identical settings. The images were then imported into Adobe Photoshop, combined into a single figure, and RGB brightness/contrast adjusted identically for all panels. C59 constructs were translated from cDNA in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT T7-Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of the translation reaction were diluted 10-fold in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture mix), and pre-cleared with protein G (Omnisorb; Calbiochem). Samples were then incubated with either anti-V5 or anti-XP (1:5,000 dilution) antibodies, and immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein G. Following extensive washing, the protein G pellets were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 37 °C for 5 min prior to removal of aggregates by centrifugation. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation of HA- and Myc-tagged hIK1 constructs, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected in 60-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE 2000 and 5 μg of each plasmid (total, 10 μg of DNA and 20 μl of lipid). When only a single construct was transfected (HA or Myc), empty pcDNA3.1(+) was included (5 μg) to keep the final concentration of plasmid and lipid the same in all dishes. 18–24 h post-transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with IP buffer. Protein concentrations were determined and normalized to achieve equivalent loading. Crude lysates were then pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads, followed by sequential washes in IP buffer containing 500, 300, and 150 mm (2×) NaCl, supplemented with 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% w/v SDS). After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described below. For CS-IP, cells were grown to confluence in a 100-mm dish and then washed in ice-cold PBS, blocked in 1% BSA/PBS, and labeled with polyclonal HA.11 Ab (1:500) for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound Ab was removed by extensive washing in 1% BSA followed by washes in PBS. As above, all steps were performed at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis of the channel and/or Ab. The cells were then lysed, and protein concentrations were normalized and the immune complexes directly subjected to IP as detailed above. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, an IB was performed using monoclonal HA Ab (1:1,000) as detailed below. In addition to the IP, 15 μg of protein was set aside following cell lysis for an IB. In this way, we were able to confirm similar levels of protein expression in cells failing to correctly traffic HA-hIK1 to the cell surface. HEK293 cells were grown to confluence, lysed with IP buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using TBS-blocking solution containing 5% w/v milk powder, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.005% (v/v) antifoam A. Subsequently, blots were incubated in 1° Ab (mouse monoclonal HA, 1:1,000; mouse monoclonalmyc, 1:1,000; or rabbit polyclonal rSK3, 1:2,000) for 1 h at room temperature and extensively washed (TBS-blocking solution deficient in milk powder) followed by incubation in 2° Ab (1:2,000; HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, or HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG). The blot was then extensively washed, and detection was performed using West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Proteinase K digestion was performed following methods described previously (22Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK cells stably transfected with either wild-type or ZIP3,4 rSK3 were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with or without 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteinase K digestion was quenched by adding ice-cold PBS containing 6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 mmEDTA. This treatment was followed by three washes in ice-cold PBS. Cleared lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting, as described above. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. DCEBIO was synthesized in the laboratory of R. J. Bridges (University of Pittsburgh), as described previously (15Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611Google Scholar). Both DCEBIO and clotrimazole were made as 10,000-fold stock solutions in Me2SO. Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture mix was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All data are presented as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test. A value ofp < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and is reported. All IF labeling and protein biochemical experiments were carried out a minimum of 3 times on each construct to ensure the voracity of our results. We previously demonstrated that truncation of hIK1 at Lys402 resulted in a complete loss of functional channels at the cell surface (20Gerlach A.C. Syme C.A. Giltinan L. Adelman J.P. Devor D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10963-10970Google Scholar). This result could be caused by either a failure of channels to correctly traffic to the plasma membrane or from channels that traffic normally but are non-functional. To distinguish between these possibilities, an HA epitope was inserted into the extracellular loop between S3 and S4 (see “Experimental Procedures”) such that cell surface expression could be evaluated by IF and CS-IP techniques, whereas function was assessed by the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Initially, we confirmed that HA-hIK1 could be detected at the cell surface by IF. As shown in Fig.1 A, wild-type HA-hIK1 is highly expressed at the cell surface (green) as well as being expressed intracellularly (red), as expected. Cells expressing hIK1 (no HA epitope) exhibited no fluorescence when labeled using an identical protocol (data not shown). We next determined whether insertion of the HA epitope had any effect on the biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of hIK1 as assessed by the excised, inside-out patch clamp technique. We and others demonstrated previously that hIK1 is activated by the pharmacological agent, DCEBIO (15Singh S. Syme C.A. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 600-611Google Scholar), and inhibited by clotrimazole (2Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Gerlach A.C. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J.

In addition, insertion of the HA epitope had no significant effect on either the single channel I-V relationship of the channel (chord conductance of 31 ± 1 pS at −100 mV and 11 ± 1 pS at +100 mV, n = 4) or Ca2+-dependent gating (K s = 831 ± 29 nm, Hill coefficient of 2.1;n = 3), as these are values similar to what we and others have reported previously (7Vandorpe D.H.

In total, these results indicate that insertion of an HA epitope into hIK1 did not affect channel function. Thus, we utilized this construct to define the role of the cytoplasmic C terminus in the cell surface expression of hIK1. Based on the observation that the HA epitope did not alter the function of hIK1 channel activity in excised patches, we confirmed HA-hIK1 could be activated by the pharmacological opener, DCEBIO (10 μm), and inhibited by clotrimazole (3 μm) in whole-cell patch clamp studies. Following establishment of the whole-cell configuration, current averaged 224.0 ± 38.5 pA at −20 mV, indicative of very few active channels (Fig. 1 E). DCEBIO increased the whole-cell current to 5,013.4 ± 597.0 pA, and this was inhibited by clotrimazole to 930.5 ± 176.4 (n = 19). As the average capacitance for these 19 cells was 26.6 ± 1.4 pF, this yielded an average current density of 166.6 ± 19.4 pA/pF, as shown in Fig. 1 E. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 1 D, HA-hIK1 displays no significant time- or voltage-dependent activation durin"

Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β protein amyloid precursor protein early onset familial AD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay glycogen synthasekinase presenilin-1 and -2 immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry reverse transcription-PCR The presence of senile plaques is one of the key neuropathological features of familial as well as sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).1Senile plaques are extracellular deposits composed mainly of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which is cleaved by a series of secretases from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Ray W.J. Ashall F. Goate A.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of three genes, APP, presenilin-1 (PS-1), or presenilin-2 (PS-2), give rise to early onset familial AD (EOFAD). Mutations in the PS-1 gene are associated with severe neuropathology. Typically, the brains of affected individuals have a large number of diffuse as well as cored neuritic plaques that are deposited in the cerebral cortex and in regions not normally involved in AD, such as the cerebellum (2Lemere C.A.

This suggests that PS-1 has a role not only in determining the levels of different Aβ species but also in the morphology of the plaques and neuritic dystrophy.The range of functions of the wild-type PS-1 protein are still being defined, although a primary function may be to serve as the γ-secretase, which cleaves the APP molecule to generate Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (10Li Y.-M.

Whether protein interactions with PS-1 are actively required for plaque formation, or neuritic dystrophy, has not been demonstrated. We report the genetic and functional analysis of a novel mutation (L271V) in the PS-1 gene in an EOFAD pedigree with a variant neuropathology. The missense mutation also results in the production of PS-1 that lacks exon 8. We show that exon 8 sequences of the PS-1 molecule interact with Tau and GSK-3β, a candidate protein kinase that can catalyze the phosphorylation and polymerization of Tau and perhaps initiate neuritic dystrophy. These results suggest that the presence of mutant PS-1 plays a major role in the development of neuritic senile plaques.DISCUSSIONWe describe an EOFAD pedigree with a novel missense (L271V) mutation in the PS-1 gene that is associated with a variant neuropathology. Bielschowsky silver stain revealed that the majority of plaques in two affected individuals (III:28 and III:32) were large spherical deposits without defined cores or neuritic dystrophy (Fig. 2,C and D). The morphology of the plaques is reminiscent of the cotton wool plaques described in other studies (5Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S.

Neurol. 2000; 48: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence demonstrate that the PS-1 L271V mutation is the pathogenic variant within the Tas-1 pedigree. First, the mutation segregates with the EOFAD phenotype within the pedigree. Second, in vitro measurements of Αβ levels using either an ELISA or by IP-MS indicate that the L271V mutation increases Αβ1–42 secretion to comparable levels to other characterized PS-1 mutations. However, the simple elevation of Aβ1–42 secretion does not explain the presence of the variant plaques that occur in this pedigree.The correlation between specific mutations in the APP and PS-1 genes and the distinctive neuropathology in affected individuals has led to the definition of two possible molecular mechanisms in the formation of cotton wool plaques. First, the APP T714I was postulated to play an integral role in the formation of the variant cotton wool form of senile plaques, through the generation of P3 and the amino-terminal truncated Aβ species (29Kumar-Singh S. De Jonghe C. Cruts M. Kleinert R. Wang R. Mercken M. De Strooper B. Vanderstichele H. Lofgren A. Vanderhoeven I. Backhovens H. Vanmechelen E. Kroisel P.M. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not detect the presence of P3 in conditioned media from cells transfected with the L271V cDNA. Furthermore, we were also unable to detect the presence of the truncated Αβ species in cells transfected with the PS-1Δexon9 cDNA, another PS-1 mutation associated with cotton wool plaques (5Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat.

Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that, unlike the APP T714I mutation, cotton wool plaques found in PS-1 L271V mutation carriers are not attributable to the production of P3. The second mechanism, proposed by Houldenet al. (8Houlden H. Baker M. McGowan E. Lewis P. Hutton M. Crook R. Wood N.W. Kumar-Singh S. Geddes J. Swash M. Scaravilli F. Holton J.L. Lashley T. Tomita T. Hashimoto T. Verkkoniemi A. Kalimo H. Somer M. Paetau A. Martin J.-J. Van Broeckhoven C. Golde T. Hardy J. Haltia M. Revesz T. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), for the formation of the cotton wool plaques is a high level of Aβ1–42 production such as observed for the PS-1Δexon9 mutation. However, levels of Aβ1–42 secretion induced by the PS-1 L271V mutation were not as high as those seen with the PS-1Δexon9 mutation (Fig. 3). This suggests that although the L271V mutation is necessary for the generation of the cytotoxic Aβ1–42 species, biochemical analyses indicate that the L271V mutation was not sufficient to explain the presence of the cotton wool plaques in our pedigree, at least by the two mechanisms proposed above. Exonic mutations can have the unexpected consequence of altering the splicing of their cognate exons. For example, the exonic deletion ΔK280 mutation in the tau gene, MAPT (microtubule-associated proteinTau) have been shown to decrease the splicing in of exon 10 of the gene due to the disruption of a purine-rich exon splicing enhancer (32D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17700-17709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the L271V mutation has a similar effect on the alternative splicing of exon 8 of the PS-1 gene, possibly by a similar mechanism. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of PS-1 expression in the frontal cortex of the two mutation carriers (III:28 and III:32) revealed a 17–50% increase in levels of PS-1Δexon 8 splice isoform compared with unrelated EOFAD brains and a neuroblastoma cell line (Fig. 4, A and C). The Δexon8 isoform is not proteolytically cleaved like the wild-type molecule (33Morihara T. Katayama T. Sato N. Yoneda T. Manabe T. Hitomi A. Imaizumi K. Tohyama M. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 85: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat.

This hypothesis was supported by our pulse-chase study of PS-1 isoforms, which demonstrated that PS-1Δexon8 was not as rapidly degraded as either the wild-type or PS-1Δexon9 isoform (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the modest increase in the level of PS-1Δexon8 transcripts would lead to accumulation of higher levels of the Δexon8 isoform than the full-length wild-type molecule (Fig. 4 C), and have functional consequences.There has been debate concerning whether PS-1 is the actual γ-secretase catalytic enzyme or whether PS-1 forms part of a larger heteromeric complex that facilitates the positioning of γ-secretase and its substrates (35Sisodia S.S. Annaert W. Kim S.-H. De Strooper B. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: S2-S6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of γ-secretase activity associated with transfected PS-1 cDNAs using ELISA or the luciferase-based reporter system (Fig. 5, C andD) may provide some insight into this debate. First, the ELISA measurements of γ-secretase activity of the L271V and PS-1Δexon9 mutants indicated that an increase in the secretion of Aβ1–42 was associated with a concomitant decrease in the production of total Aβ (which consists mostly of Aβ1–40) (Fig. 5,C and D). This suggests that the mutations resulted in an alteration of PS-1 activity, such that the mutant PS-1 was more efficient in cleavage of Aβ1–42 than Aβ1–40. This is supported by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac sulfide, which has been shown to inhibit selectively the production of Aβ1–42 while increasing the carboxyl-terminal truncated Aβ1–38 species (36Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The ELISA indicated that PS-1Δexon8 might be capable of supporting the generation of Aβ (Fig. 5 C), consistent with a similar study using stably transfected HEK cell lines (34Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To remove the effects of endogenous presenilins on the ability of the PS-1 cDNAs to generate Aβ, this experiment was repeated in PS-1/PS-2 knockout cells (24Karlstrom H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Naslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 D, the PS-1Δexon8 isoform was unable to support the generation of Aβ. We inferred that in the COS-7 cells, PS-1Δexon8 must form oligomers with endogenous PS-1 to give rise to the modified γ-secretase activity. This hypothesis is supported by studies showing that oligomeric PS-1 is part of a high molecular weight complex in vivo (37Seeger M. Nordsted C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. St George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that PS-1 molecules exist as homodimers with direct interactions between adjacent PS-1 amino-terminal fragments (38Cervantes S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Marfany G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Beher D. Wrigley J.D.J. Owens A.P. Shearman M.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the unusual carboxyl-terminally truncated Aβ species (Aβ1–19 and Aβ1–28) are generated when PS-1Δexon8 is transfected into wild-type cells (Fig. 3) remains unknown. However, a recent IP-MS study using a series of specific γ-secretase inhibitors demonstrated that there was a wide number of apparently authentic cleavage sites for the enzyme, ranging from position 19 to 42 (39). The issues outlined above are unlikely to be resolved until the γ-secretase activity can be reconstituted in vitro.A key feature of the cotton wool plaques is the lack of neuritic dystrophy. Neuritic degeneration may depend on the level of Tau hyperphosphorylation (40Rapoport M. Ferreira A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and GSK-3β appears to play a crucial role in this process, as GSK-3β conditional transgenic mice displayed increased Tau hyperphosphorylation (41Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). PS-1 has been proposed to interact with GSK-3β (11Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yamaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, PS-1 is co-localized to neuritic processes in AD brains (14Weggen S. Diehlmann A. Buslei R. Beyreuther K. Bayer T.A. NeuroReport. 1998; 9: 3279-3283PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chui D.-H.

These studies consistently suggest a vital role for PS-1 in influencing the neuritic activity surrounding the senile plaques by bringing together GSK-3β and its substrate Tau during the formation of the plaques. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the PS-1Δexon8 splice isoform did not interact with GSK-3β or Tau (Fig. 6). This finding is supported by the observation that PS-1Δexon9, another mutation associated with plaques that lack neuritic dystrophy (5Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), also appears to have a lower affinity for GSK-3β as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 C). Thus, we propose that the lack of neuritic dystrophy observed in the senile plaques of affected individuals within this pedigree (III:28 and III:32) is due to the increased levels of the PS-1Δexon8 molecule. It would be of interest to determine whether the variable levels of neuritic dystrophy displayed in other pedigrees (6Smith M.J. Kwok J.B.J. McLean C.A. Kril J.J. Broe G.A. Nicholson G.A. Cappai R. Hallupp M. Cotton R.G.H. Masters C.L. Schofield P.R. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) might correlate with levels of PS-1Δexon8.Cotton wool plaques have been associated in some AD pedigrees with the neurological disorder, spastic paraparesis (5Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat.

Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that both cotton wool plaques and spastic paraparesis are variably expressed in these pedigrees as the outcome of phenotypic modifiers (6Smith M.J. Kwok J.B.J. McLean C.A. Kril J.J. Broe G.A. Nicholson G.A. Cappai R. Hallupp M. Cotton R.G.H. Masters C.L. Schofield P.R. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Accordingly, some PS-1Δexon9 pedigrees have been reported to lack cotton wool plaques or spastic paraparesis (42Perez-Tur J. Froelich S. Prihar G. Crook R. Baker M. Duff K. Wragg M. Busfield F. Lendon C. Clark R.F. NeuroReport. 1995; 7: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,43Hiltunen M. Helisalmi S. Mannermaa A. Alafuzoff I. Koivisto A.M. Lehtovirta M. Pirskanen M. Sulkava R. Verkkoniemi A. Soininen H. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Tas-1 family is of interest because there is no indication of spastic paraparesis in the mutation carriers. The relationship of the phenotype to the specific nature of the mutation remains to be determined. The presentation of the neuropathology also differs from other pedigrees with cotton wool plaques. In several pedigrees with PS-1Δexon9 mutations, the distribution of cored neuritic plaques and cotton wool plaques was fairly even (5Crook R. Verkkoniemi A. Perez-Tur J. Mehta N. Baker M. Houlden H. Farrer M. Hutton M. Lincoln S. Hardy J. Gwinn K. Somer M. Paetau A. Kalimo H. Ylikoski R. Poyhonen M. Kucera S. Haltia M. Nat.

Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the Tas-1 pedigree, cored neuritic plaques were found only in the hippocampus of one patient. This distribution of cored and cotton wool plaques is similar to that described in a patient with an APP T714I missense mutation (27Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this distribution of neuritic dystrophy remains unknown and may simply reflect the usual relatively high intensity of Tau pathology of the hippocampus in AD brains.The EOFAD family, Tas-1, offers a unique opportunity to study the secondary processes after the initial overproduction of Αβ species by mutant PS-1. Our data provides the first example of a pathogenic PS-1 mutation that generates a molecule that cannot support Aβ production on its own but causes aberrant carboxyl truncated Aβ species to be generated when endogenous wild-type presenilins are present. Our data suggest a central role for PS-1 not only in determining the overall level of Αβ but also in specifying the morphology of plaques and neuritic dystrophy. Moreover, identification of factors that affect the splicing of PS-1 may also be of importance in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, as the PS-1Δexon8 isoform has biochemical properties that differ from those of wild-type, full-length PS-1. Correlation of the specific neuropathology of AD cases with genetic mutations will lead to a better understanding of the role that PS-1 plays in the disease process. The presence of senile plaques is one of the key neuropathological features of familial as well as sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD).1Senile plaques are extracellular deposits composed mainly of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which is cleaved by a series of secretases from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (1Ray W.J. Ashall F. Goate A.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of three genes, APP, presenilin-1 (PS-1), or presenilin-2 (PS-2), give rise to early onset familial AD (EOFAD). Mutations in the PS-1 gene are associated with severe neuropathology. Typically, the brains of affected individuals have a large number of diffuse as well as cored neuritic plaques that are deposited in the cerebral cortex and in regions not normally involved in AD, such as the cerebellum (2Lemere C.A. Lopera F. Kosik K. Lendon C.L. Ossa J. Saido T.C. Yamaguchi H. Ruiz A. Martinez A. Madrigal L. Hincapie L. Arango J.C. Anthony D.C. Koo E.H. Goate A.M. Selkoe D.J. Nat.

While it is known that the surface receptor c-kit controls PGD2 expression in MCs by regulating the levels of a synthase that converts PGH2 to PGD2, the intracellular signaling proteins that act downstream of c-kit in this cyclooxygenase pathway have not been identified. We recently cloned a new cation-dependent, guanine nucleotide exchange factor/phorbol ester receptor (designated RasGRP4) that is required for the efficient expression of granule proteases in the human MC line HMC-1. GeneChip analysis of ∼12,600 transcripts in RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells revealed a >100-fold difference in the levels of hematopoietic PGD2 synthase mRNA. No other transcript in the eicosanoid pathway was influenced by RasGRP4 in a comparable manner. As assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis, RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells contained substantial amounts of PGD2 synthase protein. RasGRP4+ MCs also produced ∼15-fold more PGD2 than did RasGRP4− MCs when both cell populations were activated by calcium ionophore. The induced transcript is therefore translated, and substantial amounts of functional PGD2 synthase accumulate in RasGRP4+ MCs. In support of the conclusion that RasGRP4 controls PGD2expression in MCs, inhibition of RasGRP4 expression in the rat MC line RBL-2H3 using a siRNA approach resulted in low levels of PGD2 synthase protein.

In the cyclooxygenase pathway that ultimately leads to PGD2expression, liberated arachidonic acid is converted to PGG2and then to PGH2. PG endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) 1 (also known as cyclooxygenase 1) and PGHS-2 (also known as cyclooxygenase 2) are both able to carry out this two-step biosynthetic process. The resulting precursor eicosanoid is then metabolized by terminal synthases to form PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2/prostacylin, and thromboxane A2. Two PGD2 synthases have been identified in mice, rats, and humans (14Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The distinct hematopoietic enzyme that is expressed in MCs (16Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Igarashi M. Nagata A. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

PGH2 can be metabolized inside cells to thromboxane A2 and to a variety of PGs. Thus, the amount of PGD2 produced by an FcεRI- or calcium ionophore-activated MC is determined in a large part by the amount of PGD2synthase protein in the cell. MCs are heterogeneous in terms of what eicosanoids they produce. c-kit is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. PGD2-expressing MCs contain abundant amounts of c-kit on their surfaces, and Murakami et al. (17Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

To a lesser extent, IL-3 and IL-10 also influence the expression of PGD2 synthase in MCs. Treatment of human megakaryocytic cell lines with phorbol esters results in a 2–5-fold increase in the levels of PGD2 synthase mRNA (18Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem.

While these findings suggest that one or more diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-responsive proteins play an important role in the expression of PGD2 synthase in hematopoietic cells, the intracellular proteins that act downstream of c-kit and other membrane receptors to control the levels of PGD2 synthase in MCs have not been identified.

In contrast to the other three members of its family, RasGRP4 normally is restricted to mature MCs and their circulating progenitors.

Although human MCs do not express RasGRP1, RasGRP2, or RasGRP3, transfection studies carried out with the RasGRP4-defective HMC-1 cell line derived from a patient with a MC leukemia suggests that RasGRP4 is required for the final stages of MC development (20Yang Y.

Thus, at least two members of the RasGRP family of signaling proteins appear to control cellular differentiation and maturation. We previously noted that RasGRP4 influences the storage of varied neutral proteases in the secretory granules of a MC line. We now report that RasGRP4 also controls what eicosanoids this immune cell produces. RasGRP4+ and RasGRP4− HMC-1 cells (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Šali A. Stevens R.L. J.

Total RNA was isolated from the two populations of cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and comparative transcript profiling was carried out at the Gene Array Technology Center (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) with HG-U95A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the experimental protocol recommended by Affymetrix. Each GeneChip contains ∼12,600 probe sets. In these analyses, 8 μg of total RNA from RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells were reverse-transcribed using the GeneChip T7-oligo(dT) promoter primer kit. Biotinylated complementary RNAs, generated from the resulting cDNAs, were fragmented and incubated with the GeneChips for 16 h. The resulting GeneChips were incubated with streptavidin-phycoerythrin staining solution. The obtained signals were then amplified by sequentially incubating the GeneChips with goat IgG, biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody, and staining solution. Hybridization to the array was quantified with a Hewlett-Packard gene array laser scanner. In separate studies, the generated RT-PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis to confirm that they were derived from the authentic PGD2 synthase transcript. The GeneChip data obtained with the PGD2 synthase probe set were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. The PCR primers and fluorogenic probes for measuring PGD2synthase mRNA levels were designed with the use of “Primer Express” (Applied Biosystems, CA). TaqMan's 18 S rRNA control reagents were used to normalize RNA levels in each HMC-1 sample. Fluorescent probes were selected such that their T mwas ∼10 °C higher than the matching primer pair. Each high performance liquid chromatography-purified fluorescent probe contained a 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) reporter dye covalently attached at its 5′ end and a black hole quencher 1 quencher dye covalently attached at its 3′ end. The forward primer 5′-GGGCAGAGAAAAAGCAAGATGT-3′, the reverse primer 5′-CCCCCCTAAATATGTGTCCAAG-3′, and the dual-labeled fluorescent probe 5′-(FAM)-CAATGAGCTGCTCACGTATAATGCGCC-(BHQ-1)-3′ were used to quantitate PGD2 synthase mRNA levels in these assays. Reactions were carried out using an iCycler IQ real-time detection system (Bio-Rad). SuperScript one-step RT-PCR with PlatinumTaq kits (Invitrogen) were used. Each 50-μl reaction contained 200 ng of total RNA, 5 mm MgSO4, 500 nm forward and reverse primers, and 200 nmfluorescent probe. Samples were analyzed in triplicate. Negative-control reactions were carried out on replicate samples that had not been subjected to the reverse transcriptase step. Additional negative-control reactions were carried out in wells lacking HMC-1 cellular RNA. The reaction conditions were as follows: 15 min at 50 °C and 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 two-temperature cycles (15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). The standard curve method (24Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar, 25Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the obtained data. RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells were analyzed for their expression of four enzymes that participate in the cyclooxygenase and/or 5-lipoxygenase pathways. Both populations of cells were resuspended at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml in enriched medium alone or medium supplemented with varied combinations of IL-3 (10 ng/ml), IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-10 (10 ng/ml) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), IL-13 (10 ng/ml), KL (50 ng/ml), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α; 20 ng/ml) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After 5 days of cytokine exposure, the cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with rabbit antibodies that recognize human PGHS-1, 5-lipoxygenase, PGE2 synthase, and hematopoietic-type PGD2 synthase (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The latter antibody also recognizes rat hematopoietic-type PGD2 synthase. After each blot was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the treated blot was exposed to Tris-buffered saline (15 ml) containing 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% goat serum, and a 1:1000 dilution of a stock solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Genotech, St. Louis, MO) and BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells were washed, suspended at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, and stimulated with 0.5 μmcalcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min as done in other eicosanoid studies of MCs (26Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Lewis R.A. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4665-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The generated eicosanoids PGD2, PGE2, and leukotriene C4(LTC4) in the supernatants were quantitated using the relevant ELISA kits (Cayman Chemical). Each reaction was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Device). Data are given as mean ± S.D. Significance was defined as p < 0.05 by the Student's t test. A siRNA approach similar to that described by Elbashiret al. (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the consequences of decreased expression of RasGRP4 in the rat MC line RBL-2H3. The coding sequence of rat RasGRP4 (28Li L. Yang Y. Stevens R.L. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was scanned to identify a gene-specific 21-nucleotide sequence downstream of an “AA” sequence that possesses a 55% GC content. A BLAST search confirmed that the selected sequence (corresponding to residues 27–47 in GenBankTMaccession number AF465263) is not present in another transcript in GenBankTM data bases. The RasGRP4-specific oligonucleotide 5′-GUCUCAUCAGGAAUGCUCUGGdTdT-3′ and its corresponding oligonucleotide 5′-CCAGAGCAUUCCUGAUGAGACdTdT-3′ were synthesized and purified (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) and then annealed to form the final siRNA duplex with its TT overhangs. The resulting siRNA duplex was introduced into RBL-2H3 cells (line CRL-2256; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using a liposome transfection approach. Liposome/siRNA complexes were formed at room temperature using 3 μl of 20 μm siRNA, 2 μl of LipofectAMINETM 2000 (Invitrogen), and 100 μl of Opti-MEM I serum-free culture medium (Invitrogen). The resulting solution was added dropwise to each culture dish containing ∼5 × 104 adherent MCs. The cells were incubated 3–4 h at 37 °C. One ml of serum-enriched medium was then added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24–48 h. The transiently transfected cells were harvested, and the levels of PGD2 synthase and β-actin protein were measured using the above SDS-PAGE immunoblot approach. In these assays, each protein blot was incubated ∼17 h with anti-PGD2 synthase antibody and then for 1 h with the anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) before final development. All nontransformed rodent and human MCs that have been examined to date preferentially metabolize arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway to PGD2 rather than to PGE2. Nevertheless, Macchia et al. (29Macchia L. Hamberg M. Kumlin M. Butterfield J.H. Haeggstrom J.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1257: 58-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) discovered that HMC-1 cells produce ∼20-fold more PGE2 than PGD2. This surprising finding allowed us to use the c-kit + HMC-1 cell line to further elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways that control PGD2production in MCs. Transcript analysis (Fig. 1) revealed that the failure of HMC-1 cells to generate large amounts of PGD2 is a consequence of a low rate of transcription of the PGD2 synthase gene and/or a high rate of catabolism of its transcript. The RasGRP4 transcript was initially cloned from IL-3-developed mouse bone marrow-derived MCs (mBMMCs). While all mouse, rat, and human MCs appear to express RasGRP4 mRNA and/or protein, the amount of RasGRP4 protein in a mouse peritoneal MC greatly exceeds that in a mBMMC as assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis. 2L. Li, Y. Yang, and R. L. Stevens, unpublished data. Calcium ionophore- or FcεRI-activated mBMMCs produce ∼25-fold more LTC4than PGD2, whereas peritoneal MCs activated in a similar manner produce >40-fold more PGD2 than LTC4(1Lewis R.A. Soter N.A. Diamond P.T. Austen K.F. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1627-1631PubMed Google Scholar, 26Razin E. Mencia-Huerta J.M. Lewis R.A. Corey E.J. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4665-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cumulative data raised the possibility that RasGRP4 regulates arachidonic acid metabolism in MCs. Thus, we evaluated whether or not RasGRP4 controls PGD2 and/or LTC4 expression in HMC-1 and RBL-2H3 cells. Comparative transcript analysis of RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells using an Affymetrix GeneChip approach revealed a dramatic difference in the steady-state levels of the transcript that encodes hematopoietic PGD2 synthase in the two populations of cells (Table I). RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells contained >100-fold more PGD2 synthase mRNA than did the starting population of HMC-1 cells that express nonfunctional forms of RasGRP4. No transcript was induced to a comparable level, including the transcripts that encode brain-type PGD2 synthase and LTC4synthase. Table I shows profile data relating to the levels of the transcripts that encode different proteins that participate in arachidonic acid metabolism. The PGD2 synthase GeneChip data were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1 A) and by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1 B) analyses in three separate populations of RasGRP4-expressing cells. In a control experiment, HMC-1 cells transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 lacking the RasGRP4 cDNA contained barely detectable amounts of PGD2 synthase transcript (data not shown).Table IComparative expression of the transcripts that encode 20 proteins that participate in arachidonic acid metabolism in cellsTranscript and its GenBank™ accession numberAffymetrix ID numberFold change1-aThe “fold change” values represent the levels of the indicated transcripts in RasGRP4+HMC-1 cells relative to that in RasGRP4− HMC-1 cells.

In each case, data were normalized to the ubiquitously expressed transcripts that encode β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Open table in a new tab Because the levels of a transcript do not always correlate with the levels of its translated product, an SDS-PAGE immunoblot approach was used to compare the levels of PGD2 synthase protein in RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells. The amount of PGD2 synthase protein in RasGRP4− HMC-1 cells was nearly below detection (Fig. 2). In contrast, RasGRP4+HMC-1 cells contained substantial amounts of an intracellular 25-kDa protein that was recognized by the anti-PGD2 synthase antibody. The induced PGD2 synthase transcript is therefore translated and the appropriately sized biosynthetic enzyme accumulates in the transfectants. As assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis, RasGRP4 did not induce HMC-1 cells to increase their accumulation of PGHS1, PGE2 synthase, or 5-lipoxgenase protein (Fig. 2). Thus, RasGRP4 induces a selective accumulation of PGD2synthase mRNA and protein in this MC line. As assessed by ELISA, calcium ionophore-activated RasGRP4+HMC-1 cells produced 12–20-fold more PGD2(p < 0.05) than did RasGRP4− HMC-1 cells (Fig. 3). The levels of PGE2 and LTC4 were modestly increased and decreased, respectively, in the calcium ionophore-treated RasGRP4+ cells. However, the variations in the amounts of these eicosanoids were not statistically significant. The fact that HMC-1 cells express nonfunctional forms of RasGRP4 indicates that RasGRP4 is not essential in the early stages of MC development, including the c-kit/KL-mediated proliferation of its progenitors. Nevertheless, the observation that HMC-1 cells are unable to granulate (20Yang Y. Li L. Wong G.W. Krilis S.A. Madhusudhan M.S. Šali A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25756-25774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and to produce substantial amounts of PGD2 (Fig. 3) implies that RasGRP4 is required for the efficient expression of the cassette of genes that encode a number of the granule and lipid mediators of MC. The siRNA data obtained from transiently transfected RBL cells (Fig. 4) support this conclusion. RBL cells contain PGD2 synthase protein, and these rat MCs (30Seldin D.C. Adelman S. Austen K.F.

A. 1985; 82: 3871-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) produce substantial amounts of PGD2 when exposed to calcium ionophore (31Steinhoff M.M. Lee L.H. Jakschik B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 618: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells also contain RasGRP4 mRNA.2 Thus, a siRNA approach was used to evaluate the consequences of decreased expression of RasGRP4 in RBL-2H3 cells. As noted in Fig. 4, inhibition of RasGRP4 expression in the MC line resulted in a transient (12–48 h) inhibition of PGD2synthase expression. As far as we are aware, no one has examined eicosanoid production in transgenic mice that lack RasGRP1 or in cultured cells that have been induced to express varied forms of the other RasGRP family members. Nevertheless, the finding that RasGRP4 regulates PGD2 expression in two populations of cultured MCs raises the possibility that RasGRP1, RasGRP2, and/or RasGRP3 regulate eicosanoid production in other cell types.Figure 4PGD2 synthase levels in control and siRNA-treated RBL-2H3 cells. SDS-PAGE immunoblots, prepared from the lysates of RBL-2H3 cells before and after these cells were transfected with a RasGRP4-specific siRNA for 48 h, were probed for with anti-PGD2 synthase (PGDS) and anti-β-actin antibodies. Similar data were obtained in a second siRNA experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier in vitro studies suggested that KL is required for maximal expression of PGD2 synthase in mouse MCs. HMC-1 cells are able to proliferate in the absence of exogenous human cytokines, because these transformed cells possess an activating mutation in c-kit (32Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H.

The inability of HMC-1 cells to produce large amounts of PGD2 supports the conclusion that RasGRP4 acts downstream of c-kit. Murakami et al. (17Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) identified a number of cytokines that influence the KL-mediated expression of PGD2 synthase in cultured mouse MCs either in a positive or negative manner. As assessed by GeneChip analysis (data not shown), HMC-1 cells express the transcripts that encode the surface receptors for IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and KL. This MC line also expresses three distinct receptors that recognize TNF-α and its family members. RasGRP4− and RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells were therefore cultured for 5 days in the presence of varied combinations of IL-3, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, KL, and TNF-α. None of these cytokines were able to induce PGD2 synthase expression in RasGRP4− HMC-1 cells (data not shown). In addition, none of these cytokines were able to inhibit the expression of PGD2 synthase in RasGRP4+ HMC-1 cells. These data imply that RasGRP4 is the dominant intracellular signaling protein that controls PGD2 expression in MCs no matter what extracellular cytokine environment this immune cell encounters in tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2060265710,"Metabolites of vinyl chloride react with cytosine in DNA to form 3,N 4-ethenocytosine. Recent studies suggest that ethenocytosine is repaired by the base excision repair pathway with the ethenobase being removed by thymine-DNA glycosylase. Here single turnover kinetics have been used to compare the excision of ethenocytosine by thymine-DNA glycosylase with the excision of thymine. The effect of flanking DNA sequence on the excision of ethenocytosine was also investigated. The 34-bp duplexes studied here fall into three categories. Ethenocytosine base-paired with guanine within a CpG site (i.e.CpG·εC-DNA) was by far the best substrate having a specificity constant (k 2 /K d) of 25.1 × 106m−1 s−1. The next best substrates were DNA duplexes containing TpG·εC, GpG·εC, and CpG·T. These had specificity constants 45–130 times smaller than CpG·εC-DNA. The worst substrates were DNA duplexes containing ApG·εC and TpG·T, which had specificity constants, respectively, 1,600 and 7,400 times lower than CpG·εC-DNA. DNA containing ethenocytosine was bound much more tightly than DNA containing a G·T mismatch. This is probably because thymine-DNA glycosylase can flip out ethenocytosine from a G·εC base pair more easily than it can flip out thymine from a G·T mismatch. Because thymine-DNA glycosylase has a larger specificity constant for the removal of ethenocytosine, it has been suggested its primary purpose is to deal with ethenocytosine. However, these results showing that thymine-DNA glycosylase has a strong sequence preference for CpG sites in the excision of both thymine and ethenocytosine suggest that the main role of thymine-DNA glycosylase in vivo is the removal of thymine produced by deamination of 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites. Metabolites of vinyl chloride react with cytosine in DNA to form 3,N 4-ethenocytosine.

Johnson M.N. J. Occup. Med. 1974; 16: 150-151Google Scholar). Vinyl chloride is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1 to form chloroethylene oxide (2Barbin A. Bresil H. Croisy A. Jacquignon P. Malaveille C. Montesano R. Bartsch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 596-603Google Scholar) which can rearrange spontaneously to give chloroacetaldehyde (3O'Neill I. Barbin A. Friesen M. Bartsch H. IARC Sci. Publ. 1986; 70: 57-73Google Scholar). Both these metabolites react in vitro with DNA to form ethenoadducts of adenine, guanine, and cytosine (Fig. 1). Three of these four possible ethenobases have been detected in animals exposed to vinyl chloride (reviewed in Ref. 4Barbin A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 55-69Google Scholar). Ethenobases have also been found in the DNA of rats and humans not exposed to vinyl chloride. These are probably formed endogenously by the reaction of lipid peroxidation products with DNA (5Nair J. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 55-61Google Scholar). The ethenobases cause mutations by misincorporating during DNA replication, and there is evidence that these mutations are responsible for the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride and related chemicals (6Marion M.J. Boivin-Angele S. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 315-324Google Scholar). Extracts from human cells remove all four ethenoadducts from DNA (7Dosanjh M.K. Chenna A. Kim E. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Samson L. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1024-1028Google Scholar). Because they are released from the DNA as the ethenobases, it is likely that they are repaired by the base excision repair pathway. The base excision repair pathway (reviewed in Refs. 8Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Google Scholar and 9Schärer O.D. Jiricny J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Google Scholar) involves initial removal of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase. In the short-patch repair pathway the resultant abasic site is cut by an apurinic endonuclease, probably human apurinic endonuclease 1 (APEX1; also known as HAP1, APE1, or Ref-1). The single nucleotide gap is filled by DNA polymerase β which also removes the abasic sugar-phosphate. Finally, the phosphate backbone is restored by a DNA ligase. Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) is the enzyme believed to repair G·T mismatches arising from spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine (10Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Google Scholar). Support for this comes from the observation that TDG excises thymine from G·T mismatches at sites of cytosine methylation (i.e. CpG) much more efficiently than from other DNA sequences (11Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.-Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Google Scholar, 12Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6869-6875Google Scholar, 13Sibghat-Ullah Gallinari P. Xu Y.-Z.

A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Google Scholar) independently found that TDG can also remove ethenocytosine from DNA. A common feature of many DNA glycosylases is their tight binding to the abasic sites that they produce (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar, 17Miao F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar). Failure to consider this product inhibition led to the so-called single strand-selective monofunctionaluracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) originally being incorrectly designated as a single-stranded DNA glycosylase (18Nilsen H. Haushalter K.A. Robins P. Barnes D.E. Verdine G.L. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4278-4286Google Scholar, 22Haushalter K.A. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 174-185Google Scholar). Product binding is particularly strong for TDG and is so tight thatin vitro each glycosylase molecule can only process one G·T mismatch (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). The next enzyme in the repair pathway, APEX, can relieve this product inhibition and increase the turnover of TDG by releasing the glycosylase from the abasic site (23Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Google Scholar). The mechanism of this release is not yet known. The initial experiments showing that TDG can remove ethenocytosine from DNA did not consider product inhibition of the glycosylase (15Hang B. Medina M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13561-13566Google Scholar, 16Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Google Scholar), and so we decided to study TDG excision of ethenocytosine using single turnover experiments. Because the base pair flanking the mismatched guanine has a remarkably strong effect on the rate of thymine excision from G·T mismatches, the effect of the flanking base pair on the excision of ethenocytosine was also measured. 34-Base deoxynucleotides of the general sequence AGC TTG GCT GCA GGX GGA CGG ATC CCC GGG AAT T (where X is A, C, G, or T) were annealed with the complementary strand that had either thymine or ethenocytosine opposite the underlined G. The nomenclature used in the following text is XpG·T-DNA for the guanine·thymine mismatch containing duplexes and XpG·εC-DNA for the guanine·ethenocytosine containing duplexes. X is either A, C, G, or T and refers to the base 5′ to the mismatched guanine. Normal base-containing oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer and purified as described previously (24Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2501-2506Google Scholar). Deoxyethenocytidine was synthesized from deoxycytidine using the protocol of Zhang et al. (25Zhang W. Rieger R. Iden C. Johnson F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 148-156Google Scholar). The correct structure of the synthesized deoxyethenocytidine was confirmed by UV and 1H NMR spectroscopy, which gave data agreeing with that published previously (25Zhang W. Rieger R. Iden C. Johnson F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 148-156Google Scholar). The 5′-dimethoxytrityl-protected deoxyethenocytidine phosphoramidite was prepared by standard procedures (26.Gait, M. (ed) (1984) Oligonucleotide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, OxfordGoogle Scholar, 27Xu Y.-Z. Swann P.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 185-189Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides containing ethenocytosine opposite the underlined G were synthesized using the standard DNA synthesis protocol except that the coupling time for the ethenocytidine phosphoramidite was increased to 2 min. The coupling yield, as judged by trityl cation release, was the same for the ethenocytidine phosphoramidite as for the unmodified phosphoramidites. Full-length oligodeoxynucleotides were separated from failure sequences using Nensorb columns (DuPont), further purified by ion exchange chromatography at pH 12 (27) using a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and finally desalted. Oligodeoxynucleotides prepared in this way were >95% pure as judged by 260 nm absorbance of their ion exchange chromatography traces. Samples of the oligodeoxynucleotides were digested with nuclease P1 plus alkaline phosphatase and analyzed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. A fifth peak eluted after the four natural deoxynucleosides. This had the absorbance expected for a single deoxyethenocytidine and co-eluted with standard deoxyethenocytidine, thus confirming the presence of ethenocytosine in the oligodeoxynucleotides. Thymine-DNA glycosylase was expressed inEscherichia coli from the pT7-hTDG plasmid as described previously (28Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Google Scholar) and was purified in three chromatographic steps (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). The concentrations of the dilute TDG samples used for the kinetic experiments were determined accurately using a bandshift assay. For this, five different amounts of TDG were incubated for 30 min with32P-labeled CpG·T-DNA in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4% Ficoll 400). Electrophoresis was performed as described (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). The amount of DNA bound was plotted against the volume of TDG added, and the concentration of the glycosylase was determined from linear regression analysis of this plot. Human APEX was a gift from Dr. I. Hickson and Dr. D. Rothwell (Oxford University, UK). 34-Base pair DNA duplexes were 5′-labeled with 32P in the strand containing the mismatched thymine or ethenocytosine. They were reacted at room temperature with TDG in reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing either 50 or 140 mm KCl. Because of the sensitivity of the TDG reaction to salt, consistent results can only be attained if extra care is taken to ensure that the concentrations of MgCl2 and KCl are kept constant (i.e. salt present in the protein and DNA stock solutions must be allowed for). For the inhibition experiments, labeled DNA and inhibitor were mixed first, and TDG was then added to start the reaction. Samples from the G·T reactions were removed at various times and quenched by addition of NaOH and EDTA to a concentration of 0.1 m and 10 mm, respectively. Abasic sites produced by the glycosylase were cleaved by heating at 90 °C for 30 min. Because of the greater lability of deoxyethenocytidine to alkali, milder conditions must be used for the ethenocytosine oligonucleotides. Ethenocytosine samples were heated at 90 °C for 30 min in 30 mm piperidine, 10 mm EDTA. This completely cleaved abasic sites, whereas cleavage of the parent DNA containing ethenocytosine was kept to less than 2%. The cleaved DNA was separated from full-length, unreacted DNA by perfusion chromatography using a 2.1 × 30 mm Q HyperD (Biosepra) anion exchange column as described (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA was detected by Cerenkov counting using a Berthold LB 506 C-1 monitor and was quantified by integration of the peaks. For the determination of kinetic constants, reactions were carried out using equimolar concentrations of TDG and DNA at seven different concentrations as follows: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 times the approximate value of K d. The reaction was analyzed using the reaction model given in Scheme FSI that assumes no product is released by the glycosylase during the time that the reaction is monitored. Data for all seven concentrations were fitted simultaneously using the differential equation solving program Berkeley Madonna (version 8.0.1; www.berkeleymadonna.com). The program was used to obtain the best fit of the theoretical lines to all of the experimental data by varying the values ofk 1, k −1, andk 2. The single turnover excision of ethenocytosine from CpG·εC-DNA was compared with the excision of thymine from CpG·T-DNA (Fig.2). Under the conditions used for this experiment (10 nm DNA + 10 nm TDG in buffer containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mmKCl), the initial rate of excision for ethenocytosine (0.72 nm min−1) was more than four times slower than the initial rate of excision for thymine (3.2 nmmin−1). Decreasing the concentration of enzyme and DNA had no effect upon the rate of excision of ethenocytosine showing that in Fig. 2 all the enzyme is bound to the CpG·εC-DNA. The value of K dmust therefore be much less than 10 nm. Also, the initial rate for CpG·εC-DNA in Fig. 2 must beV max, giving a value of 0.0012 s−1for k 2. In contrast, reducing the concentration of TDG and CpG·T-DNA significantly reduced the rate of thymine excision (data not shown). Thus, under the conditions of Fig. 2, not all the glycosylase is bound to the CpG·T-DNA. Therefore, the initial rate for CpG·T-DNA in Fig. 2 is less thanV max, and so k 2 for CpG·T-DNA must be greater than 0.0053 s−1. An attempt to get accurate values forK d and k 2 in the buffer conditions used in Fig. 2, by measuring the rates of excision at different concentrations of glycosylase and substrate, was unsuccessful when CpG·εC-DNA was used, because there was no change in the rate of excision even at the lowest concentration detectable by our assay (0.01 nm). Thus,K d values for the ethenocytosine oligonucleotide must be <0.01 nm under these buffer conditions. Increasing the concentration of salt decreases the DNA binding affinity of most proteins, mainly because the protein displaces cations from the DNA phosphates when it binds to the DNA (29Härd T. Lundbäck T. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 62: 121-139Google Scholar, 30Lohman T.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 19: 191-245Google Scholar). By increasing KCl to 140 mm (which is isotonic to mammalian tissue),K d and k 2 could be measured for the action of TDG on both CpG·T-DNA and CpG·εC-DNA (Fig.3 and TableI). Data for the base excision at seven different equimolar concentrations of DNA and TDG were fitted simultaneously to the reaction model in Scheme FSI. When fitting was performed allowing all three rate constants to vary,k 1 reached the maximum value expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction (109m−1 s−1). However, equally good fits to the experimental data were obtained withk 1 fixed at values up to 2 orders of magnitude lower and allowing just k −1 andk 2 to vary. These fits gave essentially identical values for k 2 andk −1/k 1 (i.e. K d). Although the absolute values ofk 1 and k −1 were poorly defined by the experimental data, the results do show thatk −1 ≫ k 2, and so the reaction is not limited by association of TDG with the substrates. In close agreement with the results in 50 mm KCl, the maximum rate of excision (k 2) for ethenocytosine is six times slower than the excision of thymine (Table I). Most strikinglyK d for the CpG·εC-DNA substrate is nearly 800 times smaller than the K d of CpG·T-DNA.Table IKinetic constants k2 and Kd for TDG excision of ethenocytosine and thymine from mismatches with different flanking DNA sequencesSubstratek 2K dSpecificity constant, k 2/K ds−1nmμm−1s−1CpG·T7.71 (±0.38) × 10−340.6 (±4.8)0.192 (±0.014)TpG·T0.118 (±0.056) × 10−333.7 (±7.5)0.0034 (±0.0010)CpG·εC1.22 (±0.04) × 10−30.0525 (±0.0125)25.1 (±7.6)TpG·εC0.167 (±0.024) × 10−30.33 (±0.11)0.56 (±0.20)GpG·εC0.251 (±0.016) × 10−30.789 (±0.193)0.325 (±0.060)ApG·εC0.0190 (±0.0016) × 10−31.26 (±0.30)0.0154 (±0.0024)The rate of base excision of seven different equimolar concentrations of TDG and mismatched DNA was measured in 140 mm KCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values forK d and k 2 were determined by fitting data for all seven concentrations simultaneously to the reaction model given in Scheme FSI, as shown for the examples of CpG·T-DNA and CpG·εC-DNA in Fig. 3.

Open table in a new tab The rate of base excision of seven different equimolar concentrations of TDG and mismatched DNA was measured in 140 mm KCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values forK d and k 2 were determined by fitting data for all seven concentrations simultaneously to the reaction model given in Scheme FSI, as shown for the examples of CpG·T-DNA and CpG·εC-DNA in Fig. 3. Errors in parentheses are S.D. for at least three different experiments. The binding of DNA, represented by K din Scheme FSI, involves flipping the mismatched base out of the DNA helix into a pocket of TDG (31Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Google Scholar). There are two possible explanations of why CpG·εC-DNA has a much smallerK d than CpG·T. 1) TDG binds CpG·εC-DNA more tightly by making more and/or better contacts to the DNA substrate, or 2) less energy is required to flip out the ethenocytosine from a G·εC base pair than to flip out a thymine from a G·T mismatch. In terms of potential contacts, the only difference between the two substrates is the base to be excised. The first explanation therefore implies that TDG binds ethenocytosine more tightly than thymine. This was tested by investigating whether free ethenocytosine base inhibits the TDG reaction more than free thymine base. Addition of either thymine or ethenocytosine up to a concentration of 5 mm had no effect upon the reaction of TDG (data not shown). Higher concentrations of free base were not practical because of their poor solubility. TDG therefore has little affinity for either thymine or ethenocytosine. This is in contrast to uracil-DNA glycosylase where 2 mmuracil inhibited the reaction by 58% (32Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Google Scholar). Inhibition of the TDG reaction by single-stranded oligonucleotides containing either ethenocytosine or thymine was also investigated. TDG does not excise thymine (23Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Google Scholar) or ethenocytosine (16Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Google Scholar) from single-stranded DNA, and so these oligonucleotides would act as reversible inhibitors. The results in Fig.4 show that the rate of excision of thymine from 25 nm CpG·T-DNA can be reduced to ∼50% by inhibition with 250 nm single-stranded thymine containing oligonucleotide. A similar but slightly lower level of inhibition was given by 60 nm single-stranded ethenocytosine oligonucleotide. The results in Fig. 4 suggest that TDG binds single-stranded DNA containing ethenocytosine approximately three times more tightly than single-stranded DNA containing thymine. The rate of excision of thymine from G·T mismatches is dependent upon the base pair 5′ to the mismatched guanine (11Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.-Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Google Scholar, 12Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6869-6875Google Scholar, 13Sibghat-Ullah Gallinari P. Xu Y.-Z. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. Jiricny J. Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12926-12932Google Scholar, 14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). To see whether the excision of ethenocytosine exhibited a similar dependence upon flanking sequence, K d andk 2 values for the excision of ethenocytosine from TpG·εC-DNA, GpG·εC-DNA, and ApG·εC-DNA were determined. For comparison,K d and k 2 were also measured for the excision of thymine from TpG·T-DNA under identical buffer conditions (the excision of thymine from other sequence contexts was too slow to allow accurate determination of K d). The results in Table I show that excision of ethenocytosine also is very dependent upon the 5′ base pair. In terms of the specificity constant, k 2/K d, an ethenocytosine in a CpG·εC site is 45 times more efficiently removed than the next best ethenocytosine substrate, TpG·εC-DNA. This is very similar to the difference in specificity constant between CpG·T-DNA and TpG·T-DNA. However, although with the G·T substrates this drop in specificity is entirely because of a reducedk 2, the drop in specificity for ethenocytosine is the result of TpG·εC-DNA having both reducedk 2 and decreased binding to TDG (larger K d). The other ethenocytosine oligonucleotides are even worse substrates; GpG·εC-DNA and ApG·εC-DNA had 77- and 1630-fold, respectively, lower specificity constants than CpG·εC-DNA. Again these reduced specificities are because of both decreased k 2 and increasedK d. An earlier study using slightly different buffer conditions found that k 2 for the excision of thymine from G·T mismatches depended upon the base 5′ to the mismatched guanine in the order C ≫ T > G > A (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). Here, excision of ethenocytosine from G·εC base pairs follows a similar trend except that k 2 is faster with a 5′-guanine than with a 5′-thymine (i.e. C ≫ G > T > A). In vitro, the reaction of TDG with G·T mismatches is limited by extremely slow release of the abasic DNA product (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar, 33Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Google Scholar, 34Schärer O.D. Nash H.M. Jiricny J. Laval J. Verdine G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8592-8597Google Scholar). This dissociation is so slow that each TDG molecule removes only one thymine. The apurinic endonuclease, APEX, increases the turnover number of TDG by displacing the glycosylase from the abasic site. The effect of APEX on the turnover of TDG with CpG·T-DNA was compared with its effect on the turnover of TDG with CpG·εC-DNA (Fig.5). With both substrates in the absence of APEX, the reaction stops after a stoichiometric amount of base has been removed. In the presence of APEX, the turnover of both substrates is increased. This increase in turnover is dependent upon the concentration of APEX and is essentially the same for CpG·T-DNA and for CpG·εC-DNA. In this paper the effect of flanking DNA sequence on the excision of ethenocytosine by TDG has been examined. To avoid the problem of product inhibition often encountered with DNA glycosylases and which is particularly strong for TDG, single turnover kinetics were used to determine the kinetic constants k 2 andK d (Scheme FSI). Saparbaev et al. (16Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Google Scholar) previously calculated k cat andK m values for the reaction of TDG with oligonucleotides containing GpG·T or GpG·εC mismatches assuming that the reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Their conclusion that G·εC is a much better substrate for TDG than G·T broadly agrees with our results for the mismatches in this sequence context, but, although the conclusion is correct, since product release by TDG is so slow a Michaelis-Menten analysis is not appropriate. It was originally believed that the physiological purpose of TDG was to remove thymine from the G·T mismatches produced by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (10Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Google Scholar), but the observation that TDG removes ethenocytosine faster than thymine led to the suggestion that the real in vivo role of TDG is to remove ethenocytosine and that the removal of thymine from G·T mismatches was a fortuitous accident (15Hang B. Medina M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13561-13566Google Scholar, 16Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Google Scholar). However, from Table I it is clear that TDG has evolved to have a strong sequence preference for base excision at CpG sites. Because G·T mismatches produced by the deamination of 5-methylcytosine occur exclusively in the sequence context CpG·T, the main role of TDG in cells must therefore be to remove deaminated 5-methylcytosine from CpG sites. In E. coli the mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase, which is a homologue of TDG, appears to be the only glycosylase that removes ethenocytosine efficiently (35Lutsenko E. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31034-31038Google Scholar). In humans, besides TDG there are two other enzymes known to remove ethenocytosine. These are SMUG1 (36Kavli B. Sundheim O. Akbari M. Otterlei M. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Hagen L. Krokan H.E. Slupphaug G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39926-39936Google Scholar), 2J. E. A. Wibley, T. R. Waters, K. Haushalter, G. L. Verdine, and L. H. Pearl, manuscript in preparation. and the methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4, also known as MED1) which has a weak ethenocytosine glycosylase activity (20Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Genuardi M. Karbowski M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 473-480Google Scholar). It is not yet known which (if any) of these enzymes is responsible for removing ethenocytosinein vivo. The specificity constant for CpG·T-DNA mismatches is 56 times higher than for the next best G·T substrate, TpG·T-DNA (Table I). This difference in specificity is almost entirely because of a drop in k 2 with virtually no change in K d. In an earlier study we deduced that when it binds to a G·T mismatch in the sequence CpG·T, the glycosylase makes cooperative contacts to the mismatched guanine and to the C·G base pair on the 5′ side of the mismatched guanine (14Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar). The fact that K d does not change when the 5′-flanking base pair is changed shows that the binding energy of the contacts to the mismatched guanine and to the 5′-C·G base pair is used to stabilize the transition state (to lowerk 2) and not to stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex. There is a similar drop in specificity (45-fold) on going from CpG·εC-DNA to TpG·εC-DNA suggesting that TDG makes the same contacts to the mismatched guanine and the 5′-C·G base pair of the CpG·εC-DNA substrate. However, in this case the drop in specificity is due both to a lower k 2 and to an increase inK d, and so the binding energy of these contacts is used to stabilize both the transition state and the enzyme-substrate complex. TDG excised ethenocytosine from three of the four DNA sequences containing G·εC tested with specificity constants (k 2/K d) that are at least as good as the physiologically relevant G·T oligonucleotide, CpG·T-DNA. However, in all of the G·εC substrates ethenocytosine was excised more slowly than thymine, and the increased specificity constants result from much lower K d values. TDG binds CpG·εC-DNA nearly 800 times more tightly than CpG·T-DNA, corresponding to a difference in binding energy of ∼4 kcal/mol. In the enzyme-substrate complex the base to be excised would be flipped out of the DNA helix into a binding pocket of the glycosylase (31Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6599-6609Google Scholar, 33Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Google Scholar). In this complex the enzyme makes contacts to the DNA backbone, to the mismatched guanine, and to the flipped out base itself. Because the contacts to the mismatched guanine and to the DNA backbone would be the same for CpG·T-DNA and for CpG·εC-DNA, the 800-fold lowerK d of CpG·εC-DNA may result from TDG binding the flipped out ethenocytosine more tightly than the flipped out thymine. If ethenocytosine was bound very strongly one might expect free ethenocytosine to inhibit the TDG reaction, but up to 5 mm ethenocytosine had no effect. Sub-micromolar concentrations of single-stranded DNA containing either an ethenocytosine or a thymine did inhibit the TDG reaction (Fig. 4), but the single-stranded DNA containing an ethenocytosine was only three times more effective than the single-stranded DNA containing a thymine. This suggests that the majority of the 800-fold tighter binding of CpG·εC-DNA compared with CpG·Τ-DNA is not because of TDG binding the flipped out ethenocytosine more tightly than thymine. An alternative explanation for the lowerK d of CpG·εC-DNA is that less energy is needed to flip out the ethenocytosine from a G·εC base pair than is needed to flip out thymine from a G·T mismatch. Melting temperature studies show that a G·εC base pair is less stable than a G·T base pair, although the magnitude of this difference in stability varies considerably between different authors. One melting temperature study found that on average a G·T mismatch contributes 3.5 kcal/mol less energy than a G·C base pair to the stability of a DNA duplex (37Allawi H.T. SantaLucia Jr., J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10581-10594Google Scholar). In another study, 13 bp DNA duplexes containing a G·εC base pair were 13.4–15.3 kcal/mol less stable than the parental G·C-containing duplexes (38Gelfand C.A. Plum G.E. Grollman A.P. Johnson F.

A further study directly comparing the melting temperature of 15-bp DNA duplexes containing either a G·εC base pair or a G·T mismatch found that the G·εC containing duplexes were 0.43–1.63 kcal/mol less stable than the corresponding G·T-containing duplex (39Sági J. Perry A. Hang B. Singer B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 839-845Google Scholar). Interestingly, the difference in stability between G·εC and G·T was greatest when the mismatch was in a CpG site. Structural studies also indicate that a G·εC base pair is considerably less stable than a G·T mismatch. Both crystal (40Hunter W.N. Brown T. Kneale G. Anand N.N. Rabinovich D. Kennard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9962-9970Google Scholar) and NMR (41Allawi H.T. SantaLucia Jr., J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4925-4934Google Scholar) structures show that a G·T mismatch forms a stable “wobble” base pair that involves two good hydrogen bonds (Fig.6). Also, the guanine and thymine are stacked well with the adjacent bases in the DNA helix. Although the NMR structure of a G·εC base pair reveals a similar wobble geometry, this base pair is much more distorted, and there is only one hydrogen bond between the ethenocytosine and the guanine (42Cullinan D. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Eisenberg M. de los Santos C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11933-11943Google Scholar). In addition to this weaker hydrogen bonding, the ethenocytosine base is very poorly stacked with the adjacent bases, suggesting that the G·εC base pair is considerably less stable than a G·T mismatch. An investigation of the reaction of chloroacetaldehyde with DNA found that, although the distribution of ethenoadducts was not random, there was no obvious DNA sequence preference for the formation of ethenoadducts (43Tudek B. Kowalczyk P. Ciesla J.M. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 279-293Google Scholar). Ethenocytosine is therefore expected to occur in all sequence contexts. If TDG were the sole enzyme responsible for repairing ethenocytosine, the results in Table I suggest that ethenocytosine formed at ApG·εC sites would be very poorly repaired. Thus one might expect a predominance of mutations of G·C base pairs at ApG sites in vinyl chloride-treated animals. Analysis of liver tumors from rats exposed to vinyl chloride found that 3 of 25 angiosarcomas had a mutation of a G·C base pair in their p53 gene (44Barbin A. Froment O. Boivin S. Marion M.J. Belpoggi F. Maltoni C. Montesano R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1695-1698Google Scholar). In another study, analysis of hepatacellular carcinomas taken from workers exposed to vinyl chloride found that 5 of 18 had a mutated G·C base pair in their p53 gene (45Weihrauch M. Lehnert G. Köckerling F. Wittekind C. Tannapfel A. Cancer (Phila.). 2000; 88: 1030-1036Google Scholar). Although the number of mutations studied so far is very small, it is perhaps significant that none of these G·C mutations occur at ApG sequences. This suggests that poor repair of ethenocytosine at ApG·εC sites by TDG is not an important factor in vinyl chloride-induced carcinogenesis. Acting alone, TDG removes a stoichiometric amount of mismatched base because the glycosylase remains bound to the abasic site product, but the next enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, the apurinic endonuclease APEX, releases the TDG from the abasic site (Fig. 5 and Refs. 23Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Google Scholar and 46Privezentzev C.V. Saparbaev M. Laval J. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 277-284Google Scholar). Tight binding of abasic DNA and the stimulatory effect of apurinic endonucleases has now been found for several other DNA glycosylases (21Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar, 47Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Google Scholar, 48Sung J.S. Mosbaugh D.W.

The mechanism of the release of the glycosylase by APEX is unknown and the subject of some controversy. One theory that has been proposed is that the apurinic endonuclease actspassively by simply “mopping up” free abasic DNA to prevent re-binding of the glycosylase to the abasic DNA, thus allowing it to react with more substrate DNA (21Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar, 50Hardeland U. Bentele M. Lettieri T. Steinacher R. Jiricny J. Schar P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 235-253Google Scholar). This is probably true for some glycosylases but not for TDG. The fact that APEX increases the turnover of TDG to more than 40 times the observed rate of TDG dissociation from abasic DNA suggests that APEX activelydisplaces the glycosylase from the abasic site (23Waters T.R. Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Google Scholar, 46Privezentzev C.V. Saparbaev M. Laval J. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 277-284Google Scholar), either by interacting directly with the bound TDG to displace the glycosylase or by binding to the DNA and distorting the DNA structure in such a way that disrupts the TDG-DNA complex (51Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Google Scholar, 52Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 137-147Google Scholar). The recent discovery that mouse TDG interacts, albeit weakly, with mouse apurinic endonuclease 1 also supports an active displacement mechanism (53Tini M. Benecke A. Um S.J. Torchia J. Evans R.M. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 265-277Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, APEX increases the turnover of TDG with CpG·εC-DNA to the same extent as with CpG·T-DNA. Because the reaction of TDG with CpG·εC-DNA gives the same glycosylase-abasic DNA complex as the reaction of TDG with CpG·T-DNA, this is consistent with a model where APEX actively displaces the TDG from the abasic site.

In the active conformation, Rab GTPases interact with diverse effectors implicated in vesicle budding, cargo sorting, motor-dependent transport, tethering, docking, and fusion. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins, and other accessory factors, including Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, provide multiple points of regulation throughout the GTPase cycle by modulating nucleotide binding, GTP hydrolysis, and membrane association (4Segev N. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2001/RE11)Google Scholar). Protein kinases and phosphatases have also been implicated in the regulation of Rab function, either directly or by phosphorylation of effectors and regulatory factors (5Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I.

Thus, through regulated interactions with effectors, Rab GTPases couple signal transduction networks to the membrane trafficking machinery. Both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis depend on activation of Rab5, which plays a critical role in clathrin-coated vesicle formation, endosome motility, and early endosome fusion (9Somsel Rodman J.

Endosomal localization requires an intact FYVE domain and is sensitive to inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity as well as mutants of conserved residues in the FYVE domain that disrupt PtdIns(3)P binding (15Burd C.G.

Localization also requires a region of ∼40 residues proximal to the FYVE domain but is not influenced by mutations that disrupt the interaction with Rab5 (25Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H.

EEA1 forms a parallel coiled coil homodimer, and we have shown that the C terminus of EEA1 has an organized quaternary structure that supports a multivalent interaction with membranes containing PtdIns(3)P, explaining the requirement for the proximal 40 residues (33Callaghan J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 899-911Google Scholar) to bind Rab22 as well. The C2H2 Zn2+ finger of EEA1 shares significant homology with the C2H2Zn2+ finger in the Rab5 effector Rabenosyn as well as the corresponding C2H2 Zn2+ finger in Vac1p, an effector of the yeast Rab5 homologue Ypt51. Like EEA1, Rabenosyn and Vac1p contain a FYVE domain involved in endosome targeting (14Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Google Scholar, 15Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutants implicate Vac1p in intervacuolar trafficking and vacuolar protein sorting (36Weisman L.S. Emr S.D. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunodepletion of Rabenosyn blocks homotypic early endosome fusion as well as heterotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes, suggesting that Rabenosyn plays a critical role distinct from that of EEA1 (14Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Google Scholar). The GTP-bound forms of Rab4 and Rab5 bind to sites in the central and C-terminal regions of Rabenosyn, respectively (38de Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Google Scholar). It is not known whether Rab5 binds directly to the C2H2 Zn2+ finger of EEA1, Rabenosyn, or Vac1p. Two-hybrid data indicate that the integrity of the C2H2 Zn2+ finger is essential for Rab5 binding to the N terminus of EEA1 (11Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A.

Biochem. 1999; 265: 361-366Google Scholar). The requirement for an intact C2H2 Zn2+ finger may reflect a direct interaction with Rab5 or an indirect structural role. For example, the double Zn2+ finger of Rabphilin3A is essential for interaction with Rab3A; however, in the crystal structure of the Rab3A-Rabphilin3A complex, the double Zn2+ finger does not contact Rab3A but instead supports interactions with flanking regions (40Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the structural basis underlying the function of EEA1 in the tethering and fusion of early endosomes and endocytic vesicles, we have characterized the interaction of Rab5C with truncation and site-specific mutants of EEA1 using quantitative binding measurements. The results demonstrate that the C2H2 Zn2+ finger is sufficient for the N-terminal interaction with Rab5C and support a mode of interaction in which an invariant tryptophan residue, which is partially exposed at the interface between the switch I and II regions of Rab5, lies in or near an interface that involves a cluster of hydrophobic residues in the C2H2 Zn2+ finger. EEA1 and Rab5C constructs were amplified with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). EEA1 constructs were sub-cloned into a modified pET15b vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag (MGHHHHHHGS). Rab5C constructs were sub-cloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression as an N-terminal GST fusion. Site-specific mutants were generated using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs and mutants were verified by sequencing the entire coding region from both 5′ and 3′ directions. BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the pGEX-4T1/Rab5C or modified pET15b/EEA1 plasmids, grown in 2× YT-amp (16 g of Bactotryptone, 10 g of Bactoyeast extract, 5 g of sodium chloride, and 100 mg of ampicillin per liter) at 25 (EEA1-(36–91)) or 37 °C (Rab5C and EEA1 constructs) to an A 600 of 0.6, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. For purification of wild type and mutant proteins, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and disrupted by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 35,000 × gfor 40 min. For His6 fusion proteins, clarified supernatants were loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 0.1% mercaptoethanol), His6 fusion proteins were eluted with a gradient of 10–150 mm imidazole. For GST fusions, the supernatants were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. After washing with 10 column volumes of the same buffer, GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Subsequent ion exchange chromatography using Source Q or Source S (AmershamBiosciences) followed by gel filtration chromatography over Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) resulted in preparations that were >99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. To generate the untagged form of Rab5C constructs, GST fusion proteins at a concentration of 2–4 mg/ml were incubated with 2 μg/ml human α-thrombin (Hematologic Technologies) overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% mercaptoethanol. Following incubation with glutathione-agarose to remove residual fusion protein, the cleaved Rab5C constructs were further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Typical yields of purified proteins range from 10 to 100 mg/liter of bacterial culture. For Rab GTPases, all buffers are supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2. GST-Rab5-(18–185) was exchanged at 37 °C for 30 min with a 25-fold molar excess of GppNHp in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 units of agarose-immobilized alkaline phosphatase per mg of protein. The exchange reaction was quenched by addition of 10 mm MgCl2, and excess nucleotide was removed by gel filtration on Superdex-75. His6-EEA1 constructs were incubated in a 1:1 molar ratio with GDP-bound or GppNHp-bound GST-Rab5-(18–185) at a concentration of 20 μm for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20). 50 μl of equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) were added to 100 μl of the protein mixture and incubated for 1 h. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the pellet washed three times with 100 μl of buffer A. After washing, the beads were incubated with buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione for 15 min and the fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. SPR sensograms were collected with a Biacore X instrument (Amersham Biosciences AB) using a carboxy-methylated (CM5) sensor chip to which a GST antibody was covalently coupled using reagents and protocols supplied by the manufacturer. All proteins were dialyzed into flow buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20) prior to injection. Tandem flow cells were utilized; one was loaded with the 500 nmGST-Rab5C (sample channel), and the other was loaded with an equivalent molar quantity of GST (reference channel) expressed and purified as described above for the GST-Rab5 constructs. GST and GST-Rab5C were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and subsequent injections were conducted at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Conversion to the active conformation was achieved by injecting 50 μl of 3 μmRabex-5 followed immediately by a 10-μl injection of 200 nm GppNHp. Binding and dissociation were monitored following 20-μl injections of increasing concentrations of His6-EEA1. Following curve alignment, the reference sensogram, which reflects bulk refractive index changes and/or reversible nonspecific binding, was subtracted from the sample sensogram. The SPR signal at equilibrium (R eq) was extracted from the fit with a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model and plotted as a function of His6-EEA1 concentration. Dissociation constants (K d) were obtained from a fit to the hyperbolic binding function R eq =R max (His6EEA1)/(K d + (His6 EEA1)), whereR max corresponds to the SPR signal at saturation and is treated as an adjustable parameter. Mean values and standard deviations (ςn−1) were calculated from 2 to 4 independent measurements. Control experiments verify that the fittedK d values are independent of flow rate (5–50 μl/min) and surface coverage (10-fold range), indicating that the equilibrium data are not limited by mass transfer or rebinding. Rab5C at concentrations of 1 or 20 μm in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 was titrated with His6-EEA1-(36–91), His6-EEA1-(36–218), or the W104A mutant of His6-EEA1-(36–218). Samples were excited at 290 nm (1 μm Rab5C) or 300 nm (20 μm Rab5C) with a 2 nm bandpass and emission spectra recorded from 300–400 nm (1 nm bandpass) using an ISS spectrofluorimeter. The magnitude of fluorescence quenching (ΔI) at 340 nm was calculated as ΔI =I − I 0, where I andI 0 are the emission intensities in the presence and absence of EEA1, respectively. Values for the dissociation constant (K d) and the number of binding sites (n) were obtained by a non-linear least squares fit to a simple two-state binding model ΔI = ΔI max(b − {b 2 − 4 [EEA1]t/(n[Rab5C]t)}1/2)/2, where b = 1 + [EEA1]t/(n [Rab5C]t) +K d/(n [Rab5C]t), [EEA1]t and [Rab5C]t are the total concentrations of EEA1 and Rab5C, respectively, and ΔI maxcorresponds to the emission intensity at saturation. Concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients ε280(m−1 cm−1) = number of Trp × 5200 + number of Tyr × 1200 + number of Cys × 120. His6 EEA1 constructs were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and centrifuged to equilibrium in an Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The absorbance at 230 (A 230) or 280 nm (A 280) was measured as a function of the radial distance (r) from the axis of rotation. The x values of the data were transformed as ςm·(r02 −r 2/2), where r 0 was taken as the last point in each data set and ςm was calculated with SEDINTERP (41Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) using the monomer molecular mass for each construct. Data were compared with the function A(r) =C 0 +C 1·exp(−n·ςm·(r02− r 2)/2), where C 0 andC 1 are constants, and n represents the order of the oligomeric state. The sequence of the EEA1 C2H2 Zn2+ finger was threaded against a protein structure data base using the three-dimensional PSSM fold recognition server to identify a suitable structure for homology modeling. The NMR structure of a C2H2Zn2+ finger from the yeast transcription factor Adr1 (Protein Data Bank code 1paa) was selected for further homology modeling on the basis of its low scoring E value and the absence of gaps in the alignment. The EEA1 C2H2Zn2+ finger shares 29% identity with that of Adr1, which represents the closest homologue of known structure. Non-conserved residues were substituted with the corresponding residues in EEA1, which were modeled in the most frequently observed rotomer conformation compatible with the structure. The resulting homology model represents a rough, working approximation to the actual structure, with an overall fold consistent with the common topology of C2H2 Zn2+ fingers. The active forms of Rab5A, Rab5B, and Rab22 have been shown to interact directly with EEA1-(1–209) (11Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Google Scholar, 35Kauppi M. Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Vieira A. Callaghan J. Stenmark H. Olkkonen V.M. J.

This region of EEA1 encompasses a hydrophilic sequence of ∼35 residues, the C2H2 Zn2+ finger, and two consecutive heptad repeats. As shown in Fig.1 A, His6EEA1-(1–218) co-precipitates with GST-Rab5C loaded with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GppNHp, but does not co-precipitate with the GDP-bound form or in the presence of the Zn2+-chelating agent TPEN. These results are consistent with two-hybrid experiments in which mutation of a cysteine residue involved in Zn2+ coordination disrupts the interaction with constitutively active Rab5A and Rab5B mutants (11Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Google Scholar, 39Callaghan J. Nixon S. Bucci C. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 361-366Google Scholar). Although these observations demonstrate a requirement for an intact C2H2 Zn2+ finger, it is not clear whether this reflects a direct interaction between the C2H2 Zn2+ finger and Rab5 or whether the C2H2 Zn2+ finger plays an indirect structural role by supporting interactions with flanking regions as is the case for the double Zn2+ finger of the Rab3A effector Rabphilin3A (40Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B–D, the interaction of GST-Rab5C-GppNHp with the N terminus of EEA1 can also be detected and quantitatively analyzed by SPR in a BIAcore instrument using a monoclonal GST antibody coupled to a CM5 sensor chip. When injected at concentrations in the low micromolar range, His6EEA1-(1–218) exhibits reversible binding to the GppNHp-bound form of GST-Rab5-(18–185) as judged by the amplitude of the SPR signal compared with the GST reference channel (Fig. 1 B). The signal in the reference channel rises and decays within the response time of the instrument, scales linearly with the concentration of His6 EEA1-(1–218), and therefore represents either a bulk refractive index change or weak, reversible nonspecific binding indistinguishable from a bulk refractive index change. Under the conditions of these experiments, the association of N-terminal EEA1 constructs with GST-Rab5C approaches equilibrium on the time scale of the injection (Fig. 1 C). The quantity bound at equilibrium (R eq) saturates at low micromolar concentrations of His6 EEA1-(1–218) (Fig. 1 D). The data are well fit by a simple Langmuir binding isotherm, yielding a dissociation constant (K d) of 3.3 μm. In contrast, GST-Rab5-(18–185) loaded with GDP shows no detectable binding to His6 EEA1-(1–218), as expected for a bona fideGTPase-effector interaction. An equivalent affinity (K d = 2.3 μm) is observed for the binding of His6 EEA1-(36–218) to full-length GST-Rab5-GppNHp, which includes the hypervariable N- and C-terminal extensions, indicating that the interaction determinants reside within the GTPase domain. To map the minimal interaction site at the N terminus of EEA1 and determine whether the C2H2 Zn2+finger is sufficient for Rab5 binding, SPR experiments were used to analyze quantitatively the binding of GST-Rab5-(18–185) loaded with GppNHp to a panel of His6 EEA1 truncation constructs (Fig.2 A). Elimination of the first 35 residues, corresponding to the hydrophilic N terminus, has no significant effect on the interaction. Likewise, C-terminal truncations eliminating part or all of the heptad repeats show relatively small differences in affinity, which likely reflect systematic variations in the physical properties of the constructs. Indeed, His6EEA1-(36–91), which lacks the N-terminal hydrophilic region and both heptad repeats, binds in a nucleotide-dependent manner to GST-Rab5-(18–185) with an affinity comparable with that of His6 EEA1-(1–218) (compare Fig. 2, B andC, with Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with this observation, EEA1-(91–218), which lacks the N-terminal hydrophilic region and C2H2 Zn2+finger, shows no detectable binding to GppNHp-bound GST-Rab5-(18–185) at concentrations up to 150 μm (the highest concentration tested). A shorter construct corresponding to the minimal C2H2 Zn2+ finger defined by homology (EEA1-(36–74)) expressed poorly in bacteria and could not be fully purified. Although not suitable for quantitative analysis by SPR, this construct co-precipitates with GST-Rab5-(18–185) loaded with GppNHp but not GDP and, by this measure, does not differ significantly from EEA1-(36–91) (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the C2H2 Zn2+ finger is both necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Rab5C with the N terminus of EEA1. Full-length EEA1 contains over 1200 residues of heptad repeats and forms a parallel coiled coil homodimer in cells (33Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Google Scholar). To establish the oligomeric state of N-terminal EEA1 constructs, EEA1-(1–91), EEA1-(36–126), and EEA1-(36–218) were centrifuged to equilibrium in an analytical ultracentrifuge. Whereas EEA1-(1–91) sediments as a uniform monomer at a relatively high concentration of 20 μm, EEA1-(36–126) and EEA1-(36–218) sediment as uniform dimers at a lower concentration of 1 μm (Fig.3 A). Thus, the heptad repeat proximal to the C2H2 Zn2+ finger provides sufficient driving force for stable homodimerization but does not contribute either directly or indirectly to the affinity for Rab5C. Rab5C contains two tryptophan residues (Trp-74 and Trp-114), whereas the N terminus of EEA1 contains a single tryptophan residue (Trp-104). When titrated with His6 EEA1-(36–91), which lacks tryptophan residues, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of untagged GppNHp-bound Rab5-(18–185) undergoes significant quenching accompanied by a small shift in the emission maximum (Fig. 3 B). Both effects saturate at low micromolar concentrations of His6EEA1-(36–91), indicative of a binding interaction. As shown in Fig.3 C, the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence is well described by a simple hyperbolic binding model, which yields aK d of 1.1 μm, in good agreement with the affinity of His6 EEA1-(36–91) for GppNHp-bound GST-Rab5-(18–185) measured by SPR. Consistent with these observations, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of untagged Rab5-GDP is not perturbed by addition of His6 EEA1-(36–91). To determine whether homodimerization influences the stoichiometry of Rab5C binding to the N terminus of EEA1, titration experiments employing intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to monitor binding were conducted under conditions where the concentration of the fixed component (GppNHp-bound Rab5-(18–185)) was roughly 7-fold greater than the measured K d. The resulting data were analyzed with a titration binding model (see “Experimental Procedures”) that relates the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to the binding stoichiometry (n), K d, and the maximum"

The presence of BRG1 and Brm in SW13 correlates completely with the cellular ability to express such genes asvimentin, collagenase, c-met, andCD44 that were under the control of a transcription factor, AP-1, which was shown previously to require a functional SWI/SNF complex for its transactivating activity. Transient treatment with inhibitors of histone deacetylase induced a stable transition of SW13(vim−) to a cell type indistinguishable from SW13(vim+), suggesting that these two subtypes are epigenetically different. Run-on analysis indicated that, unlike these four genes driven by AP-1, transcription of the BRG1 and Brm genes in SW13(vim−) are initiated at a frequency comparable with SW13(vim+). In both SW13(vim−) and SW13(vim+) cells, theBRG1 and Brm genes were transcribed through the entire gene at a similar efficiency, indicating that their expression was completely suppressed at the post-transcriptional level in SW13(vim−) cells.

Although the cellular specificity involved in development has been described well, the mechanisms that ensure long term cellular memory, by which the developmental fate of a particular cell is passed on to its descendents, are largely unknown. In bothDrosophila and mammals regulatory mechanisms that allow gene expression patterns to be maintained have been shown to be supported by the products of two classes of regulatory genes, the Polycomb group (Pc-G)1 and the trithorax group (trx-G) (1Breen T.R.

The proteins required to maintain a repressed state are contained in the Pc-G complex, whereas those required for persistence of expression are in the trx-G complex. The Pc-G and trx-G protein complexes counteract each other to repair previously established chromosomal domains of specific genes throughout development (3Gebuhr T.C. Bultman S.J. Magnuson T. Genesis. 2000; 26: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Insight into the role of the trx-G protein in transcriptional regulation has come from studies of the Brahma gene (belonging to trx-G) in Drosophila and its mammalian homologues, Brm and BRG1. Brm and BRG1 have DNA-dependent ATPase activity and are the catalytic subunits of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This complex contains either Brm or BRG1, but not both (4Wang W.

Cell. 1988; 5: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) (composed of Fos/Jun dimers), we found that a SWI/SNF complex subunit, BAF60a, binds to different Fos/Jun dimers with distinct affinities by interacting with two interfaces for c-Fos and c-Jun, respectively, and further showed that the SWI/SNF complex is a major determinant of the transactivation potential of Fos/Jun dimers. In SW13 cells, which lack a functional SWI/SNF complex, the transactivating activity of Fos/Jun dimers is kept at basal levels when assayed by transient transfection experiments. However, transactivation by the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer (having the highest affinity to BAF60a) was specifically enhanced by cotransfectingBrm or BRG1 into SW13 to recover the functional SWI/SNF complex (9Ito T.

Considering that the SWI/SNF complex is composed of important trx-G proteins, functional loss of the SWI/SNF complex in SW13 might affect long term cellular memory, leading to an obvious question whether the SW13 cells are epigenetically stable. We are especially interested in previous observations (22Hedberg K.K. Chen L.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 163: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that SW13 cells express vimentinin a mosaic pattern. There are two cellular subtypes in SW13 culture, the subtype that does not express vimentin protein (designated as SW13(vim−)), and the other, which does (designated as SW13(vim+)) (23Serria A.J.

We examined the molecular basis for the presence of these two subtypes and addressed whether this phenomenon was related to the deficiency in BRG1 and Brm expression in this cell line.

Total RNA was prepared from cells with the ISOGEN RNA isolation reagent (Wako). RT-PCR was performed within the linear range by the Superscript one-step RT-PCR with platinumTaq kit (Invitrogen). The band density was semi-quantified by Densitometry (ATTO Printgraph) using the software ATTO Densito graph3. The other primer pairs for BRG1,Brm (15Mizutani T. Ito T. Nishina M. Yamamichi N.

The primer pairs were as follows: for vimentin, 5′-gacaatgcgtctctggcacgtcttgaccttgaacgc-3′ and 5′-gcatctggcgttccagggactcattggttc-3′, and for CD44, 5′-cagacctgcccaatgcctttgatggacc-3′, 5′-caaagccaaggccaagagggatgcc-3′. RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 50 °C. Amplification conditions are as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles (for BRG1, Brm,vimentin, and CD44) at 94 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min or 30 cycles (forcollagenase and c-met) or 25 cycles (forGAPDH) at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Whole cell extracts (20 or 40 μg) were prepared under denaturing conditions, separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, immunostained with anti-BRG1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-Brm goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-vimentin mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (15Mizutani T. Ito T. Nishina M. Yamamichi N. Watanabe A. Iba H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15859-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from cells with the ISOGEN RNA isolation regent (Wako). Cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA was isolated from total RNA with an mRNA purification kit (AmershamBiosciences). For Northern blotting, 20 μg of poly(A) RNA was separated on 1% agarose/formamide gel and blotted onto Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with either a32P-labeled BRG1 or Brm probe. TheBRG1 probe was generated from a 5.25-kbSalI-NotI fragment of pSVhSNF2β, and theBrm probe was generated from a 5.25-kb HindIII fragment of pSVhSNF2α. The probes were labeled with the RediprimeII DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Equal numbers of nuclei (2 × 107) were isolated from SW13(vim−) #1, SW13(vim+) #21, MDA-MB435, and SW13(vim−) #1 treated with CHAP31. Transcriptional elongation was carried out in the presence of 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and radiolabeled RNA was isolated from each sample. They had almost the same total radioactivity and were hybridized to Hybond N+ filters that were slot-blotted to such plasmid DNA (1 or 5 μg) as pCR2.1-BRG1(A), -BRG1(B), -Brm(E), -Brm(F), -collagenase, -c-met, and -β-actin and pBluescriptSK(+)-BRG1(C), -BRG1(D), -Brm(G), -Brm(H), -vimentin, and -CD44. As the control plasmids, pCR2.1 and pBluescriptSK(+) were also slot-blotted. Digoxigenin-labeled probes for in situ hybridization were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To synthesize the BRG1 and Brm antisense riboprobes, pBluescriptSK(+)-BRG1(D) and pBluescriptSK(+)-Brm(H) were linearized with EcoRV and ClaI, respectively, and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase. To synthesize the vimentinantisense riboprobe, pBluescriptSK(+)-vimentin was linearized withEcoRI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. SW13 cells were cultured on collagen-coated chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes specific for theBRG1, Brm, and vimentin genes and treated with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase conjugated Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probes were detected by a 2-hydroxy-3-naphtoic acid-2′-phenylanilide phosphate fluorescent detection set (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cellular nuclei were counterstained with TOTO-1 (Molecular Probes). Subclones of SW13 cells, either expressing or not expressing vimentin, were selected previously by limiting dilution from the parent cell line SW13, on the basis of the presence or absence of a vimentin filament detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy. Using the same protocol, we have cloned two SW13(vim−) subclones, #1, #2, and two SW13(vim+) subclones, #21, #22. For each clone, the expression levels of vimentin were determined both by semiquantitative RT-PCR of total RNA (Fig.1 A) and by Western blot analysis of the total cellular lysates (Fig. 1 B) and were compared with those of a control cell line, MDA-MB435, that expressvimentin. vimentin mRNA and vimentin protein were clearly detectable in SW13(vim+) #21 and #22, whereas they are completely undetectable in SW13(vim−) #1 and #2. The generation times of clone SW13(vim−) #1 and #2 and SW13(vim+) #21 and #22 cultures were 32–34 h, indicating that SW13(vim−) and SW13(vim+) had no significant difference in their growth rates in monolayer culture. The vimentin gene has been reported to be one of the representative genes that are under the control of transcription factor AP-1. Tandem AP-1 binding sites that mediate serum inducibility were identified in its promoter region (28Rittling S.R. Coutinho L. Amram T. Kolbe M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1619-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that transactivating activity of AP-1 depends on the presence of a functional SWI/SNF complex and that AP-1 function in SW13 cells was strongly attenuated, because the cells are deficient in the expression of both catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. Considering these prior observations, we hypothesized that the expression ofBRG1 and Brm might be recovered in SW13(vim+). Therefore, we have determined the expression levels of BRG1and Brm in both SW13(vim−) and SW13(vim+). SW13(vim−) #1 and #2 have no detectable levels of both BRG1 and Brm protein (Fig.1 B), as judged by Western blot and as has been reported for the original cell line of SW13. When BRG1 and BrmmRNA levels in these clones were assessed by RT-PCR, they were also negative (Fig. 1 A). In SW13(vim+) #21 and #22, however, mRNA and the protein product of either BRG1 orBrm genes were clearly detectable (Fig. 1, A andB) like in MDA-MB435, which is competent for the SWI/SNF complex (15Mizutani T. Ito T. Nishina M. Yamamichi N. Watanabe A. Iba H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15859-15864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite the clear contrast in the gene expression patterns of vimentin, BRG1, and Brm, SW13(vim−) #1 and #2 and SW13(vim+) #21 and #22 expressed almost the same mRNA levels of a housekeeping gene, GAPDH. By Northern blot analysis of poly(A) RNA prepared from SW13(vim−) #1 or SW13(vim+) #21, SW13(vim−) did not express either full-length mRNA of BRG1 and Brm or any aberrant transcript when detected by specific probes that covered entire coding regions (Fig. 1 C). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that BRG1 and Brm are expressed in SW13(vim+) and further suggest that this subtype of SW13 has a functional SWI/SNF complex, which supports the expression of several endogenous genes, including vimentin. To examine whether the clear difference in the expression patterns observed between the two subtypes of SW13 can be stably maintained in the cloned culture, we monitored the expression of BRG1,Brm, and vimentin mRNA at single cell resolution (Fig. 2). After in situ hybridization with specific probes (red), each monolayer culture was counterstained with TOTO-1 to detect cellular nuclei. The entire population of SW13(vim−) #1 (or #2) failed to express these three genes, whereas all the cells in SW13(vim+) #21 (or #22) cultures expressed them at a significant level, as shown for SW13(vim−) #1 and SW13(vim+) #21 (Fig. 2). These results indicate that each subtype maintains its phenotypes stably after cloning by end-point dilution (corresponding to about 20 cycles of cell division). We have reported previously that collagenase(intracisternal collagenase, MMP1) and c-met genes could be induced after DNA transfection of expression vectors carrying the BRG1 or Brm gene, together with c-Fos and c-Jun expression vectors, into SW13 cells (9Ito T.

The CD44 gene is another representative gene that is under the control of AP-1 (29Lamb R.F. Hennigan R.F. Turnbull K. Katsanakis K.D. Mackenzie E.D. Birnie G.D. Ozanne B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and was recently reported to be induced by either BRG1 or Brm supplied exogenously into SW13 cells (16Maringnani P.A. Kanai F. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32415-32418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Strobeck M.W. Reisman D.N. Gunawardena R.W. Betz B.L. Anguest S.P.

We therefore examined the expression status of three other genes,collagenase, c-met, and CD44, in SW13(vim−) #1 and #2 and SW13(vim+) #21 and #22. Like thevimentin gene, expression of collagenase, c-met, and CD44 genes were completely undetectable in SW13(vim−) #1 and #2, whereas they are expressed in SW13(vim+) #21 and #22 (Fig. 3) at a significant level. These results clearly reveals that several genes under the control of AP-1 are expressed specifically in SW13(vim+) because of the presence of functional BRG1 and Brm. In none of these biochemical and cytological analyses of the expression levels (see Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) (data not shown) did we detect any significant differences between cellular clones #1 and #2 or between #21 and #22. Therefore, we used clones #1 and #21 for SW13(vim−) and SW13(vim+), respectively, for further analyses."

Protection against malaria infection can be conferred by antibodies against merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1, making it an attractive vaccine candidate. Here we present the structure of the C-terminal domains of MSP-1 (known as MSP-119) from Plasmodium knowlesi. The structure reveals two tightly packed epidermal growth factor-like domains oriented head to tail. In domain 1, the molecule displays a histidine binding site formed primarily by a highly conserved tryptophan. The protein carries a pronounced overall negative charge primarily due to the large number of acidic groups in domain 2. To map protein binding surfaces on MSP-119, we have analyzed the crystal contacts in five different crystal environments, revealing that domain 1 is highly preferred in protein-protein interactions. A comparison of MSP-119 structures fromP. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, and P. falciparum shows that, although the overall protein folds are similar, the molecules show significant differences in charge distribution. We propose the histidine binding site in domain 1 as a target for inhibitors of protein binding to MSP-1, which might prevent invasion of the merozoite into red blood cells.

This process involves many surface proteins specifically expressed at the merozoite stage of the parasite, including merozoite surface protein (MSP)1-1 (also known as merozoite surface antigen-1 or MSA-1). MSP-1, a required component of the merozoite invasion machinery, associates noncovalently with other parasite proteins, including the C-terminal portion of MSP-6 (1Trucco C. Fernandez-Reyes D.

MSP-1 is synthesized as a 180–225-kDa polypeptide capable of binding sialic acid (2Perkins M.E. Rocco L.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3190-3196PubMed Google Scholar, 3Su S. Sanadi A.R. Ifon E.

As a requirement for merozoite entry into a red cell, MSP-1 undergoes two processing steps, the first at merozoite release from an infected cell and the second during invasion of a red cell (4Holder A.A.

In the first processing step, the precursor polypeptide is cleaved into four chains (with apparent molecular masses of 83, 30, 38, and 42 kDa) held together by noncovalent contacts (4Holder A.A.

To better understand the process of invasion of thePlasmodium merozoite into a red blood cell, we have solved the structure of the C-terminal domains of MSP-1 from P. knowlesi by x-ray crystallography.

Open table in a new tab DNA encoding the C-terminal 92 amino acids of the of P. knowlesi (Malayan H strain) MSP-1 (GenBankTM accession code AAG24615) was inserted into the vector YEpRPEU-3 and expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VK1 cell line (36Stowers A.W. Keister D.B. Muratova O. Kaslow D.C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5530-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The vector included an N-terminal yeast α-factor pre-pro secretory signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The plasmid is episomally maintained by supplying a functional HIS4 gene for the host VK1 cell line (his4). Protein expression is under control of the ADH2 promoter and induced by introducing ethanol as a carbon source during fermentation. The secreted protein product included 105 amino acids: 5 amino acids (E-A-E-A-S) from the cleaved mating factor, the 92 amino acids from MSP-1, and 8 amino acids (G-P-H6) from the affinity tag. The protein was purified using nickel affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. Purified MSP-119 protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization trials. Crystals were grown via vapor diffusion with a solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mmHEPES, pH 7.0. Crystals were transferred into the same solution supplemented with 20% glycerol before cooling to 100 K in a nitrogen stream. X-ray data were collected on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator equipped with nickel mirrors and a RAXIS 4 detector (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX). 180° of diffraction data were processed using DENZO (37Otwinowski Z.

The P. cynomolgi model was rotated and translated against the 8–4 ÅP. knowlesi diffraction amplitudes, using correlation coefficients to rank solutions. Four successive objects were placed in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, whereas insertion of a fifth object failed to improve the correlation coefficient.

Residue numbering of the P. knowlesi structure corresponds to the mature secreted protein and begins at the first residue of the cleaved α mating factor secretory signal. Refinement protocols in CNS included conjugate gradient minimization, simulated annealing, and temperature factor refinement. Models were built into simulated annealing composite omit maps calculated in CNS. Tight 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry restraints (300 kcal/mol-Å2) were imposed on all atoms in the early stages of refinement and later relaxed for atoms that differ among the four copies in the asymmetric unit. Refinement steps were accepted only if they reduced the R-free (of a test set comprised of 860 reflections, 5% of the total, selected using resolution shells). TheR-work and R-free are 23.4% and 26.4%, respectively, using all reflections to 2.4 Å. Least squares superpositions were performed using the program LSQMAN (41Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J.

Electrostatic calculations include only the native MSP-119 sequence, without the secretory signal and purification epitope. Molecular figures were prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (42Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (43Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), and GRASP (44Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region ofP. knowlesi MSP-1 contains two successive EGF-like domains packed together tightly and related by a rotation of ∼170° (Fig.1 b). The molecule is roughly square-shaped, with dimensions of about 35 Å × 35 Å × 15 Å. The angle between domains 1 and 2 leads to close approach of the N terminus of domain 1 and the C terminus of domain 2. Thus, as domain 2 is anchored in the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage attached to the C-terminal residue, the N-terminal residue of domain 1 (i.e. the cleavage site in MSP-142) also points toward the membrane, in an appropriate orientation for processing by proteases attached to the merozoite membrane (28Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A. Gradwell M.G. Burghaus P.A. Syed S.E. Uthaipibull C. Holder A.A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Each EGF-like domain in P. knowlesi MSP-1 contains a segment of random coil followed by four antiparallel β strands (Fig.1 b). Typically, EGF-like domains contain six cysteines in three disulfide bonds with a connectivity of 1–3, 2–4, and 5–6. The MSP-1 EGF-like domains follow this paradigm, except that in domain 1, valine and tryptophan replace the middle (2Perkins M.E. Rocco L.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3190-3196PubMed Google Scholar, 3Su S. Sanadi A.R. Ifon E. Davidson E.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2309-2317PubMed Google Scholar, 4Holder A.A. Blackman M.J. Burghaus P.A.

The valine and tryptophan pack into the domain 1 hydrophobic core, in the same volume as the disulfide bond in canonical EGF-like domains. The crystals of P. knowlesi MSP-119 contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit, revealing the protein in four different environments. The four molecules are highly similar, with r.m.s. deviations of 0.4–0.6 Å for 77–81 Cα atoms, with differences primarily at the two termini and residues 69–74 on the loop between β strands 1 and 2 in domain 2 (Fig. 1 c). This loop shows differences across the four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and also within one molecule (as reflected by high B factors). The flexibility in this loop and in the termini corresponds to the mobility seen in the NMR structure of theP. falciparum MSP-119 (28Morgan W.D. Birdsall B. Frenkiel T.A. Gradwell M.G. Burghaus P.A. Syed S.E. Uthaipibull C. Holder A.A. Feeney J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In P. knowlesi MSP-119, the extensive interface between the two domains buries 26 residues and 1090 Å2 of surface area. This produces a rigid interface with little variation in the interdomain angle among the four copies in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1 c). The residues in the interface are among the most conserved in the MSP-119 protein: 23 of 26 residues are identical between P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi, with three conservative substitutions; and 14 of 26 residues are identical between P. knowlesi and P. falciparum, with seven conservative substitutions. The highly conserved domain 2 sequence Asn57-Asn58-Gly59-Gly60packs in the interface between domains 1 and 2, forming a short stretch of left-handed helix in P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi and a tight turn in P. falciparum. P. knowlesi domain 1 superimposes on domain 2 with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.2–1.6 Å for the four independent copies in the asymmetric unit (Table II).Table IIComparison of MSP-119 structuresMSP-119 fromP. knowlesi (4 copies)MoleculeABCDResidues in model8–988–1009–1018–94Mean B factor49.451.557.862.3No. of residues in crystal contacts37373121D1–D2 angle168°168°174°173°D1–D2 r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., r.m.s. deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank.1.6 Å (23 Cα atoms)1.4 Å (23 Cα atoms)1.2 Å (23 Cα atoms)1.3 Å (24 Cα atoms)Contents of His binding siteHis B100His C101His from DHis from AMSP-119 structures across speciesP. knowlesiP. cynomolgiP. falciparumPDB code1N1I1B9W1CEJNo. of residues928996Sequence ID vs. P. knowlesi100%82%51%Overall charge−7−4−2r.m.s.d. vs. P. knowlesicopy A0.4–0.6 Å (77–81 Cα atoms)1.3 Å (78 Cα atoms)1.7 Å (65 Cα atoms)a r.m.s.d., r.m.s. deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank. Open table in a new tab In all four copies of MSP-119 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, electron density appears in a shallow depression on the surface (Fig.2 a). In each copy, the density traces back to a histidine from the hexahistidine tag of a symmetry-related molecule. For each of the four bound histidines, the plane of the imidazole ring stacks roughly parallel to the plane of the indole ring of Trp34, and the carboxylic acid of Glu42 pairs with the bound (and presumably protonated) histidine. In the histidine-binding pocket, Trp34 forms the floor, and Glu33 and Arg35 form the walls (Fig.2 b). The hydrophobic tryptophan and the bound histidine appear in the middle of a region of negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 2 c). Although the conformation of the C-terminal hexahistidine tail differs in the four copies in the asymmetric unit, one histidine from the tail fills a histidine-binding pocket of a symmetry-related molecule. In the four copies in the asymmetric unit, each histidine binding buries between 167 and 206 Å2 of accessible surface area. This same pocket can bind other positively charged moieties: in the crystal of MSP-119 from P. cynomolgi (29Chitarra V. Holm I. Bentley G.A. Petres S. Longacre S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a lysine from a symmetry-related molecule inserts into this pocket. In all Plasmodium species except P. falciparum, domain 1 of MSP-119 lacks the middle disulfide bond found in canonical EGF-like domains. The replacement of a disulfide by a small residue (valine, isoleucine, or threonine) and a tryptophan produces a shelf on domain 1 capable of binding histidine. Tryptophan is the residue most commonly found buried in protein-protein interfaces (30Glaser F. Steinberg D.M. Vakser I.A. Ben-Tal N. Proteins. 2001; 43: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) because burial of its large hydrophobic surface area yields thermodynamic gain. The analysis of crystal contacts can be used to map protein binding surfaces on a molecule to reveal potential biologically important surfaces on the molecule (31Crosio M.P. Janin J. Jullien M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Garman S.C. Sechi S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We searched crystal contacts in MSP-119 to identify the favored sites for binding to proteins. Combining the four copies ofP. knowlesi MSP-119 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit with the one copy of P. cynomolgiMSP-119 (29Chitarra V. Holm I. Bentley G.A. Petres S. Longacre S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 457-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we have observations of MSP-119in five different crystal environments. We counted the number of times each residue participates in crystal contacts and mapped that number onto the surface of the protein (Fig.3 a). The P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi crystal contacts correlate: of the 9 residues involved in crystal contacts in all four P. knowlesi copies, 7 make contacts in the P. cynomolgicrystals as well. The seven residues (Ile14, Asp15, Leu28, Trp34, Glu42, Ala50, and Ser51) participate in crystal contacts in all five crystal packing environments. All of these except Ser51 are conserved between P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi, suggesting protein binding sites conserved across species. All of these except Leu28 differ between P. knowlesi andP. falciparum, resulting in distinctly shaped MSP-119 surfaces across these species. The crystal contacts show that MSP-119 domain 1 is highly favored for binding protein (Fig. 3 a). Trp34, the floor of the histidine binding site in the center of domain 1, falls in an ideal position to participate in protein-protein interactions on the surface of the merozoite. In P. falciparum MSP-119, domain 1 has been shown to be the binding site of monoclonal antibody G17.12 (33Pizarro J.C. Chitarra V. Calvet C. Verger D. Bentley G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1246-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence identity in MSP-119 across Plasmodium species results in highly similar three-dimensional structures of the molecule (Figs.3 b and 4 a). TheP. cynomolgi MSP-119 superimposes on the P. knowlesi structure with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.3 Å for 78 Cα atoms, whereas the P. falciparum structure superimposes on the P. knowlesi structure with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.7 Å for 65 Cα atoms (Table II). A superposition of the four P. knowlesi MSP-119molecules with the P. cynomolgi and P. falciparumhomologues reveals that the differences occur primarily at the termini and in the 69–74 loop, the same loop that shows variability among the four molecules in the P. knowlesi crystal. MSP-119 from P. knowlesi exhibits a striking charge distribution (Fig. 4 b). The molecule carries a pronounced negative potential, with an overall charge of −7 in the 92 residues of the two domains. There are no buried ion pairs in P. knowlesi MSP-119; rather, all charged residues are surface-accessible. The overall charge is species-specific because the equivalent segments of MSP-1 from P. cynomolgi and P. falciparum have overall charges of −4 and −2, respectively (Fig.4, c and d). In P. knowlesiMSP-119, the negative charge is concentrated in domain 2 (with an overall charge of −7), whereas domain 1 is neutrally charged overall. The acidic regions in domain 1 cluster near the histidine binding site. Hydrophobicity maps of the three PlasmodiumMSP-119 structures show a patch of nonpolar residues along the interface between the two domains (Fig. 4, b−d). Of the 26 residues contributing to the interface, 15 are hydrophobic, and 3 are cysteines in disulfide bonds. Because the molecule is only 15 Å thick, some hydrophobic residues in the interdomain interface (including Tyr25, Tyr27, Leu37, Leu38, and Phe88) remain partially solvent-accessible. Surprisingly, the large patch of hydrophobic residues on the back surface is among the least active surfaces in protein binding, as judged by the crystal contact analysis (Fig.3 a). The arrangement of charged and hydrophobic residues on MSP-119 may maintain specificity of the interactions between MSP-119 and its binding partners such as the other MSP-1 fragments and MSP-6. Complementary changes between residues in MSP-119 and its binding partners may allow evolution of the MSP-119 protein surface. The region around Trp34 appears to be a site onP. knowlesi MSP-119 well suited for protein-protein interactions. First, all EGF-like domain structures contain at least three pairs of disulfide bonds, with one exception: the first domain of MSP-119. Of the 40 independent EGF/laminin-like domain structures currently in the Protein Data Bank (34Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27887) Google Scholar), only Plasmodium MSP-119 has lost one of its three canonical disulfide bonds. The loss of a structurally important and highly conserved disulfide bond is most likely due to a functional requirement. Second, all of thePlasmodium species (except P. falciparum) contain a tryptophan in domain 1 of MSP-119 in place of the canonical cysteine. The disulfide is replaced with a tryptophan and a smaller residue; whereas the smaller residue may become a valine, isoleucine, or threonine, the other member of the pair is always tryptophan, suggesting functional selection. Third, tryptophan is the residue most commonly found in protein-protein interfaces (30Glaser F. Steinberg D.M. Vakser I.A. Ben-Tal N. Proteins. 2001; 43: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), so the replacement of a strictly conserved disulfide-forming cysteine with a tryptophan suggests the evolution of a protein binding site. Fourth, there are no instances of crystals of MSP-119 with an empty histidine-binding pocket. In all five independent crystallographic environments, a histidine or lysine is found stacked above the tryptophan ring. This pocket fills when the concentration of nearby protein becomes sufficiently high. Fifth, the crystal contact map of MSP-119 indicates that the tryptophan and nearby regions in domain 1 are very active in participating in protein-protein interactions. The sequence differences between P. falciparum and the otherPlasmodium species represent divergent evolution from a common precursor, but it is unclear whether P. falciparumhas lost a binding site or the other Plasmodium species have evolved new functionality. Alternatively, the difference betweenP. falciparum and the other Plasmodia may be due to the strong bias against tryptophan in P. falciparum (35Tchavtchitch M. Fischer K. Huestis R. Saul A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The virulent P. falciparum displays somewhat different disease pathology compared with the other Plasmodiumspecies; perhaps the differences in MSP-119 proteins are related to the differences in disease severity. For example, P. falciparum invades a broader spectrum of red blood cells and reaches higher levels of parasitemia compared with other malaria species, potentially due to loss of receptor specificity in P. falciparum. Some of this specificity may be conferred by the MSP-1 protein during red blood cell invasion. Although P. falciparum lacks the tryptophan defining the floor of the binding pocket, all the other species of Plasmodium have this tryptophan, which generates a site for binding histidine. We propose the use of this histidine binding site as a target for the design of compounds that bind, for example, P. vivax MSP-1. From such a scaffold compound, new inhibitors that protect against merozoite invasion of a red blood cell might be developed. Our structure reveals a new feature of the MSP-119molecule, a histidine-binding pocket in domain 1. Because antibodies that protect against malarial infections often bind specifically to domain 1, this new property of the molecule might be used to engineer tighter binding and thus more protective antibodies. Alternatively, this histidine-binding pocket might be used to interfere with the binding of blocking antibodies. For example, a small molecule inhibitor containing an imidazole scaffold may be designed to overlap with the footprint of blocking antibodies and thus disrupt the binding of blocking antibodies. The specific disruption of MSP-119blocking antibodies without perturbation of protective antibodies would greatly enhance the immune response against the malaria parasite. We thank T. Allison and the other members of the Structural Biology Section for discussions."

Unlike influenza virus, carrying an N-terminal fusion peptide, SFV represents a less-well understood fusion principle involving an endosequence fusion peptide. To explore the series of events leading to a fusogenic configuration of the SFV, we exposed the virus to successive acidification, mimicking endosomal conditions, and followed structural rearrangements at probed sensor surfaces. Thus revealed, the initial phase involves a transient appearance of a non-linear neutralizing antibody epitope in the fusion protein, E1. Concurrent with the disappearance of this epitope, a set of masked sequences in proteins E1 and E2 became exposed. When pH reached 6.0–5.9 the virion transformed into a configuration of enlarged diameter with the fusion peptide optimally exposed. Simultaneously, a partly hidden sequence close to the receptor binding site in E2 became fully uncovered. At this presumably fusogenic stage, maximally 80 fusion peptide-identifying antibody Fab fragments could be bound per virion, i.e. one ligand per three copies of the fusion protein.

With enveloped viruses this involves a fusion step, which takes place after the initial attachment to the cell surface receptor, and, in some cases, endocytosis. Fusion may be directly induced by interaction with the receptor or occur by later triggering by other means. For viruses taken up into endosomes the acid environment commonly initiates the activation leading to fusion with the endosomal membrane. The fusion reaction as revealed in influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus seems to be relevant for a series of viruses with N-terminal fusion peptides (1Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The trimeric protrusions (“spikes”) hold three molecules each of an external glycoprotein (in influenza the HA2) and a membrane-spanning fusion protein (HA1). These glycoproteins are derived from a trimeric precursor molecule, (HA0)3, cleaved such that a hydrophobic peptide (fusion peptide) forms the N terminus of the fusion protein. Thus primed, the trimeric structure shields its three fusion peptides in charged pockets. Activation requires their extrusion toward the fusion target membrane. Here, the refolding of a loop between two helical domains plays a key role in the formation of a long helix extending the central triple-stranded coiled-coil of the protrusion, as proposed from modeling studies on synthetic peptides (2Carr C.

To provide the juxtaposition of the viral and the target membranes, the long helix is unfolded at the middle, forming a reverse turn. Thus, the second half of the long α helix is jackknifed back to lie antiparallel against the first half, allowing the C-terminal membrane anchor to be repositioned at the same end of the rod-shaped molecule as the fusion peptide (6Weissenhorn W.

Hoffman L.R. Arevalo J.H. Wilson I.A. Chu W. Burnett R.M. Garcea R.L. Structural Biology of Viruses. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 80-104Google Scholar). A variation on this theme is proposed for the Newcastle disease virus, where the target membrane contacts may be established by the fusion peptide prior to formation of the extended coiled coil. In this case the helix extension and super coiling would, directly, force the virus and target membranes together to complete the fusion reaction (14Chen L. Gorman J.J. McKimm-Breschkin J.

Less explored are mechanisms prevailing in viruses, which, like the flavi and alphaviruses, have a low content of alpha helical-structure in their envelope proteins and carry an endosequence fusion peptide. Furthermore, in these viruses, although derived from one precursor peptide chain, the two main spike proteins are both anchored in the virus membrane. The structure of alphaviruses, as studied by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM)1comprises an enveloped particle with trilobed protrusions. These are arranged in a T = 4 icosahedral lattice (15Vogel R.H. Provencher S.W. von Bonsdorff C.H. Adrian M. Dubochet J.

Virol. 1994; 9 (suppl.): 473-484Google Scholar). Although these viruses usually bud at the plasma membrane, they infect by endocytosis (28Helenius A. Marsh M. White J. J. Gen.

There seems to be no strict requirement for a protein receptor to induce fusion, but cholesterol and sphingolipids should be present in the target membrane, as recently reviewed by Kielian et al. (38Kielian M. Chatterjee P.K. Gibbons D.L. Lu Y.E. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 409-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of folding and tertiary organization of theenvelope proteins in the alphaviruses are essential, not only for the assembly and budding of the virion (39Forsell K. Xing L. Kozlovska T. Cheng R.H. Garoff H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5081-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but also for the capacity of the virus to properly fulfill infection. The transmembrane glycoproteins, pE2 (p62) and E1, originating from the same translation product, form heterodimers already in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment (40Barth B.-U. Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The direct association with pE2 seems to be required to prevent aggregation of the E1 protein (41Andersson H. Barth B.U. Ekstrom M. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9654-9663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pE2-E1 dimers associate into trimers before cleavage, in the trans-Golgi, of the pE2 component into the membrane-anchored E2 subunit and the small external glycoprotein E3 (42Jain S.K. DeCandido S. Kielian M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5756-5761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Salminen A. Wahlberg J.M. Lobigs M. Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Garoff H. Wilschut J. Liljestrom P. Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Suomalainen M. Smyth J. Salminen A. Barth B.U. Zhao H. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 9: 329-338PubMed Google Scholar). This processing establishes a proper interaction of the E2/E1 subunits in a mature, trimeric spike structure (41Andersson H. Barth B.U. Ekstrom M. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9654-9663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also provides an infectious structure, because, although they may bud normally, mutants with uncleaved pE2 analogues can neither bind well to the target cell nor respond to acidification as the wild type virus (32Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 41Andersson H. Barth B.U. Ekstrom M. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9654-9663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Salminen A.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2825-2831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the E3 domain of the pE2 would not only scaffold the arrangement of the E1/pE2 glycoproteins for proper folding but also control premature unfolding. Such control would be released by split of pE2 into E2 and E3 and possibly by a following discharge of E3. The cleavage would allow receptor binding to occur and permit fusion to be triggered. In the Sindbis virus the E3 component is early separated from the mature virus. Structural studies on non-cleavable pE2 mutants imply that the E3 is located at the outer rim of the lobes in the spike-like protrusions (16Paredes A.M. Brown D.T. Rothnagel R. Chiu W. Schoepp R.J. Johnston R.E. Prasad B.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9095-9099Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Ferlenghi I. Gowen B. de Haas F. Mancini E.J. Garoff H. Sjoberg M. Fuller S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recently proposed x-ray structure of the ectodomain of SFV fusion protein, the glycoprotein E1, suggests it to be the major constituent of the protein shell, or skirt, domain, seen in the cryoEM structure (46Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The elongated molecule would cling to the stem of the protruding spikes, hiding its fusion peptide underneath the lobes. This leaves the bulk of the protrusions to be composed by glycoprotein E2. Similar conclusions on relative organization of the E1 and E2 ectodomains were derived from structural studies on sugar site deletion mutants (22Pletnev S.V. Zhang W. Mukhopadhyay S. Fisher B.R. Hernandez R. Brown D.T. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Kuhn R.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). With these structural advancements the location of functional domains and their interplay can be envisioned. The location of the receptor-binding domain has been determined, with the aid of a monoclonal antibody and cryoEM, to the outer tips of the three lobes of the spikes (18Smith T.J. Cheng R.H. Olson N.H. Peterson P. Chase E. Kuhn R.J. Baker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10648-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The epitope is located in the middle of the E2 sequence, and thus provides the first sequence location in the folded external structure. It is close in sequence to a reported protective epitope (47Mendoza Q.P. Stanley J. Griffin D.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 3015-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Grosfeld H. Velan B.

Virol. 1996; 70: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the cell surface receptor in the immediate prefusion events is unclear (24Strauss J.H. Wang K.S. Schmaljohn A.L. Kuhn R.J. Strauss E.G. Arch. Virol. 1994; 9 (suppl.): 473-484Google Scholar). Its binding seems not to be a prerequisite for fusion to occur. Whether or not it facilitates fusion at a different pH than should otherwise be the case is not known. The fusion peptide is an endosequence located about 80 amino acid residues away from the N-terminal in the E1 peptide (50Garoff H. Frischauf A.M. Simons K. Lehrach H. Delius H. Nature. 1980; 288: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 51Levy-Mintz P. Kielian M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4292-4300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are few alpha helices (46Lescar J. Roussel A. Wien M.W. Navaza J. Fuller S.D. Wengler G. Rey F.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), or even alpha helix predictability sequences, in the E1 protein, thus explaining why a somewhat different strategy for infection and fusion would prevail than in the influenza and human immunodeficiency virus-related viruses (2Carr C. Kim P. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 9Wang S. York J. Shu W. Stoller M.O. Nunberg J.H. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7283-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 13White J.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ordered structures as such, i.e. beta-sheet-forming sequences, may be essential, as suggested by Delos et al.(53Delos S.E. Gilbert J.M. White J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In several viruses with internal fusion peptides, there is a central proline within this sequence. Such a reverse-turn function seems to be related to the efficiency in processing during maturation, as shown by a series of mutations in avian sarcoma/leucosis virus (53Delos S.E. Gilbert J.M. White J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Receptor binding was not much affected by point mutations at this proline site. However, the infectivity showed a bell-shaped dependenceviz. the hydrophobicity of the residue, where proline is of a moderate level (53Delos S.E. Gilbert J.M. White J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1686-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In SFV the cholesterol dependence for fusion is linked to another proline, Pro-226, also in the E1 glycoprotein. A substitution, P226S, resulted in a more promiscuous pattern in the fusion behavior, abolishing the strict requirement for the sterol in the target membrane (54Chatterjee P.K. Vashishtha M. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, non-bulkiness and an intermediate level of hydrophobicity are essential in the metastable clusters related to the fusion mechanism. Structural rearrangements into a fusion-competent configuration take place upon acidification and are essential for fulfillment of the infection. Attempts to approach the fusogenic form of the particle by cryoEM have given indications for a reshaping of the protrusion structure (19Fuller S.D. Berriman J.A. Butcher S.J. Gowen B.E.

Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 408-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An acid-induced dissociation of the E1-E2 interaction, along with E1 homotrimerization, seems to occur at a stage prior to the actual fusion (58Justman J. Klimjack M.R. Kielian M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7597-7607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Bron R. Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The acid-induced E1 homotrimer is highly resistant to detergent and trypsin treatment (33Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,59Bron R.

Kielian M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3267-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and may provide a tool for insertion into target membranes. The split of the E1-E2 interaction appears to be a separate and preceding step toward E1 homotrimerization (60Gibbons D.L. Ahn A. Chatterjee P.K. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During the process, masked domains become available (35Kielian M. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 113-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 63Kielian M. Klimjack M.R. Ghosh S. Duffus W.A. J.

Cell. 2002; 9: 454-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and should present the fusion peptide in a ready-to-act configuration for close encounter with the target lipid layer. Details on such rearrangements in relation to other structures within the virion would provide further clues for the mechanism involved (64Kielian M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 454-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Studies to monitor and identify pH-related rearrangements in the SFV and the related Sindbis and Ross River viruses have, in addition to cryoEM, used cell binding assays, binding assays with liposomes (38Kielian M. Chatterjee P.K. Gibbons D.L. Lu Y.E. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 409-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,62Ahn A. Gibbons D.L. Kielian M. J.

Virology. 2000; 269: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in conjunction with virus mutants, antibodies, and peptides. In the present report we introduce an additional approach for following environmentally triggered, successive changes in the virus envelope configuration. Thus, variations in exposed domains in the virus are revealed by real-time measurements based on surface plasmon resonance. As sensor surface probes we establish monoclonal antibodies against the SFV envelope glycoproteins and select a set for which linear sequence epitopes can be defined by PepScan analyses. This includes an antibody directed against a portion of the fusion peptide in glycoprotein E1 and one against a sequence close to proposed receptor-binding domain in E2. Although with a non-linear epitope, a neutralizing antibody toward E1 is also included in the study. By introducing the virus to environments of different acidity, we demonstrate that rearrangements occur already at close to neutral pH, whereas a more drastic reshuffling of the structure takes place in the pH range 6.2–5.8. At the same time the virion is transformed into a particle of larger diameter, as observed by electron microscopy. These findings provide a piece of a functional map to be gradually fed into the detailed structure. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) were grown in BHK-21 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented to contain 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). (In later experiments this was further supplemented with 17 μg/ml cholesterol.) When close to confluent, the cells were infected with SFV wt at a multiplicity of infection of 10, in minimal essential medium (or BHK-21 medium), supplemented to contain 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 mm HEPES, and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 1 h of infection the medium was replaced by fresh minimal essential medium (or BHK-21 medium), containing 2 mmglutamine and 20 mm HEPES, and incubated for another 18–22 h before harvest of virus. The virus-containing supernatant was cleared from cell debris by centrifugation in a Sorvall JA10 rotor at 11,000 × g for 30 min. This was repeated until no visible pellet appeared. The virus was collected from the cell-free supernatant by pelleting it through an 8% (w/v) potassium-tartrate cushion, in an overnight centrifugation at 11,000 × g(JA10 rotor). The potassium-tartrate stock solution was 30% (w/v) and contained 100 mm Tris and 10 mmMgCl2 (final concentrations) with pH adjusted with KOH to 7.4. It was diluted to the final concentration with 100 mmTris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and filtrated at 0.22 μm before use. In later experiments the cushion was omitted and the centrifugation was performed at 17,000 × g, which assured a high recovery. The virus pellet was overlayered with 100 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and left for 4 h, or overnight, to form a suspension. The virus was applied to a 10-ml continuous gradient of 10–30% (w/v) tartrate, established in a Gradient Master, using the program for 20–50% sucrose. Ultra clear SW40 tubes (Beckman) were used, and the centrifugation was run in a Beckman Rotor SW40 Ti at 20,000 ×g (12,500 rpm) overnight. This careful handling was applied to avoid distortion and damage of the virus during purification. We found that with the alternative media, containing more glucose and supplemented with cholesterol, the virus retained its properties in a modified centrifugation protocol. Thus, in later experiments we used the tartrate gradient buffered with MOPS, pH 7.4, and ran it at about 100,000 × g (25,000 rpm) for 5 h (52Binley J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The virus band was collected, and the concentration, purity, and quality of the virus were checked by light absorbance at 260, 280, and 310 nm, SDS-PAGE, and electron microscopy. Images, at 28,000-fold nominal magnification, were taken as focal pairs at −1.0 and −3.0 μm defocus, using a Philips CM-120 microscope. In the digitized micrographs, individual intact particles were manually boxed out to generate a stack of above 700 particles for every pH condition. Data-processing steps included particle orientation and size determination with the model-based EMPFT and EMIMGCMP program packages (66Cheng R.H. Reddy V.S. Olson N.H. Fisher A.J. Baker T.S.

All calculation steps were carried out on DEC alphastations, running the system OSF with an XP1000 processor (Compaq, Houston, TX). In an iterative process, intermediate three-dimensional density maps were successively used as new models in refining the parameters of particle orientations (39Forsell K. Xing L. Kozlovska T. Cheng R.H. Garoff H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5081-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

It has been reported that although IRS-1 and IRS-3 knock-out mice showed normal blood glucose levels, IRS-1/IRS-3 double knock-out mice exhibited marked hyperglycemia. Thus, IRS-1 and IRS-3 compensate each other's functions in maintaining glucose homeostasis. To assess the effect of genetic background and also ablation of IRS-3 on IRS-2−/−, we generated IRS-2/IRS-3 double knock-out (IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/−) mice by crossing IRS-3−/− mice (129/Sv and C57Bl/6 background) with our IRS-2−/− mice (CBA and C57Bl/6 background). Intercrosses ofIRS-2+/−IRS-3+/− mice yielded nine genotypes, and all of them includingIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice were apparently healthy and showed normal growth. However, at 10–20 weeks of age, 20–30% mice carrying a null mutation for theIRS-2 gene, irrespective of the IRS-3 genotype, developed diabetes. When mice with diabetes were excluded from the analysis of glucose and insulin tolerance test,IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− showed a degree of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance similar to those of IRS-2−/− mice. BothIRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice had moderately reduced β-cell mass despite having insulin resistance. Insulin-positive β-cells were decreased to nearly zero inIRS-2−/− mice with diabetes. Although Pdx1 and glucose transporter 2 expressions were essentially unaltered in islets from IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes, they were dramatically decreased in IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes. Taken together, these observations indicate that IRS-3 does not play a role compensating for the loss of IRS-2 in maintaining glucose homeostasis and that the severity of diabetes inIRS-2−/− mice depends upon genetic background, suggesting the existence of modifier gene(s) for diabetes in mice of the 129/Sv genetic strain.

The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes involves complex interactions among multiple physiological defects.

Subsequently, Kahn's group and we ourselves proposed that IRS-2 (pp190), another insulin receptor substrate, may play important roles in insulin action, particularly in the liver (12Patti M.E.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) have generated IRS-2-deficient mice. The phenotype of these mice was strikingly different from that ofIRS-1−/− mice. Thus, homozygous IRS-2-deficient mice (IRS-2−/− mice) progressively developed diabetes. IRS-2−/− mice were insulin-resistant as a result of insulin resistance in the liver but not in skeletal muscle, and the β-cell mass in IRS-2−/− mice was reduced to 83% of that in wild-type mice, which was in marked contrast to the 85% β-cell mass increase in IRS-1−/− mice (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, liver insulin resistance together with a lack of compensatory β-cell hyperplasia caused diabetes in IRS-2−/−mice. Interestingly, the degree of hyperglycemia was much milder in ourIRS-2−/− mice than in theIRS-2−/− mice generated by White's group (15Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M.

Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T.

It is also noteworthy that the β-cell mass of our IRS-2−/− mice was reduced to 83% at 6 weeks of age and 51% at 12 weeks of age, respectively, of that in wild-type mice, which is clearly milder than the 59% reduction at 4 weeks of age and the 90%∼ reduction at 4 months of age, respectively, in their IRS-2−/− mice (15Withers D.J.

However, it is possible that differences in either genetic background or environmental factors such as chow may affect phenotypic expression inIRS-2−/− mice. In this respect, it should be noted that these quantitative differences in theIRS-2−/− mice may suggest the existence of a major modifier gene as was previously reported inIR+/−IRS-1+/− mice (18Brüning J.C.

IRS-1 and IRS-2 are required for normal growth and glucose homeostasis in mice. To determine whether IRS-3 (for review see Ref. 7Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), one of the insulin receptor substrates mainly expressed in adipose tissues, is also involved in the regulation of these processes, Liu et al. (19Liu S.C. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18093-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) generated mice with a targeted disruption of theIRS-3 gene. Homozygous IRS-3 knock-out (IRS-3−/−) mice showed normal body weight throughout development, normal blood glucose and insulin levels, and normal glucose transport in adipocytes. However, important roles of IRS-3 in adipocytes and potentially in β-cells may be masked via compensation by either IRS-1 or IRS-2 in these tissues. In fact, it has been reported that whereas both IRS-1−/− andIRS-3−/− mice showed normal FPG, IRS-1/IRS-3 double knock-out mice were marked hyperglycemic (20Laustsen P.G. Michael M.D. Crute B.E. Cohen S.E. Ueki K. Kulkarni R.N. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Kahn C.R. Genes Dev. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, IRS-1 and IRS-3 compensate for each other's functions in maintaining glucose homeostasis. To assess the effect of genetic background and also ablation of IRS-3 on IRS-2−/−, we generated IRS-2/IRS-3 double knock-out (IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/−) mice by crossing IRS-3−/− mice (129/Sv and C57Bl/6 background) with our IRS-2−/− mice (CBA and C57Bl/6 background).

The severity of diabetes in IRS-2−/− mice was found to be dependent upon genetic background, suggesting the existence of modifier gene(s) for diabetes in mice of the 129/Sv genetic strain. IRS-2−/− mice had been maintained on the original C57BL/6 and CBA hybrid background (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S.

IRS-2+/−IRS-3+/− mice were prepared by crosses ofIRS-3−/− male mice andIRS-2+/− or IRS-2−/− female mice. IRS-2+/−IRS-3+/− mice were viable and obtained with the expected Mendelian frequency.IRS-2+/−IRS-3+/− mice were fertile and were intercrossed to obtain progeny of all combinations ofIRS-2 and IRS-3 deletions. All of the mice were kept on a 12 h of light period followed by 12 h of dark period cycle. All of the experiments in this study were performed using male mice except in the situation in which female mice were analyzed. Genotype was determined using PCR methods. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tip of the tail. Primers and PCR conditions for genotyping ofIRS-2 were as follows. The sense primer was 5′-GAAGACAGTGGGTACATGCGAATG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-CCTCATGGAGGAAGGCACTGCTG-3′ from the IRS-2 gene. The sense primer was 5′-TTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGTTC-3′ from a neomycin resistance gene. These three primers and a genomic DNA template were mixed in a tube. The thermal cycle reaction consisted of 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 60 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min), and then 72 °C for 5 min. The wild-type allele gave 600 base pairs, and the recombinant allele gave 450 base pairs. Primers and PCR conditions for IRS-3 genotyping were described previously (19Liu S.C. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E.

We backcrossedIRS-2−/− animals with 129/SvEvTaconic (Taconic Farm, Germantown, NY) or C57Bl/6J (CLEA Japan Co., Ltd., Japan) mice. To date, we have obtained N7 generations with the respective backgrounds. Glucose tolerance test is as follows. Mice were fasted for >16 h before the study. They were then loaded with 1.5 mg of glucose/gram body weight by intraperitoneal injection. Blood samples were taken at different time points from the tail vein, and glucose was measured using an automatic glucometer (Glutest Pro, Sanwa Chemical Co., Nagoya, Japan). Serum insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (BIOTRAK,Amersham Biosciences) with rat insulin as the standard (10Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Brüning J.C. Haag I.B.

Tissues were routinely processed for paraffin embedding, and 2-μm sections were cut and mounted on silanized slides. Sections were triple-stained with anti-insulin (1:200), anti-glucagon (1:200), and a mixture of anti-somatostatin (1:800) and anti-pancreatic polypeptide (1:800) antibodies (all from DAKO Japan Co., Ltd., Japan).

After clamping the common bile duct at a point close to the duodenal outlet, 2.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (129 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) containing collagenase (Sigma) was injected into the duct. The swollen pancreas was taken out and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The pancreas was dispersed by pipetting and washed twice with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. Islets were collected manually. To assess insulin content, isolated islets were extracted in acid ethanol at −20 °C for measurement of insulin content by RIA. Insulin secretion from islets was measured using Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with a basal glucose concentration of 2.8 mm unless otherwise stated.

Insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit with rat insulin as the standard. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. (n). Statistical analysis was performed using a Statview software system (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). Statistical differences were analyzed using the Student's ttest for unpaired comparisons. A p < 0.05 value was considered statistically significant. Intercrosses ofIRS-2+/−IRS-3+/− mice yielded nine genotypes. Of 365 male offspring, 18IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− males were viable (Fig. 1A). The proportion of mice carrying a null mutation for the IRS-2gene was similar to that expected (IRS-2−/−IRS-3+/+, 6.6 actualversus 6.25% expected;IRS-2−/−IRS-3+/−, 8.0 actualversus 12.5% expected;IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/−, 4.9 actualversus 6.25% expected). All of the murine genotypes including IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/−were apparently healthy and showed normal growth. At 6 weeks of age, there were no differences in body weight (Fig. 1B) or FPG levels (Fig. 1C) among the nine genotypes, although mice carrying a null mutation for the IRS-2 gene showed insulin elevation (Fig. 1D). At 10–20 weeks of age, 20–30% male mice carrying a null mutation for the IRS-2 gene, irrespective of theIRS-3 genotype, developed “diabetes” (Fig.2A). In this paper, when FPG was elevated to >200 mg/dl, it was defined as diabetes. Some of the mice showed FPG >300 mg/dl and body weight loss and died because of dehydration. By contrast, female mice carrying a null mutation for the IRS-2 gene neither developed diabetes nor died by 20 weeks of age. Both male and femaleIRS-2−/− mice of the CBA and C57Bl/6 strain never developed such diabetes (15Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). We carried out glucose tolerance test in wild-type mice, IRS-3−/− mice,IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes, andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes (Fig. 2B). IRS-3−/− mice showed glucose and insulin levels similar to those of wild-type mice.IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice showed glucose intolerance similar to that of IRS-2−/−mice (Fig. 2B, upper panel).IRS-2−/− mice showed ∼1.5-fold higher insulin levels than wild-type mice and IRS-3−/− mice.IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice showed a 1.7- and a 1.9-fold higher insulin level than wild-type mice andIRS-3−/− mice, respectively, but there were no statistically significant differences betweenIRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice. At 30 weeks of age, IRS-3−/− mice became slightly insulin-resistant compared with wild-type mice as assessed by the insulin tolerance test (Fig. 2C). When mice with diabetes were excluded from the analysis,IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice showed a degree of insulin resistance similar to that ofIRS-2−/− mice. When we determined serum-free fatty acid levels for the four genotypes at 20–30 weeks of age,IRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes had lower free fatty acid levels of than wild-type andIRS-3−/− mice (Fig. 2D). We measured body weight (Fig.3A), epididymal fat mass (Fig.3B), and fed blood glucose levels (Fig.3C) in wild-type mice, IRS-3−/− mice,IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes,IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes, and IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes. Although there were no differences in body weight among the nine genotypes at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 1C),IRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice were significantly heavier than wild-type mice at 20 weeks of age (Fig.3A). Moreover,IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice were heavier than IRS-2−/− mice albeit not significantly, presumably because of slightly higher insulin levels than in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig. 3A).IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes had body weights similar to those of IRS-2−/− without diabetes although they were lighter thanIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes (Fig. 3A), but IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes had a significantly smaller fat mass thanIRS-2−/− orIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes (Fig. 3B). Fig. 4 shows the results of immunostaining of pancreatic islets from 20-week-old wild-type mice,IRS-3−/− mice, IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes, andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes. Both IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes had smaller islets than wild-type andIRS-3−/− mice. Upon quantitation, the β-cell mass in IRS-3−/− mice was similar to that of wild-type mice. As we reported previously (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), the β-cell mass inIRS-2−/− mice was reduced to ∼50% of that in wild-type mice. The β-cell amount inIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice was similar to that in IRS-2−/− mice. We next performed histological analyses of pancreata from IRS-2−/−mice without diabetes and IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes. Insulin-positive β-cells were dramatically decreased to nearly zero in IRS-2−/− mice with diabetes (Fig.5, compare C with Aand B). Transcription factor duodenal homeobox factor-1 (Pdx1) is known to regulate the expression of multiple genes such as insulin, glucokinase, and GLUT2 in β-cells, thereby maintaining normal β-cell function. Therefore, we further examined Pdx1 and GLUT2 expression in islets. Although the Pdx1 mRNA level was reported to be reduced in IRS-2−/− islets as compared with wild-type islets (28Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), its expression level was essentially unaltered in islets from IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes (Fig. 5E). Moreover, GLUT2 expression was preserved (Fig.5H). Interestingly, however, IRS-2−/−mice with diabetes had markedly decreased Pdx1 and GLUT2 expressions in β-cells (Fig. 5, F and I). Their expressions were severely decreased even in IRS-2−/− mice with a blood glucose level of 200–300 mg/dl under fed conditions (data not shown). We next studied islet function in 20-week-old wild-type mice, IRS-3−/− mice, IRS-2−/−mice without diabetes, andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes. Islets from IRS-3−/− mice showed normal insulin content and secretion (Fig. 6,A and B). By contrast, there was a significant reduction in insulin content per islet fromIRS-2−/− mice andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice without diabetes compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6A). However, when insulin content was normalized by cell number per islet, the insulin content was essentially unaltered inIRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− islets (data not shown). These results were consistent with our previously reported results (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). When glucose-induced insulin secretion was normalized by islet insulin content, it was significantly higher at 11.1 mm glucose from IRS-2−/− andIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− islets than that from wild-type islets (Fig. 6B). We noted that 20–30% of F2 mice carrying a null mutation for the IRS-2 gene, irrespective of the IRS-3 genotype, developed diabetes at 10–20 weeks of age (Fig. 2A). Fig.7 shows the frequency of animals with diabetes in each situation. IRS-2−/− mice of the CBA and C57Bl/6 strain, which is our original genetic background, never developed such diabetes (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that the difference in blood glucose levels between our originalIRS-2−/− mice and otherIRS-2−/− animals was at least in part because of the difference in genetic background. The results suggest the existence of a modifier gene(s) for diabetes in mice of the 129/Sv genetic strain. However, it is also possible that there are suppressor gene(s) for the development of diabetes in the CBA murine genetic strain and that IRS-3−/− animals with the 129/Sv and C57Bl/6 genetic background carry the responsible gene(s). To exclude these possibilities and also to confirm our hypothesis that the susceptibility to diabetes of IRS-2−/− animals increases as the contribution of the 129/Sv genetic background increases, we backcrossed our original IRS-2−/−animals directly with 129/SvEvTaconic or C57Bl/6J mice. To date, we have obtained N7 generations with the respective backgrounds. We analyzed the phenotypes of offspring from N2 intercrosses of either the 129/Sv or the C57Bl/6J genetic background. Although three of sixIRS-2−/− animals with the 129/Sv background developed diabetes by 20 weeks of age, none of >50IRS-2−/− animals with the C57BL/6J background developed diabetes (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with the idea that the increased susceptibility to diabetes inIRS-2−/− mice is because of a genetic contribution of 129/Sv. Although we (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and others (15Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) have generatedIRS-2−/− mice, significant differences in the phenotypes of IRS-2−/− mice between the two groups were seen in the severity of diabetes and alterations of β-cell mass. We had assumed that differences in either genetic background or environmental factors such as chow might affect the phenotypic expression of IRS-2−/− mice. On the other hand, it has been reported that whereas IRS-1−/− andIRS-3−/− mice showed normal FPG, IRS-1/IRS-3 double knock-out mice were markedly hyperglycemic (20Laustsen P.G. Michael M.D. Crute B.E. Cohen S.E. Ueki K. Kulkarni R.N. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Kahn C.R. Genes Dev. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, IRS-1 and IRS-3 compensate each other's functions in maintaining glucose homeostasis. In this study, to assess the effect of genetic background and also ablation of IRS-3 on IRS-2−/−mice, we generatedIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice by crossing IRS-3−/− mice (129/Sv and C57Bl/6 background) with our IRS-2−/− mice (CBA and C57Bl/6 background).IRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− mice showed glucose tolerance (Fig. 2), β-cell mass (Fig. 4), and β-cell function (Fig. 6) similar to those of IRS-2−/−mice. Thus, no major differences were found betweenIRS-2−/−IRS-3−/− andIRS-2−/− mice in contrast to the marked differences between IRS-1/IRS-3 double knock-out mice andIRS-1−/− or IRS-3−/− single knock-out mice (20Laustsen P.G. Michael M.D. Crute B.E. Cohen S.E. Ueki K. Kulkarni R.N. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Kahn C.R. Genes Dev. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). We attributed this to the difference in tissue distribution of IRS proteins. Thus, IRS-1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, and IRS-2 is abundantly expressed in the liver, whereas IRS-3 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissues. Therefore, IRS-1/IRS-3 double knock-out leads to nearly a total loss of function of IRS proteins in adipose tissue. By contrast, because major tissues in which IRS-2 and IRS-3 are expressed are different and IRS-1 can compensate for the loss of functions, IRS-2/IRS-3 double knock-out mice showed phenotypes similar to those of IRS-2 single knock-out mice. We found that 20–30% F2 mice carrying a null mutation for theIRS-2 gene irrespective of the IRS-3 genotype developed diabetes at 10–20 weeks of age (Fig. 2A). However, it should be noted that IRS-2−/− mice of the CBA and C57Bl/6 strain never developed such diabetes (16Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Suzuki R. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition, although 50% N2 IRS-2−/− mice with the 129/Sv background developed diabetes by 20 weeks of age, none of >50 N2 IRS-2−/− animals with the C57BL/6J background developed such diabetes (Fig. 7). These results support the idea that increased susceptibility to diabetes in IRS-2−/−mice is related to the 129/Sv genetic strain. In this respect, the backcrosses of the insulin receptor mutant animals with mice of strain 129/Sv or C57Bl/6 have already revealed that the 129/Sv strain contains diabetic genes (29Kido Y. Philippe N. Schaffer A.A. Accili D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mapping and cloning of the modifier gene(s) in the 129/Sv murine strain that appear to interact with IRS-2 in the regulation of β-cell mass should facilitate the understanding of the role of IRS-2 in the regulation of β-cell mass and reveal novel molecular targets for drug development aimed at ameliorating β-cell mass reduction in diabetic patients. A recent report (28Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) from another laboratory indicated Pdx1 expression to be reduced in IRS-2−/− islets compared with wild-type islets, suggesting the existence of a pathway from IRS-2 to Pdx1. By contrast, our results demonstrate Pdx1 expression to be essentially unaltered in islets from IRS-2−/− mice without diabetes while being dramatically decreased in islets from those with diabetes (Fig. 5, E and F). Moreover, DNA microarray analysis as well as TaqMan PCR analysis revealed Pdx1 expression to be unaltered in islets from our originalIRS-2−/− mice without diabetes. 2R. Suzuki, K. Tobe, Y. Terauchi, and T. Kadowaki, manuscript in preparation. These results indicate that IRS-2 deficiency by itself is not sufficient to decrease Pdx1 expression in β-cells and that either genetic background or hyperglycemia itself plays a role in reducing Pdx1 expression. Moreover, it seems likely that markedly decreased insulin content and GLUT2 expression are linked to the development of diabetes inIRS-2−/− mice (Fig. 5). In summary, IRS-3 does not compensate for the loss of IRS-2 in maintaining glucose homeostasis and the severity of diabetes inIRS-2−/− mice depends upon the genetic background, suggesting the existence of a modifier gene(s) for diabetes in mice of the 129/Sv genetic strain.

They are not committed to a single cisterna but their localization overlaps that of other GTs in adjacent cisternae. The mechanisms underlying the sequential distribution and localization of GTs along the exocytic pathway are not fully understood. The presence of polar residues inside the transmembrane domain (TM) is known to drive α-helix association (5Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The luminal domain of GTs has also been shown to be important for the formation of protein-protein complexes. It has been observed thatcis/medial GTs form large insoluble oligomers, contrary to late Golgi GTs that usually exist as dimers (7Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F.

Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying its correct localization has not been elucidated until recently.In the present work, we have observed that the replacement of Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33 from the TM of FT3wt by Leu residues (FT3np) caused a shift of the enzyme from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. This resulted in a decrease of the biosynthetic products of FT3wt, the Lewis determinants. Enzyme dimerization mediated by the TM Cys was observed and was abolished in the mutants where both Cys were mutated. Furthermore, TM Cys were required for the localization of FT3wt in the Golgi. Concomitantly, FT3wt was concentrated into COPI vesicles contrary to the mutant FT3np, indicating that the Cys, Gln, and Tyr residues are important for the sorting of FT3wt into the transport vesicles.DISCUSSIONIn this article, we present evidence that four amino acid residues, Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33, from the TM of FT3wt are required for its localization in the Golgi. The mutation of these amino acid residues to Leu caused a shift in fucosyltransferase III localization from the trans-Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation.Studies from different groups with different enzymes have implicated the TM, as well as flanking amino acids, from the luminal (β4-galactosyltransferase, Ref. 24Nilsson T.

In general, there is no clear evidence for the influence of each of these domains, separately, for their correct localization. Our finding that for FT3wt, four amino acid residues from the TM are sufficient for its localization in the Golgi, provides a tool to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its Golgi retention/retrieval.Transfection of BHK cells with FT3wt, which is targeted to thetrans-Golgi and the TGN (4Sousa V.L. Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), conferred the cells the new glycosylation capacity to perform the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants, Lea, Lex, and sLex. However, when the enzyme was targeted to the PM the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants was dramatically reduced even if FT3wt and FT3np had similar activities and were expressed in similar amounts. Since FT3np was in transit through the Golgi, its time of residence in this compartment should be much lower than that of FT3, and therefore the efficiency of Lewis determinants biosynthesis observed was much lower for FT3np than for FT3wt. Similarly, previous results have shown that soluble secretory forms of glycosyltransferases with low residence times in the Golgi, such as fucosyltransferase VI (sFT6, Ref. 35Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and soluble α3-galactosyltransferase (sα3GT, Ref. 39Cho S.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) kept their glycosylation capacity in vivo but with a lower efficiency. A 20-fold overexpression of sFT6 only produced small amounts of fucosylated products (10% α3-monofucosylated and 7% α3-difucosylated) (35Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 2-fold overexpression of sα3GT produced lower amounts of cell-associated α3-galactosylated glycoproteins than full-length α3-galactosyltransferase (39Cho S.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In this work, we have also showed that FT3wt dimerization occurred within the TM through disulfide bond formation involving Cys-16 and Cys-29. The dimerization did not inactivate the enzyme since FT3wt and FT3np had similar enzyme activities. The formation of one disulfide bond mediated by Cys-16 or Cys-29 prevented a second disulfide bond since higher molecular weight oligomers have not been observed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; this probably is caused by steric hindrance. Intramembrane disulfide bond formation might consist of a regulated process. Other GTs from the trans-Golgi and TGN have been shown to dimerize (GM2 synthase, Refs. 40Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G. Bassi R.

Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, α2,6-sialyltransferase has been shown to dimerize through Cys-24 from its TM, dimerization not being required for Golgi localization or enzyme activity, but possibly necessary to induce higher multiplicity oligomerization (9Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For FT3, it was found that mutation of Cys-29 led to increased levels of expression on the PM (FT3np2). Furthermore, when Cys-16 and Cys-29 were not mutated (FT3np6), levels of expression on the cell surface comparable to those of FT3wt were detected. These results suggested that Cys from the TM might play a role in Golgi retention of FT3.We cannot exclude that the introduction of Leu residues into positions 16, 23, 29, and 33 in the TM might have created a new targeting signal to the PM. However, this is not probable since substitution of the TM of α2,6-sialyltransferase by a peptide with the same number of Leu residues did not have an effect on Golgi localization of the enzyme (11Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substitution of a single residue to Leu (FT3np1, FT3np2, FT3np3, and FT3np4) was enough to induce a localization shift to the PM.In vitro studies have indicated that the correct localization of Golgi resident proteins, namely GTs, is due to their concentration into retrograde COP I-coated vesicles in a process that is dependent on GTP hydrolysis (20Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C.C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have found that FT3wt, a late acting glycosyltransferase, was also incorporated into transport vesicles contrary to its related plasma membrane mutant FT3np. Such vesicles also contained the medial Golgi SNARE GS28 or the p24 family proteins (p24γ3, α2, δ1, β1) but not anterograde cargo such as the plasma membrane TfR or soluble ApoE.The results obtained strongly support that the composition of the Golgi is maintained constant because of the incorporation of resident proteins such as FT3wt into retrograde COP I-coated vesicles. FT3np, which was transiently detected in the Golgi, but whose final destination was the PM, was never detected in this transport vesicle population.The molecular basis for FT3wt concentration in the retrograde transport vesicles involves Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33 from its transmembrane domain. These amino acid residues might mediate interactions with other proteins or specific lipids necessary for sorting into COP I vesicles. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments are presently in progress in order to detect and identify potential FT3wt-binding proteins important for the sorting process. Glycosyltransferases (GTs)1 mediate the transfer of monosaccharide residues from the corresponding nucleotide sugar donor onto glycoproteins or glycolipids during their transport along the secretory pathway. Human α3/4 fucosyltransferase III (FT3wt) (EC2.4.1.65) preferentially transfers fucose (Fuc) from the GDP-Fuc donor onto type I (Galβ3GlcNAc)-containing glycolipids and glycoproteins (1Kukowska-Latallo J.F.

Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 163-205Google Scholar). FT3wt also synthesizes the type II (Galβ4GlcNAc)-derived carbohydrates, the Lewisx (Lex), sialyl-Lewisx (sLex), and Lewisy(Ley), although to a lower extent (1Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4Sousa V.L. Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GTs are distributed along the Golgi from the cis to thetrans regions as well as the trans-Golgi network (TGN). They are not committed to a single cisterna but their localization overlaps that of other GTs in adjacent cisternae. The mechanisms underlying the sequential distribution and localization of GTs along the exocytic pathway are not fully understood. The presence of polar residues inside the transmembrane domain (TM) is known to drive α-helix association (5Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and to be important for the correct localization of protein M in the Golgi (6Machamer C.E. Grim M.G. Esquela A. Chung S.W. Rolls M. Ryan K. Swift A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The luminal domain of GTs has also been shown to be important for the formation of protein-protein complexes. It has been observed thatcis/medial GTs form large insoluble oligomers, contrary to late Golgi GTs that usually exist as dimers (7Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F.

Furthermore, changing the targeting of cis/medialGolgi mannosidase II to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to accumulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I in the ER (7Nilsson T. Hoe M.H.

On the other hand, it has been observed that increasing the length of the TM of α2,6-sialyltransferase caused a shift in localization from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (11Munro S.

Recent evidence has also shown that the cytoplasmic tail was essential for the correct Golgi localization of fucosyltransferase I (13Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and α3-galactosyltransferase (14Milland J. Russell S.M. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J.

The cisternal maturation model, which explains several aspects of transport across the Golgi, proposes that anterograde cargo progresses through the Golgi within the cisternae, whereas Golgi resident proteins are concentrated into retrograde transport coatomer protein (COP) I-coated vesicles, which fuse with previous cisternae, thereby promoting Golgi maturation (15Storrie B.

Golgi resident GTs such as mannosidase II and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (cis/medial Golgi), or β4-galactosyltransferase (trans-Golgi and TGN) have been shown to be concentrated into COP I vesicles in a process that is dependent on GTP hydrolysis by ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)-1 and its effector Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1 (18Lanoix J.

FT3wt is localized in the trans-Golgi and TGN of Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells (4Sousa V.L. Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying its correct localization has not been elucidated until recently. In the present work, we have observed that the replacement of Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33 from the TM of FT3wt by Leu residues (FT3np) caused a shift of the enzyme from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. This resulted in a decrease of the biosynthetic products of FT3wt, the Lewis determinants. Enzyme dimerization mediated by the TM Cys was observed and was abolished in the mutants where both Cys were mutated. Furthermore, TM Cys were required for the localization of FT3wt in the Golgi. Concomitantly, FT3wt was concentrated into COPI vesicles contrary to the mutant FT3np, indicating that the Cys, Gln, and Tyr residues are important for the sorting of FT3wt into the transport vesicles. DISCUSSIONIn this article, we present evidence that four amino acid residues, Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33, from the TM of FT3wt are required for its localization in the Golgi. The mutation of these amino acid residues to Leu caused a shift in fucosyltransferase III localization from the trans-Golgi/TGN to the plasma membrane, as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation.Studies from different groups with different enzymes have implicated the TM, as well as flanking amino acids, from the luminal (β4-galactosyltransferase, Ref. 24Nilsson T.

In general, there is no clear evidence for the influence of each of these domains, separately, for their correct localization. Our finding that for FT3wt, four amino acid residues from the TM are sufficient for its localization in the Golgi, provides a tool to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its Golgi retention/retrieval.Transfection of BHK cells with FT3wt, which is targeted to thetrans-Golgi and the TGN (4Sousa V.L. Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), conferred the cells the new glycosylation capacity to perform the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants, Lea, Lex, and sLex. However, when the enzyme was targeted to the PM the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants was dramatically reduced even if FT3wt and FT3np had similar activities and were expressed in similar amounts. Since FT3np was in transit through the Golgi, its time of residence in this compartment should be much lower than that of FT3, and therefore the efficiency of Lewis determinants biosynthesis observed was much lower for FT3np than for FT3wt. Similarly, previous results have shown that soluble secretory forms of glycosyltransferases with low residence times in the Golgi, such as fucosyltransferase VI (sFT6, Ref. 35Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M.

In general, there is no clear evidence for the influence of each of these domains, separately, for their correct localization. Our finding that for FT3wt, four amino acid residues from the TM are sufficient for its localization in the Golgi, provides a tool to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its Golgi retention/retrieval. Transfection of BHK cells with FT3wt, which is targeted to thetrans-Golgi and the TGN (4Sousa V.L. Costa M.T. Palma A.S. Enguita F. Costa J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 803-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), conferred the cells the new glycosylation capacity to perform the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants, Lea, Lex, and sLex. However, when the enzyme was targeted to the PM the biosynthesis of the Lewis determinants was dramatically reduced even if FT3wt and FT3np had similar activities and were expressed in similar amounts. Since FT3np was in transit through the Golgi, its time of residence in this compartment should be much lower than that of FT3, and therefore the efficiency of Lewis determinants biosynthesis observed was much lower for FT3np than for FT3wt. Similarly, previous results have shown that soluble secretory forms of glycosyltransferases with low residence times in the Golgi, such as fucosyltransferase VI (sFT6, Ref. 35Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and soluble α3-galactosyltransferase (sα3GT, Ref. 39Cho S.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) kept their glycosylation capacity in vivo but with a lower efficiency. A 20-fold overexpression of sFT6 only produced small amounts of fucosylated products (10% α3-monofucosylated and 7% α3-difucosylated) (35Grabenhorst E. Nimtz M. Costa J. Conradt H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30985-30994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 2-fold overexpression of sα3GT produced lower amounts of cell-associated α3-galactosylated glycoproteins than full-length α3-galactosyltransferase (39Cho S.K. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13622-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this work, we have also showed that FT3wt dimerization occurred within the TM through disulfide bond formation involving Cys-16 and Cys-29. The dimerization did not inactivate the enzyme since FT3wt and FT3np had similar enzyme activities. The formation of one disulfide bond mediated by Cys-16 or Cys-29 prevented a second disulfide bond since higher molecular weight oligomers have not been observed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE; this probably is caused by steric hindrance. Intramembrane disulfide bond formation might consist of a regulated process. Other GTs from the trans-Golgi and TGN have been shown to dimerize (GM2 synthase, Refs. 40Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G. Bassi R.

Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, α2,6-sialyltransferase has been shown to dimerize through Cys-24 from its TM, dimerization not being required for Golgi localization or enzyme activity, but possibly necessary to induce higher multiplicity oligomerization (9Qian R. Chen C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28641-28649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For FT3, it was found that mutation of Cys-29 led to increased levels of expression on the PM (FT3np2). Furthermore, when Cys-16 and Cys-29 were not mutated (FT3np6), levels of expression on the cell surface comparable to those of FT3wt were detected. These results suggested that Cys from the TM might play a role in Golgi retention of FT3. We cannot exclude that the introduction of Leu residues into positions 16, 23, 29, and 33 in the TM might have created a new targeting signal to the PM. However, this is not probable since substitution of the TM of α2,6-sialyltransferase by a peptide with the same number of Leu residues did not have an effect on Golgi localization of the enzyme (11Munro S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3577-3588Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the substitution of a single residue to Leu (FT3np1, FT3np2, FT3np3, and FT3np4) was enough to induce a localization shift to the PM. In vitro studies have indicated that the correct localization of Golgi resident proteins, namely GTs, is due to their concentration into retrograde COP I-coated vesicles in a process that is dependent on GTP hydrolysis (20Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C.C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have found that FT3wt, a late acting glycosyltransferase, was also incorporated into transport vesicles contrary to its related plasma membrane mutant FT3np. Such vesicles also contained the medial Golgi SNARE GS28 or the p24 family proteins (p24γ3, α2, δ1, β1) but not anterograde cargo such as the plasma membrane TfR or soluble ApoE. The results obtained strongly support that the composition of the Golgi is maintained constant because of the incorporation of resident proteins such as FT3wt into retrograde COP I-coated vesicles. FT3np, which was transiently detected in the Golgi, but whose final destination was the PM, was never detected in this transport vesicle population. The molecular basis for FT3wt concentration in the retrograde transport vesicles involves Cys-16, Gln-23, Cys-29, and Tyr-33 from its transmembrane domain. These amino acid residues might mediate interactions with other proteins or specific lipids necessary for sorting into COP I vesicles. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments are presently in progress in order to detect and identify potential FT3wt-binding proteins important for the sorting process.

PolyNeu5Ac is therefore an oncodevelopmental antigen, has important regulatory effects on the adhesive and migratory behavior of neural cells, and is thus crucial to synaptic plasticity. Until now, α2,9-polyNeu5Ac, a linkage isomer of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, has long been thought to occur only in capsules of neuroinvasive Neisseria meningitidis group C bacteria. Here we report the unexpected discovery of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac in a new cell adhesion-related glycoprotein on the membrane of C-1300 murine neuroblastoma cells (clone NB41A3). We also report the expression of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac was affected by cell growth and retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Occurrence of the linkage isomer of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac has been left unrecognized by conventional methods using biological diagnostic probes for α2,8-polyNeu5Ac.

Jennings H.J. Kenny C.P. Martin A. Smith I.C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1926-1932Google Scholar) (Fig.1). These molecules encapsulate the organisms, which are responsible for a dominant portion of all cases of meningococcal meningitis, and are critical to their pathogenesis. One of these linkage isomers, α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, which also forms the capsule of neuroinvasive Escherichia coli K1, is poorly immunogenic (2Glode M.P. Lewin E.B. Sutton A. Le C.T. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1979; 139: 52-59Google Scholar), probably due to the fact that it is a self-antigen occurring as an oncodevelopmentally regulated mammalian antigen in the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and certain tumors. In contrast α2,9-polyNeu5Ac is immunogenic enough to be used as a vaccine against meningitis caused by group C meningococci and is expressed by these organisms in both O-acetylated andO-deacetylated forms (2Glode M.P. Lewin E.B. Sutton A. Le C.T. Gotschlich E.C. Robbins J.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1979; 139: 52-59Google Scholar). Since the 1980s, the molecular biology, structural biology, and physiological and pathophysiological functions of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac on NCAM have already been the subject of major reviews (3Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Google Scholar, 4Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

Usually detection and identification of α2,8-PSA in NCAM studies are made using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to α2,8-polyNeu5Ac. Although such immunological reagents are useful for studies of developmentally regulated dynamic expression of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, they cannot be used to define DP or to detect either changes in the distribution of glycoforms differing in DP or the presence of PSA differing in sequences or inter-residue linkages. Prior to the identification of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac-NCAM, we discovered α2,8-polyNeu5Gc by chemical and biochemical methods, which was the first example of animal PSA (8Inoue S. Iwasaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1018-1023Google Scholar, 9Inoue S. Iwasaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 162-165Google Scholar). Later we also unveiled divergent forms of PSA, such as an α2,8-poly(Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc) co-polymer, α2,8-polyKDN, and α2,5-Oglycolyl-linked oligo/polyNeu5Gc (10Inoue Y. Inoue S. Pure & Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 789Google Scholar, 11Inoue S. Inoue Y. Montreuil J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins II. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1997: 143-161Google Scholar). These PSA-glycoproteins (gp) were shown to play biological functions in fertilization and early embryogenesis, and until now, except for the last example found in sea urchin eggs, all inter-residue linkages in PSA chains found in vertebrate sources were α2,8. In view of the fact that the presence of a large number of glycoforms for a single functional protein is important for the delicate and fine regulation of “protein-based functions” in higher animals, we thought that the NCAM of neuroblastoma cell lines would be an excellent model system to demonstrate how the DP of PSA chains and the structure of the core N-glycan are modulating the adhesive and migratory behavior of neural cells. To define DP and the change in distribution of glycoforms differing in DP we developed an ultrasensitive fluorescent labeling method using a fluorogenic probe DMB (1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene), which selectively reacts with any type of oligo/poly-α-ulosonic acids to introduce a strong fluorescent group at the reducing termini of these chains (DMB/HPLC-FD method) (12Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29968-29979Google Scholar, 13Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31863-31870Google Scholar, 14Inoue S. Lin S.-L. Lee Y.C. Inoue Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar, 17Inoue S. Inoue Y. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). This method permits us to achieve the same level of sensitivity as that attained by using antibodies. Here we report the serendipitous discovery of α2,9-linked polyNeu5Ac in a new cell adhesion-related glycoprotein on the membrane of C-1300 murine neuroblastoma cells (clone NB41A3). α2,9-PolyNeu5Ac has long been thought, until now, to be a homopolymer only found as capsular polysaccharide of N. meningitidis group C bacteria. Sources for rat anti-mouse embryonic PSA-NCAM (CD56) mAb (12F8, IgM) and anti-rat NCAM mAb (5B8, IgG) were given previously (16Poongodi G.L. Suresh N. Gopinath S.C.B. Chang T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar). Serum-pooled mouse polyclonal antisera against de-O-acetyl group C meningococcal polysaccharide (GCMP)-tetanus toxoid conjugate Ab against α2,9-polyNeu5Ac was prepared as described previously (18Guo Z. Jennings H.J. Pollard A.J. Maiden C.J. Meningococcal Vaccines, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-54Google Scholar). C-1300 murine neuroblastoma (clone NB41A3) cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and actually purchased from Food Industry Research and Development Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Cells were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium, supplemented with 15% horse serum, and 2.5% fetal bovine serum and kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transferred upon reaching confluence, and those within 5 passages after purchasing from ATCC were used for analysis and harvested by trypsination after washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. To examine growth stage-dependent change of polysialylation, NB41A3 cells were inoculated at the concentration of 5 × 105/ml and were collected at different stages of growth (5-, 6-, and 7-days). The same amount of cells (250 mg wet weight) was subjected to PSA analysis to facilitate direct comparison. The cells harvested at different stages of growth and differentiation were examined for their morphological features under a phase-contrast microscope (Olympus, IX70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All-trans-retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 10 μmin the culture medium. PSA and total Neu5Ac in the glycoproteins solubilized with Triton X-100 were analyzed by DMB/HPLC-FD method (16Poongodi G.L. Suresh N. Gopinath S.C.B. Chang T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar). Peaks of oligo/polysialic acids were monitored with a fluorescence detector set at 372 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission. Because each PSA can acquire only one DMB molecule, the total peak area for DMB-oligo/polysialic acid peaks (DP > 4) represents the total number of PSA chains and is used as a value comparing the level of PSA in the cells. ELISA was also applied to evaluate quantitatively the PSA expression level in the cells using mouse polyclonal antisera against de-O-acetylated GCMP (α2,9-polyNeu5Ac)-tetanus toxoid conjugate Ab and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antimouse IgM as the primary and secondary antibody, respectively. The absorbance at 405 nm (p-nitrophenol) of the reaction mixture represents the amount of PSA epitope. All procedures used in SDS-PAGE and Western blot were essentially similar to those previously described (16Poongodi G.L. Suresh N. Gopinath S.C.B. Chang T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar). The membrane fraction of NB41A3 cells was first delipidated with a mixture of chloroform-methanol-10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4:8:3 (v/v). The lipidated residue was washed with cold 80% ethanol, suspended in 2 volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and incubated withStreptomyces griseus nonspecific proteinase (Sigma; 1 mg for 1 g of wet cells) for 3 days at 37 °C under a toluene atmosphere. The incubation mixture was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650-m (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) column (1.2 × 8 cm). Compounds bound to the column were eluted stepwisely with 4-column volume each of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mNaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). PSA was found only in the 0.4 m NaCl fraction. Each sample containing 200 ng of Neu5Ac of NB41A3 α2,9-polyNeu5Ac-glycopeptides, authentic α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, and α2,9-polyNeu5Ac was dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and left at 37 °C for 4 h to remove possibleO-acetyl group. To a 10-μl aliquot of each sample solution (pH was adjusted to 5.5 with 1 m acetic acid), 10 μl of water and 10 μl of 0.15 m sodium metaperiodate were added and incubated at 4 °C. After 24, 48, and 96 h, reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 3% glycerol. Then, 10 μl of freshly prepared 0.04 m sodium borohydride in 0.01 msodium hydroxide was added, and the mixtures were kept at room temperature for 30 min. Excess borohydride was destroyed with 10 μl of 0.2 m acetic acid. The products were hydrolyzed in 0.1m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 4 h, derivatized with DMB for 2.5 h at 55 °C, and analyzed for C7 and C9 non-ulosonates by HPLC/FD as described elsewhere (17Inoue S. Inoue Y. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The expression of PSA and NCAM in the solubilized membrane fractions was analyzed for the murine neuroblastoma by DMB/HPLC-FD and by Western blot analysis using anti-α2,8-polyNeu5Ac mAb (12F8) and anti-NCAM mAbs (5B8 and VIN-IS-53). For 5 cell lines (4 different neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32, SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH, and Neuro-2A) and one pheochromocytoma cell line (PC-12)) examined in our previous report, these two diagnostic tests gave consistent results (16Poongodi G.L. Suresh N. Gopinath S.C.B. Chang T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar): IMR-32 and PC-12, PSA-positive/NCAM-positive; neuro-2A, PSA-negative/NCAM-positive. However, conflicting results were obtained regarding PSA expression in NB41A3 cells that were found to be NCAM immunoassay-negative with anti-NCAM mAb (TableI). NB41A3 cells were α2,8-polyNeu5Ac-negative on Western blots using 12F8 (Fig.2 C) but PSA-positive on the DMB/HPLC-FD analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). PSA residues in NB41A3 cells were also shown to be completely hydrolyzed to unsubstituted Neu5Ac monomer by treatment with Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase. These surprising findings provided a hint about the possible occurrence of a linkage isomer of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac,i.e. α2,9-polyNeu5Ac in NB413A cells, which has long been thought, until now, to be a homopolymer only found as capsular polysaccharide of N. meningitidis group C bacteria (1Bhattacharjie A.K. Jennings H.J. Kenny C.P. Martin A. Smith I.C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1926-1932Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the PSA structure of the NB413A membrane-bound glycoprotein.Table IDiagnosis for polySia and NCAM in neuroblastoma cell lines (NB41A3 and IMR-32) and pheochromocytoma cell line (PC-12) by DMB/HPLC-FD and by Western blot analysis using anti-α2,8-polyNeu5Ac mAb (12F8) and anti-NCAM mAb (5B8)polySia by DMB/HPLC-FD methodWestern blotAnti-α2,8-polyNeu5Ac mAb, 12F8Anti-NCAM mAb, 5B8Mouse neuro-blastoma, NB41A3+−−Human neuro-blastoma, IMR-32+++Rat pheochromo-cytoma, PC-12+++ Open table in a new tab Usually detection and identification of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac are made using monoclonal antibodies specific to this form of polymer. However, it should be emphasized here that if we had used only immunochemical criteria for examining PSA expression, the present finding of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac in NB413A cells would have definitely been missed. This emphasizes the importance of having additional analytical methods to detect PSA. Therefore we recommend that the DMB/HPLC-FD method should be routinely used as a screening test for PSA chains in biological samples. Confirmation of the presence of novel α2,9-polyNeu5Ac in the NB413A-derived glycoprotein was obtained by Western blot analysis using a mouse polyclonal antibody induced by a protein conjugate of the O-deacetylated group C meningococcal polysaccharide (18Guo Z. Jennings H.J. Pollard A.J. Maiden C.J. Meningococcal Vaccines, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 49-54Google Scholar). The cell membrane extract of NB413A PSA-gp revealed a broad anti-α2,9-polyNeu5Ac-positive band on SDS-PAGE, centering at an apparent molecular size of ∼150,000, because of the presence of numerous glycoforms differing in the DP of their PSA chain(s) (Fig. 2 D). Structural evidence for the presence of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac was also obtained from the results of the analysis of C7 and C9 ulosonates obtained after periodate oxidation of the sample, followed by borohydride reduction and mild acid hydrolysis. Oxidation of the α2,9-polyNeu5Ac chain with periodate resulted in its depolymerization and the destruction of all Neu5Ac residues to form their C7 analogs. The time-course of reaction was examined for three samples, NB41A3 PSA-glycopeptide, authentic α2,9-polyNeu5Ac, and α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, by monitoring C7 and C9 monomers using the DMB/HPLC-FD method (Fig.3, A–C). The reaction proceeded slowly (19Lifely M.R. Lindon J.C. Williams J.M. Moreno C. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 143: 191-205Google Scholar), and the NB41A3 PSA-glycopeptide and authentic α2,9-polyNeu5Ac samples gave the C7 analog of Neu5Ac as the only product (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas α2,8-polyNeu5Ac remained unoxidized and gave C9 Neu5Ac (Fig.3 A). These results prove that the inter-residue linkage of polyNeu5Ac in NB41A3 PSA-gp is α2,9. Supporting evidence for the presence of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac was obtained, using the DMB/HPLC-FD method, by co-injecting NB41A3-derived PSA-gp with each of the authentic samples, which resulted in a subtle retention time difference between homologous α2,8-oligo/polyNeu5Ac and α2,9-oligo/polyNeu5Ac labeled with fluorescent quinoxalinone at their reducing termini. The results are reproduced in Fig. 3, D and E, and as expected, NB41A3 PSA exhibited a simple profile when co-chromatographed with authentic standard α2–9-polyNeu5Ac (Fig. 3 D), whereas, when mixed with α2,8-polyNeu5Ac, a series of doublet peaks was seen on the co-chromatogram (Fig. 3 E). Interestingly, although α2,9-polyNeu5Ac has been known for well over a couple of decades as a constituent of the capsule of N. meningitidis group C (1Bhattacharjie A.K. Jennings H.J. Kenny C.P. Martin A. Smith I.C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1926-1932Google Scholar), its occurrence in animal glycoproteins had yet to be identified. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, there has been only one report concerning the finding of an α2,9-diNeu5Ac residue, Neu5Acα2→9Neu5Acα2→, in human ovarian teratocarcinoma (PA-1) cells (20Fukuda M.N.

Chem. 1985; 260: 6623-6631Google Scholar), but we failed to detect PSA in PA-1 cells by the DMB/HPLC-FD method. α2,8-PolyNeu5Ac is almost exclusively associated with NCAM in animal, where it can modulate the homotypic adhesive properties of this member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Based on its immunoreactivity, the newly identified α2,9-PSA in NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells is expressed on a distinct glycoprotein species other than α2,8-polyNeu5Ac-bearing NCAM, but its biological function has yet to be defined. However, by analogy these two cell surface molecules are probably functionally equivalent, α2,9-polyNeu5Ac playing a similar role to α2,8-polyNeu5Ac as a cell adhesion regulatory molecule during cellular development and differentiation. This can be indicated by the observed change of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac expression profiles with culture time in the presence or absence of RA as determined by the DMB/HPLC-FD method (Fig.4), and this can be deduced from coordinated behavioral changes in both the expression level of PSA and cellular adhesive nature of NB41A3 cells (Fig.5). The growth stage-dependent change in PSA expression was evaluated by two methods; one as the total peak areas in DMB/HPL-FD, and the other as the PSA level estimated by ELISA. The results in the absence and presence of RA, respectively, are shown in Fig. 5, A andB. The amount of total protein-bound Neu5Ac (ng/mg of wet cells) was also included. In the absence of RA the PSA level increased with cell culture time and reached the maximum values at confluence (day 7) (Fig. 5 A). By contrast, in the presence of RA the level of PSA was high on day 5 and gradually decreased during cell growth until it reached the lowest value at day 7 (Fig. 5 B). We were not able to determine the PSA expression level at stages before the day 5 post-inoculation time simply because the cells grew so slowly that not enough of them could be harvested.Figure 5Comparison of PSA levels in NB41A3 PC-12 cells at different culture times in the absence (A) and in the presence (B) of RA at post-inoculation incubation times (5-, 6-, and 7-days). The levels of PSA were evaluated by two different methods: (i) PSA analysis by DMB/HPLC-FD (PSA, in total area of PSA peaks) and (ii) ELISA using anti-PSA (ELISA, in A405 × 10). Total glycoprotein-bound Neu5Ac was also determined and expressed in ng/mg of wet cells. C and D, morphological changes of the cells cultured in the absence (C) and in the presence (D) of RA were examined under a phase-contrast microscope at different stages of post-inoculation incubation times (5-, 6-, and 7-days).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cellular adhesive properties were examined in cultured NB41A3 cells. When NB41A3 cells were incubated in the absence of RA, they formed aggregates at the initial stages of proliferation (day 5 post-inoculation incubation time; Fig. 5 C) and underwent dissociation of cell aggregates at later stages (day 7; Fig.5 C). These changes were associated with a parallel increase in the level of PSA per unit weight of wet cells (Fig. 5 A). In sharp contrast to these observations, in the presence of 10 μm RA NB41A3 cells did not form aggregates at the initial stages of incubation (day 5; Fig. 5 D) and a majority of the cells differentiated to a neuronal phenotype. They extended long neuritic processes during incubation, and finally on day 7 of culture a large portion of the cells formed large aggregates (Fig.5 D). Similar morphological changes were correlated with changes in the expression level of α2,8-polyNeu5Ac chains in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells and pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells during growth in the absence and presence of RA (16Poongodi G.L. Suresh N. Gopinath S.C.B. Chang T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28200-28211Google Scholar). Because cell aggregation can be correlated with change in the expression level of PSA, the newly identified α2,9-polyNeu5Ac-expressing glycoprotein may be considered as a molecule closely related to NCAM. α2,8-PolyNeu5Ac chain was suggested to be associated with the voltage-sensitive Na-channels in adult rat brain merely by immunohistochemical and Western blot data (21Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, there is no report showing that expression of PSA on Na-channels affects cell adhesion. Identification and structural determination of the new cell adhesion molecule is important and is underway. In addition we are pursuing the identification of a specific polysialyltransferase(s) (PST) that catalyze formation of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac in NB41A3 cells. Over the past decade, there has been a rapid advance in the knowledge of biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics of the PST genes and enzyme proteins. The discovery of a novel α2,9-PSA-glycoprotein on NB41A3 cells will open up a new avenue of research to characterize the biosynthesis of α2,9-polyNeu5Ac by identifying its associated enzyme(s), PST, and determining how this unique glycosylation influences the fate and function of this putative new cell adhesion glycoprotein on neuroblastoma cells."

The models predict that Gd activates Snk, which in turn activates Ea. Gd can be activated either autoproteolytically or by Ndl. The three-dimensional models of each enzyme-substrate complex in the cascade rationalize existing mutagenesis data and the associated phenotypes. The models also predict unanticipated features like a Ca2+ binding site in Ea and a Na+ binding site in Ndl and Gd. These binding sites are likely to play a crucial role in vivo as suggested by mutant enzymes introduced into embryos as mRNAs. The mutations in Gd that eliminate Na+ binding cause an apparent increase in activity, whereas mutations in Ea that abrogate Ca2+ binding result in complete loss of activity.

Hong C.C. Hashimoto C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 102-107Google Scholar) are involved in extracellular events that lead to dorsoventral polarization of theDrosophila melanogaster embryo. nudel,pipe, and windbeutel are expressed by somatic follicle cells during mid-oogenesis, whereas easter,gastrulation defective, snake, andspätzle are expressed by the nurse cells and oocyte. These genes were identified in several large scale genetic screens for maternal effect mutations that cause homozygous mutant females to produce embryos with abnormal cell fates (2Anderson K.V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1984; 311: 223-227Google Scholar). Among the dorsal group genes, nudel, gastrulation defective,snake, and easter encode proteins containing serine protease domains of the trypsin family. Easter (Ea),1 Snk, Gd, and Ndl are expressed and secreted during oogenesis as inactive zymogens into a thin, fluid-filled perivitelline space that lies between the eggshell and the oocyte. Genetic and molecular studies suggest that these proteins act in a proteolytic cascade many hours later in the early embryo (1LeMosy E.K. Hong C.C. Hashimoto C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 102-107Google Scholar, 3LeMosy E.K. Tan Y.Q. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5055-5060Google Scholar, 4Han J.H. Lee S.H. Tan Y.Q. LeMosy E.K.

The cascade resembles in its general organization those controlling the innate immune response and blood coagulation (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 67-74Google Scholar). Ovulation of the egg in some way triggers the self-activation of Ndl into Ndl*. Gd can be activated either by Ndl* or by self-activation in the presence of Snk. Subsequently, Gd* activates diffusible Snk and Snk* activates diffusible Ea. The result of this cascade is cleavage by Ea* of the diffusible dimeric nerve growth factor-like Spz (7DeLotto Y. DeLotto R. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 141-148Google Scholar). The processed Spz appears to function as a dimer to activate the transmembrane receptor Toll only on the embryo surface that will become ventralized through the Toll signaling pathway. In contrast to the significant knowledge garnered from previousin vivo studies, quantitative information on activity and specificity of various members of the cascade has so far eluded characterization involving purified proteins. Several questions remain regarding the activation of Ndl and Gd (1LeMosy E.K. Hong C.C. Hashimoto C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 102-107Google Scholar, 3LeMosy E.K. Tan Y.Q. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl.

DeLotto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2387-2393Google Scholar) and the specificity of Gd* and Snk*. Elucidation of these timely and important questions would benefit from the knowledge of the structural organization of the enzymes involved in the cascade. However, none of the members of the cascade has been crystallized so far or even expressed successfully for detailed in vitro characterization. Hence, we felt that the construction of three-dimensional models of Ndl*, Gd*, Snk*, and Ea* in complex with their targets could fill a critical structure-function gap in the field as recently shown for thrombin interactions with the platelet receptors (8Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar) and fibrinogen (9Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18875-18880Google Scholar). The value of these models stems from their timeliness and the new insight offered for future mutagenesis studies, as illustrated in the present work by the effect on embryo polarization when putative cation binding sites of examined proteases were mutated. The fly sequences came from the strain Berkeley in the Flybase (FB) and Swiss Protein (SP) databases: Ea (FBgn0000533, SP-P13582), Gd (FBgn0000808, SP-O62589), Ndl (FBgn0002926, SP-P98159), and Snk (FBgn0003450, SP-P05049). These sequences were aligned with 1800 serine proteases from the trypsin family pulled from the non-redundant data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the Flybase image at the NCBI using trypsin homologues as seeds with the BLAST program and aligned together with ClustalX as described recently (10Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19243-19246Google Scholar). Sequences were clustered into 100 groups from a neighbor junction tree accounting 500 bootstraps with ClustalX. One hundred sequences were selected, one per cluster. Three-dimensional models of 70 structures were built by comparative modeling based on 12 of 20 crystal structures of serine proteases used in the sequence core. These models were used to refine the alignment of the 100-sequence core (10Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19243-19246Google Scholar). The theoretical three-dimensional models of activated protease domains Ndl* (central or Ndl1*-(1146–1385) and C-terminal or Ndl2*-(2017–2616)); Gd*-(256–528); Snk*-(191–430); and Ea*-(127–392) were constructed by comparative modeling using the program Modeller 4 (11Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar). The following crystal structures of serine proteases downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (12Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) were used as templates: trypsin (PDB code 1tld, 1.50 Å-resolution); chymotrypsin (PDB code 4cha, 1.68 Å); tPA (PDB code 1rtf, 2.30 Å); plasmin (PDB code 1bui, 2.65 Å); plasma kallikrein (PDB code 2pka, 2.05 Å); thrombin (PDB code 1ppb, 1.92 Å); factor Xa (PDB code 1hcg, 2.20 Å); factor IXa (PDB code 1rfn, 2.80 Å); factor VIIa (PDB code1dan, 2.00 Å); and activated protein C (PDB code 1aut, 2.80 Å). These proteases were chosen because they span the breadth of diversity of trypsin-related domains and regulatory cation binding sites. Alignments extracted from the 100-sequence core were optimized manually during preliminary comparative modeling processes according to the distance violation from templates provided by the Modeller program output files. Two hundred models were built for each protease with different frameshifts of alignment in the poorly conserved loops and different seeds for the number generator. Models were then checked and ranked for stereochemistry, structural topology features, and amino acid spatial distribution with Procheck (13Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Google Scholar), WhatCheck (14Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Google Scholar), and Verify3D (15Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Google Scholar). Conformers in the same clusters were pooled when the root mean square deviations of their backbone was <2.5 Å. The best conformer was kept for each cluster and optimized by molecular dynamics (fast annealing 50–600 K in 3 ps, slow cooling 600–50 K from 5 to 15 ps) and then minimized (200 steepest descents and then 500 conjugate gradient cycles) using the program Discover (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The following parameters were used in all of the procedures: force field CFF91, dielectric constant set at 2, and cut off to threshold non-covalent bonds was set at 14 Å during dynamics and set to ∞ during minimizations. The highest ranked models were used for analysis. The in-and-out side chain distributions and the sequence-structure compatibility analyzed with Verify3D gave the following current score/expected score/threshold for the final three-dimensional models: Ndl1* (118/116/52), Gd* (130/130/58), Snk* (112/112/50), and Ea* (117/120/54). These values are comparable with those obtained with the crystal structures used as templates. The Ramachandran plot put ϕ-ψ-dihedral angle pairs per residue mostly in the favored and allowed regions as per the program Procheck: Ndl1* (92.4%), Gd* (86.0%), Snk* (94.2%), and Ea* (91.4%). The stereochemistry of the three-dimensional models satisfied Procheck and WhatCheck requirements found for crystals of proteases solved at a resolution lower than 2.5 Å. Solvent-accessible surfaces were displayed with Insight II (Accelrys) using the Connolly's algorithm with a 1.4-Å probe radius. We screened the three-dimensional models of catalytic domains for putative sites of cleavage by proteases. Only Arg, Lys, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Val residues were selected if not followed by Pro provided that their side chain was at least 50% exposed compared with same residue in the tripeptide GXG. Every selected position iin the model was scored for the solvent accessibility of neighbor residues from i − 4 to i + 2. We defined a protease cleavage site when [(r sc,i−4 +r sc,i−3 + r sc,i−2)/3 +r i + (r sc,i+1 +r sc,i+2)/2]/3 > 0.50, wherer i is the percentage of overall solvent accessibility and r sc,i is the percentage of side chain solvent accessibility. Ca2+ and Na+ binding sites were identified with the program VALE (16Nayal M. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 88: 817-821Google Scholar) using a grid of 0.1 Å, water molecule radius of 1.4 Å, and a minimum threshold for the sum of oxygen-cation bond-strength contributions of 0.8. Three-dimensional models of protease-substrate complexes were built by comparative modeling in a thorough or quick mode. In the thorough mode, the protease-fragment complexes were threaded over thrombin-peptide crystal structures (8Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Google Scholar, 9Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18875-18880Google Scholar). We used the following templates: peptide-Ac-DFLAEGGGVR from PDB (1bbr and 1ucy); PPACK from PDB (1ppb); hirugen peptide-NGDFEEIPEEYL from PDB (1hah); and peptide-LDPR from PDB (1nrs). 50 three-dimensional models were built and ranked in terms of stereochemistry quality and lowest potential binding energies. The accepted computer-generated models of protease-peptide substrate complexes had root mean square deviations of <1.5 Å for the protease backbone and peptide residues <10 Å from protease residues. Models containing a ligand with root mean square deviations of <2 Å from a higher ranked model were discarded. We selected the best ten models, extracted the ligand, docked it on the best free protease three-dimensional model as a starting point for a new modeling process, and optimized the best complex as described above for the free proteases. The thorough mode screened 1 of 50 three-dimensional models of enzyme-target peptide complexes and was used to screen every putative activation cleavage site of zymogens with every selected protease to assess activator-activated pairs. The quick mode was used to screen possible cleavage sites all along sequence targets in and out of the catalytic domain. We used only one of seven peptide three-dimensional models to template the position P1–P11, chosen according to the length of the loop between P1 and the closest hydrophobic side chain from P4 to P10 (seven possibilities). Five three-dimensional models of the complex were provided by Modeler runs, and then the best one was minimized as in the thorough mode. We examined the relative binding free energies of substrates on proteases by applying an empirical method on bound and free components. We used the potential energy of the system as an enthalpy term (force field CFF91), a conformational entropy term based on solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of residues and a hydration free energy term based on finite difference approximation of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The predicted free energy of association between receptor (R) and peptide (P), ΔG, was calculated considering that free R and P have the same conformation as in the complex RP from ΔG = ΔG RP − ΔG R − ΔG P with ΔG x = ΔG x,gas(ε=1) − ΔG x,hyd(ε=80) and x =RP, R, or P. The value of ΔG x,gas was calculated from its enthalpic and entropic contributions expressed as ΔG x,gas = ΔH x,gas −TΔS x,gas with ΔH x,gas = E x,vdw +E x,coul and ΔS x,gas = ΔS x,conf,gas + ΔS x,rt,gas + ΔS x,vib,gas. The enthalpy ΔH x,gas is a function of the van der Waals (E vdw) and coulombic (E coul) components, whereas ΔS x,gas is defined in terms of the rotational, configurational, and vibrational components.E vdw and E coul were computed from the CFF91 force-field without cut-off with ε = 2. The value of the conformational entropy ΔS x,conf,gas was computed from the loss of side and main chain rotation freedom using the definition as shown in Equation 1,TΔSX,conf,gas=TΔSX,confsc,gas+TΔSX,confmc,gas=∑iΔf1(rsc,i)TΔSi+∑iRTlnΔf2((ri−1+ri+ri+1)/3)ρiEquation 1 wheref 1(r sc,i) =r sc,i8/(r sc,i8+0.5) and r sc,i are the relative accessibility of thei th residue side chain, r sc,i= SASAsc,i/SASAsc,i,GXG. SASAsc,i,GXG refers to the side chain solvent-accessible surface area of amino acidX in the tripeptide Gly-X-Gly. The empirical scales of side chain rotation freedom, Δs i were taken from Pickett and Sternberg (17Pickett S.D. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 825-839Google Scholar). The functionf 1 decreases the entropy values when the accessibility of the side chain is <50%. The loss of freedom of residue i main chain dihedral angles ϕ and ψ was roughly considered as a function of the steric hindrance around residuei − 1 to i + 1, affecting the access of allowed and core region in the Ramachandran graph.r i is the smallest value of SASAmc,i/SASAmc,i,GXG (accessibility of the main chains only) or SASAi/SASAi,GXG (overall accessibility) weighted by the attenuation functionf 2(x) =x 7/(x 7 + 0.5). The accessible area fraction, ρi was fixed for each residue dihedral pair ϕ and ψ of X from the tripeptide Ala-X-Ala in the Ramachandran graph: 0.28 forX = Pro; 0.56 for X = Gly; and 0.40 for all other amino acids according to the allowed and core region in Procheck graphs (13Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Google Scholar). The size of the different ligands is very similar, and the resulting loss of rotational and translational entropy upon binding ΔS rt,gas between different ligands is negligible. For 25-residue peptides associated to proteases modeled by quick and thorough mode TΔS rt,gas was ∼18–20 kcal/mol at 298 K (18Finkelstein A.V. Janin J. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 1-3Google Scholar). ΔS vib,gas was not computed in the absence of experimental data on the examined structures or their normal mode vibrations. The main modes of vibrations are weakly affected for peptides of similar length, targeting the same site of a protease in a slightly different conformation. The values of ΔG x,hyd were calculated from their electrostatic energy G e and non-polar energy of hydrationG n as ΔG hyd = ΔG e + ΔG n. The electrostatic energies ΔG e were computed using the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method implemented in the program DelPhi (19Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar) averaged from eight 1-Å resolution grids decayed by 0.5 Å in one, two, or three of the x, y, and z directions. The choice of the grid position and resolution affects final values (the mean ± S.D. is 0.8–1.8 kcal/mol). G e values were computed for the transfer of the solute in water from ε = 2.0 to 80.0,G e(80.0,2.0), and then in gas from ε = 2.0 to 1.0, G e(1.0,2.0), as ΔG e =G e(80.0,2.0) − G e(1.0,2.0). The radius was fixed to 1.4 Å for solvent molecules and 2 Å for ions. Ionic strength was set at 145 mm, and the protonation state and partial charge distribution were assigned by the program Biopolymer according to the pH fixed at 7.0. The non-polar contributionG n was considered as linearly dependent on the molecule solvent-accessible surface area using a surface tension coefficient of 25 cal/mol/Å2 (20Sharp K.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 39-48Google Scholar), i.e.ΔG n = 25 ΔSASA. Based on the above definitions, the free energy for the receptor-peptide complex becomes ΔG = ΔH gas − TΔS rt,gas − TΔS vib,gas − TΔS conf,gas + ΔG hyd. Some of the terms cancel if we compare the association of same length peptides bound to the same protease. The approximation of the relative binding free energy is given by ΔΔG ∼ ΔΔH gas − TΔΔS conf,gas + ΔΔG hyd. This approach does not allow comparison of the binding of a peptide to two different proteases unless the vibrational entropy variation upon binding is comparable. The ΔΔG values refer to selected conformations and are affected by the choice of the “best model” according to global potential energy of the system and the goodness of its stereochemistry. The mean ± S.D. is ∼2.4 kcal/mol between the ΔΔGof the 10 best models of Snk* when it is bound to the activation site of Ea. Lower deviations were estimated as 1.2 kcal/mol for Ea* with Spz peptide, 1.7 kcal/mol for Ndl1* with Gd peptide, and 1.4 kcal/mol for Gd* with Snk peptide. The plasmid pNB-GD2 containing a full-length gd cDNA was obtained from J. L. Marsh (University of California, Irvine, CA) (21Konrad K.D. Goralski T.J. Mahowald A.P. Marsh J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6819-6824Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEM7Zf(+) containing a full-length ea cDNA was obtained from K. V. Anderson (Sloan-Kettering Institute) (22Chasan R. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1989; 56: 291-400Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange Exchange kit (Stratagene). We mutated Phe-225 to Ala and Pro in the putative Na+ binding site of Gd. We also mutated separately Phe-225 to Ile, Ser, and Tyr to create the putative Na+ binding site of Ea, and we mutated Glu-70 to Ala and Lys in the putative Ca2+ binding site of Ea. mRNAs encoding wild-type and mutant Gd and Ea were transcribed from plasmids by using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and were dissolved in water in a range of concentration from 0.06 to 1 mg/ml as estimated by UV absorbance (4Han J.H. Lee S.H. Tan Y.Q. LeMosy E.K. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9093-9097Google Scholar). The mutations and allelic combinations used here were described previously:gd 7/gd 7 (23Konrad K.D. Goralski T.J. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 133-142Google Scholar) andea 4/ea 5022rx1 (24Jin Y.S. Anderson K.V. Cell. 1990; 60: 873-881Google Scholar). Embryos (0.5–1.5 h post-fertilization) were injected centrally at 40–60% egg-length after the removal of the outer eggshell layer according to a standard procedure (2Anderson K.V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1984; 311: 223-227Google Scholar). Injected embryos were visually examined during gastrulation, and their cuticles were prepared for examination as described previously (25Anderson K.V. Jürgens G. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Cell. 1985; 42: 779-789Google Scholar, 26Jürgens G. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1986: 199-227Google Scholar). The injection of mRNAs encoding wild-type Gd or Ea was used as positive controls (4Han J.H. Lee S.H. Tan Y.Q. LeMosy E.K. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9093-9097Google Scholar). Zymogens Gd (amino acid 528), Snk (amino acid 430), and Ea (amino acid 392) are organized in three domains: an N-terminal signal that is cleaved during protein secretion and a zymogen that gives rise to A (N-terminal) and catalytic B (C-terminal) chains (Fig.1). The A and B chains remain covalently linked through disulfide bridges after proteolytic activation. The topology of Ndl is more complex and unusual because it carries two S1a protease domains. The first catalytic domain (Ndl1*-(1145–1385)) is central, and the second (Ndl2*-(2017–2616)) is C-terminal. Eleven low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-binding repeats intercalate the two protease domains (27Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Google Scholar). Four LDL receptor repeats are inserted in the second protease catalytic domain. To locate cleavage positions (↓) of signal peptides, we used the program SignalP (28Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Int. J. Neural. Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Google Scholar). This yielded the following sites of cleavage: Ndl 1–47↓48–2616 (VYH↓GL, score 0.54, threshold 0.48); Gd 1–19↓20–528 (TKA↓VA, score 0.85, threshold 0.48); Snk 1–27↓28–430 (LEA↓LD, score 0.75, threshold 0.48); Ea 1–21↓22–392 (SAG↓QF, score 0.82, threshold 0.48), and Spz 1–25↓26–326 (YEA↓KE, score 0.93, threshold 0.48). Alignment of Ea, Snk, Gd, and Ndl with other serine proteases suggests the following cleavage sites for zymogen activation: Ndl1* 48–1144↓1145–2616 (GDGR↓IVGG; trypsin-like cleavage); Snk* 28–183↓184–430 (SVPL↓IVGG; chymotrypsin-like cleavage); and Ea* 22–127↓128–392 (LSNR↓IYGG; trypsin-like cleavage) (Fig.1). The predicted underivatized Ea* A chain (106 amino acids, theoretical mass 12,086 Da), Ea* B chain (265 amino acids, theoretical mass 28,951 Da), Snk* A chain (156 amino acids, theoretical mass 17,372 Da), and Snk* B chain (247 amino acids, theoretical mass 27,319 Da) agree with Western blots described by Dissing et al. (5Dissing M. Giordano H. DeLotto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2387-2393Google Scholar). In the case of Gd, no basic or hydrophobic residue occupies the canonical position, and the closest putative cleavage site is either 30 or 22 residues upstream, specifically Gd* 20–211↓212–528 (GEPK↓SSDG; trypsin-like cleavage) or Gd* 20–220↓221–528 (TSPV↓FVDD; chymotrypsin-like cleavage). The fragment 212–528 expressed in S2 insect cells is an active protease (3LeMosy E.K. Tan Y.Q. Hashimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5055-5060Google Scholar). DeLotto (29DeLotto R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 721-726Google Scholar) proposed the cleavage site Gd* 20–136↓137–528 (EHIR↓KLSF; trypsin-like cleavage) located 83 residues upstream of the canonical activation site. The proposed cleavage site is 12 residues upstream of a type A von Willebrand repeat motif (LLLDXXEXXVRXXD) as described for complement factor B and C2. With such a cleavage, the predicted underivatized Gd* A chain (116 amino acids, theoretical mass 13,396 Da) and Gd* B chain (390 amino acids, theoretical mass 43579 Da) agree with the Western blots described by Dissing et al. (5Dissing M. Giordano H. DeLotto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2387-2393Google Scholar). The alignment of Spz with the protease activation sites proposes 26–220↓221–326 (VSSR↓VGGS; trypsin-like cleavage) as the best site of cleavage to produce the fragments documented by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5Dissing M. Giordano H. DeLotto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2387-2393Google Scholar). Ndl* could also be processed to release only the central catalytic domain Ndl1* (241 amino acids, theoretical mass 26,862 Da) by a second cleavage 1145–1385↓1386–2616 (TTPR↓LLPK; trypsin-like cleavage) as shown by LeMosy et al. (30LeMosy E.K. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. Development. 1998; 125: 4045-4053Google Scholar). The cleavage site 1386–2016↓2017–2616 (NLMR↓LLNV; trypsin-like cleavage) is also detectable in the C-terminal domain Ndl2 (600 amino acids). Ea and Snk show 25% identity overall, 33% within the B chain, and feature the same potential disulfide bridges (Fig. 1). Alignment with other proteases suggests that only one disulfide bridge,1-122 in the chymotrypsin numbering, 2Underlined numbers refer to positions aligned with chymotrypsin(ogen). Non-underlined positions refer to the corresponding zymogen precursor sequence. links the A and B chains. The disulfide bonds 42-58,168-182, and 191-220 are highly conserved in the catalytic B chain of serine proteases. Gd is proposed to retain the disulfide bonds 42-58 and168-182 as well as 1-122linking the A and B chains (Fig. 1). Ndl could have five disulfide bonds in Ndl1* (1-122 between the A and B chains and 42-58, 136-201,168-182, and 191-220within the B chain). Ndl2* features only the42-58 disulfide bond within the B chain and1-122 between the A and B chains (Fig. 1). Ndl1*-(1145–1385), Ndl2*-(2195–2616), Gd*-(212–528), Snk*-(184–430), and Ea*-(128–392) were folded using the trypsin scaffold (CATH 2.40.10.20; SCOP B.47.1.1) with two orthogonal six-stranded β-barrels flanking the active site groove hosting the catalytic triad (Fig. 2). Insertions or deletions relative to chymotrypsin occur in loops at the protein surface and outside the active site. Although the identity between Ndl2* and other trypsin-like proteases is low, it spreads uniformly among all domains and especially at the level of the two β-barrels. Ndl2* features an unusual catalytic triad, where the nucleophile Ser-195 is coupled to Glu-102 and Ser-57 that replace the canonical Asp-102 and His-57. There is no other example of a Ser-Glu-Ser catalytic triad among 1800 other serine proteases in the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and MEROPS (www.merops.co.uk) databases, which suggests that Ndl2* may not participate in the cascade as an active protease. The LDL domain is inserted away from the potential active site in the 186-loop, where insertions of various length also exists in thrombin and tissue- plasminogen activator. Fig. 2 displays the water-accessible surfaces of Ndl1*, Gd*, Snk*, and Ea*. The overall architecture of the active site is similar in all models, but their surfaces show notable differences in amino acid composition. The four proteases feature the catalytic triad His-57, Asp-102, Ser-195, and the important ancillary residues Cys-42 and Cys-58(SS-linked), Gly-193, Gly-196, Gly-211, and Ser-214. The Cys-168/Cys-182 disulfide bond stabilizes the intervening loop that forms part of the binding site and is conserved in all four proteases. The Cys-191/Cys-220disulfide bond is present in Ndl1*, Snk*, and Ea* but not in Gd*. This bond bridges the 186-loop and 220-loop that shape the bottom of the primary specificity pocket. Binding site pockets around residue 189 and the hydrophobic core around residues 99, 174, and 215differ among the four proteases. The presence of Asp-189 in the S1 (31Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar) pocket shows that specificity is unambiguously trypsin-like for Ndl1* and Ea*, whereas Ser-189 suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity for Gd*. The presence of Gly-189 in Snk* makes the prediction of specificity ambiguous. The shape and volume of the S1 pocket in Snk* could accommodate a variety of side chains. Leukocyte elastase, which carries Gly189 and cleaves after Val in P1, shows a 23% identity with Snk* in the catalytic B chain. The structure of elastase (PDB code 1ppg) complexed with the tetrapeptide AAPV (32Wei A.Z. Mayr I. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 367-373Google Scholar) shows that Val-190 defines the S1 specificity toward hydrophobic P1 residues. In the model of Snk*, the unusual His-190(His-371) points out of the S1 pocket and interacts with Asp-194 (Asp-375), thereby leaving the S1 pocket free to interact with a variety of side chains besides hydrophobic residues.

To date, relatively low levels of enzymatic activity could be introduced into antibodies by using transition-state analogues of haptens. In the present study, we identify the structural elements that contribute to the observed hydrolytic activity in egg white avidin, which promote the cleavage of active biotin esters (notably biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester). The latter elements were then incorporated into bacterial streptavidin via genetic engineering. The streptavidin molecule was thus converted from a protector to an enhancer of hydrolysis of biotin esters. The conversion was accomplished by the combined replacement of a “lid-like loop” (L3,4) and a leucine-to-arginine point mutation in streptavidin. Interestingly, neither of these elements play a direct role in the hydrolytic reaction. The latter features were thus shown to be responsible for enhanced substrate hydrolysis. This work indicates that structural and non-catalytic elements of a protein can be modified to promote the induced fit of a substrate for subsequent interaction with either a catalytic residue or water molecules. This approach complements the conventional design of active sites that involves direct modifications of catalytic residues.

The tremendously high affinity between the proteins and their ligand has been exploited as a powerful tool in numerous biotechnological applications (3Wilchek M. Bayer E.A.

Despite differences in the primary structure of the two proteins (∼30% identity and 40% overall similarity) both have strikingly similar tertiary β-barrel topology and homo-tetrameric quaternary arrangement. Both proteins contain four biotin-binding sites wherein the interacting residues are remarkably similar. In addition to the binding residues, the contribution of a critical tryptophan (Trp-110 and Trp-120 in avidin and streptavidin, respectively), donated from an adjacent monomer, plays a pivotal role both in biotin binding and in the stability of the tetrameric structure (5Laitinen O.H.

Avidin and streptavidin in their apo forms, include a disordered L3,4 loop (i.e. the loop connecting strands β3 and β4), thus exposing the biotin-binding site. Upon biotin binding, the “lid-like” loop adopts an ordered and closed conformation, thereby burying the biotin molecule in the binding site (8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl.

In contrast to the latter structural and functional similarities, the two proteins differ in many other properties (2Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). One of the intriguing differences between avidin and streptavidin lies in their propensity to promote the hydrolysis of selected biotinyl ester derivatives (12Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Specifically, avidin was found to enhance the hydrolysis of biotinylp-nitrophenyl ester (BNP),1 whereas streptavidin was found to strongly protect the same biotin derivative from hydrolysis. It was also discovered that upon chemical modification of lysine residues in avidin, the hydrolysis of BNP is lost (12Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this context, we have recently determined the crystal structures of avidin and streptavidin in complex with biotinyl p-nitroanilide (BNA), the stable amide analogue of BNP (12Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The structures of the avidin and streptavidin complexes with BNA revealed the structural and chemical factors that appear to contribute to the observed differences in hydrolytic potential toward BNP. Three main determinants were noted that could account for the hydrolytic activity in avidin versus the protection afforded by streptavidin. (i) The disordered conformation of the L3,4 loop in avidin, which would permit solvent accessibility to the ester group of BNP as opposed to the closed conformation of the loop in streptavidin (similar to that in the streptavidin-biotin complex), in which the ligand is almost completely buried (Fig.1). It is also noteworthy that the L3,4 loop in avidin is three residues larger than that of streptavidin, and its disposition in avidin is more susceptible toward derivatized biotin ligands, thus resulting in the observed disordered conformation (13Pazy Y. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30892-30900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). (ii) Arg-114 of avidin, which protrudes from the β8 strand, repels the BNP into a conformation that promotes its interaction with Lys-111 from an adjacent monomer. In streptavidin, the homologous position is occupied by a smaller residue, Leu-124, that allows the BNP ligand to adopt an alternative conformation that precludes interaction with Lys-121 (Fig. 2). (iii) In avidin, the formation of a hydrogen bond between the nitro group of BNP and Lys-111 increases the electron-withdrawing properties of thep-nitrophenyl moiety, thus enhancing its leaving-group properties and promoting hydrolysis under conditions of relatively low pH values. In streptavidin, however, the BNP acquires a different conformation that prevents interaction with the critical lysine residue (Fig. 2).Figure 2Superposition of the avidin- and streptavidin-BNA complexes, showing the binding site region and the 1,2 interface. Both monomers (Mon1 and Mon2) of avidin and streptavidin are shown in cyan and magentarespectively. The avidin side chains of Lys-111, Arg-114, and the BNA ligand of the complex are shown in blue, whereas the respective streptavidin-based Lys-121, Leu-124, and BNA are shown inred. Arg-114 in avidin protruding from β8 repels the p-nitroanilide segment of BNA to adopt a conformation that facilitates hydrogen bond formation between the nitro group and Lys-111. Conversely, in streptavidin Leu-124 permits a different BNA conformation, wherein the nitro group is distant from Lys-121.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the structural and biochemical differences between the two proteins, we designed a series of streptavidin mutations. Our main objectives were to evaluate the structural factors that result in the pseudo-catalytic properties in avidin and to convert streptavidin from a protector of the BNP ligand to one that enhances its hydrolysis. Consequently, Leu-124 in streptavidin was converted to Arg (mutant M1), and the relatively shorter L3,4 loop (residues 48–52) of streptavidin was replaced to emulate that (residues 38–45) of avidin (mutant M2). A third construct was generated to contain both modifications (i.e. the point mutation and the L3,4 loop exchange; mutant M3). In this study, we thus elected to mutate streptavidin in a manner that would both sterically divert the substrate into the correct conformation for the hydrolytic reaction to occur and expose the substrate to the solvent. Importantly, throughout the design of the three mutations, the purported residue (Lys-121 in streptavidin) that drives the hydrolysis was not subjected to mutation. This work is the first instance in which rational mutagenesis of a protein has been employed for steric diversion of a substrate in a binding site to attain a preferred orientation that favors hydrolysis. This strategy represents an alternative approach for protein modification in the design of enzymes (14Altamirano M.M. Blackburn J.M. Aguayo C. Fersht A.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Davies R.R. Distefano M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11643-11652Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Imperiali B.

A pET-21a plasmid, containing an insert encoding for core streptavidin with favorable codon usage for expression in Escherichia coli, was kindly provided by P. Stayton. Site-directed mutagenesis of Leu-124 to Arg (mutation M1), was performed with primers P1 and P2 (TableI) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The core streptavidin was used as a template for the exchange of the L3,4 loop of avidin. The desired exchange of the L3,4 loop (mutation M2) was achieved by PCR using two separate fragments: fragment 1 was formed by primers P3 and P6, and fragment 2 was produced using primers P4 and P5 (Table I) using the core streptavidin as a template. The combination of the L124R mutation of streptavidin (mutation M1 as template), combined with the primers used for modifying the L3,4 loop, generated the double mutant (mutation M3), in which the L124R mutation was obtained in combination with the modified L3,4 loop.Table ISequence of primers used in PCR and site-directed mutagenesis reactionsPrimer namePrimer sequenceP15′-GCG TGG AAA TCC ACC CGT GTT GGT CAC GAC ACC-3′P25′-GGT GTC GTG ACC AAC ACG GGT GGA TTT CCA CGC-3′P35′-GAA CAA CAC ATA TGG CTG AAG C-3′P45′-GTG CGG CCG CAA GCT TTT ATT AG-3′P55′-ACC GCT ACC TCC AAC GAA ATC AAA AGA TAC GTT CTG ACC GGT CGT TAC-3′P65′-TTT GAT TTC GTT GGA GGT AGC GGT AAC AGC GGA TTC GTA GGT ACC GG-3′ Open table in a new tab Streptavidin mutants were expressed in E. coli using the pET-21a expression vector (Novagen) according to the protocol essentially as reported previously (17Chilkoti A. Tan P.H. Stayton P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. US. 1995; 92: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Starter BL21 cells, transfected with the various constructs, were grown in 2× yeast-tryptone media at 37 °C until anA 600 of 0.6–0.8 was attained. Expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6–8 h at 37 °C, after which the cells were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.02% sodium azide) to 1/20 of the original culture volume. After mechanical disruption of the cells using a microfluidizer (model M-110 EHIS, Microrofluidics Corp., Newton, MA), the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. For the isolation of the inclusion bodies, the insoluble fraction was washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm EDTA, 1.5 m NaCl, 1 mmPMSF, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and four times in the same buffer solution without Triton X-100. For the L124R mutation, inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 1.5) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the supernatant fluids were dialyzed against 2 liters of dialysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m PMSF, and 0.5 mm benzamidine for 24 h with two changes of dialysis buffer. The protein solution was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min to remove the excess of pelleted unfolded protein. For the sL3,4a and the L124R+sL3,4a mutants, the pellets of inclusion bodies were resuspended in 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 1.5), and 3 mm1,4-dithiothreitol. After 1 h of incubation, the solubilized protein was dialyzed for 12 h at 4 °C against 2 liters of refolding buffer containing 0.2 m NaHCO3 (pH 8), 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The unfolded protein was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the solution fraction was further dialyzed against two liters of the same buffer, initially with the addition of 5% glycerol and later without glycerol. NaCl was added to the mutant protein solutions to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the pH value was adjusted to 10 with 1 n NaOH. Affinity purification using iminobiotin-agarose was performed according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce) (18Gitlin G. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Biochem.

Samples containing the desired streptavidin mutants were eluted from the iminobiotin column with 0.1 m acetic acid (pH 2.9) concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml protein and assayed immediately. BNP was dissolved in dimethylformamide (7 nmol per 10 μl) and added to a solution containing 16 nmol of subunit mutant in 0.5 ml. The assay for BNP hydrolysis was conducted as previously described (12Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32031-32039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Wilchek M. Gitlin G. Bayer E.A. Viswanath T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3099Google Scholar) with some modifications. Core streptavidin and avidin were also assayed for comparison of the activity of the given mutant. Protein solutions were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C. The pH value was initially adjusted to the approximate value by adding either 1 m phosphate buffer or 1m Na2CO3, and the solution was then titrated with 5 n NaOH to the desired pH value. Hydrolysis was assayed versus time at different pH values and monitored by the release of p-nitrophenol atA 410. The hydrolysis assays were performed at pH values ranging between 6.5 and 10.5, and the concentration ofp-nitrophenol was measured as a function of time. The extent of BNP hydrolysis was examined at several pH values. The results emphasize the differences in the pseudocatalytic properties of the different mutants compared with those observed for the avidin and streptavidin molecules (Fig. 3). At pH values below 9.0, the results revealed but a limited effect on hydrolytic activity for the L124R point mutant M1, and the protective behavior of streptavidin is preserved. As the pH is raised, the hydrolytic activity for M1 increases slightly relative to that of streptavidin until pH 10.5, whereby the hydrolysis of BNP by mutant M1 is increased drastically to emulate that of avidin (Fig. 3). At pH values below 8.0, mutant M2 still exhibits a protective effect vis-à-vis BNP hydrolysis, although under more basic conditions the activity of this mutant is dramatically increased to levels of hydrolysis similar to those observed for avidin. The level of hydrolytic activity for the double mutation (M3) drops sharply at pH below 7.5 compared with that of avidin, which still exhibits substantial hydrolysis. The observed hydrolysis by avidin below pH 7 represents a minimal value since the pK of thep-nitrophenyl leaving group is around 7. Above pH 7.5, the extent of BNP hydrolysis exhibited by M3 is even higher than that of avidin. The rates of hydrolysis were examined at pH 10 and 10.5 (Fig.4), and the results confirmed the above-described tendencies. Streptavidin protects the hydrolysis of BNP even after overnight incubation. The point mutation M1 is only slightly more active than streptavidin at pH 10 (Fig. 4), but its activity increases drastically at pH 10.5 to values comparable to avidin. The hydrolytic activity of the loop mutation M2 is markedly higher than that of M1 at pH 10, and the course of hydrolysis increases gradually and reaches a maximum after overnight incubation, whereby the final values observed are approximate those measured for avidin. Although the extent of BNP hydrolysis by M2 indeed resembles that of avidin, the rate of reaction is much slower. The initial rate of hydrolysis for the combined mutant M3 is much higher at pH 10 than that of M2 but lower than that of avidin. At later stages of hydrolysis, the extent of hydrolysis by M3 is very similar to the level observed for avidin. Although the structures of the avidin and streptavidin complexes with BNA have been determined and analyzed, the factors determining the pseudo-catalytic properties of avidin have yet to be verified. Lys-111 in avidin plays a direct and essential role in the hydrolysis reaction. The amine side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the nitro group of BNP thus enhancing the electron-withdrawing properties of the nitro group and subsequent leaving-group properties of the p-nitrophenyl moiety. The crystal structures also revealed two additional factors in avidin, which are lacking in streptavidin but play an indirect role in the hydrolysis reaction. The L3,4 loop of avidin exhibits higher flexibility than that of streptavidin by adopting a disordered conformation in many of the complexes with biotin analogues (13Pazy Y. Kulik T. Bayer E.A.

Conversely, in many of the streptavidin complexes with the same analogues, this loop retains an ordered “consensus” conformation (12Huberman T. Eisenberg-Domovich Y. Gitlin G. Kulik T. Bayer E.A.

The disordered L3,4 loop of avidin exposes thep-nitrophenyl moiety of BNP to the solvent and thus permits nucleophilic attack on the ester bond. In streptavidin, however, the closed conformation of the L3,4 loop (Fig. 1) serves to bury the BNP molecule in the binding site, thus rendering the ligand completely inaccessible to solvent. In addition to solvent accessibility of BNP in avidin, Arg-124 shoves the p-nitrophenyl group into an orientation that allows its interaction with Lys-111 from an adjacent avidin monomer. The assay of hydrolytic activity for the three streptavidin mutants revealed that both the lid-like L3,4 loop and Arg-124 indeed play an important role in promoting the hydrolysis reaction as deduced from the x-ray structures. The results also show that each of the two factors (the L3,4 loop and Arg-124) contributes differently to the course of the reaction. In this context, under moderate alkaline conditions, the hydrolytic activity of mutant M1 is only marginally higher than that of streptavidin, which protects the ligand from the reaction. This modest increase in hydrolytic activity, displayed by M1 under alkaline conditions, may imply that a diversion of the p-nitrophenyl group of the ligand and its plausible interaction with the lysine residue from an adjacent monomer is not the crucial factor that drives BNP hydrolysis. On the other hand, the exchange of the lid-like loop of streptavidin (mutant M2) appears to enhance drastically the hydrolytic properties of streptavidin. M2 contains a larger L3,4 loop, which is probably flexible and displays a higher level of disorder upon ligand binding. M2 is thus active at relatively low pH (below 8.5), although the observed extent of hydrolysis is lower than that of avidin (Fig. 2). It is thus expected that the L3,4 loop is disordered upon BNP binding, thereby exposing the ligand to the solvent and facilitating nucleophilic attack on the ester bond. Consequently, the disordered conformation of L3,4 is only one of the essential elements that promotes the hydrolysis reaction. The enhanced hydrolysis reaction also requires facile interaction of the nitro group of BNP with the lysine residue from the adjacent monomer. In mutant M2, thep-nitrophenyl moiety of BNP is unconfined as in avidin and is thus free to maintain alternative conformations, some of which may indeed direct the nitro group toward the locale of the reactive lysine. The conformational freedom of the p-nitrophenyl group, however, may also explain the lower rate of hydrolysis observed by this mutant (Fig. 4) since, at any given moment, only a fraction of ligand molecules would be in a conformation (Fig. 2) that would favor interaction with the essential lysine residue. Supplementing the characteristics of M2 with those of M1 (mutant M3) markedly increases the catalytic activity at pH 8 and higher (Figs. 3 and 4), similar to that observed for avidin. The increased activity of the double mutant relative to M2 implies that disorder in the L3,4 loop indeed promotes hydrolysis by water. Moreover, the steric diversion of the p-nitrophenyl group by Arg-124 toward Lys-121 is also important for further enhancement of the reaction and for lowering the pH of hydrolysis, which results from the formation of a hydrogen bond. In this study, we examined experimentally our previously reported structure-based hypotheses regarding the main determinants for pseudo-catalytic activity of egg-white avidin. Based on the x-ray structures of avidin and streptavidin complexed with BNA, we designed a functionally active hydrolytic site in streptavidin. In doing so, we succeeded in converting the streptavidin binding site from its protection of the BNP ligand from pseudo-enzymatic hydrolysis to a strong promoter of hydrolysis. The present study demonstrates clearly that if the structure and mode of catalytic action of a protein is known, the structural elements responsible for catalysis can be transferred to a structurally similar but non-catalytic protein. In this context, local alterations (e.g. point mutations or major modifications in loop regions) are permissible, while the scaffold (i.e. tertiary structure) of the protein must remain intact. Such an approach, in which catalytic properties have been induced in a binding protein, has only been attempted successfully in the past for antibodies (21Pollack S.J. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1929-1931Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Schultz P.G. Lerner R.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 23Schultz P.G. Lerner R.A.

We would like to thank P. Stayton (University of Washington) for providing the gift of the plasmid containing the core streptavidin insert."

Thus, up-regulating p53 activity is an important function for p300 and CBP. p300 has also been shown to interact with the p53 negative regulator MDM2 (5Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D.

Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). MDM2 possesses an E3-like ubiquitin ligase activity and thus ubiquitinates p53 (25Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), leading to its degradation (26Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

MDM2 also binds to p53 when this transcriptional activator resides at the promoter regions of its target genes (28Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. Asch H. Kulesz-Martin M.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5402-5406PubMed Google Scholar), blocking p53-dependent transcription (24Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J.

Because MDM2 itself is transcriptionally induced by p53, it serves as a negative feedback regulator of this activator (31Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 32Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, by binding to MDM2, p300 assists this protein in degrading p53 (23Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Though seemingly contradictory to the fact that p53 is activated by p300, as discussed above, the enhancement of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by p300 appears to be correlated with the observation that MDM2 forms a ternary complex with p300 and p53 (33Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and inhibits p300-catalyzed p53 acetylation (16Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 33Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Reasonably, inhibition of p300-catalyzed p53 acetylation would favor MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and, thus, degradation, because these enzymes target the same set of lysine residues at the C-terminal domain of p53 (14Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar,15Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E.

Hence, the MDM2-p300 interaction leads to down-regulation of p53 function. However, it is unclear whether p300 requires its acetylase activity to assist MDM2 in degrading p53. We recently found that overexpression of p300 increased the level of MDM2 (Fig. 2). This phenomenon was also reported by others (35Kawai H. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45928-45932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our study as presented here shows that p300 does not need its acetylase activity to stabilize MDM2. First, p300 apparently did not acetylate MDM2 in solution and in cells. Second, overexpression of p300 in cells increased the level of the MDM2 protein, but not its mRNA, and led to elongation of the half-life of MDM2. Similarly, the acetylase-defective p300 AT2 mutant stabilized the MDM2 protein as well. Consistently, the deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), did not significantly affect the half-life of the endogenous MDM2 protein. Moreover, both wild-type and acetylase-defective mutant p300 proteins recruited MDM2 to nuclear body-like structures where MDM2 might be protected from targeting by nuclear proteosomes. Thus, these results demonstrate that p300 stabilizes MDM2 by retaining this protein in a specific nuclear structure rather than by acetylating it.

The mixture was then incubated at 30°C for 60 min and analyzed on SDS-PAGE afterward. Acetylated p53 or MDM2 was detected by autoradiography. MDM2 and p53 were detected by Western blot using monoclonal anti-p53 antibody 421 and polyclonal anti-MDM2 antibody. The acetylation in cells (60% confluence in a 10-cm plate) was performed according to the published method with minor modifications (53Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Human H1299 cells were transfected with the MDM2 expression plasmid alone or together with the p300 or p300-AT2 plasmid. 30 h after transfection, the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) (5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 1 h and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]sodium acetate (Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μg/ml CHX for 1 h at 37°C before cell lysates were prepared. Immunoprecipitation with the lysates and antibodies against MDM2 was carried out, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography for 2 months. MDM2 was detected by Western blotting. Northern blot analysis was conducted as described (54Zeng X. Keller D. Wu L. Lu H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6184-6188PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from transfected H1299 cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 15 μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was exposed to UV light in a UV cross-linker (Fisher) and incubated with 32P-labeled cDNA probes encoding human MDM2 at 42°C overnight. After washing with 4× SSC once and 1× SSC twice, the blot was exposed to x-ray film overnight. H1299 cells were transfected with the MDM2 plasmid alone or together with the p300 or p300-AT2 expression plasmid as described above. 30 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TSA or Me2SO for 6 h. Separately, mouse p53 null embryonic fibroblast cells, human HEK, and H1299 cells were also treated with TSA or Me2SO for 6 h. Then, all the cells were treated with 50 μg/ml CHX and harvested at different time points afterward for the preparation of cell lysates. Lysates containing 100 μg of proteins were loaded directly onto an SDS gel for Western blot analysis with antibodies against MDM2. The level of MDM2 from the transfected cells was quantified by scanning the blot and using the Adobe Photoshop program and plotted with the Cricket Graph (Fig.3 A). These experiments were repeated twice. A wild-type human p300 cDNA and the AT2 mutant lacking histone acetyltransferase activity (7Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were used to generate recombinant adenoviruses with the adenase Vector Kit (Quantum Biotechnologies). Each p300 cDNA was first cloned into a modified shuttle plasmid containing a tetracycline-inducible promoter using standard molecular biological manipulations. Each pShuttle:TetR:p300 recombinant plasmid was linearized and recombined with the pedally plasmid in Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 as described by the manufacturer. Five micrograms of purified pAdEasy:TetR:p300 and pAdEasy:TetR:p300AT2 plasmids were then digested with PacI endonuclease and transfected into low passage HEK293 cells using FuGENE-6 at a ratio of 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 5 μl of FuGENE 6. After 2 days, the transfected cells were replated in 6-well dishes, and growth medium containing 1.25% Seaplaque Agarose was added 1 day later to promote the formation of recombinant viral plaques, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 17 days later, individual plaques were picked, amplified in the HEK293 cells, and purified over a discontinuous CsCl gradient as outlined in the supplier's protocol. Cells were co-infected with approximately equal amounts of two recombinant adenoviruses, one encoding a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator (Ad:tTA), and the other either Ad:GFP, Ad:FLAG-p300, or Ad:FLAG-p300-AT2. Cells at ∼50% confluent density were washed once with PBS and then incubated for 3 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and an equal mixture of two viruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) that depends upon cell type. The medium was then replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated until confluence before being used for experiments. Human astrocytoma SJSA cells containing detectable MDM2 were co-infected with the recombinant adenovirus encoding a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator (Ad:tTA) and the recombinant adenovirus harboring GFP, FLAG-p300, or FLAG-p300AT2 at an m.o.i. of 1000. 48 h after infection, cells were fixed for immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies and polyclonal anti-MDM2 antibodies as well as DNA staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The Alexa Fluor 488 (green) goat anti-mouse antibody and the Alexa Fluor 546 (red) goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) were used for FLAG and MDM2, respectively. Stained cells were analyzed under the Zeiss Axiovert 25 fluorescent microscope. The infected cells were also harvested for Western blot analysis using antibodies against p300, MDM2, and α-tubulin. The interaction between p300 and MDM2 (33Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine whether MDM2 is also a substrate for this acetylase. To this end, purified p300, MDM2, and GST-MDM2 were used in a set of in vitroacetylation assays with purified PCAF-HAT fragment and p53 as controls. [3H]acetyl-CoA was used as a substrate, and acetylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.1 A, both p300 and the PCAF-HAT fragment acetylated p53 (lanes 2 and 3) as expected (33Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). However, none of these acetylases were able to acetylate either MDM2 or GST-MDM2 (lanes 4–9). To further confirm this result, MDM2 was titrated in the same acetylation reaction setting with increasing amounts of p53 as positive controls. Again, p53 was acetylated by p300, but not by the p300 AT2 mutant (7Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), in a dose-dependent fashion (lanes 1–5 of Fig.1 B). Although a significant amount of the MDM2 protein was used in the reaction, no acetylated MDM2 was detected even after an extended exposure (lanes 6–10 of Fig. 1 B). Thus, these results demonstrate that p300, like PCAF (28Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), does not acetylate MDM2 in solution. To determine whether this observation is also true in cells, we performed an in vivo acetylation assay by co-introducing p300 with MDM2 into human small cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells that are free of p53 proteins. Cells were labeled with [3H]acetic acid 36 h after transfection and harvested 2 h after labeling in the presence of the deacetylase inhibitor TSA. Although both MDM2 and p300 were well expressed, we were unable to detect acetylated MDM2 in the presence of the exogenous p300 (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that p300 is unable to acetylate MDM2 in solution and in cells. We next tested whether p300 affects the level of MDM2 in cells. To this end, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-MDM2 and p300 alone or together. Protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis using antibodies against p300 and HA, respectively. As shown in Fig.2 A, the MDM2 level increased dramatically when MDM2 was co-expressed with p300. This increase was in a p300 dose-dependent manner, but it was not due to the increase of the mdm2 gene transcription by p300, as the mRNA level of the mdm2 gene did not change significantly (two bottom panels of Fig.2 A) no matter whether the p300 level was high or low (top panel). Surprisingly, the acetylase-defective p300AT2 mutant (37Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) was also able to induce the level of MDM2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 B). Consistent with this result, the deacetylase inhibitor TSA did not significantly affect the half-life of either exogenous (Figs. 2 C or 3) or endogenous MDM2 in H1299 cells (Figs. 2 D). This finding was also true in HEK293, p53 null MEF, and Saos2 cells (data not shown). In addition, the NAD-dependent deacetylase inhibitor vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid, 5 mm) was without effect on the half-life of MDM2 either (data not shown). Although MDM2 level increased in the presence of TSA, this increase was inconsistent, as it was not reproducible in H1299 and several other cell lines including HEK293 and p53 null MEF cells (Fig. 2 D, and data not shown). The stabilization of MDM2 by p300 appeared to require a direct association between these proteins, as the MDM2 level did not significantly increase when two p300 deletion mutants that lack the MDM2-binding domain (amino acids 350–450) (5Zeng X.

https://openalex.org/W2048733287,"Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing is developmentally regulated in the human and rodent small intestine, changing from <1% at day 14 to ∼90% by day 20 in the rat fetus. This regulation is coincident with the developmental formation of the crypt-to-villus axis functional unit, a continuous and rapidly renewing system involving cell generation, migration, and differentiation. Utilizing small intestine isografts implanted into the subcutaneous tissue of adult recipients, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing was developmentally up-regulated, parallel to that seen with an intact control. In contrast, apoB mRNA expression remains nearly constant in the isograft, unlike the normal intact small intestine. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that apoB-48 protein existed predominantly in well differentiated enterocytes along the villus surface whereas apoB-100 was in the lamina propria and crypts. ApoB mRNA editing levels were very low in the crypt-like rat intestinal cell line, IEC-6 (∼0.3%), but very high in well differentiated enterocytes (∼91.5%). The expression of homeobox gene Cdx1 increased 18-fold in small intestine <i>in vivo</i> during the same time course when apoB mRNA editing increased from ∼2 to ∼90%. The overexpression of Cdx1 in IEC-6 cells increased apoB mRNA editing over 10-fold compared with the vector control. This increase was associated with a significant increase of activating factor ACF, a component of the apoB mRNA editing complex. Taken together, these data suggest that the developmental regulation of apoB mRNA editing is an autonomous cytodifferentiation function of small intestine for which homeobox gene Cdx1 may play an important role."
https://openalex.org/W2020870806,"9-O-Acetylation is a common sialic acid modification, expressed in a developmentally regulated and tissue/cell type-specific manner. The relevant 9-O-acetyltransferase(s) have not been isolated or cloned; nor have mechanisms for their regulation been elucidated. We previously showed that transfection of the GD3 synthase (ST8Sia-I) gene into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells gave expression of not only the disialoganglioside GD3 but also 9-O-acetyl-GD3. We now use differential display PCR between wild type CHO-K1 cells and clones stably expressing GD3 synthase (CHO-GD3 cells) to detect any increased expression of other genes and explore the possible induction of a 9-O-acetyltransferase. The four CHO mRNAs showing major up-regulation were homologous to VCAM-1, Tis21, the KC-protein-like protein, and a functionally unknown type II transmembrane protein. A moderate increase in expression of the FxC1 and SPR-1 genes was also seen. Interestingly, these are different from genes observed by others to be up-regulated after transfection of GD3 synthase into a neuroblastoma cell line. We also isolated a CHO-GD3 mutant lacking 9-O-acetyl-GD3 following chemical mutagenesis (CHO-GD3-OAc−). Analysis of the above differential display PCR-derived genes in these cells showed that expression of Tis21 was selectively reduced. Transfection of a mouseTis21 cDNA into the CHO-GD3-OAc− mutant cells restored 9-O-acetyl-GD3 expression. Since the only major gangliosides expressed by CHO-GD3 cells are GD3 and 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (in addition to GM3, the predominant ganglioside type in wild-type CHO-K1 cells), we conclude that GD3 enhances its own 9-O-acetylation via induction of Tis21. This is the first known nuclear inducible factor for 9-O-acetylation and also the first proof that 9-O-acetylation can be directly regulated by GD3 synthase. Finally, transfection of CHO-GD3-OAc− mutant cells with ST6Gal-I induced 9-O-acetylation specifically on sialylatedN-glycans, in a manner similar to wild-type cells. This indicates separate machineries for 9-O-acetylation on α2–8-linked sialic acids of gangliosides and on α2–6-linked sialic acids on N-glycans. 9-O-Acetylation is a common sialic acid modification, expressed in a developmentally regulated and tissue/cell type-specific manner.

Ganglioside nomenclature is based on the system of Svennerholm (95Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Google Scholar) Sialic acids are a family of 9-carbon carboxylated monosaccharides typically located at the termini of mammalian cell surface sugar chains on both glycoproteins and glycolipids. N-acetylneuraminic acid, the most common sialic acid, is subjected to various modifications in vivo (1Schauer R. Cell Biol. Monogr. 1982; : 10Google Scholar, 2Varki A.

Rev. 2002; 102: 439-470Google Scholar). One of the most prevalent modifications is O-acetylation of the hydroxyl group at the 9-carbon position. This modification is known to reduce or abolish the recognition of sialic acid residues by sialidases (2Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Google Scholar, 4Varki A.

These findings indicate diverse physiological and pathological roles for 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid residues. O-Acetyl groups can be added to the 7- and/or 9-position of sialic acids, with the former migrating to the 9-position, either spontaneously under physiological conditions (21Varki A. Diaz S. Anal.

In the previous studies, we and others showed that 9(7)-O-acetylation is an acetyl-CoA-dependent enzymatic reaction (24Schauer R. Wember M. Hoppe-Seyler's Z Physiol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1691-1707Google Scholar) and is presumably catalyzed by a sialic acid-specific 9(7)-O-acetyltransferase. Available evidence also suggests that there are multiple distinct O-acetyltransferases responsible for O-acetylating sialic acids attached to glycans in different linkages and possibly for different classes of glycan chains. For example, transfection of a cDNA encoding CMP-Sia:Galβ1–4GlcNAc α2–6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal-I)1 into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (which normally express only α2–3-linked sialic acids) induced the expression of 9-O-acetyl groups only on the newly appearing α2–6-linked sialic acids of N-glycans (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). Likewise, transfection of GD3 synthase (CMP-Sia:GM3 α2–8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia-I)) into CHO-K1 cells resulted in generation of 9-O-acetyl groups only on α2–8-linked sialic acids of the newly synthesized disialoganglioside GD3 (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). In contrast, no 9-O-acetyl sialic acids were detected upon transfection of CMP-Sia:Galβ1–3(4)GlcNAc α2–3 sialyltransferase into CHO-K1 cells (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). On the other hand, regulated 9-O-acetylation on murine erythroleukemia cells and on murine T cells appears to be on mucin-like molecules, presumably carried on O-glycans (32Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31517-31525Google Scholar, 33Krishna M. Varki A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1997-2013Google Scholar). Many groups have attempted to isolate or clone the 9-O-acetyltransferases responsible for these phenomena, with no success so far. The 9-O-acetyltransferase activity in most systems is very sensitive to solubilization, and thus, direct purification has proven difficult (27Butor C. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10197-10206Google Scholar, 28Shen Y. Tiralongo J. Iwersen M. Sipos B. Kalthoff H. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 307-317Google Scholar, 34Diaz S. Higa H.H. Hayes B.K. Varki A. J.

A. 1997; 94: 2897-2902Google Scholar, 37Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 199-205Google Scholar). However, whereas several candidate genes were isolated, neither a 9-O-acetyltransferase nor a biologically significant inducer for 9-O-acetylation was eventually defined. This suggests that the 9-O-acetyltransferase could be a complex of multiple gene products, not amenable to standard expression cloning. This would fit with our proposal in rat liver Golgi that the acetyl group is transferred to luminal sialic acids via a transmembrane acetyl transfer reaction (26Higa H.H. Butor C. Diaz S. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19427-19434Google Scholar, 34Diaz S. Higa H.H. Hayes B.K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19416-19426Google Scholar). The induction of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid by transfection of ST8Sia-I (GD3 synthase) into wild CHO-K1 cells described above can be explained either by the up-regulation of the 9-O-acetyltransferase gene in the presence of this sialyltransferase or by the preexisting expression of an α2–8 linkage-specific 9-O-acetyltransferase gene in CHO-K1 cells. If the former is true, analysis of gene expression differences between wild-type CHO-K1 and sialyltransferase gene-transfected CHO cells offers the possibility of detecting the putative 9-O-acetyltransferase gene and/or biologically significant inducers of 9-O-acetylation. We have therefore performed differential display PCR (DD-PCR) between wild type CHO-K1 cells and CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with ST8Sia-I (CHO-GD3 cells). In doing so, we also intended to detect other interesting genes up-regulated by the expression of ST8Sia-I. Such genes might be of interest regarding the induction of 9-O-acetylation or the involvement of GD3 and/or GD3 synthase in biological functions such as differentiation, tissue organization, and regeneration (38Varki A.

Using this approach and a 9-O-acetyl-GD3-deficient CHO-GD3 mutant cell (CHO-GD3-OAc−), we present evidence for a novel pathway in which GD3 induces its own 9-O-acetylation via up-regulation of Tis21, a member of an antiproliferative protein family. Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Fisher or Sigma, and all oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL61). All CHO cell lines were grown under 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The mouse IgG3 anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody R24 (57Pukel C.S. Lloyd K.O. Travassos L.R. Dippold W.G. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 1133-1147Google Scholar) was purified from hybridoma supernatant using Protein A-Sepharose as previously described (58Chammas R. Sonnenburg J.L. Watson N.E. Tai T. Farquhar M.G. Varki N.M. Varki A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1337-1346Google Scholar). Biotinylated R24 was generated by incubating 20 μg of the antibody with 4 μg of EZ-link sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in 0.1m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline to remove the excess reagent. The mouse IgG3 anti-9-O-acetyl-GD3 monoclonal antibody 27A (59Reivinen J. Holther H. Miettinen A. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 624-631Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego) and was used as hybridoma supernatant, or it was purified from supernatant using Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. FITC-conjugated 27A was generated using a Fluorotag FITC Conjugation Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. A recombinant soluble chimera of influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (CHE-Fc) (60Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Google Scholar) was produced by stably transfected HEK-293 cells. These cells were also adapted to a protein-free medium, CHO-S-SFM II, and generously provided by Dr. Pascal Crottet (University of Basel) (61Dumermuth E. Beuret N. Spiess M. Crottet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18687-18693Google Scholar). CHE-FcD, the esterase-inactive form of CHE-Fc (60Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Google Scholar), was prepared by treatment with diisopropyl fluorophosphate as previously described (60Klein A. Krishna M. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7782-7786Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected and concentrated to 4 μg/ml protein concentration. For each staining, 150 μl of CHE-FcD-containing medium was precomplexed with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IgG1 at a 1:15 dilution (preoptimized for this batch of antibody) in the dark for 2 h at 4 °C. The antibodies were then preabsorbed with CHO-K1 wild type cells to eliminate nonspecific cell surface binding. Samples were stained with these preabsorbed CHE-FcD preparations for 2 h at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD22-Fc, the soluble chimera of the extracellular domain of CD22 fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain, was purified and used at 5 μg/ml concentration for cell staining, as previously described (62Brinkman-Van der Linden E.C.M. Sjoberg E.R. Juneja L.R. Crocker P.R. Varki N. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8633-8640Google Scholar). The expression vector carrying ST8Sia-I for transient transfection has been reported (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). Stable expression of the same cDNA was obtained by transfecting a pcDNA3-based construct into parental CHO-K1 cells using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and selected with G418. After 68 h, cells were stained with antibody 27A as described below, and individual positive cells were sorted into 96-well plates by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACStar unit (Becton Dickinson). The levels of 9-O-acetyl-GD3 expression of individual clones were analyzed by flow-cytometric analysis as described below. One clone that showed high and stable expression of 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (named CHO-GD3) was used for further experiments. The cloned CHO-GD3 cell line (stably transfected with ST8Sia-I) was incubated in α-minimum essential medium containing 450 μg/ml ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS; Sigma) for 16 h in a 37 °C incubator. The concentration of EMS was determined in pilot experiments in which the frequency of ouabain resistance was monitored, exactly as previously described (63Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover for 72 h in regular medium. Mutagenized cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated 27A antibody and with biotinylated R24 antibody followed by streptavidin-Cychrome (Pharmingen). Cells that stained positive for R24 and negative for 27A were isolated on a FACStar unit (Becton Dickinson). Individual clones were analyzed by flow cytometry as described below. One clone that showed stable GD3 expression (R24-positive) without detectable 9-O-acetylation (27A-negative) was expanded and named CHO-GD3-OAc−. Total RNA was extracted from CHO-K1 wild type and CHO-GD3, respectively, using RNeasy minikits (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT11N) (where N represents A, C, or G) reverse primers (Genhunter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant first strand cDNA was amplified by PCR using 240 primer pairs of 80 arbitrary forward primers and three oligo(dT11N) primer sets (where N represents A, C, or G; Genhunter) and Amplitaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were labeled by [33P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) contained in the PCR mixture. The 33P-labeled PCR products were resolved on 6% acrylamide gels followed by extraction of the products that were specifically enhanced in CHO-GD3 cells. The isolated products were subcloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands using M13 primers and an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of CHO-K1 wild type, CHO-GD3, and CHO-GD3-OAc− using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Amplitaq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and gene-specific primers for each DD-PCR product. In addition, the expression of the Chinese hamster isopentenyl-diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase gene (GenBankTM accession number AF003836) was employed as a control. The RT-PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. A mouse Tis21 open reading frame was prepared by PCR from a mouse 5′-expressed sequence tag clone (accession number BG973699) using a forward primer (5′-CTGTAGAATTCGCCATGAGCCACGGGAAGAGAAC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCAGCTGGAGACGGCCATCACAT-3′). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI followed by ligation into a EcoRI/NotI site of an expression vector, pcDNA3.1myc-His A (Invitrogen). The sequence of the subcloned insert was confirmed by sequencing of PCR products obtained using T7 forward and BGH reverse primers. Mouse Tis21-containing pcDNA 3.1 plasmid or empty vector was transfected into CHO-GD3-OAc− using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. The cycle of transfection, 48-h incubation, and detachment from a culture plate was carried out three times, and re-expression of 9-O-acetyl-GD3 was monitored by flow cytometry using 27A. Human ST6Gal-I-containing pcDNA 3.1 plasmid or empty vector was transfected into wild-type, CHO-GD3, or CHO-GD3-OAc−mutant cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Cells were detached by EDTA solution (without trypsin treatment) and subjected to flow cytometric analysis using CHE-FcD to detect 9-O-acetyl groups. Various types of CHO cells (1 × 106) were trypsinized to expose gangliosides (or released with EDTA only when studying glycoproteins) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated with either R24 antibody (for detecting GD3), 27A antibody (for detecting 9-O-acetyl-GD3), CD22-Fc (for detecting α2–6-linked sialic acids without 9-O-acetylation), or CHE-FcD (for detecting 9-O-acetyl sialic acids). The reagents were either precomplexed or complexed in situ with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody as previously described. After final washing, the fluorescent intensity on the cell surface was observed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument. Wild type CHO cells express predominantly the monosialoganglioside GM3 (64Weis F.M.B. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12059-12066Google Scholar, 65Lutz M.S. Jaskiewicz E. Darling D.S.

A. 1994; 91: 2708-2712Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we prepared CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with GD3 synthase (ST8Sia-I) (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). This cell population expressed not only disialoganglioside GD3 but also 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (detected with monoclonal antibodies R24 and 27A, respectively), neither of which are found in the wild type cells (31Shi W.X. Chammas R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15130-15138Google Scholar). During continuous culture, we noticed that this population of cells expressed varying levels of GD3 and 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (data not shown). We therefore used FACS to isolate clones with consistently high expression of GD3 and 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (see example in Fig. 1). As expected, stable clones expressing GD3 synthase (called CHO-GD3) expressed primarily GD3, as determined by a resorcinol stain of high performance thin-layer chromatography-separated total gangliosides (not shown), with smaller amounts of 9-O-acetyl-GD3 (also detected in the total lipid fraction of cells labeled with [3H]galactose and studied by autoradiography; data not shown). Although the CHO-GD3 cells express 9-O-acetyl-GD3, neither these cells nor the wild-type CHO-K1 cells express 9-O-acetyl GM3. Thus, a GD3-specific 9-O-acetyltransferase must either preexist in wild-type CHO-K1 cells or be secondarily induced by the presence of GD3. (Since GD3 synthase is a Golgi-localized protein with a short cytoplasmic tail, it is unlikely that such induction is a direct effect of the synthase protein itself.) To explore these possibilities as well as to evaluate the effects of GD3 and 9-O-acetyl-GD3 on the expression of other genes, we performed DD-PCR between RNA preparations from CHO-K1 wild type and CHO-GD3 cells using 80 arbitrary primers and three oligo(dT11N) (where N represents A, C, or G) primers. To minimize artifacts and false positive bands, DD-PCR using all primer pairs was repeated three times. Six DD-PCR products that consistently showed differentially enhanced expression in CHO-GD3 cells were finally obtained. These products were extracted, reamplified, subcloned, and sequenced. We designated them as 19C, 26C, 38G, 44G, 64C, and 66G, according to the numbering of the arbitrary primers and oligo(dT11N) reverse primer sets originally used for detection of each. To confirm that message expression of these DD-PCR products was actually enhanced or induced in CHO-GD3, we performed RT-PCR using gene-specific primers for each product. As shown in Fig.2 A, 19C, 38G, 64C, and 66G were expressed in CHO-GD3 much more abundantly than in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Expression of the other two products, 26C and 44G, was also increased in CHO-GD3 cells (Fig. 2 A). These results confirm that expression of all six mRNAs is up-regulated by stable transfection of the GD3 synthase gene. Similar data were obtained by comparative RT-PCR between wild-type cells and another CHO-GD3 clone, as well as with wild-type cells transiently transfected with GD3 synthase (Fig. 2 B). These results confirmed the consistent enhancement of expression of these genes by the presence of GD3. Nucleotide sequence analysis followed by BLAST homology searching of the NCBI data bases revealed similarities of each of the hamster DD-PCR products with other previously reported genes (see summary in TableI). Product 19C was most similar to the mouse Tis21/Btg2/PC3/APRO-1 gene (accession number M64292), which is a member of an anti-proliferative protein family (hereafter called the Tis21 gene) (67Fletcher B.S. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Kujubu D.A. Koski R.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14511-14518Google Scholar). The 64C sequence showed homology with mouse vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; accession number X67783) (68Araki M. Araki K. Vassalli P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 261-264Google Scholar). The 38G sequence was found to be homologous to a small type II transmembrane protein of unknown function (accession number AB015632) (69Yokoyama-Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi T. Sekine S. Kato S. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 161-167Google Scholar). The 66G sequence is similar to a rat KC protein-like protein gen"
https://openalex.org/W2024679398,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors are potent activators of T lymphocytes, most likely by affecting the early steps of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We have analyzed the effect of the PTP inhibitor bisperoxovanadium (bpV) on expression of the human cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) gene, which is induced following TCR triggering. Here we show that COX-2 promoter activity is markedly up-regulated following exposure of Jurkat T cells to bpV(pic). Interestingly enough, treatment of Jurkat cells with cyclic AMP-elevating agents such as forskolin, in combination with bpV, resulted in a more important COX-2 transcriptional activation. Such activation is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A. The two nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding sites located within the COX-2 promoter region are involved in bpV-mediated positive effect on COX-2 promoter. Electromobility shift assays showed that NFAT1 and activator protein-1 are both translocated to the nucleus following bpV treatment. The active participation of p56lck, ZAP-70, p36LAT, and calcium in the bpV-dependent signaling cascade leading to COX-2 transcriptional activation was demonstrated using deficient cell lines and specific inhibitors. Although several PTPs are most likely targeted by bpV, our data suggest that the bpV-mediated signaling cascade is initiated by inhibition of SHP-1, which leads to phosphorylation of p56lck and ZAP-70 and, ultimately, to NFAT and activator protein-1 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that PTP inhibitors can activate COX-2 gene expression in a manner very similar to the stimulation induced by TCR triggering.

These potent lipid molecules play key roles in the inflammatory response, and inhibition of their synthesis is the target of most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prostaglandin biosynthesis is controlled by the cyclooxygenase (COX)1 enzyme, which catalyzes the initial conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, a precursor common to all prostanoids. Two COX isoenzymes are expressed in mammalian tissues, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues, whereas COX-2 is induced by various pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitogenic agents in different cell types and is thought to be responsible for the increased production of prostaglandins in inflammatory disorders (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). COX-2 synthesis is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level via distinct pathways in various cell types (including vascular endothelial cells, epithelial cells, pancreatic cells, mast cells, and monocytes) and involves transcription factors such as nuclear factor of κ chain in B cells (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (2Caivano M.

One of the earliest events following TCR-mediated T cell activation is an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins such as cell surface receptors, adapter proteins, and kinases (14Qian D.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The intracellular phosphotyrosine content is tightly regulated by a complex balance between protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities. The importance of PTP in T cell response has been demonstrated by studies using specific PTP inhibitors that reported an increase of T cell activation by these compounds (16Secrist J.P. Burns L.A.

A panoply of second messengers such as p56lck, p59fyn, ZAP-70, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade are induced following treatment of lymphocytes with PTP inhibitors such as pervanadate (17Imbert V.

These observations, along with the previously reported implication of NF-κB and NFAT in the control of COX-2 expression and the pivotal function of COX-2 in T cell activation, led us to scrutinize the effect of bpV molecules on the transcriptional induction of COX-2 isoenzyme. In this study, we show that bpV compounds strongly activate COX-2 promoter transcription in human T cells. The bpV-mediated activating effect on COX-2 requires calcineurin and two transcription factors, i.e. NFAT and AP-1. The lymphoid T cell lines used in this work include Jurkat (clone E6.1), JCAM1.6, JCAM2, and J.RT3-T3.5.

The polyclonal anti-NFATc (NFAT2) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were electroporated using a gene pulser I apparatus (Bio-Rad) (960 microfarad, 250 V) at room temperature. Cells were concentrated at 37.5 × 106 per ml of complete culture medium. Cells (400-μl aliquots) were electroporated with either 5 μg of the reporter construct DNA alone or, in the case of reconstitution experiments, with 5 μg of reporter construct DNA and 0, 5, or 15 μg of the expression plasmid. The total DNA amount for the reconstitution experiments was maintained constant at 20 μg using the empty vector. To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies, cells were transfected in bulk and were separated at 36 h post-transfection into various treatments groups at a density of 105cells/well (100 μl) in 96-well flat-bottom plates. For studies using pharmacological inhibitors, cells were resuspended in fresh cell culture medium (1 × 106 cells/ml) and were treated for 60 min with subcytotoxic and subcytostatic concentrations of cyclosporin A (1 to 100 ng/ml) (Fujisawa, Osaka, Japan), FK506 (1 to 10 ng/ml) (Sigma), TMB-8 (Sigma) (25 to 100 μm), or piceatannol (Biomol) (0.1 to 50 μm) before addition of bpV(pic). Cells were either left untreated or were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 20 ng/ml (Sigma) alone or in combination with ionomycin at 1 μm (Sigma) or with various concentration of bpV(pic) (Alexis Biochemical), used either alone or in combination with 10 μm forskolin (Cedarlane) in a final volume of 200 μl. Next, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h unless otherwise specified. Luciferase activity was determined following a previously described protocol (20Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). -Fold induction was obtained by calculating the ratio between measured relative light units of treated over untreated samples. Results shown are the mean ± S.D. of four determinations and are representative of three different experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a previously described protocol (20Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated or treated cells (5 × 106) were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (Buffer A) (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept for 15 min on ice before lysis with 25 μl of Nonidet P-40 10%. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended with an hypertonic buffer (Buffer B) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by gentle agitation for 15 min. The solution was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by BCA assay (Pierce) and stored at −85 °C until use. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4% glycerol, 1% Ficoll, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V) containing 0.8 ng of [γ-32P]-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. The following double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were used as probes and/or competitors: the distal NFAT binding site of the human COX-2 promoter (nucleotides −117 to −191), 5′-tcgaCAAGGGGAGAGGAGGGAAAAATTTGTGGC-3′; the NFAT/AP-1 proximal site of the COX-2 promoter (nucleotides −82 to −58), 5′-tcgaCAAAAGGCGGAAAGAAACAGTCATTTC-3′; the distal NFAT binding site from the murine interleukin-2 promoter, 5′-TCGAGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATG-3′; the consensus NF-κB binding site, 5′-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; and the consensus binding site for Oct-2A (used for nonspecific competition). DNA-protein complexes were resolved from free-labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed on an Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax MR film at −85 °C. Cold competition assays were conducted by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide simultaneously with the labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of nuclear extracts with 1 μl of the appropriate antibody in the presence of all of the components of the binding reaction for 30 min on ice before addition of the labeled probe. To assess whether PTP inhibitors can modulate the human COX-2 gene promoter activity, we performed reporter assays using various COX-2 promoter-based constructs. The P2–1900 construct, which comprises a region spanning from −1796 to +104 bp of the human COX-2 gene placed in front of the luciferase reporter gene (3Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was transiently transfected in Jurkat cells. As reported previously (3Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), treatment of Jurkat cells with the PMA/ionomycin combination led to an increase in COX-2 promoter-driven reporter gene activity (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, treatment with the PTP inhibitor bpV(pic) at 20 μm induced an even stronger activation of COX-2 promoter. A greater bpV-mediated induction of COX-2 activity (i.e. 70-fold increase) was observed with P2–274 (Fig. 1 B), a molecular construct that comprises the promoter region spanning from −170 to +104. This suggests that the upstream region contains negative regulation elements. Dose-response and time course experiments indicated that the highest transcriptional induction was achieved following an 8-h incubation time period with 20 μm bpV(pic) (Fig. 1, B and C). Altogether these data suggest that inhibition of PTP activity triggers COX-2 promoter activity in human T cells. We have demonstrated previously (20Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Fortin J.F. Barbeau B. Robichaud G.A. Pare M.-È. Lemieux A.M. Tremblay M.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that bpV compounds can induce both calcineurin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways in T cells. To elucidate the signal transduction pathway(s) involved in bpV-mediated COX-2 transcriptional activation, we used the immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and CsA. Jurkat cells were first transiently transfected with P2–274 and next pretreated with increasing amounts of FK506 or CsA before activation by bpV(pic). As depicted in Fig. 2, treatment with both calcineurin inhibitors resulted in an almost complete inhibition of COX-2 transcriptional activation. Similar observations were made when using the P2–1900 COX-2 promoter construct (data not shown). No detectable cell toxicity was observed upon cell incubation with these inhibitors at the tested concentrations (data not shown). These results demonstrate that COX-2 transcriptional activation by bpV occurs through a pathway that relies on calcineurin activity. We next wanted to identify the precise cis-acting regions required for the inducibility of the COX-2 promoter region to the bpV(pic) compound. To this end, we first used several 5′ deletion constructs that were created from the P2–274 vector (Fig. 3 A). A deletion of 83 bp (i.e. P2–192 vector) resulted in a 60% decrease in the inducibility by bpV(pic) (Fig. 3 B). A supplementary deletion of 42 bp (i.e. P2–150 vector) decreased transcriptional activity by an additional 50%, leaving only a 20% residual activation. These results suggest that regions spanning from −170 to −88 and −88 to −46 bp relative to the transcription start site of the human COX-2 gene include sequences responsible for the bpV-mediated positive effect on COX-2 gene. These regions contain a binding site for C/EBP, a CRE, and two NFAT binding sites, one of which contains an adjacent AP-1 motif (i.e. pNFAT) (Fig.3 A). Given that the two NFAT elements have been shown to be crucial for COX-2 transcriptional activation by PMA and ionomycin (3Iniguez M.A. Martinez-Martinez S. Punzon C. Redondo J.M. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23627-23635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and treatment of human T cells with bpV molecules resulted in induction of NFAT (21Fortin J.F. Barbeau B. Robichaud G.A. Pare M.-È. Lemieux A.M. Tremblay M.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we next tested the importance of NFAT binding sites in the noticed bpV-induced COX-2 activation. To this end, we used constructs bearing mutations destroying proximal (pNFAT-mut) or distal (dNFAT-mut) NFAT sites. Transfection of Jurkat cells with the P2–274 vector bearing either COX-2 dNFAT or pNFAT mutated sites resulted in a 40 to 50% diminution in the responsiveness to bpV(pic) (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, data obtained with dNFAT-mut were comparable with results seen when using the P2–192 deletion mutant, which lacks the entire dNFAT binding site. The inducibility by bpV(pic) was even further diminished when cells were transiently transfected with a P2–192-based construct carrying mutations in the remaining pNFAT site (i.e. P2–192 pNFAT-mut vector). These data support the idea that NFAT plays a crucial role in bpV-mediated transcriptional induction of the human COX-2 gene in human T cells. The COX-2 pNFAT element contains an adjacent AP-1-like binding site that is destroyed in pNFAT mutant. Thus, to establish the possible implication of the AP-1 transcription factor and to further incriminate the participation of NFAT in the observed phenomenon, we performed electromobility shift assays with nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells using DNA probes specific for the distal or the proximal NFAT elements. Two specific retarded complexes were induced with different kinetics when using the proximal NFAT probe (Fig.4 A). The intensity of complex I was maximal at 270 min whereas complex II reached a peak after only 30 min of bpV treatment. A single retarded complex, i.e.complex II, was seen when using the distal NFAT probe. Both complexes were efficiently competed away with 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled specific probe but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (i.e. Oct-2A). The intense, faster migrating band was considered as nonspecific, because it was not consistently competed away by an excess of specific oligonucleotide. Migrating complexes were further identified using specific competitions and supershift assays. Complex I was specifically competed away by an NFAT-specific oligonucleotide and also by an AP-1-specific sequence, but not by a control NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–4), suggesting that this complex contains both NFAT and AP-1 bound to their specific sites. Complex II was also specifically competed away by a NFAT-specific oligonucleotide, but not by either NF-κB- or AP-1-specific sequences, suggesting that NFAT is responsible for this complex (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–4). However, because this band was not completely competed away either by the consensus NFAT or by the distal NFAT sequences (lanes 2 and 5) but only by the pNFAT oligonucleotide, it is likely that the complex II represents a superimposition of a major NFAT complex and a minor AP-1 complex. Supershift assays indicated that NFAT1, but not NFAT2, was present in both the NFAT and NFAT·AP-1 complexes (lanes 8 and9). Incubation with a pan-NFAT antiserum prevented the formation of both the NFAT and the NFAT·AP-1 complexes (lane 10). Similar observations were made when the distal NFAT sequence was used as a probe (lanes 11–20), thus confirming that treatment of Jurkat cells with bpV molecules induces the binding of NFAT1 on both NFAT elements of the COX-2 promoter. Given that the COX-2 promoter contains a C/EBP binding site, we also assessed the importance of C/EBP transcription factors in bpV-dependent induction of the COX-2 promoter. The implication of the C/EBP family of transcription factors was assessed by using pCMV-LIP, a construct that encodes a truncated C/EBP protein that has only the DNA binding and leucine zipper domains and possesses a dominant negative function (28Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of this expression vector, along with P2–274, had no effect on bpV-induced reporter gene expression (Fig.5), thus ruling out any implication of C/EBP in COX-2 transcriptional regulation by the PTP inhibitor bpV(pic). Because the CRE presents in the COX-2 promoter has been shown to be involved in COX-2 regulation in various cell types such as monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial and epithelial cells (6Subbaramaiah K.

When Jurkat cells were transfected with COX-2 promoter constructs and were treated with the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin (FSK), a very modest increase in transcriptional activity was observed (never more than 2-fold) (Fig. 6,panels A and B). However, when FSK was used with bpV(pic), this combination resulted in an induction of COX-2 activity that was superior to the one seen when bpV(pic) was used alone. This up-regulating effect was observed with both COX-2 molecular constructs,i.e. P2–1900 and P2–274. Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger that transmits information to several proteins including protein kinase A and a family of cAMP-responsive nuclear factors that bind to the CRE consensus sequence. Phosphorylation of these CREBs by the C subunit of protein kinase A modulates their overall activity. To assess the importance of CREB factors in COX-2 transcriptional activation, we used a dominant negative form of CREB named killer CREB (KCREB), which is unable to bind to CRE DNA sequence and blocks the binding of wild type CREB when present as a KCREB·CREB heterodimer. Jurkat cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of the KCREB expression vector, along with P2–274, and were next treated with bpV(pic) and/or FSK. The dominant negative CREB was found to severely decrease COX-2 transcriptional activation that is seen following treatment with bpV(pic) alone (Fig. 6 C). The enhancing effect of FSK was completely abolished in the presence of high concentrations of KCREB, therefore suggesting that the transactivating potential showed by FSK is mediated by CREB transcription factors.
