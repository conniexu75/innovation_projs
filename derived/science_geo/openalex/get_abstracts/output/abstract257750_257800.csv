https://openalex.org/W2114725617,"A broad spectrum of mutations in PTEN, encoding a lipid phosphatase that inactivates the P13-K/AKT pathway, is found associated with primary tumors. Some of these mutations occur outside the phosphatase domain, suggesting that additional activities of PTEN function in tumor suppression. We report a nuclear function for PTEN in controlling chromosomal integrity. Disruption of Pten leads to extensive centromere breakage and chromosomal translocations. PTEN was found localized at centromeres and physically associated with CENP-C, an integral component of the kinetochore. C-terminal PTEN mutants disrupt the association of PTEN with centromeres and cause centromeric instability. Furthermore, Pten null cells exhibit spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We show that PTEN acts on chromatin and regulates expression of Rad51, which reduces the incidence of spontaneous DSBs. Our results demonstrate that PTEN plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability through the physical interaction with centromeres and control of DNA repair. We propose that PTEN acts as a guardian of genome integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2095659495,"The PTEN tumor suppressor is frequently affected in cancer cells, and inherited PTEN mutation causes cancer-susceptibility conditions such as Cowden syndrome. PTEN acts as a plasma-membrane lipid-phosphatase antagonizing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT cell survival pathway. However, PTEN is also found in cell nuclei, but mechanism, function, and relevance of nuclear localization remain unclear. We show that nuclear PTEN is essential for tumor suppression and that PTEN nuclear import is mediated by its monoubiquitination. A lysine mutant of PTEN, K289E associated with Cowden syndrome, retains catalytic activity but fails to accumulate in nuclei of patient tissue due to an import defect. We identify this and another lysine residue as major monoubiquitination sites essential for PTEN import. While nuclear PTEN is stable, polyubiquitination leads to its degradation in the cytoplasm. Thus, we identify cancer-associated mutations of PTEN that target its posttranslational modification and demonstrate how a discrete molecular mechanism dictates tumor progression by differentiating between degradation and protection of PTEN."

https://openalex.org/W2099658407,"The tumor suppressor PTEN, a critical regulator for multiple cellular processes, is mutated or deleted frequently in various human cancers. Subtle reductions in PTEN expression levels have profound impacts on carcinogenesis. Here we show that PTEN level is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and purified its ubiquitin ligase as HECT-domain protein NEDD4-1. In cells NEDD4-1 negatively regulates PTEN stability by catalyzing PTEN polyubiquitination. Consistent with the tumor-suppressive role of PTEN, overexpression of NEDD4-1 potentiated cellular transformation. Strikingly, in a mouse cancer model and multiple human cancer samples where the genetic background of PTEN was normal but its protein levels were low, NEDD4-1 was highly expressed, suggesting that aberrant upregulation of NEDD4-1 can posttranslationally suppress PTEN in cancers. Elimination of NEDD4-1 expression inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth in a PTEN-dependent manner. Therefore, NEDD4-1 is a potential proto-oncogene that negatively regulates PTEN via ubiquitination, a paradigm analogous to that of Mdm2 and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2157012084,"Regulation of integrin affinity (activation) is essential for metazoan development and for many pathological processes. Binding of the talin phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic domains (tails) causes activation, whereas numerous other PTB-domain-containing proteins bind integrins without activating them. Here we define the structure of a complex between talin and the membrane-proximal integrin beta3 cytoplasmic domain and identify specific contacts between talin and the integrin tail required for activation. We used structure-based mutagenesis to engineer talin and beta3 variants that interact with comparable affinity to the wild-type proteins but inhibit integrin activation by competing with endogenous talin. These results reveal the structural basis of talin's unique ability to activate integrins, identify an interaction that could aid in the design of therapeutics to block integrin activation, and enable engineering of cells with defects in the activation of multiple classes of integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2069512527,"The assumption that the cells of the mammalian embryo are identical until they form into 'inside' and 'outside' cells was overturned by the recent discovery that cells in the mouse differ in cell fate from as early as the four-cell stage. An epigenetic (non-DNA coded) mechanism seemed likely, and that has now been shown to be the case. Differential epigenetic modification (arginine methylation) of histone H3 in the four-cell mouse blastomere changes the fate of embryo cells and can maintain a cell in a pluripotent state. It has been generally accepted that the mammalian embryo starts its development with all cells identical, and only when inside and outside cells form do differences between cells first emerge. However, recent findings show that cells in the mouse embryo can differ in their developmental fate and potency as early as the four-cell stage1,2,3,4. These differences depend on the orientation and order of the cleavage divisions that generated them2,5. Because epigenetic marks are suggested to be involved in sustaining pluripotency6,7, we considered that such developmental properties might be achieved through epigenetic mechanisms. Here we show that modification of histone H3, through the methylation of specific arginine residues, is correlated with cell fate and potency. Levels of H3 methylation at specific arginine residues are maximal in four-cell blastomeres that will contribute to the inner cell mass (ICM) and polar trophectoderm and undertake full development when combined together in chimaeras. Arginine methylation of H3 is minimal in cells whose progeny contributes more to the mural trophectoderm and that show compromised development when combined in chimaeras. This suggests that higher levels of H3 arginine methylation predispose blastomeres to contribute to the pluripotent cells of the ICM. We confirm this prediction by overexpressing the H3-specific arginine methyltransferase CARM1 in individual blastomeres and show that this directs their progeny to the ICM and results in a dramatic upregulation of Nanog and Sox2. Thus, our results identify specific histone modifications as the earliest known epigenetic marker contributing to development of ICM and show that manipulation of epigenetic information influences cell fate determination."

This study demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in the mouse as a means to discover the basis of human neurodevelopmental disorders. IntroductionThe development of the mammalian brain depends on extensive neuronal migration resulting in the formation of a number of highly laminar structures, most notably the cortex and hippocampus. This process involves a large number of neurons that originate in the proliferative ventricular zones and migrate radially to their final locations past previously formed neurons (Gupta et al., 2002Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Life is a journey: a genetic look at neocortical development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in mice and humans have identified some of the molecular determinants of neuronal migration: mutations in doublecortin (DCX) (des Portes et al., 1998des Portes V. Pinard J.M.

Truwit C.L. Lissencephaly and other malformations of cortical development: 1995 update.Neuropediatrics. 1995; 26: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In females, mutations in DCX can also cause subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH), in which an additional layer of misplaced heterotopic neurons is found in the white matter. Perturbations of the laminar architecture of the cortex also result from mutations in the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) (Boycott et al., 2005Boycott K.M. Flavelle S. Bureau A. Glass H.C. Fujiwara T.M. Wirrell E. Davey K. Chudley A.E. Scott J.N. McLeod D.R. Parboosingh J.S.

Genet. 2000; 26: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Together, mutations in DCX, LIS1, VLDLR, and reelin are responsible for ∼70% of the cases of type 1 lissencephaly. The pathogenic mutations responsible for the remaining cases are unknown (Leventer, 2005Leventer R.J.

Child Neurol. 2005; 20: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Impaired neuronal migration affects behavior as well as brain structure. Humans with lissencephaly are mentally retarded and frequently suffer from epilepsy (Francis et al., 2006Francis F. Meyer G. Fallet-Bianco C. Moreno S. Kappeler C. Socorro A.C. Tuy F.P. Beldjord C.

Similarly, the reeler mouse mutant and mice with loss of function mutations in Dcx and Lis1 exhibit varying degrees of cognitive dysfunction (Corbo et al., 2002Corbo J.C. Deuel T.A. Long J.M. LaPorte P. Tsai E. Wynshaw-Boris A. Walsh C.A. Doublecortin is required in mice for lamination of the hippocampus but not the neocortex.J.

Mice with mutations that cause behavioral abnormalities are currently being identified as part of a large-scale mutagenesis screen in the UK (Nolan et al., 2000Nolan P.M. Peters J. Strivens M. Rogers D. Hagan J. Spurr N. Gray I.C. Vizor L. Brooker D. Whitehill E. et al.A systematic, genome-wide, phenotype-driven mutagenesis programme for gene function studies in the mouse.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In this dominant screen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is injected into the peritoneum of BALB/cAnN male mice and causes random mutations in spermatogonia. Mutagenized males are mated with C3H/HeH females and their offspring assessed for variation in locomotor activity. Here we describe a hyperactive ENU-induced mouse mutant with cortical and hippocampal abnormalities due to impaired neuronal migration. We show that mutations in the human homolog of this gene cause cortical brain malformations, including lissencephaly.ResultsIdentification and Mapping of a Novel Behavioral MutantWe screened 9216 mice from the Harwell ENU mutagenesis program. The total distance each mouse travelled in 35 min was assessed. Mice with levels of activity more than three standard deviations outside the mean were retested 7 days later (n = 87) (Figure 1A). We excluded mice with abnormal vestibular, skeletal, or neuromuscular phenotypes that might also influence locomotor behavior. Ten outliers were subject to heritability testing by backcrossing to C3H/HeH. A single line that we named Jenna (Jna) was identified with a semidominant hyperactive phenotype.We mapped variation in locomotor activity to the distal end of chromosome 15 by treating the phenotype quantitatively and applying standard methods for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (Zeng, 1994Zeng Z.B. Precision mapping of quantitative trait loci.Genetics. 1994; 136: 1457-1468PubMed Google Scholar). To generate sufficient animals to map the mutation, we employed in vitro fertilization, raising a total of 89 animals on a C3H/HeH background. We attempted to intercross hyperactive animals but failed to generate any pregnancies.We identified a QTL on chromosome 15 with a logP (negative logarithm of the P value, base 10) of 12.6. This was the only locus that exceeded the genome-wide 5% significance threshold of logP 4.1 (Churchill and Doerge, 1994Churchill G.A. Doerge R.W. Empirical threshold values for quantitative trait mapping.Genetics. 1994; 138: 963-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No other loci were detected with a logP greater than 2.0. The presence of a relatively large QTL segregating on chromosome 15 suggested that we had mapped the causative mutation (Figure 1B), but we could not exclude the possibility that the genetic effect arose from a naturally occurring polymorphism between BALB/cAnN and C3H/HeH.We reasoned that the presence of pleiotropy would distinguish the effect of the ENU-induced mutation from a naturally occurring polymorphism. Unlike the latter, engineered and induced mutations with an effect on behavior frequently display additional phenotypic abnormalities. We found that mice from the mapping population could be divided into two groups by variation in weight and activity, the smaller mice exhibiting higher levels of activity (Figure 1C). We then fine-mapped the mutation to a 1.3 Mb region between D15Mit43 and a single nucleotide polymorphism rs32344030 (Figure 1D). This region contains 41 annotated genes (http://www.ensembl.org).The coding and exon-flanking sequences of all 41 genes was sequenced in affected animals (n = 4), a wild-type control, and the two mapping strains, C3H/HeH and BALB/cAnN. All the variants identified were present in the two mapping strains, except for a T to C transition in exon 4 of α-1 tubulin (Tuba1) (Figure 1E). We sequenced exon 4 of α-1 tubulin from the inbred strains AKR/J, A/J, C57BL6/J, RIII, DBA/2J, IS, FVB, and 129 and did not observe this polymorphism.We extracted whole brain mRNA from Jna/+ animals, sequenced the cDNA, and confirmed the presence of the mutation in the brain Tuba1 transcript. The mutation causes an amino acid change from serine to glycine at residue 140 (S140G). This amino acid is located in the T4 loop of Tuba1, forming part of the N-site, a highly conserved glycine-rich motif that binds GTP (Lowe et al., 2001Lowe J. Li H. Downing K.H. Nogales E. Refined structure of alpha beta-tubulin at 3.5 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) (Figures 1F and 7B). GTP bound at the N site does not undergo hydrolysis and is thought to act as a structural cofactor stabilizing the α/β heterodimer (Spiegelman et al., 1977Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Turnover of tubulin and the N site GTP in Chinese hamster ovary cells.Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The S140G Mutation Reduces GTP Binding and Native Heterodimer FormationWe hypothesized that the S140G mutation might affect the ability of Tuba1 to bind GTP at the N site. We therefore conducted in vitro folding assays containing α-32P-GTP. Equal amounts of urea-unfolded wild-type or mutant Tuba1 probes, quantitated by Coomassie blue staining, were introduced by sudden dilution into a buffer containing ATP, radio-labeled GTP, and cytosolic chaperonin (CCT). CCT is the first chaperone required in a cascade of interacting proteins that act in concert to facilitate the formation of native tubulin heterodimers (Figure 2A) (Lewis et al., 1996Lewis S.A. Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Cowan N.J. Chaperonin-mediated folding of actin and tubulin.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CCT undergoes multiple rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with unfolded α-tubulin polypeptides, forming chaperonin bound quasi-native tubulin folding intermediates that contain a GTP binding pocket (Tian et al., 1995Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Tap W.D. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. Quasi-native chaperonin-bound intermediates in facilitated protein folding.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23910-23913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Figure 2Tuba1 S140G Has a Reduced Ability to Incorporate GTP, Resulting in a Marked Decline in the Efficiency of Tubulin Heterodimer FormationShow full caption(A) The tubulin heterodimer assembly pathway. Newly synthesized α/β-tubulin polypeptides undergo one or more rounds of ATP-dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin (CCT). Quasi-native intermediates formed as a result of this interaction are then captured and stabilized by a series of tubulin-specific chaperones termed TBCA–TBCE. α-tubulin intermediates interact with TBCB and TBCE, while β-tubulin intermediates interact with TBCA and TBCD. TBCEα (Eα) and TBCDβ (Dβ) together form a supercomplex. Entry of TBCC into this supercomplex triggers GTP hydrolysis by β-tubulin; this acts as a switch for the discharge of the newly assembled α/β heterodimer. This is based on Tian et al., 2006Tian G. Huang M.C. Parvari R. Diaz G.A. Cowan N.J. Cryptic out-of-frame translational initiation of TBCE rescues tubulin formation in compound heterozygous HRD.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We then assessed what effect this would have on native tubulin heterodimer formation. To do this, we repeated the assay, including the additional components required for de novo heterodimer formation. We found that the yield of labeled heterodimers was significantly less in reactions carried out with the mutant protein compared to the wild-type protein (Figure 2C).To show that the reduced incorporation of GTP in mutant heterodimers is reflected in a reduced yield of native dimerized protein, we repeated our in vitro folding experiments using mutant and wild-type unfolded 35S-methionine labeled Tuba1 probes. Consistent with the data obtained in our GTP labeling experiments, we found that the S140G mutation reduced the efficiency of de novo heterodimer formation under conditions where equal amounts of 35S-labeled protein were analyzed (Figure 2D). These data are not artifacts of in vitro reconstitution, because we observed the same reduced yield of tubulin heterodimers in parallel experiments in which the identical cloned sequences used for the generation of probes for in vitro folding experiments were translated in a cell free system from rabbit reticulocytes (Figures 2E and 2F). We then investigated whether the heterodimers produced in these in vitro experiments were able to polymerize. The products of the reactions shown in Figure 2D were mixed with depolymerized brain microtubules and taken through two successive cycles of polymerization/depolymerization. At the end of each cycle, an aliquot of the depolymerized material was removed and analyzed. While heterodimer formation was reduced in all our assays carried out with the S140G mutant, the ability of mutant heterodimers to cocycle with native tubulin in vitro was not affected (Figure 2G).Consistent with these data we found that a FLAG-tagged mutant Tuba1 incorporated into the normal interphase microtubule network upon overexperession in cultured cells (Figure 2H) and that these microtubules behaved in the same manner as their wild-type counterparts in a regrowth assay following depolymerization with nocodazole (Figure S1). These experiments demonstrate the ability of the S140G tubulin, once folded, to assemble into heterodimers that can copolymerize into dynamic microtubules in vivo. We conclude that the S140G mutation results in a diminished efficiency of polymerization-competent tubulin heterodimer formation as a result of a compromised GTP binding pocket. Our data indicate that the S140G substitution is a partial loss-of-function mutation, suggesting that the phenotype in Jna/+ mice is due to haploinsufficiency.Genetic Rescue of the Hyperactive Phenotype in Jna/+ MiceWe tested whether delivery of additional copies of α-1 tubulin by BAC transgenesis would rescue the phenotype in Jna/+ mice. We selected a BAC clone (RP23-3124H4) that contained the Tuba1 gene for this experiment. Purified BAC DNA was injected into the pronucleus of C3H/HeH embryos, and these embryos transferred into recipient females. Four transgenic lines were identified that carried the BAC (H2, H8, H17, and H41). We established germline transmission in two of these (H8 and H41). Quantitative PCR analysis of the transgene indicated that four copies of the clone had been incorporated into the H41 line and a single copy into the H8 line (data not shown). Behavioral analysis of the H41 line revealed no significant differences in measures of activity with control animals (F[1,16] < 1; P > 0.5), demonstrating that delivery of additional copies of Tuba1, by itself, has no effect on locomotor behavior (Figure 5A). The H41 line was selected for rescue and was crossed with Jna/+ mice. There was a significant reduction in the locomotor behavior of transgenic animals with the S140G mutation (Jna/+/BAC) in comparison to nontransgenic mutants (F[1,14] = 18.7; P < 0.005) and no significant difference from controls (F[1,16] = 1.2; P > 0.1) (Figure 5A).The S140G Mutation Results in Abnormal Hippocampal and Cortical Morphology in Jna/+ MiceWe undertook a complete histological examination of Jna/+ mice (n = 4). Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed no gross anatomical defects in somatic organs or tissues (data not shown). We focused on the neuroanatomical features of the Jna/+ mice. Brains from Jna/+ mice were smaller than wild-type (∼85%), but this is probably because mutant animals weigh ∼30% less than littermate controls. Examination of coronal sections of Jna/+ mice (n = 6), littermate controls (n = 6), and rescued brains (n = 6) from animals aged 8 weeks revealed abnormal lamination of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of mutant animals (Figures 3A–3I). Staining with cresyl violet and with the neuronal marker NeuN showed hippocampal disorganization with an additional layer of pyramidal cells in the stratum oriens that extended throughout the pyramidal cell subfields into the subiculum, which was most marked in the CA3 region where the neurons were loosely packed. The abnormality was also apparent in mutant animals aged 8 months (n = 3) (data not shown). Staining with calbindin revealed fewer calbindin-positive pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region and a disorganized mossy fiber tract extending from the dentate gyrus to CA3. No gross morphological abnormalities were apparent in the dentate gyrus of Jna/+ mice, the hilus appearing intact. There were no detectable abnormalities in the hippocampal morphology of Jna/+/BAC mice (Figures 3C, 3F, and 3I).Figure 3Abnormal Hippocampal and Cortical Morphology in Jna/+ MiceShow full caption(A–I) Coronal sections of the hippocampus from littermate controls, heterozygote (Jna/+) and rescued (Jna/+/BAC) animals aged 8 weeks when stained with cresyl violet (A–C), NeuN (D–F), and calbindin (G–I).

These stains showed that the laminar structure of the cortex is preserved; however, on closer examination of NeuN (Y–ZA) and Cux-1 (ZB–ZD) staining, wave-like perturbations in layers II/III and IV (arrowed) can be seen.

These experiments showed that the laminar cytoarchitecture of the cortex was intact in Jna/+ mice, but closer examination of NeuN, Cux-1, and Nissl stains revealed wave-like perturbations in layer IV (Figure 3, Y-ZA and ZB-ZD; Figure S2). While layer IV still consisted of the characteristic granular cells that were of similar size and shape to those observed in littermate controls, they were organized into three to four cellular fronts, each containing a single row of cells. This perturbation was evident in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices but was not observed in the motor or retrosplenial cortices (Figure S2). It was observed primarily in layer IV but extended into layers II/III in the posterior and dorsal medial regions of the cortex as revealed by Cux-1 staining. Jna/+/BAC mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice for all stains (Figure 3, L, O, R, U, and X). Analysis of Golgi- stained sections revealed no significant differences in the percentage of misorientated (θ > 8°) or inverted (θ > 90°) apical dendrites in the visual, somatosensory, or motor cortices between littermate controls (n = 3) and Jna/+ mice (n = 3) (Demyanenko et al., 2004Demyanenko G.P.

No anatomical abnormalities were seen in the cerebellum or amygdala (Figure S4).Defective Neuronal Migration in Jna/+ MiceWe considered whether abnormal radial migration might be responsible for the unusual hippocampal and cortical architecture observed in the Jna/+ mice. We injected pregnant females with BrdU at three time points (E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5) and counted labeled cells at the day of birth (P0), dividing the cortex into ten equal bins extending from the intermediate zone to the cortical surface (Figures 4A–4C). We tested for an interaction between genotype and the mean percentage of cells in each bin. There was no significant difference between littermate controls and Jna/+ mutants when BrdU was injected at E12.5 (F[9,189] < 1; P > 0.05), however there was a highly significant difference when injected at E14.5 (F[9,198] = 4.75; P < 0.0001), and at E16.5 (F[9,270] = 13.3; P < 0.0001). At these time points, a higher percentage of BrdU-positive cells are observed in bins 1, 2, and 3 in wild-type littermates. These results are consistent with our anatomical observations that showed perturbations in layers II/III and IV of the cortex, as the majority of cells that populate these layers are born between E14.5 and E16.5 (Takahashi et al., 1999Takahashi T.

Several layers of BrdU-positive cells could be seen, lacking structure when compared to wild-type littermates. The dentate gyrus, unlike the phenotype in the adult, also appeared chaotic, suggesting a delay in its development. This result, together with our analysis of BrdU staining in the cortex, is consistent with impaired radial migration in Jna/+ mice.Jna/+ Mice Show Impaired Spatial Working Memory, Reduced Anxiety, and Abnormal Nesting Consistent with a Hippocampal DeficitGiven the lamination defect in the hippocampus, we tested whether hippocampal-dependent behaviors are altered in Jna/+ mice (Deacon et al., 2002Deacon R.M.

A number of behaviors are known that require an intact hippocampus. Effects on memory are well documented, but lesions also result in increased activity, reduced anxiety, and disruption of a number of species-typical behaviors (Deacon et al., 2002Deacon R.M.

Although the current emphasis is on production of this valuable resource, there are significant efforts to facilitate program coordination, to enhance the availability of this resource, and to plan for future efforts in mouse genetics research. Three major mouse knockout programs are underway worldwide, working together to mutate all protein-encoding genes in the mouse using a combination of gene trapping and gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Although the current emphasis is on production of this valuable resource, there are significant efforts to facilitate program coordination, to enhance the availability of this resource, and to plan for future efforts in mouse genetics research. The rapid advances and scale up of projects in DNA sequencing during the past 15 years have produced complete genome sequences of dozens of species. The great challenge facing biologists today is to ascribe function to the thousands of genes discovered through these efforts. Answering this challenge requires description of the functions of each gene in normal physiology and development, as well as the contribution of mutant alleles to inherited diseases. One powerful approach to help decipher the functions of genes is the manipulation of genes in intact animals. The ability to perform gene knockouts in the laboratory mouse via ES cells has been a particularly successful research tool for nearly two decades, using two major methodologies: gene trapping and gene targeting (see Note for definitions). A survey of the Mouse Genome Informatics database (MGI; http://www.informatics.jax.org) and the International Gene Trap Consortium (IGTC; http://www.genetrap.org) reveals that nearly 4000 targeted knockouts of genes have already been made in mice and that another 7000 unique genes have been trapped in ES cells. Given the overlap between these sets, about 9000 mouse genes in total have been knocked out. In contrast to the gene-trapping efforts, which have produced readily available ES cell libraries, the gene-targeting efforts have thus far been accomplished mostly as a cottage industry with many investigators contributing one or a few knockout mice engineered using a wide variety of approaches, and fewer than 900 knockouts are actually available from a repository. Participants at a 2003 meeting at the Banbury Center of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposed that the systematic mutagenesis of all protein-encoding genes in the mouse would provide a standardized resource that would save time and expense (Austin et al., 2004Austin C.P. Battey J.F. Bradley A. Bucan M. Capecchi M. Collins F.S. Dove W.F. Duyk G. Dymecki S. Eppig J.T. et al.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). At the same time, pan-European discussions sponsored by the European Commission (EC) endorsed similar goals (Auwerx et al., 2004Auwerx J. Avner P. Baldock R. Ballabio A. Balling R. Barbacid M. Berns A. Bradley A. Brown S. Carmeliet P. et al.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 925-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Elements that supported these proposals included the availability of a highly accurate mouse genome sequence indicating a tractable number of genes; the high degree of homology between the mouse and human genomes; the excellent track record of the mouse as a model for human diseases and traits; and the sophisticated genetic tools and resources available for the mouse. The first step of the proposals has now come to fruition, and major mouse knockout programs are underway worldwide. Here, we describe the status of these efforts, the production goals, the methods for generation of research reagents, the plan to achieve close coordination among the programs, and the future direction of this research. The complexity and cost of such an undertaking required the deployment and coordination of resources on a global scale. Three funding agencies, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the EC, and Genome Canada and its partners have responded by funding such programs (see Supplemental Data available with this article online). These programs will use gene targeting and trapping to complete a resource of mutated ES cells and mice that will be comprehensive and will establish and support distribution centers and web-based data dissemination to deliver these resources to the biomedical community. KOMP (KnockOut Mouse Project, http://www.knockoutmouse.org), funded by the NIH, encompasses a number of efforts that all aim to enhance the availability and utility of mouse knockout strains. The first effort involved the acquisition of 251 knockout strains, and extensive associated phenotype data, from Deltagen and Lexicon Genetics. These strains were chosen from a list of approximately 2000 commercially derived gene knockouts by an NIH committee comprised of scientists representing areas of human disease and all major fields of biology. The strains have been deposited, as cryopreserved embryos, at two repositories and the data are available from the MGI database (http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/ko/). A second effort of KOMP aims to support the deposition of additional mouse knockout strains, produced by academic researchers, into repositories. Toward that end, the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (http://www.mmrrc.org) are supported to “repatriate” and archive 320 mouse strains for broad distribution. A prioritized list was generated from the set of all published mouse knockouts, and the investigators that published the strains are currently being requested to deposit their mice. The centerpiece of the KOMP knockout effort, however, consists of two programs that aim to create 8500 targeted mutations in ES cells in genes that have not yet been knocked out. The first is a consortium comprising The Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the University of California at Davis (“CSD”). The other group consists of investigators at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Both groups have established high-throughput pipelines to target genes in mouse ES cells. The CSD group will create “null-first conditional-ready” alleles (Figure 1). It is clear, however, that not all genes will be suitable for this allele design. Currently, compact genes and genes composed of complex transcript variants will not be readily amenable to this approach due to DNA sequence requirements to engineer the loxP sites flanking a critical exon that upon removal would ensure a null mutation. The use of BacVectors (targeting vectors with on average over 100 kb of homology), as developed by Regeneron, provides an alternate approach that is not dependent on gene structure, gene expression in ES cells, or a single exon that is critical for function. Regeneron will create null mutant alleles by deleting all or most of the exons in given genes, preferably from the initiator ATG codon to the stop codon (Valenzuela et al., 2003Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar; Figure 1). Additionally, as part of a quality-control effort, about 500 mutant mouse strains will be generated by KOMP and made available through repositories (Table 1).Table 1International Mouse Gene Knockout ProgramsType of ResourceType of Knockout20062007200820092010TotalsKOMPES CellTargeted Deletion1755009419429423500MouseTargeted Deletion5050505050250ES CellTargeted Conditional100010001000100010005000MouseTargeted Conditional5050505050250EUCOMMES CellTrapped Conditional30006000300012,000ES CellTargeted Conditional1000300040008000MouseMixed20100200320NorCOMMES CellTrapped Conditional100040003000200010,000ES CellTargeted Conditional1004007507502000MouseMixed25252525100Cumulative for All ProgramsES CellTrapped (Conditional)400014000200002200022,000aThe above numbers reflect estimates of unique genes trapped by the respective programs, but it is anticipated that there will be a 30%–40% overlap, resulting in ∼14,000 unique gene traps from the combined efforts.ES CellTargeted (Deletion)1756751616255835003500ES CellTargeted (Conditional)2100650012,25014,00015,00015,000MouseMixed125400715830920920Production timelines and totals are shown here.

EUCOMM (EUropean Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program, http://www.eucomm.org), funded by the FP6 program of the EC, combines the expertise of 11 research institutions across Europe and is coordinated by the GSF–National Research Center for Environment and Health and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The goals of the EUCOMM project are to produce 12,000 conditional gene trap mutations and 8000 conditional targeted mutations in mouse ES cells (Table 1). From these, EUCOMM will generate up to 320 mutant mouse strains for genes of biological and medical relevance, mainly for quality-control reasons but also to determine gene function in vivo. The gene trapping and targeting vectors are designed to allow the generation of a null mutation as well as a conditional mutation (Schnütgen et al., 2005Schnütgen F. De-Zolt S. Van Sloun P. Hollatz M. Floss T. Hansen J. Altschmied J. Seisenberger C. Ghyselinck N.B. Ruiz P. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Figure 1). In support of these efforts, the EUCOMM consortium will also produce 20 ligand-inducible, Cre-recombinase-expressing transgenic mice that will be available to the research community as well. NorCOMM (North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project, http://norcomm.phenogenomics.ca/index.htm) is a Canadian project, funded by Genome Canada and partners, whose mission is to contribute to the generation of a mouse ES cell resource with characterized mutations in every gene in the genome. Three centers in Canada are contributors to this initiative—the University of Manitoba, the University of Toronto, and the University of British Columbia. The project's goals include the generation of 10,000 gene trap insertion clones in ES cells derived from the 129 mouse strain using conditional-ready gene trap vectors, 2000 targeted conditional mutant ES cell lines, and a toolbox of vectors and associated molecular reagents under development by the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, to enhance the re-engineering of mutant lines. All three efforts rely on high-quality annotation of genomic sequence for the identification of genes to ablate, for the design of targeting constructs, and for the interpretation of gene-trapping results. Toward that end, both EUCOMM and KOMP are supporting vertebrate genome annotation (VEGA; http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/) that will be performed largely at the Sanger Institute. The resources generated by these programs will be available from three distribution centers: the German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD; http://www.rzpd.de), the KOMP repository (to be announced later, not yet funded), and the Canadian Mouse Consortium (CMC; http://www.mousecanada.ca/index.htm). Investigators can find reagents at these sites or at the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR; http://www.informatics.jax.org/imsr/index.jsp). Historically, the vast majority of mouse knockouts have been generated using ES cells derived from the 129 mouse strain. Unfortunately, the 129 mouse strain has not been widely used in other fields of experimentation and poses particular problems in immunology, neuroscience, and physiology. Although ES cells have been made from C57BL/6, DBA, and BALB/c mouse strains, they have not yet demonstrated the robustness needed to make a large-scale gene knockout project feasible. A workshop held at the NIH in March 2005 recognized the expediency of using 129 mouse ES cells, but participants strongly endorsed the development and use of C57BL/6 ES cells. Thus, three groups (University of Pennsylvania; Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto; and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) are moving forward to further characterize and develop robust C57BL/6 ES cells for high-throughput targeting efforts and implementation into the KOMP program. In contemplating the range of strategies that might be used to generate mutants of a large number of mouse genes at high efficiency and low cost, much discussion has centered around which technical approaches to use—for example, gene targeting or trapping, null or conditional alleles, and whether to include reporter genes (e.g., β-galactosidase). Further discussions that have taken into consideration the complexities of gene structure and expression have yielded a synthesis of approaches, while continuing evolution of genetic resources and high-throughput technologies have also influenced these plans. For example, one advantage of trapping is that only a single (or small number) of vectors needs to be constructed to trap thousands of genes (Skarnes et al., 2004Skarnes W.C. von Melchner H. Wurst W. Hicks G. Nord A.S. Cox T. Young S.G. Ruiz P. Soriano P. Tessier-Lavigne M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast, with targeting, a vector has to be made for each gene that is to be mutated. Now, however, end-sequenced BAC libraries and recombineering methods (Copeland et al., 2001Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Court D.L. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 1998Zhang Y. Buchholz F. Muyrers J.P. Stewart A.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) with the implementation of robotics allow the rapid construction of hundreds of targeting vectors (Valenzuela et al., 2003Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), which can in principle be used to knock out any gene in ES cells. Moreover, development and implementation of high-throughput screens for ES cells that are correctly targeted using such vectors has enabled the efficient utilization of large numbers of targeting vectors (Valenzuela et al., 2003Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). As a second example, the adoption of promoterless selection cassettes into targeting vectors has greatly improved the efficiency in targeting expressed genes (Friedel et al., 2005Friedel R.H. Plump A. Lu X. Spilker K. Jolicoeur C. Wong K. Venkatesh T.R. Yaron A. Hynes M. Chen B. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13188-13193Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Testa et al., 2004Testa G. Schaft J. van der Hoeven F. Glaser S. Anastassiadis K. Zhang Y. Hermann T. Stremmel W. Stewart A.F. Genesis. 2004; 38: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), decreasing the advantage of trapping in large-scale efforts. On the other hand, an advantage of targeting, that it allows the design of conditional alleles, is no longer as compelling because conditional gene traps are now being made (Schnütgen et al., 2005Schnütgen F. De-Zolt S. Van Sloun P. Hollatz M. Floss T. Hansen J. Altschmied J. Seisenberger C. Ghyselinck N.B. Ruiz P. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, the use of long homology arms in the constructs used for recombination may obviate the need for DNA constructs from the same strain (isogenic) (Valenzuela et al., 2003Valenzuela D.M. Murphy A.J. Frendewey D. Gale N.W. Economides A.N. Auerbach W. Poueymirou W.T. Adams N.C. Rojas J. Yasenchak J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), eliminating a disconnect between genome reagents, that is, the standard C57BL/6 BAC library that was used to sequence the mouse genome, and ES cells that are derived from 129 or other mouse strains. Thus, a combination of methods allows various approaches to be used in the construction of universal alleles that can be re-engineered as nulls, hypomorphs, or conditional knockouts. The development of technologies, the recognition of medical need for experimental models, and the common interests of strained funding agencies have resulted in, from the perspective of the mouse genome, a grand conjunction in the field of genetics. Given the scale of the mouse knockout project, it should be possible to rapidly provide a collection of gene knockouts of immediate interest. EUCOMM has already selected a list of high-priority genes that is available at http://www.eucomm.org. For the KOMP, a working group will make recommendations to the NIH, based on community input (http://www.knockoutmouse.org) regarding prioritization of which genes to knockout. Presumably, not all genes will be nominated, so that after ordering of nominated genes the working group will complete recommendations for prioritization of the remaining genes based on completion of known pathways, gene families, disease-related genes, expression profiles, and completeness of the gene annotation. KOMP, EUCOMM, and NorCOMM have agreed to share gene lists and data to help coordinate these international efforts. The participants of the 2003 Banbury Conference envisioned that the completion of the ES cell knockout resource for the entire mouse genome would provide a foundation of maximum utility to the research community and serve as a springboard for developing additional high-throughput cost-saving efforts in functional genomics. For example:•Proven constructs with the presence of loxP and FRT (Flp recombinase target) sites will afford the opportunity to use recombinases to exchange reporter genes or introduce expression cassettes with human genes (or any transgene or siRNA) into the vectors or directly in the targeted ES cell lines. These reagents will help to facilitate the future re-engineering of allelic mutations as our knowledge of particular gene functions and human disease alleles grows. The specific introduction of disease-related mutations should significantly enhance modeling of human diseases in mice.•While all the above-mentioned efforts have incorporated the highly versatile and broadly accepted lacZ reporter, there are many instances where redesign of the reporter cassette to provide live-cell imaging, molecular tags, or other markers could be highly advantageous. Having the reagents available from the original targeting experiment will greatly facilitate this switch.•Reporter expression profiles should also provide valuable data to allow the selection of the next generation of Cre driver strains, which can be easily developed using the construct and targeted ES cell resources.•The BacVectors with their very long regions of homology will also enhance the rate of homologous recombination in ES cell lines from other mouse strains that, while less robust for these large-scale projects, are from mouse strains preferred in specific areas of research.•The ES cells themselves are a valuable tool to study gene function in vitro. The redesign of vectors with a different selection cassette could allow the production of homozygous mutant ES cells that can be studied in cell-based assays, differentiated into multiple cell types, and used as recipients for human transgenes (or knockin of a humanized locus) for drug screening or toxicology without the potential background of the mouse gene product. In fact, entire pathways potentially can be engineered.•Homozygous ES cells can be used as the “null benchmark” for the development of other mutagenesis approaches, such as siRNA, to validate these approaches in vitro prior to their application in whole animals. It is important to note that generating mice from an ES cell line, by blastocyst injection and breeding, and subsequent phenotyping of such mice is significantly more expensive than the creation of the knockout ES cell line. Furthermore, many labs have specialized research interests, such that many phenotypes may be missed for lack of expertise or broad systematic experimentation. If an expanded program can be mounted in the future, the proposed areas for centralized phenotyping might include expression analysis of the reporter gene, stage of lethality, activity, appearance and general behavior of the mice, blood chemistry, skeletal structure, cardiovascular function, urinalysis, MRI, and histology of major organs and tissues. The number of targeted genes that can be studied in these programs will depend critically on funding. It is envisioned that specialized second and third tier phenotyping such as behavioral studies, immunological challenge, physiology, cardiovascular disease assessment, and cancer occurrence, to name a few, will require highly specialized assays and can only reasonably be performed on a subset of genes. Therefore, those assays that are of higher cost and that require a higher degree of specialization will most likely need to be investigator driven. The development of the vectors, mutant ES cells, mice, and distribution networks for the efforts of KOMP, EUCOMM, and NorCOMM to produce a knockout mutation for every gene in the mouse genome will not only provide valuable research tools in the short-term, decrease overall cost to the research community, and reduce time in producing experimental data, but it will also provide a foundation for future research in a wide variety of areas for many years to come. Definition of gene trapping and gene targeting: Gene trapping relies on the random integration in the genome of a DNA construct carrying a splice acceptor sequence and selection marker. This strategy exploits the fact that when constructs integrate into introns, they create fusion transcripts through the action of the vector's splice acceptor and express the selection marker. The resulting truncation/fusion often leads to a knockout or a severe hypomorphic allele of the endogenous gene. Gene trapping has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive and can be performed using one or a few vectors. A significant limitation of this strategy is that it is only effective for genes that are expressed in ES cells, and there is also bias toward larger genes. Gene targeting is a directed approach that uses homologous recombination to mutate an endogenous gene. Specifically, this method can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, and introduce point mutations either permanently or in a conditional fashion. Gene targeting requires the creation of a specific vector for each gene of interest but can be used for any gene, regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size.

A mutation in human Period 2 (hPER2), a gene crucial for resetting the central clock in response to light, is associated with familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS), an autosomal dominant condition with early morning awakening and early sleep times. The FASPS hPER2 S662G mutation resulted in PER2 being hypophosphorylated by casein kinase I (CKI) in vitro. We generated transgenic mice carrying the FASPS hPER2 S662G mutation and faithfully recapitulate the human phenotype. We show that phosphorylation at S662 leads to increased PER2 transcription and suggest that phosphorylation at another site leads to PER2 degradation. Altering CKIdelta dosage modulates the S662 phenotype demonstrating that CKIdelta can regulate period through PER2 in vivo. Modeling a naturally occurring human variant in mice has yielded novel insights into PER2 regulation."

This report reveals that erythrocytes constitute a buffer system for S1P in blood. They efficiently incorporated and stored S1P, and protected it from cellular degradation. They also released S1P into plasma, but not into other serum-free media, indicating that S1P release was controlled by a plasma factor. Erythrocytes did not generate S1P since an increase in plasma S1P levels was always accompanied by a decrease in cellular S1P levels. Thrombocytes that were reported to generate and release S1P after activation did not contribute to the observed S1P release in blood. The amount of erythrocytes as well as the proportion of plasma in the medium determined the magnitude of S1P release. Adoptively transferred S1P-loaded and unloaded mouse erythrocytes displayed a normal life span and similar S1P levels 24 h after recovery, indicating that S1P incorporation and release are dynamically regulated in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2973151367,"A memory-based immune system may have evolved in vertebrates because of the need to recognize and manage complex communities of beneficial microbes. The cover on Nature of 21/28 December 2006 highlighted the role of gut microbes in obesity. Gut flora are even talked of as part of the Homo sapiens 'metagenome'. This has echoes in this week's Essay, which suggests that adaptive immunity, which allows vertebrates to respond to microbes on the basis of past interactions, may have developed initially as a way of managing communities of beneficial microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2094078115,"We identify PICH (Plk1-interacting checkpoint ""helicase""), a member of the SNF2 ATPase family, as an interaction partner and substrate of Plk1. Following phosphorylation of PICH on the Cdk1 site T1063, Plk1 is recruited to PICH and controls its localization. Starting in prometaphase, PICH accumulates at kinetochores and inner centromeres. Moreover, it decorates threads that form during metaphase before increasing in length and progressively diminishing during anaphase. PICH-positive threads connect sister kinetochores and are dependent on tension, sensitive to DNase, and exacerbated in response to premature loss of cohesins or inhibition of topoisomerase II, suggesting that they represent stretched centromeric chromatin. Depletion of PICH causes the selective loss of Mad2 from kinetochores and completely abrogates the spindle checkpoint, resulting in massive chromosome missegregation. These data identify PICH as a novel essential component of checkpoint signaling. We propose that PICH binds to catenated centromere-related DNA to monitor tension developing between sister kinetochores."
https://openalex.org/W2071329652,"The compositions of volcanic gases can be used by geologists to monitor volcanic activity or as a pointer to how the composition of the atmosphere has evolved with time. It is implicitly assumed that these gases faithfully reflect the conditions, in particular the redox state, of their source magma. But detailed physico-chemical modelling of the degassing processes reveals that this assumption is not generally valid and that the redox state of erupted magmas does not necessarily reflect the redox state of the gases emitted into the atmosphere. A coupled chemical–physical model of conduit flow shows that the oxidation state of an ascending magma is strongly dependent on both the composition and amount of gas in the reservoir. Volatiles carried by magmas, either dissolved or exsolved, have a fundamental effect on a variety of geological phenomena, such as magma dynamics1,2,3,4,5 and the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere6. In particular, the redox state of volcanic gases emanating at the Earth’s surface is widely believed to mirror that of the magma source, and is thought to have exerted a first-order control on the secular evolution of atmospheric oxygen6,7. Oxygen fugacity ( ) estimated from lava or related gas chemistry, however, may vary by as much as one log unit8,9,10, and the reason for such differences remains obscure. Here we use a coupled chemical–physical model of conduit flow to show that the redox state evolution of an ascending magma, and thus of its coexisting gas phase, is strongly dependent on both the composition and the amount of gas in the reservoir. Magmas with no sulphur show a systematic increase during ascent, by as much as 2 log units. Magmas with sulphur show also a change of redox state during ascent, but the direction of change depends on the initial in the reservoir. Our calculations closely reproduce the H2S/SO2 ratios of volcanic gases observed at convergent settings, yet the difference between in the reservoir and that at the exit of the volcanic conduit may be as much as 1.5 log units. Thus, the redox state of erupted magmas is not necessarily a good proxy of the redox state of the gases they emit. Our findings may require re-evaluation of models aimed at quantifying the role of magmatic volatiles in geological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1998837897,"High-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity develops near antiferromagnetic phases, and it is possible that magnetic excitations contribute to the superconducting pairing mechanism. To assess the role of antiferromagnetism, it is essential to understand the doping and temperature dependence of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The phase diagram is asymmetric with respect to electron and hole doping, and for the comparatively less-studied electron-doped materials, the antiferromagnetic phase extends much further with doping [1, 2] and appears to overlap with the superconducting phase. The archetypical electron-doped compound Nd{2-x}Ce{x}CuO{4\pm\delta} (NCCO) shows bulk superconductivity above x \approx 0.13 [3, 4], while evidence for antiferromagnetic order has been found up to x \approx 0.17 [2, 5, 6]. Here we report inelastic magnetic neutron-scattering measurements that point to the distinct possibility that genuine long-range antiferromagnetism and superconductivity do not coexist. The data reveal a magnetic quantum critical point where superconductivity first appears, consistent with an exotic quantum phase transition between the two phases [7]. We also demonstrate that the pseudogap phenomenon in the electron-doped materials, which is associated with pronounced charge anomalies [8-11], arises from a build-up of spin correlations, in agreement with recent theoretical proposals [12, 13]."
https://openalex.org/W2148607491,"While studies of the adaptor SH3BP2 have implicated a role in receptor-mediated signaling in mast cells and lymphocytes, they have failed to identify its function or explain why SH3BP2 missense mutations cause bone loss and inflammation in patients with cherubism. We demonstrate that Sh3bp2 ""cherubism"" mice exhibit trabecular bone loss, TNF-alpha-dependent systemic inflammation, and cortical bone erosion. The mutant phenotype is lymphocyte independent and can be transferred to mice carrying wild-type Sh3bp2 alleles through mutant fetal liver cells. Mutant myeloid cells show increased responses to M-CSF and RANKL stimulation, and, through mechanisms of increased ERK 1/2 and SYK phosphorylation/activation, they form macrophages that express high levels of TNF-alpha and osteoclasts that are unusually large. M-CSF and RANKL stimulation of myeloid cells that overexpress wild-type SH3BP2 results in similar large osteoclasts. This indicates that the mutant phenotype reflects gain of SH3BP2 function and suggests that SH3BP2 is a critical regulator of myeloid cell responses to M-CSF and RANKL stimulation."

We describe here the functional organization of the glycosynaptic microdomain, and the mechanisms for control of cell motility and invasiveness, in normal bladder epithelial HCV29 cells versus highly invasive bladder cancer YTS1 cells, both derived from transitional epithelia. (i) Ganglioside GM2, but not GM3 or globoside, interacted specifically with tetraspanin CD82, and such a complex inhibited hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced activation of Met tyrosine kinase in a dose-dependent manner. (ii) Depletion of GM2 in HCV29 cells by treatment with d-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (P4), or reduction of CD82 expression by RNA interference, significantly enhanced HGF-induced Met tyrosine kinase and cell motility. (iii) In contrast, YTS1 cells, lacking CD82, displayed HGF-independent activation of Met tyrosine kinase and high cell motility. Transfection of the CD82 gene to YTS1 inhibited HGF dose-dependent Met tyrosine kinase activity and cell motility, due to formation of the GM2-CD82 complex. (iv) Adhesion of YTS1 or YTS1/CD82 cells to laminin-5-coated plates, as compared with noncoated plates, strongly enhanced Met activation, and the degree of activation was further increased in association with GSL depletion by P4. Laminin-5-dependent Met activation was minimal in HCV29 cells. These findings indicate that GSL, particularly GM2, forms a complex with CD82, and that such complex interacts with Met and thereby inhibits HGF-induced Met tyrosine kinase activity, as well as integrin to Met cross-talk.

PNF was subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate low density membrane fractions as described previously (13Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F.A. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34349-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fractions were separated and numbered 1–12 from top to bottom. Aliquots of each fraction, containing equal protein content (2.5 μg), were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Determination of Met Tyrosine Phosphorylation following HGF Stimulation—Cells were grown in 6-well culture plates to ∼90% confluence, washed, and starved overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were then stimulated with 0, 10, 25, 50, or 100 ng/ml HGF for 10 min, washed with PBS containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, and lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF) containing 75 units of aprotinin, 2 mm PMSF, and 5 mm sodium vanadate. Sample, containing 200 μg of protein, was precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads (20 μl) with tumbling at 4 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation (1,000 rpm), 3 μg of anti-Met antibody was added to the supernatant and tumbled overnight. The mixture was incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF). Levels of tyrosine phosphate in immunoprecipitated fractions were measured using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Py20), and stripped blots were probed by anti-Met antibody. The effect of P4 on Met tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by pretreatment of cells with 1 μm P4 for 72 h in serum-free medium (see below), followed by treatment with 0, 50, or 100 ng/ml HGF. P4 Treatment and Effect of P4 on GSL and Ceramide Level— Cells were grown in a 10-cm dish for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was changed to fresh growth medium with or without P4 (1 μm), and GSL levels were determined. Gangliosides were essentially depleted in P4-treated cells within 72 h. Quantity of ceramide was determined as ceramide-1-[32P]phosphate following 32P phosphorylation by diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem), by the method of Bektas et al. (37Bektas M. Jolly P.S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). There was no increase of ceramide during 48–72 h of P4 incubation in WI38 cells or bladder cancer cell lines, as described previously (14Mitsuzuka K. Handa K. Satoh M. Arai Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35545-35553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Exogenous Addition of GM2 and/or GM3—For exogenous addition of gangliosides, cells were plated 24 h before the experiment. The cells were then washed with serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h with GM2 and/or GM3 (dissolved in serum-free medium by sonication) at a final concentration of 50 μm. For reversion of P4 effect, cells were treated with P4 as above, washed, and incubated with GM2 (25 μm) in serum-free medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Phagokinetic Gold Sol Assay for Cell Motility—Cell motility was studied by an improved method (38Scott W.N. McCool K. Nelson J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) based on Albrecht-Buehler’s original procedure (39Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates were incubated with 1% BSA for 3 h at room temperature, washed with 100% ethanol, and dried. Colloidal gold suspension was prepared by adding 1.8 ml of freshly prepared 0.1% formaldehyde solution to a boiling mixture containing 6 ml of Na2CO3 (36.5 mm), 1.8 ml of AuHCl4 (14.5 mm), and 11 ml of H2O. Plates were incubated with gold solution suspension (0.5 ml/well) for 40 min at room temperature and washed with culture medium. Cells (1 × 104/well), in medium containing 5% FBS, were seeded onto gold sol-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 18 h cells were fixed by adding 0.5 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde, observed, and photographed using a light microscope (Nikon). The track area of 20 cells/well was measured by Scion image program and expressed as square pixels. Determination of GSL Binding to CD82—(i) Polystyrene beads (1 μm diameter; as pure water suspension from Interfacial Dynamics Corp., Portland, OR) were washed three times with PBS and 1× with ethanol (each washing by ∼1400 × g centrifugation). Beads were resuspended in ethanol, and aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes (6.85 × 107 beads per tube). (ii) Gb4, GM3, or GM2 was dried, respectively, in a separate tube and dissolved in ethanol/water 9:1 (for each case, 16 nmol of GSL per 1 ml of solution), and 1 ml of aliquot was transferred to bead-containing microcentrifuge tube as in (i). Bead/GSL mixture, or bead mixture alone without GSL, was incubated with tumbling for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS and incubated with 300 μl of 0.1% gelatin with tumbling for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding sites. (iii) Lysate of YTS1 or YTS1/CD82 cells in TBS (+) (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) was prepared, and aliquots, each containing 100 μg of protein, were added to a tube containing a suspension of noncoated or GSL-coated beads. Each tube with addition of cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBS (+), resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CD82 antibody. Determination of Interaction between Glycosynaptic Components by Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—The procedure was essentially as described previously (13Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F.A. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34349-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), except for modification of number of cells, type of coverslip, medium, and incubation time. Cells (1 × 104/well) were seeded onto 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates. The next day, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 for 30 min. Cells were double-stained with two primary antibodies with different isotype and/or species for 2 h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibodies labeled with green fluorescence or red fluorescence for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and mounted with Glycergel mounting medium (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Double-stained cells were subjected to laser scanning confocal microscopy (Fluoro-View™, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the fluorescence pattern was recorded. Thus, the degree of interaction of GM2 with CD82, GM2 with Met, α3 with CD82, Met with CD82, and Met with β1 was determined as detailed in the legend of Fig. 7, A, B, 3rd lane, and C, 3rd lane. Determination of Interaction between Glycosynaptic Components by Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)—Interaction of CD82 with Met, α3 with Met, α3 with CD82, β1 with CD82, and β1 with Met in this study was determined using PNF prepared in 0.5% Brij 98, as described previously for interaction of CD9 with α3 in ldlD cells (13Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F.A. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

PNF (containing 200 μg of protein), prepared as described above, was precleared by mixing with protein A/G-agarose beads (30-μl bed volume), incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 3 h, and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm. The precleared supernatant was mixed with 3 μg of antibody (rabbit anti-α3 or mouse anti-β1) and incubated with tumbling at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was added with protein A/G-agarose beads, incubated with tumbling at 4 °C for 3 h, and centrifuged to collect the beads. After washing twice with lysis buffer, the IPs were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Interaction of CD82 with α3 was observed by IP with anti-α3 and Western blot with mouse anti-CD82 IgG1 antibody. To observe interaction of Met with CD82 or β1, primary IP was performed with anti-Met and Western blot with antibodies directed to CD82 or β1. Knockdown of CD82 Expression through Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) in HCV29 Cells—HCV29 cells (1 × 105) were seeded in a 6-well plate in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with no antibiotics. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 100 nmol/liter of three siRNA duplexes for human CD82 (SMART selection) separately or a negative control siRNA (Dharmacon Research, Denver, CO) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Reduction of the mRNA level was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cell pellets using RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (1 μg) using the Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) using standard protocol. The CD82 primers (sense, 5′-GGGCCCTCTTCTACTTCAACAT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGAAAGGCTGTTGTCCTCTTCC-3′) yielding a 254-bp product, and β-actin primers as control (sense, 5′-AACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACAT-3) yielding a 721-bp product, were used. PCR products were separated on agarose gel, and the intensity of bands was analyzed using the Scion image program. Reduction of CD82 level was further confirmed by Western blot and flow cytometry. To establish permanent knockdown cells, the oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCCCGTATCAAAGTCACCAAATATTCAAGAGATATTTGGTGACTTTGATACTTTTTC; CD82-specific sequences shown in boldface) and its complementary oligonucleotide were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), based on the sequence of the most effective siRNA tested above, and ligated into a BglII/XhoI-cut pSUPER vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) (40Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Control plasmid was constructed similarly using the oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCCCTAGCGACTAAACACATCAATTCA"

https://openalex.org/W2156404917,"High-fidelity chromosomal segregation requires the properly timed establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the Cohesin complex, and its resolution at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. We have examined cell-cycle progression in a yeast strain from which the origin recognition complex protein Orc2 was depleted after the assembly of prereplication complexes. We find that Orc2 depletion causes a delay in progression through mitosis, reflecting activation of both the DNA-damage and Mad2-spindle checkpoints. Surprisingly, sister-chromatid cohesion is impaired in Orc2-depleted cells, although Cohesin subunits are properly associated with chromatin. Reexpression of Orc2 in late G2/M phase restores chromatid cohesion. Finally, the targeting of Orc2 to a specific chromosomal locus suppresses premature sister-chromatid separation locally in a temperature-sensitive cohesin mutant. We conclude that ORC mediates sister-chromatid interaction on a pathway that is additive with Cohesin-mediated pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2008847964,"Yeast mutants lacking vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits (vma mutants) were sensitive to several different oxidants in a recent genomic screen (Thorpe, G. W., Fong, C. S., Alic, N., Higgins, V. J., and Dawes, I. W. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 6564–6569). We confirmed that mutants lacking a V1 subunit (vma2Δ), Vo subunit, or either of the two Vo a subunit isoforms are acutely sensitive to H2O2 and more sensitive to menadione and diamide than wild-type cells. The vma2Δ mutant contains elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and high levels of oxidative protein damage even in the absence of an applied oxidant, suggesting an endogenous source of oxidative stress. vma2Δ mutants lacking mitochondrial DNA showed neither improved growth nor decreased sensitivity to peroxide, excluding respiration as the major source of the endogenous reactive oxygen species in the mutant. Double mutants lacking both VMA2 and components of the major cytosolic defense systems exhibited synthetic sensitivity to H2O2. Microarray analysis comparing wild-type and vma2Δ mutant cells grown at pH 5, permissive conditions for the vma2Δ mutant, indicated high level up-regulation of several iron uptake and metabolism genes that are part of the Aft1/Aft2 regulon. TSA2, which encodes an isoform of the cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidase, was strongly induced, but other oxidative stress defense systems were not induced. The results indicate that V-ATPase activity helps to protect cells from endogenous oxidative stress. Yeast mutants lacking vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits (vma mutants) were sensitive to several different oxidants in a recent genomic screen (Thorpe, G. W., Fong, C.

The results indicate that V-ATPase activity helps to protect cells from endogenous oxidative stress. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have multiple mechanisms for preventing and counteracting the effects of oxidative stress (1Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; YEPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium; SC, synthetic complete medium; DHR, dihydrorhodamine 123; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are normal products of aerobic metabolism, but excess ROS accumulation due to perturbation of control mechanisms can result in accumulation of mutations, premature aging, and cell death (2Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 3Costa V. Moradas-Ferreira P. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Drug Metab. Rev. 1998; 30: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Many of the central mechanisms for controlling redox balance in the cell are highly conserved. These mechanisms include 1) proteins involved directly in regulating redox balance or repairing effects of oxidative stress, including the well known components of the glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent reduction systems, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the pentose phosphate pathway, and 2) a transcriptional response centered around recruitment of the “redox-specific” transcription factors to promoters of these and other antioxidant response genes (2Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 3Costa V. Moradas-Ferreira P. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Only recently has the full spectrum of genes important for control of oxidative stress begun to be appreciated, through microarray analysis of responses to a variety of oxidants and screens of ordered S. cerevisiae deletion mutant arrays (5Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar, 6Outten C.E. Falk R.L. Culotta V.C.

A. 2004; 101: 6564-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Genomic screens have revealed that deletions in many genes not previously associated with redox balance result in sensitivity to one or more applied oxidants (6Outten C.E. Falk R.L. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Thorpe G.W. Fong C.S. Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These screens also revealed that response to oxidative stress may be more specific than previously appreciated, since many deletion mutants show sensitivity to one type of oxidant but little sensitivity to others (7Thorpe G.W. Fong C.S. Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6564-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 8Higgins V.J. Alic N. Thorpe G.W. Breitenbach M. Larsson V. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the cell tailors its response to different stresses rather than having a single general response pathway (9Temple M.D. Perrone G.G. Dawes I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, certain deletion strains do show sensitivity to multiple different applied oxidants (7Thorpe G.W. Fong C.S. Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6564-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 8Higgins V.J. Alic N. Thorpe G.W. Breitenbach M. Larsson V. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This may indicate that the deletions in these genes affect protective mechanisms that are used in multiple contexts and/or that the deletions result in a chronic state of oxidative stress that render the mutants unable to cope with further stress. Consistent with this, mutants lacking important antioxidant functions also show evidence of oxidative stress or damage even in the absence of an applied oxidative stress (10Chang E.C. Crawford B.F. Hong Z. Bilinski T. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4417-4424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, the screens may be revealing previously unappreciated sources of oxidative stress and the cellular mechanisms that contain them. Yeast mutants lacking subunits of the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) have been identified in multiple genomic screens for sensitivity to different forms of oxidative stress (6Outten C.E. Falk R.L. Culotta V.C. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Thorpe G.W. Fong C.S. Alic N. Higgins V.J. Dawes I.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is a highly conserved proton pump responsible for acidification of organelles such as the lysosome/vacuole, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes in all eukaryotic cells (12Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 13Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). V-ATPases have also been recruited to a variety of more specialized functions, often involving high level expression of the enzyme at the plasma membrane of polarized cells, in addition to intracellular compartments (13Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 14Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The yeast S. cerevisiae does not appear to express a plasma membrane form of the V-ATPase and has proven to be an excellent model for the “constitutive” functions of V-ATPases associated with acidification of intracellular compartments (12Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). All eukaryotic V-ATPases are multisubunit enzymes comprised of a complex of peripheral membrane proteins, V1, attached to a complex of integral membrane proteins, Vo. Deletion of any V-ATPase subunit gene, except VPH1 and STV1, which encode organelle-specific isoforms of one of the Vo subunits, results in a common Vma– phenotype, characterized by a pH-dependent conditional lethality and sensitivity to elevated extracellular calcium concentrations (12Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, vma mutants show a variety of other defects that are not completely understood, including poor growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, hypersensitivity to multiple drugs, and increased sensitivity to transition metals, such as iron, copper, and zinc (15Eide D.J. Clark S. Nair T.M. Gehl M. Gribskov M. Guerinot M.L. Harper J.F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sambade M. Alba M. Smardon A.M. West R.W. Kane P.M.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In this work, we confirm that vma mutants are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, particularly H2O2, and further explore the basis of this sensitivity. We find that the vma mutants show evidence of chronic oxidative stress, including elevated ROS levels and protein modifications characteristic of accumulated oxidative damage, even in the absence of any added oxidant, but the electron transport chain is not the major source of the stress in these cells. vma mutations result in a synthetic sensitivity to peroxide when combined with mutations in many of the components of the cytoplasmic machinery for redox control, including the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione synthetase, thioredoxins, thioredoxin peroxidases, and components of the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway, suggesting that vacuolar acidification is not simply involved in supporting one of these mechanisms central to redox balance. Microarray analysis under conditions permissive for growth of the vma2 mutant (pH 5) indicates high level up-regulation of the cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidase Tsa2p and induction of the Aft1p/Aft2p regulon in the vma2 mutant. Based on these results, we suggest several possible explanations for the sensitivity of vma mutants to applied oxidative stresses, such as hydrogen peroxide. Materials and Strains—Hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Acros. Menadione and diamide were obtained from Sigma. Dihydrorhodamine 123 was obtained from Sigma, and the OxyBlot kit was purchased from Chemicon International. Yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD) and synthetic complete (SC) were prepared as described (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). All strains were obtained from the Open Biosystems or Eurofan haploid deletion collections and were based on BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0). All strains in the collection have a complete replacement of the open reading frame with the kanMX marker in the BY4741 background (19Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K.

Double mutant spores were isolated by mating the indicated strain from the deletion collection with the BY4742 vma2Δ strain, selecting diploids on YEPD containing 200 μg/ml kanamycin and 200 μg/ml clonNAT (Werner Biolabs) and then sporulating the resulting diploids and dissecting tetrads on YEPD plates buffered to pH 5. Haploid spores resistant to both kanamycin and clonNAT were identified. The wild-type BY4741 and the BY4741 vma2Δ strain were converted to rho0 strains by extended incubation with 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide as described (21Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W.

Loss of mitochondrial DNA was confirmed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Halo assays for sensitivity to various oxidants were performed as described (22Haarer B.K. Amberg D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except that the indicated concentrations of oxidant were added to the filter paper disk after the disk was placed on an overlay of cells grown to log phase in liquid culture, mixed with an equal volume of 1% agar, and then layered onto a YEPD plate buffered to either pH 7 or pH 5. The cells were then allowed to grow at 30 °C for 2–4 days. For each assay, wild-type and mutant strains were spread at the same density and grown for identical times. Relative halo sizes were determined by measuring the diameter of the area around the disk that was clear of cells and dividing this measurement by the diameter of the halo for wild-type cells treated in parallel with the same peroxide concentration. For dilution assays to test peroxide sensitivity, hydrogen peroxide was added to SC to give the final concentration indicated. Plates were used within 2 days of the assay. Liquid cultures of strains to be tested were grown to log phase, adjusted to identical density, and then serially diluted (10-fold dilutions) before spotting on the plates. Genetic and Biochemical Tests for Oxidative Stress Sensitivity and Oxidative Damage—Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) staining was performed as described by Madeo et al. (23Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Briefly, DHR was dissolved in ethanol to make a 2.5-mg/ml stock. Liquid cultures of BY4741 and BY4741 vma2Δ strains and the corresponding rho0 cells were grown overnight in SC, and DHR was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope and a rhodamine filter set after 4.5 h of staining. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu CCD camera. For quantitation of the percentage of cells stained with the dye, 280–350 cells from each strain were scored in two independent experiments. Samples were compared using the two-sample t test assuming equal variances. Carbonylated proteins were detected by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazine and detection of DNP-modified protein by Western blotting with rabbit anti-DNP polyclonal antibody according to protocols provided with the OxyBlot kit. Yeast cells were prepared as described (24Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 5 A600 units of each strain were isolated during log phase growth, converted to spheroplasts, and lysed by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold 0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, and vortex mixing for 2 min. Unlysed cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was used for derivatization. A mock derivatization, in which all reagents except DNP-hydrazine were added to the supernatant, was carried out in parallel for each strain. After neutralization of the reaction, equal amounts of protein for each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The GFP-YAP1 plasmid was a generous gift from Scott Moye-Rowley (25Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into wild-type and vma2Δ strains, and transformants were selected and maintained on fully supplemented minimal medium lacking uracil. Localization of Yap1p was visualized after overnight growth of the cells in SC-uracil. Microarray and Northern Analyses—Total yeast RNA was isolated from wild-type and vma2Δ mutant yeast cells grown to early log phase in YEPD, pH 5, as described (26Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The total RNA obtained was then further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy RNA purification kit, and then the quality and quantity of the RNA was analyzed using an Agilent RNA nanochip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Duplicate RNA samples (from two independent isolations from the vma2Δ strain and a single isolation from the wild-type strain) were subjected to microarray analysis using Affymetrix Yeast Gen2 chips and standard eukaryotic one-cycle amplification and labeling procedures. Arrays were scanned on a GeneChip 3000 scanner (Affymetrix) and analyzed by GeneChip Operating System software (Affymetrix) to generate present and absent calls and assess sample quality. Subsequently, the .cel format image files were imported into GeneSpring GX (Agilent) and normalized using the robust multiarray average method (27Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar). For this report, we determined the fraction of genes that were increased or decreased in the mutant versus wild type strains at the two-tailed 99th percentile confidence level (defined as ±2.58 S.D. values from the mean expression ratio comparing the two strains). In the present study, this translated to cut-off values of 2.1-fold up or down in assessing changes in expression in the mutant strains (see supplemental Fig. 1). For Northern analysis, two independent RNA samples were prepared from both the wild type and vma2Δ mutant as described above. RNA was separated on a 2.2 m formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred by capillary action to Duralon membrane, and fixed to the blot by UV cross-linking (260 nm for 1 min), as described by Sambrook and Russell (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.21-7.45Google Scholar). Probes against the indicated genes were prepared by PCR amplification of 250–400-bp regions of the open reading frames of the genes, followed by labeling with [α-32P]dCTP using a Stratagene Prime-It random primer labeling kit. Blots were hybridized with the probes as described (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.21-7.45Google Scholar) and then washed and analyzed on an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon PhosphorImager. Yeast vma Mutants Are Acutely Sensitive to Oxidative Stress—In order to confirm that the vma mutants were sensitive to external oxidative stress, we challenged two of the vma deletion strains, vma2Δ and vma3Δ, with several concentrations of H2O2. These two mutations affect the two different sectors of the V-ATPase; vma2Δ lacks the B subunit of the V1 sector but contains assembled Vo sectors at the vacuole, and vma3Δ lacks the c subunit of the Vo sector and contains assembled V1 sectors in the cytosol (29Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows a halo assay for wild type, vma2Δ, and vma3Δ in which varied H2O2 concentrations were applied to filter disks on top of a fresh overlay of cells, and the size of the area of inhibited growth around the disk provides a measure of sensitivity (a larger halo indicates sensitivity to a lower concentration of H2O2 as it diffuses from the filter). It is clear from Fig. 1A that both the vma2Δ and vma3Δ mutants exhibit much larger halos than the wild-type control strain at every peroxide concentration tested, suggesting that the mutant strains are very sensitive to peroxide stress. In Fig. 1B, the sensitivity of the vma2Δ strain to two other oxidants, diamide and menadione, was compared with the wild-type strain. The vma2Δ mutant is only slightly more sensitive to diamide than the wild-type strain at pH 5, but there is an increase in its relative sensitivity at pH 7. In contrast, H2O2 (at the concentrations used in Fig. 1A) almost completely inhibits growth of vma2Δ and vma3Δ cells at neutral pH (data not shown). Menadione sensitivity could only be measured at elevated pH and was clearly more pronounced in the vma2Δ mutant than in wild type. The sensitivity of the vma3Δ mutant to these oxidants was similar to or slightly greater than that of the vma2Δ mutant (data not shown). These data support previous indications that vma mutants are sensitive to various forms of applied oxidative stress but also suggest that the mutants are exquisitely sensitive to H2O2. Both the vma2Δ and vma3Δ mutations disrupt subunits that are required for all V-ATPase activity in the cell (12Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). One subunit of the V-ATPase, the Vo a subunit, is present as two organelle-specific isoforms, Vph1p and Stv1p, which have steady state localizations at the vacuole and Golgi apparatus/endosomes, respectively, in wild-type cells (30Kawasaki-Nishi S. Bowers K. Nishi T. Forgac M. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47411-47420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that both vph1Δ and stv1Δ mutants are much more sensitive to peroxide at pH 5 than wild-type cells, although neither is as sensitive as the vma2Δ or vma3Δ mutants. These results suggest that both vacuolar Vph1p-containing V-ATPases and the Golgi/endosome Stv1p containing V-ATPases contribute to resistance to oxidative stress. As a means of quantitating the relative strength of the sensitivity of the vma mutants to peroxide stress, we compared the relative halo size of the vma2Δ challenged with 2 and 5% peroxide to those of deletions of the two superoxide dismutases (Sod1p and Sod2p) in yeast, which are firmly established as important defenses against oxidative stress (32Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, vma2Δ mutants have significantly larger halos than wild-type cells challenged with 2 and 5% peroxide, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1A. Furthermore, the halo sizes for the vma2 mutant are comparable with those for either superoxide dismutase mutant, suggesting that loss of V-ATPase activity compromises the resistance of cells to peroxide to a comparable degree. vma Mutants Are under Chronic Oxidative Stress—Cells that are highly sensitive to an applied oxidative stress often contain elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be present in a number of different chemical forms (33Moradas-Ferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), even in the absence of an applied stress. An increase in steady-state ROS levels can be detected with redox-sensitive dyes. In order to compare ROS levels in the wild-type and vma mutants, we incubated the cells with DHR. DHR enters the cell but is non-fluorescent unless it is oxidized by intracellular oxidants to form rhodamine 123. Wild-type and vma2Δ mutants were grown overnight in fully supplemented minimal medium, and then DHR was added for an additional 4.5-h incubation. Fig. 2A shows DHR staining of one field of wild-type and of vma2Δ mutants. On average, only 6.75 ± 1.85% of wild-type cells showed any staining with DHR, but 17.2 ± 0.2% of vma2Δ cells were stained (see also Fig. 3B). These results indicate that loss of V-ATPase activity does result in a higher percentage of cells with ROS, consistent with hypersensitivity to oxidative stress in these cells.FIGURE 3The electron transport chain may not be the major source of ROS in vma mutants grown in glucose. A, wild-type and BY4741 vma2Δ cells were depleted of mitochondrial DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures” to form rho0 cells, and the growth of the rho+ and rho0 cells on SC and SC containing the indicated concentration of H2O2 is compared. For each strain, 10-fold serial dilutions from liquid cultures of cells at identical density were spotted on the indicated plates. Cells were grown for 2 days at 30 °C. B, the percentage of both rho+ and rho0 cells stained with DHR was measured in two independent experiments, and the mean ± range of the two experiments is shown. C, the growth of wild type and vma2Δ mutants on YEPD, pH 5 (optimal growth conditions), YEP containing typical concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources (3% glycerol plus 2% ethanol or 3% lactate), and YEP with lowered concentrations of nonfermentable carbon sources (3% glycerol only or 0.3% lactate) is compared as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells that are under chronic oxidative stress accumulate protein modifications of several different types (34Cabiscol E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). One of these modifications is protein carbonylation, and levels of carbonylated protein have frequently been used as a measure of chronic oxidative stress (24Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 35Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). We detected protein carbonylation using the OxyBlot system, in which carbonylated proteins are further derivatized with DNP, which can then be detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, lysates from wild-type cells contain very little DNP-reactive carbonylated protein, but the vma2Δ mutant contains high levels of protein carbonylation, even though no extracellular oxidant was added in these experiments. What Is the Source of ROS Accumulation in the vma Mutants?—Reactive oxygen species can arise from a number of different sources and processes, but mitochondria, and specifically the respiratory chain, are frequently one of the major sources (36Barros M.H. Bandy B. Tahara E.B. Kowaltowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49883-49888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In yeast, at least one subunit of each complex of the electron transport chain is encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and the cells can survive by fermentative growth in the absence of mitochondrial DNA and respiratory function. Therefore, respiration can be totally abolished by inducing the loss of mitochondrial DNA. We selected wild-type and vma2Δ mutants that had lost mitochondrial DNA (rho0 cells) and then determined whether the rho0 versions of the two strains were more or less sensitive to oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 3A, loss of mitochondrial DNA did not affect the growth of either strain at pH 5. More importantly, the rho0 cells showed no improvement in their sensi"

GCs inhibit Th1 cytokines and promote a shift toward Th2 differentiation. Th1 phenotype depends on TF T-bet. In this study, we examined GC regulation of T-bet. We found that GCs inhibit T-bet transcriptional activity. We show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) physically interacts with T-bet both in transfected cell lines and in primary splenocyte cultures with endogenous GR and T-bet. This interaction also blocks GR-dependent transcription. We show both in vitro and in vivo at endogenous binding sites that the mechanism underlying T-bet inhibition further involves reduction of T-bet binding to DNA. Using specific mutations of GR, we demonstrate that the first zinc finger region of GR is required for T-bet inhibition. GCs additionally inhibit T-bet both at mRNA and protein expression levels, revealing another layer of GR action on T-bet. Finally, we examined the functional consequences of GR/T-bet interaction on IFN-gamma, showing that GCs inhibit transcriptional activity of T-bet on its promoter. In view of the crucial role of T-bet in T cell differentiation and inflammation, we propose that GR inhibitory interaction with T-bet may be an important mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive properties of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W2146348678,"Titin forms an intrasarcomeric filament system in vertebrate striated muscle, which has elastic and signaling properties and is thereby central to mechanotransduction. Near its C-terminus and directly preceding a kinase domain, titin contains a conserved pattern of Ig and FnIII modules (Ig(A168)-Ig(A169)-FnIII(A170), hereby A168-A170) that recruits the E3 ubiquitin-ligase MuRF-1 to the filament. This interaction is thought to regulate myofibril turnover and the trophic state of muscle. We have elucidated the crystal structure of A168-A170, characterized MuRF-1 variants by circular dichroism (CD) and SEC-MALS, and studied the interaction of both components by isothermal calorimetry, SPOTS blots, and pull-down assays. This has led to the identification of the molecular determinants of the binding. A168-A170 shows an extended, rigid architecture, which is characterized by a shallow surface groove that spans its full length and a distinct loop protrusion in its middle point. In MuRF-1, a C-terminal helical domain is sufficient to bind A168-A170 with high affinity. This helical region predictably docks into the surface groove of A168-A170. Furthermore, pull-down assays demonstrate that the loop protrusion in A168-A170 is a key mediator of MuRF-1 recognition. Our findings indicate that this region of titin could serve as a target to attempt therapeutic inhibition of MuRF-1-mediated muscle turnover, where binding of small molecules to its distinctive structural features could block MuRF-1 access."
https://openalex.org/W2171845995,"Microtubule behavior changes during the cell cycle and during spindle assembly. However, it remains unclear how these changes are regulated and coordinated. We describe a complex that targets the Protein Phosphatase 2A holoenzyme (PP2A) to centrosomes in C. elegans embryos. This complex includes Regulator of Spindle Assembly 1 (RSA-1), a targeting subunit for PP2A, and RSA-2, a protein that binds and recruits RSA-1 to centrosomes. In contrast to the multiple functions of the PP2A catalytic subunit, RSA-1 and RSA-2 are specifically required for microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and for spindle assembly. The centrosomally localized RSA-PP2A complex mediates these functions in part by regulating two critical mitotic effectors: the microtubule destabilizer KLP-7 and the C. elegans regulator of spindle assembly TPXL-1. By regulating a subset of PP2A functions at the centrosome, the RSA complex could therefore provide a means of coordinating microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and kinetochore microtubule stability during mitotic spindle assembly.

A mitotic spindle is a bipolar microtubule-based structure that ensures accurate inheritance of genetic material. As cells enter mitosis, the interphase microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized to form the mitotic spindle. During spindle formation, microtubule dynamics are modulated globally but also locally at spindle poles and in the vicinity of chromatin (Desai and Mitchison, 1997Desai A. Mitchison T.J.

Numerous studies have shown that the function of many organizers of the microtubule cytoskeleton, such as microtubule motors and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), is modulated by their phosphorylation state (Verde et al., 1990Verde F. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Karsenti E.

Accessory protein regulation of microtubule dynamics throughout the cell cycle.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A key question that remains poorly understood is how protein phosphorylation is regulated temporally and spatially during spindle assembly. Phosphorylation states are determined by the balanced activities of kinases and phosphatases. Mitotic kinases (Nigg, 2001Nigg E.A. Mitotic kinases as regulators of cell division and its checkpoints.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) rely largely on consensus sequence motifs for substrate recognition; however, recent work suggests that kinase activation and targeting can also occur through specific adaptor proteins. Examples include TPX2, which leads to activation of Aurora A kinase and its binding to spindle microtubules (Gruss and Vernos, 2004Gruss O.J. Vernos I. The mechanism of spindle assembly: functions of Ran and its target TPX2.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the chromosomal passenger proteins INCENP and Survivin, which localize and activate Aurora B kinase (Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. The cellular geography of aurora kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatases, which counteract the activity of kinases, are also required for correct microtubule organization. Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), for example, has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle (Gliksman et al., 1992Gliksman N.R. Parsons S.F. Salmon E.D. Okadaic acid induces interphase to mitotic-like microtubule dynamic instability by inactivating rescue.J.

Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. Protein phosphatase 4 is required for centrosome maturation in mitosis and sperm meiosis in C. elegans.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1403-1410PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of substrates during mitosis is presumably as tightly controlled as the corresponding phosphorylation reactions. However, there are far fewer phosphatases than kinases present in eukaryotic cells, and unlike kinases, most phosphatases do not appear to target consensus sequence motifs. This implies a far more complex regulation of individual phosphatases, and regulatory subunits are crucial for the activity as well as the specificity of phosphatases (Faux and Scott, 1996Faux M.C.

PP2A, for instance, forms heterotrimeric complexes consisting of a catalytic C subunit and a structural A subunit (the core heterodimer) and a variable regulatory B subunit. The association of the core heterodimer with different B subunits can modulate phosphatase activity, localization, or substrate specificity (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V. Goris J.

However, little is known about how regulatory subunits determine phosphatase function during mitosis and how they themselves are regulated. In C. elegans embryos, centrosomes dominate the spindle-assembly process (Hamill et al., 2002Hamill D.R. Severson A.F. Carter J.C. Bowerman B.

Shortly before mitotic spindle assembly, microtubule levels at C. elegans centrosomes increase about 5-fold (Hannak et al., 2002Hannak E. Oegema K. Kirkham M. Gonczy P. Habermann B. Hyman A.A. The kinetically dominant assembly pathway for centrosomal asters in Caenorhabditis elegans is gamma-tubulin dependent.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A subset of these microtubules attach to the holocentric kinetochores to form kinetochore microtubules. Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screens and forward genetics have identified a number of centrosome-localized effectors required for spindle assembly (reviewed in Oegema and Hyman, 2006Oegema, K., and Hyman, T. (2006), WormBook, ed. The C. elegans Research Community (WormBook) 10.1895/wormbook.1.72.1, http://www.wormbook.org.Google Scholar). Microtubule nucleation requires centrosomal core components and a trimeric γ-tubulin complex (Hannak et al., 2002Hannak E. Oegema K. Kirkham M. Gonczy P. Habermann B. Hyman A.A. The kinetically dominant assembly pathway for centrosomal asters in Caenorhabditis elegans is gamma-tubulin dependent.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Plus-end growth of microtubules away from the centrosome depends on free tubulin and the activity of a complex of ZYG-9 (the C. elegans ortholog of the microtubule stabilizer XMAP215) and its activator TAC-1 (Srayko et al., 2005Srayko M.

Proper length of kinetochore microtubules and therefore the stability of the assembling mitotic spindle depends on the activity of the Aurora A kinase AIR-1 and its activator TPXL-1 (Ozlu et al., 2005Ozlu N.

Cell. 2005; 9: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how the process of spindle assembly is controlled temporally and spatially and how the different aspects of microtubule dynamics are coordinated to form this complex structure. Here we identify a C. elegans protein complex that is required for two distinct processes in spindle formation: the outgrowth of microtubules from centrosomes and the stability of kinetochore microtubules. This complex consists of the new RSA-1 and RSA-2 proteins (Regulator of Spindle Assembly) and the core centrosomal protein SPD-5 and constitutes a centrosome-targeting module for Protein Phosphatase 2A. During a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in C. elegans embryos, we identified C25A1.9, an uncharacterized gene whose silencing disrupted mitotic spindle assembly (Sonnichsen et al., 2005Sonnichsen B. Koski L.B. Walsh A. Marschall P. Neumann B. Brehm M. Alleaume A.M. Artelt J. Bettencourt P. Cassin E. et al.Full-genome RNAi profiling of early embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2005; 434: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Based on its RNAi phenotype and likely regulatory function (see below) we termed C25A1.9 rsa-1, for regulator of spindle assembly. In rsa-1(RNAi) embryos, centrosomal microtubules were reduced (Figure 1A and Movie S1) and centrosomes collapsed onto chromatin after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and separated again at anaphase (Figures 1A and 1B). We used electron-microscope tomography to investigate the structure of the collapsed spindles more closely. Three-dimensional modeling of tomographic sections from rsa-1(RNAi) embryos with collapsed spindles showed that microtubules still contacted the chromatin (Figure 1D), suggesting that these spindles are otherwise intact and that kinetochore microtubules form but are less stable than in wild-type spindles. We confirmed the rsa-1(RNAi) phenotype by isolating a mutant in rsa-1 using ethyl-methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis and TILLING to identify mutants in the gene (Figure S1; for a review of the TILLING method see Stemple, 2004Stemple D.L. TILLING–a high-throughput harvest for functional genomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mutant allele rsa-1(dd13), predicted to give rise to a C-terminally truncated protein (Figures S1B and S1C), caused a phenotype indistinguishable from that of rsa-1(RNAi) embryos (Figure 1A and Movie S1). RSA-1 encodes a 404 amino acid (aa) protein with sequence similarity to B-type regulatory subunits of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Figure S2). PP2A regulatory B subunits belong to one of at least three groups, the B, B′, or B″ families (Janssens and Goris, 2001Janssens V. Goris J. Protein phosphatase 2A: a highly regulated family of serine/threonine phosphatases implicated in cell growth and signalling.Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). Based on sequence conservation, the B″ subunits can be grouped into two classes: the PR48/PR130 and the TON2 subfamilies (Figure S2). RSA-1 is most closely related to B″ subunits of the TON2 subfamily (Figure S2). Consistent with this classification, the Arabidopsis thaliana B″ PP2A subunit TON2 has been implicated in aspects of microtubule cytoskeleton organization (Camilleri et al., 2002Camilleri C. Azimzadeh J. Pastuglia M. Bellini C. Grandjean O. Bouchez D. The Arabidopsis TONNEAU2 gene encodes a putative novel protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit essential for the control of the cortical cytoskeleton.Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To test biochemically whether RSA-1 associates with a PP2A core heterodimer in C. elegans, we generated a worm strain expressing RSA-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and immunoprecipitated the protein using anti-GFP antibodies. The gfp::rsa-1 transgene fully rescued rsa-1(dd13) mutants, indicating that it is functional in vivo (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). GFP::RSA-1 coprecipitated with the PP2A catalytic and structural subunits LET-92 and PAA-1, indicating that RSA-1 functions as part of a PP2A heterotrimeric complex. In addition to the PP2A core heterodimer, we consistently coimmunoprecipitated the core centrosomal protein SPD-5 and an uncharacterized protein, Y48A6B.11 (Table 1). SPD-5 is a coiled-coil protein required for the recruitment of all known components of the pericentriolar material (PCM) and thus is essential for the formation of functional centrosomes (Hamill et al., 2002Hamill D.R. Severson A.F. Carter J.C. Bowerman B. Centrosome maturation and mitotic spindle assembly in C. elegans require SPD-5, a protein with multiple coiled-coil domains.Dev.

Centriole assembly requires both centriolar and pericentriolar material proteins.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no direct interaction partners of SPD-5 have been described to date. Y48A6B.11 is a coiled-coil-containing 108 kDa protein with no obvious homologs in other organisms. Y48A6B.11(RNAi) embryos displayed a phenotype indistinguishable from that of rsa-1(RNAi) embryos (Figures 1A and 1C and Movie S1). Therefore, we refer to this gene as rsa-2.Table 1RSA-1 Coimmunoprecipitates with a PP2A Complex, SPD-5 and the Uncharacterized Protein Y48A6B.11 (RSA-2)Proteins Coimmunoprecipitating Specifically with RSA-1Y48A6B.11 (RSA-2)Uncharacterized protein.

Open table in a new tab RSA-1 Coimmunoprecipitates with a PP2A Core Complex, SPD-5, and Y48A6B.11 Proteins coimmunoprecipitating with GFP::RSA-1 were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by nanoLC-MS-MS. Corresponding molecular weight region samples of RSA-1 and control experiments were compared. Proteins that specifically coprecipitated with RSA-1 in two independent experiments are listed. Consistent with the association of RSA-1 and RSA-2 with SPD-5, antibodies raised against these two proteins labeled centrosomes in wild-type embryos (Figure 2A), as did GFP fusions of the proteins (data not shown). The centrosomal staining was strongly reduced after RNAi knockdown of the respective proteins, confirming the specificity of the antibodies and the RNAi phenotypes (Figure 2A). In spd-5(RNAi) embryos, we could not detect any localized intracellular staining for RSA-1 or RSA-2, indicating that both proteins depend on SPD-5 for binding to centrosomes (data not shown). In order to investigate the assembly relationship between RSA-1 and RSA-2, we determined the location of each protein in the absence of the other. In both rsa-1(RNAi) embryos (Figure 2A) and rsa-1(dd13) mutants (data not shown), RSA-2 localized correctly to centrosomes. However, in rsa-2(RNAi) embryos, RSA-1 was not detected on centrosomes (Figure 2A). Western blotting showed that RSA-1 levels were decreased by about 50% upon rsa-2(RNAi) and RSA-2 levels were also reduced by about 50% in rsa-1(RNAi) (Figure 2C). These results suggested that RSA-2 is specifically required for the centrosomal recruitment of RSA-1, while RSA-1 appears to be dispensable for RSA-2 binding to centrosomes. A GFP-tagged version of the RSA-1-associated PP2A catalytic subunit LET-92 also localized to centrosomes. GFP::PP2AcLET-92 fluorescence was additionally observed in the cytoplasm and around chromatin after NEBD. After depletion of RSA-1, the centrosomal GFP::PP2AcLET-92 signal was no longer detectable, while the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools persisted (Figure 2B and Movie S2). These localization results suggested an assembly hierarchy of SPD-5, RSA-2, RSA-1, and the PP2A catalytic subunit onto centrosomes. In order to investigate how the RSA proteins facilitate PP2A binding to centrosomes, we performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis. These experiments suggested that RSA-2 could directly bind to both RSA-1 and the core PCM protein SPD-5 (Figure 2D and Table S1). Furthermore, we found that the amino-terminal part of RSA-2 interacted with SPD-5 and its carboxy-terminal half with RSA-1 (not shown), indicating that RSA-2 acts as a scaffold to link the phosphatase complex to centrosomes. These results support the view of a linear assembly pathway that is based on direct protein-protein interactions, whereby the centrosomal core protein SPD-5 links RSA-2 to centrosomes, which then recruits RSA-1, the localizing B regulatory subunit for the PP2A complex (Figure 2E). To more closely examine the functions of RSA-1 and RSA-2, we measured centrosomal GFP::β-tubulin fluorescence in rsa-1(RNAi) and rsa-2(RNAi) embryos. Centrosomal microtubules were reduced to 10%–20% of wild-type levels during prophase, and a small nonuniform accumulation of tubulin at centrosomes appeared after NEBD (Figures 3A–3D and Movie S1). Consistent with the microtubule reduction observed in rsa-1(RNAi) and rsa-2(RNAi) embryos, depletion of these proteins also caused a substantial decrease in outgrowth of microtubule plus ends from centrosomes (Movie S3). The number of microtubules growing out from rsa-1(RNAi) centrosomes at metaphase was previously measured to be approximately 25% of the wild-type number (Srayko et al., 2005Srayko M. Kaya A. Stamford J. Hyman A.A. Identification and characterization of factors required for microtubule growth and nucleation in the early C. elegans embryo.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 223-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether RSA-1- and RSA-2-mediated stabilization of centrosomal microtubules requires the PP2A catalytic subunit LET-92, we examined let-92(RNAi) embryos. In contrast to RSA-1 or RSA-2 depletion, let-92(RNAi) resulted in a highly pleiotropic phenotype, including a failure in meiotic spindle disassembly, a failure in the formation of nuclear envelopes around the pronuclei and unseparated centrosomes. Nevertheless, a spindle-like bipolar structure eventually formed (Figure 4A and Movie S4), but with greatly reduced microtubule numbers at the poles (Figure 4A, compare let-92(RNAi) panel IV with wild-type anaphase stage embryo in the right panel). The pleiotropic defects observed in let-92(RNAi) embryos made it difficult to compare the function of this phosphatase with the functions of RSA-1 and RSA-2 in centrosomal microtubule stability. We therefore used the PP2A and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitor Calyculin A to remove phosphatase activity from embryos that had progressed into mitosis normally. Embryos expressing YFP::α-tubulin were mounted in the presence or absence of Calyculin A, which does not penetrate the eggshell. A UV laser was used to perforate the eggshell during mitosis, facilitating the entry of Calyculin A into the cytoplasm. In embryos exposed to Calyculin A, microtubules rapidly disappeared from centrosomes (Figure 4B and Movie S5). These observations indicate that phosphatase catalytic activity is required for microtubule stability at spindle poles. Our results so far suggested that RSA-1 and RSA-2 mediate a specific subset of PP2A functions that are required for maintenance of normal microtubule levels at centrosomes. Microtubule amounts at C. elegans centrosomes are also modulated by KLP-7, the only identified Kinesin-13 in C. elegans (Desai et al., 1999Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Kin I kinesins are microtubule-destabilizing enzymes.Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, Siddiqui, 2002Siddiqui S.S. Metazoan motor models: kinesin superfamily in C. elegans.Traffic. 2002; 3: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the RSA complex, which normally stabilizes microtubules, KLP-7 reduces the microtubule number at centrosomes. Specifically, the number of microtubule plus ends growing out from centrosomes is doubled in klp-7(RNAi) embryos (Srayko et al., 2005Srayko M. Kaya A. Stamford J. Hyman A.A. Identification and characterization of factors required for microtubule growth and nucleation in the early C. elegans embryo.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 223-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, KLP-7 and the RSA complex have opposite effects on microtubule outgrowth. Indeed codepletion of KLP-7 and either RSA-1 or RSA-2 restored centrosomal microtubules to wild-type levels. However, spindle poles still collapsed onto each other (Figures 5A and 5B and Movies S6 and S7; for controls, see Experimental Procedures). Similar results were obtained when KLP-7 was depleted from rsa-1(dd13) mutant embryos (Figure S3 and Movie S8). Thus, codepletion of KLP-7 rescues the microtubule outgrowth defect in rsa-1(RNAi), rsa-1(dd13), and rsa-2(RNAi) embryos but cannot rescue spindle instability. This result indicates that the RSA complex has at least two functions in the formation of a mitotic spindle: regulation of kinetochore microtubule length and regulation of microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes. The above result also suggested that the nucleation capacity of the centrosomes is intact in the absence of RSA-1 and RSA-2. Consistent with this notion, we found that γ-tubulin, the major microtubule nucleator in C. elegans embryos (Hannak et al., 2002Hannak E. Oegema K. Kirkham M. Gonczy P. Habermann B. Hyman A.A. The kinetically dominant assembly pathway for centrosomal asters in Caenorhabditis elegans is gamma-tubulin dependent.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), localizes normally in rsa-1(RNAi) and rsa-2(RNAi) embryos (Figures 5C, S4A, and S4B). We suggest that the RSA complex acts in a process downstream of microtubule nucleation per se and regulates the outgrowth of nucleated microtubules. The RSA complex could control microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes directly by regulating KLP-7 catalytic activity, or indirectly, for instance by regulating KLP-7 levels at centrosomes. We tested whether the RSA-PP2A complex affects KLP-7 localization using a transgenic line expressing GFP-tagged KLP-7. KLP-7 levels at centrosomes were about 1.6–1.8-fold increased in rsa-1(RNAi), as compared to wild-type (Figures 5D and 5E and Movie S9). This observation indicated that the RSA-PP2A complex controls microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes at least in part by restricting the levels of the microtubule destabilizer KLP-7 at centrosomes. The collapse of spindle poles at NEBD and their subsequent re-elongation observed in rsa-1(RNAi) (Figures 1A and 1B and Movie S1) as well as the ultrastructure of rsa-1(RNAi) spindles obtained by EM tomography (Figure 1D) are very reminiscent of the depletion phenotype described earlier for the Aurora kinase activator TPXL-1 (Ozlu et al., 2005Ozlu N. Srayko M. Kinoshita K. Habermann B. O'Toole E.T. Muller-Reichert T. Schmalz N. Desai A. Hyman A.A. An essential function of the C. elegans ortholog of TPX2 is to localize activated aurora A kinase to mitotic spindles.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of the RSA complex in regulating TPXL-1. Consistent with this idea, TPXL-1 amounts at centrosomes were substantially reduced after depletion of RSA-1 (Figure 6A). The decrease in TPXL-1 at the centrosome did not result from the reduced microtubule number, as it was also observed when microtubule amounts were restored to wild-type levels by codepletion of KLP-7 and RSA-1 (Figures 6A and 6B and Movie S10). Similar results were obtained in rsa-2(RNAi) (data not shown). We next determined whether TPXL-1 and the RSA proteins also interact physically. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of TPXL-1 resulted in copurification of the RSA complex, as judged by Western blot and mass spectrometry (Figure 6C and Table S2). Depletion of the RSA complex did not affect the localization of other known centrosomal regulators, (see Figure S4). Based on these results, we conclude that the RSA complex contributes to mitotic spindle assembly, at least in part by targeting TPXL-1 to centrosomes, likely via a direct physical interaction. One of the major questions regarding phosphatase regulation is how target specificity is achieved. Our data suggest that PP2AcLET-92 activity in the C. elegans embryo is regulated by the RSA centrosome-targeting complex, indicating that the RSA complex confers temporal and spatial specificity to the PP2A holoenzyme. This result further suggests that other regulatory subunits could mediate different functions of PP2AcLET-92 in the early embryo. Indeed, out of the potential PP2A subunits of the B, B′, and B″ classes identified by BLAST searches (seven proteins in total), the B type subunit SUR-6 has a clear function in early embryonic mitoses (Kao et al., 2004Kao G. Tuck S. Baillie D. Sundaram M.V.

SUR-6, therefore, appears to mediate LET-92 functions that are separate from those regulated by RSA-1. The Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of RSA-1, TON2, is also required for microtubule organization (Camilleri et al., 2002Camilleri C. Azimzadeh J. Pastuglia M. Bellini C. Grandjean O. Bouchez D.

DnaK has additional functions that are indispensable for the targeting of CueO. Folded proteins can be translocated across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane if they are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide that is recognizable by the Tat (twin-arginine translocation) system (1Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Signal sequences of these proteins have a polar N terminus (n-region), which is followed by an uncharged and more or less hydrophobic sequence (h-region). If the signal sequence is cleavable, a recognition site for a leader peptidase marks the end of the signal sequence (c-region). Importantly, Tat signal sequences typically carry a sequence motif that includes two conserved arginine residues, the eponymous “twin arginine motif” (2Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The Tat signal sequence of the high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP) 2The abbreviation used is: HiPIP, high potential iron-sulfur protein. from Allochromatium vinosum is the best studied cleavable Tat signal. It has been shown not to fold per se, even when the connected mature domain is completely folded (3Kipping M. Lilie H. Lindenstrauss U. Andreesen J.R. Griesinger C. Carlomagno T. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Tat signal sequences are therefore in principle sensitive toward proteolytic attacks. Accordingly, proteolytic degradation up to the mature folded domain is often observed with recombinant Tat substrates in vivo (4Sturm A. Schierhorn A. Lindenstrauss U. Lilie H. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13972-13978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For this reason, it is likely that there exist signal sequence binding chaperones that ensure the integrity of the signal sequence prior to the recognition by the Tat apparatus under physiological expression levels. In the case of transported Me2SO reductase subunits (DmsAB), periplasmic trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA), and hydrogenase 2 (HybOC), specific signal sequence binding chaperones have been identified, which are likely to play important roles in the folding or cofactor assembly of the corresponding mature domain (5Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F.

The TorA signal-binding chaperone TorD has also been demonstrated to prevent degradation of the TorA signal sequence in recombinant TorA signal-green fluorescent protein fusion proteins (8Genest O. Seduk F. Ilbert M. Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, no such specific chaperones have been found for Tat substrates that contain only [4Fe-4S] clusters, such as NapG, NrfC, or YdhX (1Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In line with this, the [4Fe-4S] cluster containing HiPIP from A. vinosum has been found to be efficiently translocated by the heterologous Escherichia coli Tat system, demonstrating that Tat substrates do exist that can be translocated without the presence of a specific signal-binding chaper-one (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further, no specific signal-binding chaperones have been identified so far for Tat substrates with single metal ion cofactors or without predicted cofactors (1Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We therefore searched for more general Tat signal-binding proteins, which could serve to bind many different signal sequences without being adapted to certain specific Tat substrates. In our approach, we profited from our previously established efficient in vitro folding procedure for the HiPIP precursor (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This method allowed us to use fully folded HiPIP and derivatives with exchanged Tat signal sequences for affinity purification of general Tat signal sequence-binding proteins. As a result, we identified the chaperones SlyD, GroEL, and DnaK. The data suggest that especially SlyD and DnaK are both functioning as broad range Tat signal sequence binding chaperones in E. coli. An essential function could be specifically assigned to DnaK for the targeting of the Tat substrate CueO. Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli MC4100 (10Casadaban M.J. J. Mol.

The PCR products with the amiA and cueO signal sequence coding regions were digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEXH5-BamHI, resulting in the expression plasmids pEX-amiA(ss)-hip or pEX-cueO(ss)-hip, respectively. For in vivo analyses, the signal sequence coding region of cueO was amplified using the primer pair, CueO-NdeI-F (as above) and CueO-BamHI-R2 (5′-TTG GGG GAT CCG CCG CAA ATA CTG CGC GGC TC-3′). The PCR product was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pEXH5-BamHI-tac, resulting in the expression plasmid pEX-cueO(ss)-hip-tac. The plasmid pEX-mat-hip, which served for the expression of mature untagged HiPIP, was generated by amplification of the mature region of hip in pEXH5 using the primer pair mat-hip-NdeI-F (5′-CCG GCC ATA TGT CCG CTC CCG CCA ATG CCG-3′) and hip-XhoI-R (5′-GTG CTC GAG TGC GGC CGC AAG-3′), followed by a restriction with NdeI and XhoI and ligation into the corresponding sites of pEXH5. The hip gene encoding Strep-tagged HiPIP was expressed from pBW-hip-strep, and the signal sequence-deficient mature domain was produced from pBW-mat-hip-strep. For construction of pBW-hip-strep, hip was amplified by PCR with pEXH5 as template using the primer pair hip-NdeI-F (5′-GGA GAT ATA CAT ATG TCC GAT AAG CCA ATC AGC-3′) and hip-BamHI-R (5′-AAC GGG GAT CCG CCG GCC TTC AGG GTC CAG-3′), and the PCR product was introduced into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a Strep tag derivative of pBW22 (16Wilms B. Hauck A. Reuss M. Syldatk C. Mattes R. Siemann M. Altenbuchner J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 73: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to allow a rhamnose-inducible production of a C-terminal Strep tag II fusion of HiPIP. The vector pBW-mat-hip-strep was analogously constructed, but the signal sequence coding region was excluded by using the forward primer hip-mat-NdeI-F (5′-CCG CCC ATA TGT CCG CTC CCG CCA ATG CCG-3′) in the PCR. Similarly, also cueO could be expressed with this system. Since cueO contains a natural NdeI site, cueO was cloned with two fragments using the primer pairs cueO-NdeI-F (5′-GAA ATA CAT ATG CAA CGT CGT GAT TTC TTA-3′)/cueO-ClaI-R (5′-ACG TAA TCG ATA CCC CAC TGT TTT GG-3′) and cueO-ClaI-F (5′-GAA GAA TCG ATG ATG TTC CGG TGA TCG-3′)/cueO-BamHI-R (5′-GAG TTG GAT CCT ACC GTA AAC CCT AAC ATC ATC-3′). The fragments were restricted with NdeI/ClaI or ClaI/BamHI, respectively, and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the vector. For mature CueO, the signal sequence coding region was omitted by use of the alternative forward primer matcueO-NdeI-F (5′-GCA GTA CAT ATG GCA GAA CGC CCA ACG TTA C-3′) and the same cloning strategy. The cueO gene was also expressed from pEX-cueO-H6-tac, which encodes a hexahistidine-tagged CueO under control of the tac promoter. The cueO gene was amplified using the primer pair cueO-NdeI-F (5′-GAA ATA CAT ATG CAA CGT CGT GAT TTC TTA-3′) and cueO-XhoI-R (5′-TAT ACC TCG AGC CCT AAC ATC ATC CCC GTA TC-3′), the PCR product was restricted with NdeI and XhoI, and the full-length fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of pEXH5 (14Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), resulting in pEX-cueO-H6. The cueO-H6-containing fragment of this vector was excised with XbaI and ScaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pTB-DG (17Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), resulting in pEX-cueO-H6-tac. The ycdB gene was expressed from pBAD-ycdB-strep (4Sturm A. Schierhorn A. Lindenstrauss U. Lilie H. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13972-13978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The vector pBAD-mat-ycdB-strep was analogously constructed, but the signal sequence coding region was excluded by using the forward primer ycdB-mat-NcoI-F (5′-GAA TCC ATG GAA AAA ACG CAA AGT-3′) in the PCR. All constructs were confirmed by restriction analyses and sequencing. The ΔdnaK ΔslyD strain was generated from JWK3311 by removal of the kanamycin cassette according to the protocol of Datsenko and Wanner (12Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11190) Google Scholar) and P1 transduction from the ΔdnaK::Km strain JWK0013 (E. coli BW25113 ΔdnaK::Km). The gene deletions were confirmed by PCR and by immunoblots using specific antibodies against DnaK (Acris antibodies; Hiddenhausen) and SlyD (a kind gift of C. Schiene-Fischer, Halle, Germany). Biochemical Methods—Inclusion bodies of HiPIP precursor variants were produced and folded as described previously (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mature HiPIP was purified after recombinant expression in BL21 DE3 from the soluble fraction as follows: 2-liter cultures of BL21 DE3 pEXH5-mat were aerobically grown and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD600 nm of 0.8. After a 2-h induction, cells were harvested, resuspended in five volumes of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, and disintegrated by two French pressure cell passages at 130 MPa. Cell debris and membranes were removed by subsequent centrifugations (20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C and 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C), and the soluble fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 9.0. Bound HiPIP was eluted by a shift to pH 6.8 with 50 mm ammonium acetate. The eluted HiPIP-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, loaded on a MonoQ column, and eluted by a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. HiPIP eluted at 400 mm and was further purified by gel permeation chromatography using a Superose 6 column. Mature HiPIP was virtually pure (>98%). The quality of folded HiPIP and its derivatives was assessed by UV-visible spectroscopy, using a Ultrospec 4000 (Amersham Biosciences). For affinity chromatography, HiPIP derivatives were covalently coupled to 2-ml Aminolink™ matrices (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytoplasmic extracts from 3 g of cells in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, were loaded and incubated at room temperature for 1 h on the column. After extensive washing with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, the bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. For further analyses, elution fractions were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), and protein estimations followed standard protocols (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), using sera against purified DmsA (a generous gift of Joel Weiner), YcdB (purified as described previously (4Sturm A. Schierhorn A. Lindenstrauss U. Lilie H. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13972-13978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)), or hexahistidine-tagged HiPIP (14Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For identification of proteins, Coomassie-stained bands were cut out of the gels, and tryptic peptides were generated, eluted, and identified by mass spectrometry as described previously (20Gutensohn M. Pahnke S. Kolukisaoglu U. Schulz B. Schierhorn A. Voigt A. Hust B. Rollwitz I. Stöckel J. Geimer S. Albrecht V. Flügge U.I. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using a Q-TOF 2 mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The mass spectrometer was equipped with a modified nanoelectrospray ionization source to hold a picotip (New Objective, Cambridge, MA). The collision energy was determined on the fly based on the mass and charge state of the peptide. Charge state recognition was used to switch into MS/MS mode on only doubly and triply charged ions. Per survey scan, up to three components were monitored. Spectra were acquired in MS mode at 1 s/scan and in MS/MS mode at 3 s/scan. The data were processed to generate a searchable peak list. These files were then fed into the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK). The data were searched against the MSDB protein sequence data base. Identification of SlyD as a General Tat Signal Sequence-binding Protein in Vitro—HiPIP from A. vinosum is a Tat substrate that can be efficiently translocated by the E. coli Tat system (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The signal sequence of HiPIP has been shown to be per se unfolded in solution and highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation in vitro (3Kipping M. Lilie H. Lindenstrauss U. Andreesen J.R. Griesinger C. Carlomagno T. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the signal sequence of HiPIP is cytoplasmically only degraded at higher expression levels, when translocation becomes limiting. Similar observations have been made with other recombinant Tat substrates, such as YcdB (4Sturm A. Schierhorn A. Lindenstrauss U. Lilie H. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13972-13978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was therefore likely that a titratable factor exists that is able to bind and protect Tat signal sequences and that could be involved in targeting of Tat substrates. Since HiPIP is a heterologous Tat substrate in E. coli, this titratable factor was likely to be a general signal sequence binding chaperone with affinity to many signal sequences. We thus focused on the identification of proteins with Tat signal sequence binding activities that could serve that purpose. In the past, we identified DnaK as a chaperone that binds to HiPIP precursor (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and others found that DnaK bound the signal sequence of DmsA (5Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, DnaK-deficient strains were not significantly affected in the translocation of the Tat substrates HiPIP or SufI (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Jong W.S. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Genevaux P. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4779-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since DnaK is an abundant chaperone that may compete with alternative chaperones for binding sites on Tat signal sequences, we avoided this problem by using extracts of a dnaK-deficient strain for affinity purifications. Homogeneous HiPIP precursor was coupled to an Aminolink™ (Pierce) matrix, and membrane-free crude extract was loaded on the column. After a washing step, HiPIP-binding proteins were eluted with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1A). One dominant protein band near 28 kDa and two faint bands (near 55 and 90 kDa) were detectable in the elution fractions. As identified by mass spectrometric analyses of peptides from the individual Coomassie-stained bands, the dominant band represented the chaperone SlyD, whereas the faint bands represented the chaperone GroEL and the endopeptidase MepA. MepA is periplasmic and thus no reasonable candidate for a signal sequence binding chaperone. In a control experiment, mature HiPIP was shown not to bind any soluble protein under these experimental conditions, indicating that all identified proteins bound HiPIP precursor in a signal sequence-dependent mode (Fig. 1B). Since HiPIP is not an E. coli protein, these data were promising in that they pointed to general signal sequence binding activities of the detected chaperones. We tested this hypothesis by use of the two completely unrelated Tat signal sequences of CueO and AmiA. Both sequences were fused to the mature domain of HiPIP. This allowed us to exclude any unspecific binding and was very convenient, since fully folded and pure precursor fusion proteins could be obtained in large amounts by the same method as described for native HiPIP precursor (9Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As with native HiPIP, the affinity chromatographies with AmiAss-HiPIP and CueOss-HiPIP resulted in the isolation of the chaperones SlyD and GroEL from DnaK-free extracts (Fig. 2, A and B). With CueOss-HiPIP there was a broader stained area below 70 kDa in which we could only detect GroEL. MepA was not present in these elutions, indicating that MepA does not generally bind signal sequences. In all cases, SlyD was the predominant Tat signal sequence-interacting chaperone in the absence of DnaK. Importantly, SlyD and DnaK, but not GroEL, were identified as signal sequence-binding proteins when DnaK-containing extracts were used for affinity purification (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1). SlyD was the predominant signal sequence-binding protein also in these cases. We therefore tested which proteins bind Tat signal sequences when extracts without SlyD are used for affinity purification (supplemental Fig. S2). With the HiPIP precursor, we found DnaK as a strongly interacting chaperone. Interestingly, with AmiAss-HiPIP, we identified YcfD, an essential protein of unknown function (22Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. Campbell J.W. Balazsi G. Ravasz E. Daugherty M.D. Somera A.L. Kyrpides N.C. Anderson I. Gelfand M.S. Bhattacharya A. Kapatral V. D'Souza M. Baev M.V. Grechkin Y. Mseeh F. Fonstein M.Y. Overbeek R. Barabasi A.L. Oltvai Z.N. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and SlpA (SlyD-like protein) (23Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Plückthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Together, the affinity screen for Tat signal sequence-binding proteins identified SlyD as a new chaperone that generally binds to Tat signal sequences in addition to DnaK in vitro. Moreover, YcfD and SlpA can bind the signal sequence of AmiA. GroEL can also bind signal sequences, but this chaperone is most likely less important for signal sequence binding under conditions when DnaK is present, because it was not detectable in affinity chromatographies with extracts containing DnaK. DnaK Is Essential for the Tat Transport of CueO—Having identified DnaK and SlyD as the most likely general Tat signal sequence binding chaperones in E. coli, we analyzed the effect of their absence on the transport and stability of Tat substrates. At first, we chose for this analysis the Tat substrate CueO, for which specific signal sequence chaperones are not predicted (1Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CueO is a multicopper oxidase that is involved in copper homeostasis in E. coli (24Tree J.J. Kidd S.P. Jennings M.P. McEwan A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Grass G. Thakali K. Klebba P.E. Thieme D. Muller A. Wildner G.F. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5826-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The transport of recombinant CueO was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and Western blot detection in wild type E. coli, in strains with single or double deletions in the slyD and dnaK genes, and in a tatC deletion strain. In the ΔslyD/ΔdnaK strain, the transport was blocked, and no processed CueO was anymore detectable in the periplasm, whereas full-length CueO accumulated inside the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). The absence of the chaperones thus affected translocation without compromising the stability of the precursor in the cytoplasm. When we analyzed the effects that were already caused by single deletions in the slyD or dnaK genes, we found that the transport of CueO was not inhibited in the ΔslyD strain, whereas in the ΔdnaK strain no mature CueO was detectable in the periplasm (Fig. 3). Due to the block of translocation, CueO precursor clearly accumulated in the cytoplasm of the ΔdnaK strain. Traces of precursor and intermediate size CueO were reproducibly released into the periplasm by some cytoplasmic leakage due to an increased sensitivity toward the osmotic shock, but no mature size CueO was generated. The leakage of cytoplasmic proteins was supported by the detection of small amounts of cytoplasmic biotin carrier protein in the periplasm of this strain (Fig. 3). We found that the expression of CueO itself caused the leaking, since the ΔdnaK strain fractionated normally in other cases (Fig. 4). It is interesting that the additional absence of SlyD resulted in a normal fractionation behavior. Together, the data indicated that the block of CueO translocation in the ΔslyD/ΔdnaK strain was caused by the absence of DnaK alone and not of SlyD. There was a rather positive effect of the slyD deletion on membrane interaction and translocation of CueO. Without SlyD, CueO appeared more abundant in the membrane and periplasmic fractions. However, as the ΔslyD/ΔdnaK strain was blocked in translocation, the lack of DnaK was dominant over any positive effect of SlyD absence.FIGURE 4Translocation of a CueO signal sequence HiPIP fusion is independent from DnaK. Shown is detection of CueOss-HiPIP in subcellular fractions of strain BW25113 (wt) or its derivatives deleted in slyD and dnaK (ΔslyD/ ΔdnaK), in slyD alone (ΔslyD), in dnaK alone (ΔdnaK), or in tatC (ΔtatC), all containing the plasmid pEX-cueO(ss)-hip-tac. Analysis was as described for Fig. 3, but HiPIP-specific antiserum was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, the CueO data show that DnaK is essential for targeting of CueO at a late stage after an initial folding inside the cytoplasm. Full-length precursor CueO clearly accumulates in the double deletion strain, indicating that this protein folds to a protease-resistant conformation in the absence of DnaK or SlyD. Importantly, the signal sequence of CueO is not degraded in the double or single deletion mutants, suggesting that other chaperones can bind the CueO signal sequence in the absence of DnaK or SlyD. This is not surprising, considering the finding that, for example, GroEL binds the Tat signal sequence of CueO when DnaK is absent (see Fig. 2). DnaK Dependence of CueO Targeting Is Not Only Conferred by Signal Sequence Characteristics—Since SlyD and DnaK act on CueO in vivo, we asked the question whether the chaperone dependence of CueO targeting was only conferred by signal sequence characteristics. To test this, we fused the signal sequence of CueO to the mature domain of HiPIP and assessed the transport of this CueOss-HiPIP fusion protein (Fig. 4). Precursor and mature forms of this fusion protein migrated very closely in SDS-PAGEs. Importantly, CueOss-HiPIP transport was completely blocked in a TatC-deficient strain, underlining a strict Tat dependence of CueOss-HiPIP targeting. CueOss-H"

They bind two unrelated receptors, the Trk family of receptor-tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75). p75 was recently identified as a new substrate for γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane proteolysis, generating a p75-derived intracellular domain (p75-ICD) with signaling capabilities. Using PC12 cells as a model, we studied how neurotrophins activate p75 processing and where these events occur in the cell. We demonstrate that activation of the TrkA receptor upon binding of nerve growth factor (NGF) regulates the metalloprotease-mediated shedding of p75 leaving a membrane-bound p75 C-terminal fragment (p75-CTF). Using subcellular fractionation to isolate a highly purified endosomal fraction, we demonstrate that p75-CTF ends up in endosomes where γ-secretase-mediated p75-CTF cleavage occurs, resulting in the release of a p75-ICD. Moreover, we show similar structural requirements for γ-secretase processing of p75 and amyloid precursor protein-derived CTFs. Thus, NGF-induced endocytosis regulates both signaling and proteolytic processing of p75. Neurotrophins are trophic factors that regulate important neuronal functions.

They regulate different aspects of the developing and adult nervous system by binding to specific members of the Trk family of receptor-tyrosine kinases (TrkA, -B, and -C) or to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75). Their involvement includes neuronal migration, cell death, axonal elongation, myelinization, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (1Gentry J.J. Barker P.A. Carter B.D. Prog.

It binds all neurotrophins, alone or in complex with Trk receptors, but also other ligands such as amyloid peptides and pro-neurotrophins (4Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L.

The association of p75 with different receptors shapes the outcome of a signaling event. For example, binding of p75 to TrkA in the presence of NGF promotes neuronal survival, whereas interaction with the Nogo receptor (NgR) in the presence of its ligands, such as Nogo and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), results in growth cone collapse and the inhibition of axonal regeneration (1Gentry J.J.

In addition, different downstream p75-associated signaling cascades are triggered through the interaction of its cytosolic portion with multiple adaptor proteins (6Roux P.P. Barker P.A. Prog.

The regulation of p75 signaling becomes even more complicated with the finding that p75 is subject to a dual processing starting with shedding of the ectodomain and followed by γ-secretase cleavage. This adds p75 to the growing list of substrates for regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) that includes the amyloid precursor protein (APP), Notch, Syndecan 3, ErbB4, and N-cadherins among others (13Kim D.Y.

Shedding of p75 can be induced by protein kinase C (PKC) activators such as the phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), reminiscent of the regulatory component of APP shedding by the ADAM (a metalloprotease and disintegrin) family of metalloproteases (23Allinson T.M. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 24Kim S.H. Yin Y.I. Li Y.M. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Indeed, in particular ADAM17 has been shown to be involved in phorbol ester-stimulated shedding of p75 in murine fibroblasts (33Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This event produces a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (p75-CTF) that is further processed by γ-secretase resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of p75 (p75-ICD). γ-Secretase is a multiprotein complex that consists of the catalytic presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, Pen-2, and Aph-1. In the case of APP, γ-secretase cleavage releases both amyloid β-peptides and APP-ICD. Initial studies suggested a nuclear translocation and signaling role for APP-ICD (25Pardossi-Piquard R. Petit A. Kawarai T. Sunyach C. Alves da Costa C. Vincent B. Ring S. D'Adamio L. Shen J. Muller U. St George Hyslop P. Checler F.

Derks C. Filippov M.A. Muller U. De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the Notch receptor, the ICD has the potential to regulate gene expression by forming transcriptionally active complexes (27Annaert W. De Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Neuron. 2005; 46: 849-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of growth cone collapse mediated by p75 and NgR in the presence of myelin ligands (35Ahmed Z. Mazibrada G. Seabright R.J. Dent R.G. Berry M. Logan A. Faseb. J. 2006; Google Scholar). Finally, the addition of pro-BDNF or BDNF to sympathetic neurons results in RIP of p75, which is necessary for nuclear translocation of NRIF (a p75 intracellular interactor) and for p75-induced neuronal apoptosis (36Kenchappa R.S.

These examples clearly demonstrate the growing importance of p75 processing for its downstream signaling. Different lines of evidence suggest that early/recycling endosomes might be a major compartment where γ-secretase mediates the cleavage of APP and other substrates such as Notch (37Gupta-Rossi N.

Indeed, the inhibition of γ-secretase activity results in the accumulation of APP-CTFs in recycling endosomes in addition to the cell surface (40Zhang M. Haapasalo A. Kim D.Y. Ingano L.A. Pettingell W.H. Kovacs D.M. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 1176-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Considering that p75 can become internalized (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M.

Cell Neurosci. 2004; 26: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the increasing evidence implicating p75 shedding and RIP in downstream signaling, we have investigated the regulation of p75 processing in PC12 cells. Here we show that p75 shedding is regulated through the activation of the TrkA receptor and that the resulting p75-CTFs end up in endosomes. Using a subcellular fractionation approach we furthermore demonstrate that γ-secretase processing occurs in early/recycling endosomes, resulting in the production of the corresponding p75-ICD fragment. Our data identify the endocytic pathway as a platform for processing of p75 and as a critical junction for regulation of neurotrophin signaling.

Van Broeckhoven (Antwerp, Belgium). Immunofluorescence—PC12 and nnr5 cells were routinely cultured as described (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine cell surface-associated p75, PC12 cells were starved in incubation buffer (IB; 25 mm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/HEPES, pH 7.4 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by PMA treatment (100 ng/ml) in IB for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, cells are washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated on ice with MC192 (3 μg/ml) in IB for 1 h. After fixation (3% PFA in PBS) and blocking (10% donkey serum in PBS, 30 min at room temperature) the primary antibody was visualized using donkey-anti-mouse-Alexa488, washed and mounted in Mowiol. In the case of immuno-endocytosis, PC12 cells were starved (1 h, 37 °C) and incubated with MC192 (3 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml) or NGF (4 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following fixation (3% paraformaldehyde in PBS) and blocking (10% donkey serum in PBS, 30 min at room temperature) cells were incubated with the first secondary antibody (donkey anti-mouse-Alexa647, 30 min in PBS + 5% donkey serum). Next, cells were permeabilized (PBS, 5% donkey serum, 0.2% saponin), incubated with secondary donkey anti-mouse-Alexa555 pAbs, washed, and finally mounted in Mowiol. To study the internalization of the N-terminal HA epitope-tagged p75-CTF construct (HA-p75-CTF), lacking the complete p75 ectodomain in PC12 cells, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used, and cells were processed 24 h after transfection (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zampieri N. Xu C.F. Neubert T.A. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14563-14571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Internalization of HA-p75-CTF was studied by starving the cells (1 h, 37 °C) followed by incubation with anti-HA (3 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were treated with NGF (4 nm; 1 h, 37 °C) in the presence of transferrin-Alexa555 (100 μg/ml). Following fixation and blocking as described above, cells were permeabilized (PBS, 5% donkey serum, 0.2% saponin) and incubated with secondary donkey-anti-mouseAlexa488 pAb, washed, and finally mounted in Mowiol. Microscopy—Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM Pascal 5 (including a triple laser module (Arg 458/488/514 nm, HeNe 543 nm, HeNe 633 nm, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) connected to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 2000) with a ×63 objective. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity was done as described in Ref. 8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and as shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, for each experimental point, 4-5 digital images were taken from two different coverslips (×63 and zoom ×2) in which 100 cells were imaged and quantified with Sigma Scan software. Western Blot Analysis of p75 Fragments—PC12 cells were starved and pretreated with the different inhibitors (5 μm lactacystin, 10 μm GM6001, 0.2 μm compound E) for 1 h at 37 °C in IB followed by neurotrophin treatment (NGF or BDNF, 4 nm) for different times (15 min to 6 h) or PMA (100 ng/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were lysed (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.6) and cleared extracts processed for Western blotting using a pAb against the C terminus of p75. For detection, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used followed by ECL using West Pico (p75-FL) or West Femto (p75 fragments) kits (Pierce). γ-Secretase Presence and Activity in Intracellular Membranes (P2)—A P2 pellet from PC12 cells was prepared essentially as described (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 7-9 confluent 10-cm dishes were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with IB to deplete endogenous growth factors, followed by 2 h at 37 °C with NGF (4 nm). Next, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and, after a final wash with sucrose/HEPES buffer (SHB; 320 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), scraped, and sedimented (800 × g, 15 min). The pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of SHB and homogenized with a ball-bearing homogenizer (cell cracker; EMBL, Germany) with 12-μm clearance. A postnuclear supernatant (1,000 × g, 10 min) was centrifuged over a cushion of 1% Ficoll in SHB (190,000 × g, 20 min). The resulting P2 pellet was resuspended in SHB (+ protease inhibitors) or solubilized in CHAPSO buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 0.25% CHAPSO; pH 6.8) and incubated for different times at 37 °C without or with specific γ-secretase inhibitors (0.2 μm CpE, 10 μm DAPT, or 0.5 μm inhibitor X). After incubation, membranes resuspended in SHB were solubilized with 0.2%, Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice in addition to 5 min at 37 °C. Cleared supernatants were finally analyzed by Western blotting for p75. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments the P2 pellet was solubilized in CHAPS buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 125 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS, pH 7.4). From the cleared lysate, 900 μg of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 7 μg of anti-p75-ICD (Upstate Biotechnologies) and further incubated with 30 μl of TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG IP beads (eBioscience) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS in PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer (10 min, 70 °C) and analyzed by Western blotting for PS1 interaction. γ-Secretase-mediated Peptide Cleavage Assay—γ-Secretase activity was assayed in vitro using an APP-CTF-derived intramolecularly quenched fluorescent peptide according to the manufacturer's instructions (CALBIOCHEM) (46Farmery M.R.

Mentone S. Thomson B. Biemesderfer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34302-34310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg from CHAPSO-solubilized P2 membranes were incubated at 37 °C for different times in 150 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, protease inhibitors, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPSO, pH 6.8, and 8 μm fluorescent APP-CTF-derived peptide. After incubation, the cleared reaction mixture (16,100 × g, 15 min) was transferred to a 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Luminescence spectrometer LS50B (excitation/emission at 350/440 nm). Specific γ-secretase activity was determined after subtracting the fluorescence obtained in the presence of DAPT (10 μm). Background fluorescence was calculated by incubating separately 50 μg of CHAPSO-solubilized P2 membranes and 8 μm APP-CTF-derived peptide with assay buffer for different times and mixing them just before fluorescence determination. Cell Fractionation—Labeling of early/recycling endosomes with transferrin-HRP was done as described (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To label late endosomes, cells were incubated for 90 min with NGF (4 nm) followed by a pulse (10 min) with HRP (0.5 mg/ml) and NGF (4 nm) and a chase (20 min) in the presence of NGF (4 nm) at 37 °C. Next, a P2 pellet was prepared, resuspended in 0.5 ml of SHB and loaded on a 4-ml linear Ficoll gradient (2-16%) over a 1-ml 16% Ficoll cushion. After velocity gradient centrifugation (SW50, 190,000 × g, 20 min), 0.5-ml fractions were manually collected from the top. The three transferrin-HRP or HRP peak fractions from gradient 1 were pooled, centrifuged again (SW50, 190,000 × g, 20 min) over a 4-ml linear Ficoll gradient prepared in SHB (3-16%), and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. HRP activity was measured as described previously (8Bronfman F.C. Tcherpakov M. Jovin T.M. Fainzilber M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Lichtenstein Y. Desnos C. Faundez V. Kelly R.B. Clift-O'Grady L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). From each fraction of gradient 2, 50-70 μl were used for Western blot analysis. For in vitro generation of p75-ICD, endosomal membranes from gradient 2 were incubated in SHB buffer (+ protease inhibitors) 2 or 10 h at 37 °C, with or without DAPT (10 μm) or CpE (0.2 μm), respectively and analyzed by Western blotting. The neuroendocrine PC12 cell line is an established model for NGF signaling and expresses both p75 and TrkA receptors (49Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar, 50Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). It is also used as a model system for synaptic membrane recycling because synaptic proteins recycle through PC12 endosomes (51Faundez V. Horng J.T. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 52Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and is therefore suited to study p75 processing and trafficking. We initiated our studies by analyzing the cell surface-associated full-length p75 (p75-FL) following PMA treatment using a p75 ectodomain-specific mAb. Quantitative confocal microscopy revealed a reduction of nearly 50% of cell surface-associated p75-FL (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blot analysis did not show a similar or substantial reduction of total p75-FL (Fig. 1, E and F). This could be explained by the fact that cell surface-associated p75 represents a part of the total cellular p75, and the levels of PMA-induced p75-CTFs are a minor fraction of the total p75-FL. Alternatively, PKC activation may induce p75 internalization, as has been shown for other receptors (52Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 53Eichholtz T. Vossebeld P. van Overveld M. Ploegh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22490-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this by measuring the cell surface and intracellular pool of p75 before and after permeabilization in control and PMA-treated cells. PMA induced a 5-fold increase in p75 internalization compared with basal levels (Fig. 1, C and D). However, when cells were challenged with NGF, the level of p75 internalization increased 3-fold compared with PMA treatment. This indicates that the trafficking of p75, in addition to being regulated in a ligand-dependent manner, is also regulated by PKC in a ligand-independent manner. In PMA-treated PC12 cells, we also observed the appearance of p75-CTF and p75-ICD fragments (Fig. 1E). The latter could be stabilized by lactacystin or blocked by compound E (CpE), a highly specific γ-secretase inhibitor (54Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higaki J.N. Prakash S.R. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. Arneric S.P. Hartig P.R. Robertson D.W. Cordell B. Stern A.M. Olson R.E. Zaczek R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34086-34091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, E and F). GM6001, a general metalloprotease inhibitor, inhibited both p75-CTF and p75-ICD production, thus demonstrating that p75-CTF generation is a prerequisite for specific γ-secretase processing and production of p75-ICD (Fig. 1F). This contradicts previous findings reported in glial cells (30Frade J.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but agrees with other studies performed in different cell types (21Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jung K.M. Tan S. Landman N. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P.K. Kim D.S. Ryu S.H. Chao M.V. Kim T.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14563-14571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The PMA effect on p75 shedding is most likely because of the activation of ADAMs by PKC (55Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Karkkainen I. Ortiz R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We thought that similar to PMA, NGF might trigger such an effect by activating downstream signaling leading to the regulation of ADAMs activity. Indeed, like PMA, NGF induced p75-CTF and p75-ICD fragments in a metalloprotease- and γ-secretase-dependent manner (Fig. 1G). Following 2 h of NGF treatment, the levels of p75-ICD were similar to those of PMA-treated PC12 cells (Fig. 1H). In addition,"
https://openalex.org/W2068249583,"The involvement of complement (C) in inflammatory diseases has driven the search for agents capable of inhibiting dysregulated complement activation. Many of these reagents inhibit the C3 convertases during the early stages of the cascade. However, a drawback of total systemic C inhibition, particularly in longterm treatment of chronic disease, is potentiation of infection and immune complex disease due to an inability to opsonize complexes and foreign cells and to lyse pathogens. Recent identification of a C5-binding protein in the salivary gland of the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata has enabled development of a terminal pathway-specific reagent, OmCI, with potential to ameliorate disease while leaving key physiological processes unaffected. Here we demonstrated that OmCI has broad cross-species activity. When given intravenously to rodents, OmCI totally ablated complement hemolytic activity, which gradually restored as C5 was resynthesized. The circulating half-life of OmCI was 30 h, demonstrating a much slower clearance than other small, biological agents. Using C5-sufficient and C5-deficient mice we showed that prolonged half-life was due to binding to plasma C5. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of C5 binding to OmCI confirmed a high binding affinity with a slow dissociation rate. OmCI was effective in preventing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis induced by passive transfer in normal Lewis rats. OmCI ablated clinical disease, reduced C3 and C9 deposition at the neuro-muscular junction, and effected a marked reduction in cellular infiltration at this site. These data offer exciting prospects for targeted treatment of complement-mediated diseases without the detrimental inhibition of the opsonic roles of complement.

The complement (C) 2The abbreviations used are: C, complement; OmCI, complement inhibitor from Ornithodoros moubata; EAMG, experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis; AChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; sCR1, soluble recombinant complement receptor 1; MAC, membrane attack complex; α-BuTx, α-Bungarotoxin; NMJ, neuro-muscular junction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Creg, C regulator. system is a crucial arm of innate immunity. It is activated by foreign or antibody-coated surfaces via various different pathways that converge at the formation of the C3 convertase enzyme. This cleaves C3 to C3b, which binds covalently to the target surface. Surface-bound C3b acts as an opsonin, leading to cell death via phagocytosis, or contributes to further progression of the C cascade through formation of the C5 convertase and subsequent cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b. C5a has chemotactic and anaphylactic properties, thereby triggering inflammation and aiding pathogen clearance. C5b binds components of the terminal pathway that culminates in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a pore through the cell membrane that can result in osmotic lysis of the target cell. In addition to cell killing, the C system has other key roles such as in solubilization and clearance of immune complexes (1Manderson A.P. Botto M. Walport M.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and it also has important links to adaptive immunity, drastically lowering the threshold concentration of antigen required to stimulate an effective antibody response (2Tedder T.F. Zhou L.J. Engel P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus C, and activated C3 in particular, plays key roles in health and prevention of infection. The propensity for C activation products to “drift” from the site of activation and deposit on self-cells puts these cells at risk. However, damaging effects of C are prevented by expression of multiple C regulators (CReg) on the membrane of self-cells (3Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins, Academic Press, London. 1999; Google Scholar, 4Morgan B.P. Meri S. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1994; 15: 369-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, this protection can be overwhelmed, particularly in autoimmune diseases where non-C induction mechanisms, such as auto-reactive T cells and antibodies, trigger disease (5Holers V.M. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 107: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). C acts as a destructive effector mechanism that damages tissue and drives inflammation. C has been implicated in pathology of various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and myasthenia gravis. C is also responsible for much of the damage occurring in ischemia-reperfusion injury, such as that seen in transplantation, stroke, cardiopulmonary bypass, and myocardial infarction. As a consequence, controlling inappropriate activation of C is a therapeutic strategy in these pathologies (6Harris C.L. Fraser D.A. Morgan B.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Numerous approaches to the development of agents that regulate C activation have evolved, including development of soluble, recombinant CReg. The best characterized of these, soluble CR1 (sCR1) has been tested in humans for acute respiratory distress syndrome and myocardial infarction (8Lazar H.L. Bokesch P.M. van Lenta F. Fitzgerald C. Emmett C. Marsh Jr., H.C. Ryan U. Circulation. 2004; 110: II274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A different approach has been to use antibodies to specific components to arrest the C cascade at specific stages. A humanized antibody to C5 has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of myocardial infarction and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (9Mahaffey K.W. Van de Werf F. Shernan S.K. Granger C.B. Verrier E.D. Filloon T.G. Todaro T.G. Adams P.X. Levy J.H. Hasselblad V. Armstrong P.W. Am. Heart J. 2006; 152: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Hillmen P. Hall C. Marsh J.C. Elebute M. Bombara M.P. Petro B.E. Cullen M.J. Richards S.J. Rollins S.A. Mojcik C.F. Rother R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The stage at which the C system should be inhibited using therapeutics is of considerable importance. Agents that cause systemic inhibition of C in vivo may cause iatrogenic infections or immune complex disease, likely limiting their use to acute situations. The problems of systemic inhibition of C might be overcome either by targeting the agent to a specific site or by choosing an agent that permits the physiological actions of C to proceed unhindered. Inhibition at the C5 stage is an attractive proposition as C3b opsonization of pathogens and immune complex solubilization proceed unaffected while C5a-mediated inflammation and tissue damage or cell activation caused by MAC formation are prevented. Individuals deficient in components of the MAC are healthy apart from an increased susceptibility to meningococcal disease. We and others have shown in animal models that the terminal pathway is involved in pathology of various diseases and that therapeutic intervention at the later stages of the C cascade will be of benefit. A lack of C6, a C component involved only in the terminal pathway, prevents both demyelination and axonal injury in ADEAE (antibody-mediated demyelinating experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) and damage to neuromuscular endplates in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) (11Mead R.J. Singhrao S.K. Neal J.W. Lassmann H. Morgan B.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Chamberlain-Banoub J. Neal J.W. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 146: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that intra-articular injection of a membrane-targeted form of CD59 inhibits disease progression in mono-articular antigen-induced arthritis (13Fraser D.A. Harris C.L.

Furthermore, we have shown that mice lacking CD59, a membrane CReg specifically inhibiting MAC, develop enhanced severity of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, EAMG, and arthritis compared with wild-type animals (14Williams A.S. Mizuno M. Richards P.J. Holt D.S. Morgan B.P. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3035-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Mead R.J. Neal J.W. Griffiths M.R. Linington C. Botto M. Lassmann H.

Parasitol. 1987; 64: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18717-18723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The recent cloning and expression from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata of a protein that prevented C5 activation raised the possibility that this protein could be used to inhibit therapeutically the terminal pathway of C (19Nunn M.A. Sharma A. Paesen G.C. Adamson S. Lissina O. Willis A.C. Nuttall P.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mature protein, termed OmCI, is a 150-amino acid (17-kDa) non-glycosylated protein belonging to the lipocalin family of β barrel-forming proteins and has no similarity to any known CReg. We have expressed recombinant OmCI and here characterize further its inhibitory function in vitro and in vivo in rodents. We also describe its efficacy in the rat model of myasthenia gravis, a disease in which the terminal pathway has been shown to have a key role in pathology. Materials—All chemicals unless otherwise stated were from Sigma Aldrich or Fisher Scientific UK Ltd (Loughborough, UK). Polyclonal goat anti-rat C3c was from Nordic Laboratories (Copenhagen, Denmark) and was used at a dilution of 1:400. Mouse anti-rat CD68 mAb (EDI) was from Serotec (Oxford, UK) and was used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Polyclonal rabbit anti-OmCI and polyclonal sheep anti-human C9 were prepared in-house using standard immunization techniques and were used at 1/1000 and 1/400, respectively. Donkey anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate and donkey antigoat/sheep IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Stratech Scientific Ltd, Soham, UK) and were used at 1/200. α-Bungarotoxin-rhodamine conjugate (T-1175) was from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Goat antirabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch and was used at 1/10,000. The rat hybridoma TIB-17, secreting the anti-AChR mAb35 (20Tzartos S. Hochschwender S. Vasquez P. Lindstrom J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 15: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (TIB-175; ATCC); antibody was purified as described previously (12Chamberlain-Banoub J. Neal J.W. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 146: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of pOmCI—Native mature OmCI, also known as EV576, is not glycosylated. The asparagines of the NX(S/T) glycosylation sites (Asn-78 and Asn-102) were mutated into glutamines using PCR to prevent the hyperglycosylation seen when expressed in Pichia methanolica (19Nunn M.A. Sharma A. Paesen G.C. Adamson S. Lissina O. Willis A.C. Nuttall P.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The double mutant N78Q/N102Q Pichia-expressed protein is termed pOmCI. A single pOmCI-positive colony, grown overnight in BDMY (buffered complex dextrose) medium (Invitrogen) was used to seed a 10-liter fermentation vessel housed on a Bioflow 3000 benchtop fermentor (New Brunswick, NJ). The vessel contained 3 liters of sterile Fermentation Basal Salts Medium supplemented with PTM1 trace metal solution. Controls were set to: temperature 30 °C, pH 5.0, agitation 250 rpm, and DO2 30% maintained within an agitation range of 250–1000 rpm. After 24 h of growth the initial glucose was consumed and glucose feeding begun: 20 h of 50% glucose containing 12 ml/liter of PTM1; 60 ml/h, followed by a 24-h mixed glucose (19.5 ml/h) -methanol (24 ml/h) feed; and a final 24-h methanol feed (24 ml/h for the first 6 h and then 48 ml/h for 18 h). The fermentation broth (6.5 liters, 220 g/liter of wet cells) was clarified (4500 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant concentrated and exchanged to 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, by tangential flow filtration (Centramate, 5000 MWCO membrane; Pall Corp.). The sample was fractionated on a XK 26/20 Q-Sepharose HP 80-ml column (GE Healthcare) using a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient and further purified over a Mono Q 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) using a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient. After concentration of active fractions (Vivaspin 20, 5000 MWCO; Sartorius), the sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 column equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl. Positive fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 8 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. A predicted A 0.1%, 1 cm 280 of 1.3 was used to estimate the protein concentration. The final protein was estimated to be >96% pure by reducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Hemolysis Assays and Serum Hemolytic Activity—Inhibition of human or rat C by pOmCI was assessed by hemolysis assay using antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes and inhibition of mouse C using antibody-coated rabbit erythrocytes as target cells as described previously (21Harris C.L. Spiller O.B. Morgan B.P. Immunolology. 2000; 100: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Final dilutions of sera were as follows: human serum 1/240, rat serum 1/600, mouse serum 1/21. To determine in vivo C-inhibitory activity in rats (normal and EAMG-induced), 15 mg/kg pOmCI was administered through the tail vein to female Lewis rats (average animal weight 180 g), and blood was collected at specific time points by venesection; a pre-bleed was taken to assess normal hemolytic activity. Serum was harvested and CH50 was determined as described previously (22Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as percent activity compared with pre-bleed. To determine C-inhibitory activity in DBA/1OlaHsd mice (C5-sufficient), the same serum samples taken for the clearance study (below) were used. Restoration of hemolytic activity in mouse serum was assessed as follows: 50-μl aliquot of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes was incubated with 10 μl of 50% (v/v) C5-depleted human serum (in-house) and 50 μl of 10% (v/v) mouse serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Percent lysis was calculated as described previously (22Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and values were expressed as percent activity compared with pre-bleed. Clearance of pOmCI in Vivo—pOmCI (1 mg) was labeled with 125I (MP Biomedicals, Stretton Scientific Ltd, Stretton, UK) using Iodobeads (Pierce) according to the method of Fraker and Speck (23Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Labeled protein was isolated from free iodine by gel filtration into PBS using PD10 columns (GE Healthcare, Amersham Biosciences). Five Lewis rats (Charles River, average weight 180 g) were injected through the tail vein with ∼12 × 106 cpm radiolabeled protein. Blood was collected at specific time points following administration, and protein-bound radioactivity was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as previously described (22Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For each time point protein-bound counts/ml of blood were calculated and expressed relative to protein-bound counts at 5 min post-administration as follows: % of 5-min level = 100 × protein-bound counts at time (t)/protein-bound counts at 5 min. Log of the percentage counts (y-axis) were plotted against time in hours (x-axis). The half-life was calculated from the slope of the linear region of the line: β-half-life = 0.693/-slope (24Waller D. Renwick A. Principles of Medical Pharmacology, Balliere Tindall, London. 1994; : 26-35Google Scholar). Clearance in mice was determined as follows: six 8-week-old DBA/1OlaHsd mice (C5-sufficient) and six DBA/2 OlaHsd mice (C5-deficient; Harlan UK, Bicester, UK) were given 320 μg of pOmCI through the tail vein. Blood (50 μl) was collected by venesection at specific times post-administration. Presence of pOmCI in serum (1 μl) was assessed by Western blot following electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. pOmCI was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-pOmCI followed by antirabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase; blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and captured on autoradiographic film (Kodak). Surface Plasmon Resonance—All analyses were carried out on a Biacore T100 (Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). pOmCI (20 resonance units) was immobilized to a CM5 chip (carboxymethylated dextran surface; Biacore) using amine coupling according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NHS/EDC coupling kit; Biacore). For kinetic analysis the flow rate was maintained at 30 μl/min, and data were collected at 25 °C. Data from a reference cell were subtracted to control for bulk refractive index changes. The Rmax was kept low and the flow rate high to eliminate mass transfer. C5 was purified using classical chromatography (25Harrison R.A. Herzenberg L.A. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C. Weir's Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA. II. 1996: 75.01-75.50Google Scholar); protein was “polished” by size exclusion chromatography to ensure removal of any aggregates prior to kinetic analysis. Samples were injected using the KINJECT command to ensure accurate association kinetics. Interactions were analyzed in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20). Data were evaluated using Biaevaluation software (Biacore International AB). Passive Induction of EAMG—To test therapeutic efficacy of pOmCI in EAMG, 11 female Lewis rats (160–200 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Margate, UK) and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week. Disease was induced on day zero using 1 mg/kg mAb35 in PBS (intraperitoneal). MAb35, produced against Electrophorus electricus electric organ muscle-type nicotinic AChR, binds the main immunogenic region of the α subunit of the AChR and cross-reacts with chicken, rat, mouse, and human AChR. Animals were assessed as described previously (16Morgan B.P. Chamberlain-Banoub J. Neal J.W. Song W. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 146: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Six animals were also given pOmCI at a dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously. Collection and Processing of Tissues for Immunohistochemical Analysis—Soleus muscle was removed, frozen, and sectioned as described previously (12Chamberlain-Banoub J. Neal J.W. Mizuno M. Harris C.L. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 146: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sections were fixed in acetone for 5 min and were stained for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-C3c, anti-C9, and anti-CD68) at the stated dilutions in block buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin). Sections were washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 40 min at room temperature. Sections were washed and mounted in VectorShield before analysis. α-Bungarotoxin (α-BuTx)-rhodamine conjugate was used to identify the AChR and provided a tool with which to evaluate the numbers of α-BuTx-reactive AChR from comparable sections from each animal. α-BuTx-rhodamine was diluted 1/200 in block buffer (PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 40 min at room temperature in a humid chamber. Sections were washed in PBS and mounted using VectorShield for analysis using a fluorescent microscope. The number of BuTx-reactive AChR in each section was measured using density slicing in an image analysis system (Openlab Improvision, Coventry, UK). Twenty fields were captured from comparable regions of muscle in each sample at the same exposure and magnification. For hematoxylin and eosin staining, muscle was post-fixed in 10% formaldehyde in PBS and embedded in paraffin for sectioning and staining. Inflammatory infiltrate was scored blind using a semiquantitative method: 0, no infiltration; 1, up to 20% of whole muscle infiltrated; 2, up to 40% of whole muscle infiltrated; 3, up to 60% of whole muscle infiltrated; 4, over 80% of muscle fibers infiltrated. Cross-species Activity of pOmCI—Initial analysis of pOmCI indicated that it inhibited the terminal C pathway in both human and guinea pig serum (19Nunn M.A. Sharma A. Paesen G.C. Adamson S. Lissina O. Willis A.C. Nuttall P.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We extended this study of cross-species activity to include rat and mouse serum; comparison with sCR1 was also made. Using classical pathway-mediated lysis of antibody-coated erythrocytes, we show that pOmCI efficiently protected cells against lysis mediated by either rat, mouse, or human serum in vitro (Fig. 1). Circulating Half-life—pOmCI was labeled with 125I and administered as a single bolus intravenously to Lewis rats. Plasma was harvested at specific times following administration, and protein-bound counts were measured. The calculated β-phase half-life of pOmCI was 30 h (Fig. 2). We have previously shown that small (∼30-kDa) recombinant CReg given intravenously to rodents have half-lives of ∼20 min 3N. J. Hepburn, A. S. Williams, and C. L. Harris, unpublished data. (22Harris C.L. Williams A.S. Linton S.M. Morgan B.P. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 129: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This prolonged half-life of pOmCI suggested that it circulated in plasma as a complex with C5. To determine whether this was the case, pOmCI was given to mice that were either sufficient or deficient in C5. At specific times following administration, plasma was harvested and analyzed for the presence of pOmCI by Western blot (Fig. 3). In C5-deficient animals, pOmCI was rapidly excreted and only trace amounts were apparent in plasma 30 min after administration; thereafter it was not detectable. In the C5-sufficient animals, the pOmCI signal was very strong at 30 min and was still apparent 48 h later, demonstrating that C5 dramatically increased the half-life of this reagent.FIGURE 3Dependence on C5 for prolonged half-life of pOmCI. Clearance of pOmCI in C5-deficient (top) and C5-sufficient (bottom) mice was investigated by administering reagent intravenously and detecting it in plasma samples by Western blot. This blot is representative of five animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect on C Activity in Rodents in Vivo—pOmCI was administered to rats and mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Serum was harvested at specific times, and total C activity (rats) or C5 activity (mice) was determined by hemolysis assay (Fig. 4). In both species C activity was totally ablated post-administration. However, within 8–12 h ∼50% of the lytic activity had returned. 24 h following administration, C activity was almost restored to preadministration levels. Binding of pOmCI to C5—The clearance data in C5-deficient and C5-sufficient mice indicated that binding between C5 and pOmCI was of high affinity. To confirm this, surface plasmon resonance was used to characterize the on- and off-rates of the interaction. pOmCI was immobilized on the sensor chip surface and human C5 was flowed across. The KD of the interaction was 1.85 × 10-8 m, and binding kinetics were characterized by a very slow off-rate (Fig. 5). This indicates that, following binding of pOmCI in vivo, a stable complex with C5 will be formed. Induction of EAMG and Effect of pOmCI on Clinical Disease— Rats were given mAb35 at 1 mg/kg, and control animals began to lose weight consistently by 24 h post-induction. In contrast, animals given an initial bolus of pOmCI were stable or continued to gain weight over the time course of the experiment (Fig. 6). Control animals began to display clinical symptoms comprising limp tails, pilo-erection, and reduced grip strength by 30 h post-induction, and all exhibited severe disease with hind limb weakness and/or partial paralysis by 52 h. In contrast, all animals given pOmCI were protected from any clinical manifestations of EAMG for the duration of the experiment. There was no measurable decrease in grip strength, and the general condition remained unaltered (Fig. 6). Control animals were sacrificed at 52 h in accordance with Home Office regulations, and tissue sections were prepared. pOmCI-treated animals were monitored for a further 131 h, although one animal was sacrificed at 52 h for comparative histology with the control group. At the end of the experiment, tissue sections were taken from all remaining animals treated with pOmCI. Hemolytic activity in control and OmCI-treated groups was monitored during the course of the experiment. This had increased in control animals by 2 h post-disease induction, presumably due to the acute phase response, and rose to 175% pre-induction levels by 24 h. In OmCI-treated animals, hemolytic activity was absent for 4 h following disease induction and had started to return by 6 h (14.8%). Levels rose to ∼120% of pre-induction levels and remained constant (Table 1).TABLE 1Complement hemolytic activity in control and treated animals during the course of EAMG Serum samples were harvested at specific time points following EAMG induction.

The number of AChR was significantly decreased in control animals compared with pOmCI-treated animals (Fig. 7a). Immunohistochemical analysis of C3 and C9 deposition at the endplate demonstrated marked deposition at the AChR in control animals at 52 h (Table 2; Fig. 7b). Immunohistological analysis and hematoxylin and eosin staining also demonstrated high levels of cellular infiltration in untreated animals. In contrast, whereas C3 and C9 deposition was visible in treated animals at sacrifice, there was less staining of activated C and cellular infiltration was minimal (Table 2). Analysis at 52 h indicated that C3 was deposited at the neuro-muscular junction (NMJ) but only trace C9 at this time point; there was no evidence of cellular infiltration.TABLE 2Histological analysis of NMJ in soleus muscle postmortem Se"

https://openalex.org/W2031171396,"Staphylococcus sciuri are important human pathogens responsible for endocarditis, peritonitis, septic shock, urinary tract infection, pelvic inflammatory disease and wound infections. However, little information is known regarding the pathogenicity of S. sciuri to animals. From the pericardial fluid of a diseased piglet with exudative epidermitis (EE), we isolated a strain of Staphylococcus in pure culture. Surprisingly, this isolate was a member of S. sciuri rather than S. hyicus as identified by its biochemical traits and also by analysis of 23S ribosomal DNA using Internal Transcribed Spacer PCR. In addition, inoculation of newborn piglets with 1x10(10) CFU of the isolate by oral feeding or intra-muscular injection successfully reproduced EE in piglets, which suggested that the oral intake of the pathogen by the animals is one of the major routes of exposure. These unexpected findings prioritized S. sciuri as important zoonotic agents, which may have ramifications for human medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2090585432,"Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen that can persist in the urogenital tract. Mechanisms by which C. trachomatis evades clearance by host innate immune responses are poorly described. CD1d is MHC-like, is expressed by epithelial cells, and can signal innate immune responses by NK and NKT cells. Here we demonstrate that C. trachomatis infection down-regulates surface-expressed CD1d in human penile urethral epithelial cells through proteasomal degradation. A chlamydial proteasome-like activity factor (CPAF) interacts with the CD1d heavy chain, and CPAF-associated CD1d heavy chain is then ubiquitinated and directed along two distinct proteolytic pathways. The degradation of immature glycosylated CD1d was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin but not by MG132, indicating that degradation was not via the conventional proteasome. In contrast, the degradation of non-glycosylated CD1d was blocked by lactacystin and MG132, consistent with conventional cellular cytosolic degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. Immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed the interruption of CD1d trafficking to the cell surface, and the dislocation of CD1d heavy chains into both the cellular cytosol and the chlamydial inclusion along with cytosolic CPAF. C. trachomatis targeted CD1d toward two distinct proteolytic pathways. Decreased CD1d surface expression may help C. trachomatis evade detection by innate immune cells and may promote C. trachomatis persistence.

Chlamydia trachomatis serovars D–K are common obligate intracellular pathogens that infect the columnar epithelia of the human urogenital mucosa (1Cates Jr., W Wasserheit J.N. Am. J. Obstet.

Infection most frequently occurs in the penile urethra or endocervix and causes acute inflammatory responses at these sites (1Cates Jr., W Wasserheit J.N. Am. J. Obstet.

Despite immune recognition of infection, C. trachomatis can persist within the host, and persistence is associated with more severe disease (2Hogan R.J. Mathews S.A. Mukhopadhyay S. Summersgill J.T.

C. trachomatis-associated alterations in host immunity are thought to promote persistence, and these immunoevasive mechanisms may affect innate immune responses, adaptive immune responses, or both. Mechanisms for evasion of adaptive responses by C. trachomatis have been described, including the down-regulation of MHC 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; CPAF, chlamydial protease/proteasome-like activity factor; HC, heavy chain; β2m, β2-microglobulin; PURL, penile urethral epithelial cells; p.i., post infection; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; NK, natural killer cells; NKT, natural killer T cells; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPS, lipopolysaccharide. class I heavy chain (HC) and β2-microglobulin (β2m) expression (4Zhong G.

Pirbhai M. Zhong Y. Zhong G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Down-regulation appears to be the result of a novel chlamydial proteasome-like activity factor (CPAF) (4Zhong G. Liu L. Fan T. Fan P. Ji H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). CPAF, composed of N-terminal (29 kDa) and C-terminal (35 kDa) fragments, is secreted from the chlamydial inclusion into the host cytosol and degrades the transcriptional factor RFX5 that would otherwise up-regulate promoters of MHC class I HC and β2m genes (4Zhong G. Liu L. Fan T. Fan P. Ji H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). C. trachomatis also targets upstream stimulation factor-1 for CPAF-mediated degradation, resulting in the inhibition of interferon γ-inducible expression of MHC class II products (5Zhong G. Fan T. Liu L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cellular fractionation places CPAF into subfractions that differ from those containing the classic cytosolic proteasome subunits. Further, CPAF-associated proteasomal activity is inhibited by one cytosolic proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, but not by other proteasome inhibitors (4Zhong G. Liu L. Fan T. Fan P. Ji H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These data indicate that CPAF has proteasomal activities distinct from those of the classic cytosolic proteasome. CD1d is an MHC-like glycoprotein that presents lipid antigen to natural killer T (NKT) cells (8Bendelac A. Lantz O. Quimby M.E. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Brutkiewicz R.R.

In humans, a specific subset of NKT cells expresses an invariant Vα24-JαQ/Vβ11 T cell receptor and can recognize CD1d on the surface of antigen presenting cells through this receptor (9Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Like MHC class I HC, CD1d HC is synthesized, glycosylated by N-glycosyltransferase, modified, and assembled with β2m within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E.

Unlike MHC class I HC, CD1d HC is not affected by quality control mechanisms that efficiently destroy misfolded N-linked membrane glycoproteins and those that have not properly assembled with β2m (10Balk S.P.

In fact, diverse CD1d HC isoforms, including mature glycosylated (∼48 kDa), immature glycosylated (∼45 kDa), and non-glycosylated (∼37 kDa) forms, are expressed on the cell surface in a cell-type specific fashion (10Balk S.P.

CD1d plays a role in both innate and adaptive immunity to various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites (14Skold M. Behar S.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5447-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Sanchez D.J. Gumperz J.E. Ganem D. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Activation of CD1d-restricted invariant NKT cells enhances host resistance to these microbes. CD1d-restricted NKT cells can act directly on infected cells, killing the CD1d-expressing cell. They also promote interferon γ production by conventional NK cells and modulate adaptive immune cells by altering Th1/Th2 polarization. Recognition of CD1d by invariant NKT cells causes rapid release of interleukin-4 and interferon γ from the NKT cell (9Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The activation of CD1d-restricted invariant NKT cells in response to microbial invasion is antigen-dependent, but these antigens can be derived from the invading microbe or possibly host antigens (16Brigl M.

Viewing the importance of CD1d in innate immune responses to microbes, we hypothesized that C. trachomatis may alter CD1d-mediated immune pathways and thereby avoid innate immune destruction of the infected cell by the host. Here we demonstrate that surface-expressed CD1d in human urethral epithelial cells is down-regulated by C. trachomatis infection, and this involves both CPAF-mediated and classic cytosolic proteasomal pathways. Epithelial Cell Line—The PURL epithelial cell line was established from penile urethra collected at autopsy under IRB approval. Small pieces of tissue were cultured in supplemented keratinocyte growth media (Invitrogen) and 0.4 mm calcium until epithelial outgrowth occurred. Primary cells were transduced with a retroviral vector (LXSN-16E6E7) (22Yuan W. Dasgupta A. Cresswell P. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), selected by resistance to the neomycin analogue G418 and passaged over 20 times prior to experiments. The cytokeratin profile (positive for CK13, -17, and -18), and the expression of the secretory component of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (SC) confirmed derivation from penile urethral epithelium. C. trachomatis Infection—Near confluent PURL cells were overlaid with C. trachomatis serovar F (strain F/IC-Cal-13) elementary bodies suspended in a sucrose-phosphate-glutamate solution at a predetermined dilution that resulted in 80–85% of cells becoming infected. Plates were centrifuged for 1 h, supernatants were aspirated after centrifugation, and cells cultured for up to 45 h at 37 °C in keratinocyte growth media. Antibodies—For anti-CD1d antibodies, a D5 mAb (mIgG2b (11Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9289-9295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) recognizing all isoforms of CD1d HC was used for biochemical experiments. An NOR3.2 mAb (mIgG1, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) recognizing all isoforms was used for flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. A 51.1.3 mAb (mIgG2b (10Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Frantz M.E. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)) recognizing only mature glycosylated-CD1d was used for immunofluorescence. For anti-CPAF antibodies, an n54b mAb (mIgG1 (6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar)) recognizing N terminus and a c100a mAb (mIgG1 (7Dong F. Pirbhai M. Zhong Y. Zhong G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) recognizing C terminus fragments of CPAF (kind gifts from Dr. G. Zhong, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX) were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, respectively. The n54b mAb was also used for immunofluorescence. Flow Cytometry—PURL cells infected with C. trachomatis were harvested 24 h after infection. Uninfected and infected PURL cells were harvested using accutase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Harvested cells were then incubated with an anti-transferrin receptor mAb conjugated to phycoerythrin (Caltag Laboratories) or with an anti-CD1d NOR3.2 mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. CD1d staining was followed by a goat antimouse Ig secondary antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin for 30 min at 4 °C (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were suspended in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using a FACS-Calibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Proteasome Inhibitor Treatment—Infected and control PURL cells were cultured for up to 45 h in the presence or absence of two different cytosolic proteasome inhibitors: lactacystin (2 or 10 μm) or MG132 (2 or 10 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) in Me2SO. Control wells included vehicle alone. Immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblotting—Harvested PURL cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent aliquots of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml of anti-CD1d D5 mAb or anti-CPAF n54b and 5 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8 or 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Purified CPAF c-fragment proteins (a kind gift from Dr. G. Zhong, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX) were included as positive controls. Anti-CD1d D5 mAb, anti-CPAF c100a mAb, or a rabbit anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (Abcam Inc.) were used as primary reagents for immunoblotting and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Pierce) as secondary reagents. A peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect ubiquitin. Products in Western immunoblotting experiments were visualized using standard chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular weights were confirmed by comparison to standard size markers and molecular weight analysis (FluorChem™SP, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Endoglycosidase-H Treatment—D5-precipitated CD1d HCs were denatured and incubated overnight at 37 °C with endoglycosidase-H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in reaction buffer (11Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9289-9295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein products were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation by a His-tagged, Synthetic CD1d Cytoplasmic Tail—Three polypeptides with sequences corresponding to the wild-type CD1d cytoplasmic tail (HHHHHH-RFKRQTSYQGVL), to a mutated cytoplasmic tail lacking tyrosine and lysine residues (HHHHHH-RFKRQTSFQGVA), or to a truncated cytoplasmic tail lacking six amino acids (HHHHHH-RFKRQT) (20Cho S.

Virology. 2005; 337: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were synthesized, His tag conjugated, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (New England Peptide, Inc., Gardner, MA). Total cell lysates were incubated with or without the synthesized peptides (0, 20, or 100 μg) in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were recovered using anti-His tag antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Abcam Inc.), separated by PAGE and immunoblotted with the anti-CPAF c100a mAb. Fluorescence Deconvolution Microscopy—PURL cells were seeded onto coverslips and infected as above. The ER was visualized using ER tracker Blue-White DPX (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. All coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with anti-CD1d 51.1.3 mAb, anti-CD1d NOR3.2 mAb, or anti-CPAF n54b mAb singly, or in combination with anti-chlamydial LPS (clone-3, Accurate, Westbury, NY). Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (51.1.3, NOR3.2, and n54b) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG3 (chlamydial LPS) were used as secondary reagents. In some experiments NOR3.2 was directly conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 using a mouse IgG1 labeling kit (Molecular Probes) to allow costaining with CPAF. Thereafter, except in ER-Tracker-treated coverslips, cells were counterstained with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) nucleic acid stain. Images were obtained with a Leica DMRXA automated upright epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL); a Sensicam QE charge-coupled device (Cooke Corp., Auburn Hills, MI); and filter sets optimized for Alexa 488 (exciter HQ480/20, dichroic Q495LP, and emitter HQ510/20m), Alexa 568 (exciter 545/30x, dichroic Q570DLP, emitter HQ620/60m), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (exciter 360/40×, dichroic 400DCLP, and emitter GG420LP). Z-axis plane capture, deconvolution, and analysis were performed with Slidebook™ deconvolution software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). To determine how C. trachomatis infection affects CD1d expression, flow cytometry was used to analyze its cell-surface expression on PURL epithelial cells, a cell line we immortalized from penile urethra, the most common site of infection in the male. Cells were infected with C. trachomatis serovar F in this, and all subsequent experiments, because it is one of the most frequent genital isolates. We observed that CD1d was expressed by the majority of uninfected PURL cells; however, by 24 h post infection, CD1d expression was abrogated in >90% of cells in the C. trachomatis-infected cultures (Fig. 1B). The loss of CD1d expression was selective, because PURL cells retained, and in fact showed a slight increase in, their expression of transferrin receptor (Fig. 1C). PURL cells were then infected with C. trachomatis and harvested at various time points (up to 45 h after infection) to biochemically assess the effects of C. trachomatis infection on CD1d HC. All isoforms of CD1d HC were recovered using an anti-CD1d mAb (D5) that recognizes the α-region of the CD1d HC regardless of its association with β2m (10Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Frantz M.E.

The anti-CD1d D5 mAb precipitated CD1d HC isoforms of ∼48 kDa (open arrowhead), 45 kDa (closed arrow), and 37 kDa (open arrow) with distinct patterns depending on infection status and time after C. trachomatis infection. (Fig. 2A, panel 1). In non-infected PURL cells, the 48-kDa CD1d HC predominated, whereas the 45- and 37-kDa forms were present in negligible amounts (panel 1, lane 1).FIGURE 2CD1d HC degradation upon C. trachomatis infection. A, PURL cells were infected with C. trachomatis and harvested at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 45 h p.i. Total cell lysates were subjected to IP using anti-CD1d (D5) or anti-CPAF n-fragment (n54b) mAbs. Precipitated proteins were separated by PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CD1d (D5) or anti-CPAF c-fragment (c100a) mAbs. The mAb pairs (D5–D5, n54b–D5, n54b–c100a, or D5–c100a) when used sequentially for IP and IB, isolated total CD1d HC, CPAF-bound CD1d HC, total CPAF, or CD1d-bound CPAF, respectively. Open arrowheads, closed arrows, and open arrows indicate the 48-, 45-, and 37-kDa HC bands, respectively. Protein levels of β2m and β-actin (loading control) in total cell lysates were detected by Western immunoblotting. B, PURL cells were infected as in A and exposed to the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 (left) or lactacystin (right) at the indicated concentrations for 45 h. Total cell lysates were used for IP and IB with the anti-CD1d (D5) mAb as in A. Arrow/arrowheads indicate HC bands as in A.

CT, C. trachomatis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD1d isoforms were altered in the presence of C. trachomatis infection in a time-dependent, stepwise fashion (Fig. 2A, panel 1). The 48-kDa HC was largely converted to a 45-kDa HC form between 10 to 20 h post infection (p.i.), and this was accompanied by a decrease in β2m protein levels (Fig. 2A, panels 1 and 5). To confirm the glycosylation status of the 45-kDa HC, the isoform was digested by endoglycosidase-H (Fig. 2C). The 45-kDa CD1d HC was sensitive to endoglycosidase-H and represents an immature glycosylated CD1d that may include β2m-unassembled HCs. The amount of detectable, 45-kDa, glycosylated CD1d HC protein decreased by 20 h p.i. By 30 h p.i., it was no longer detectable. In its place, a 37-kDa non-glycosylated CD1d HC form began to accumulate at 20 h p.i. This isoform predominated at 30 h but was nearly undetectable by the end of the infectious cycle. We hypothesized that the degradation of CD1d HCs in the presence of C. trachomatis infection may involve the C. trachomatis-specific proteasomal activity, CPAF (6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we used coimmunoprecipitation (IP) to search for physiologic interactions between CPAF and CD1d HCs (Fig. 2A, panels 2–4). Using combinations of the anti-CD1d D5 mAb and mAbs against the C-terminal (c100a) or N-terminal (n54b) fragments of CPAF we could demonstrate association between CPAF and CD1d and follow these associations through the infectious cycle. CPAF-bound proteins and CPAF itself were immunoprecipitated with the anti-CPAFn n54b mAb, separated by PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-CD1d D5 (panel 2) or anti-CPAFc c100a (panel 3) mAbs. In turn, CD1d-associated proteins were recovered with the anti-CD1d D5 mAb, separated by PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CPAFc c100a mAb (panel 4). Experiments using primary IP with anti-CD1d D5 and anti-CPAFn n54b mAbs demonstrated that CD1d HCs and CPAF interacted with each other physiologically (Fig. 2A, panels 2 and 4). Furthermore, CPAF preferentially associated with the 45-kDa immature glycosylated CD1d and 37-kDa non-glycosylated CD1d but not the 48-kDa mature glycosylated CD1d HC (Fig. 2A, panel 2). CPAF binding to CD1d HC was first detected at 20 h p.i. By 30 h p.i., the CPAF-associated immature glycosylated CD1d was undetectable. In parallel, the levels of the CPAF-associated non-glycosylated CD1d increased transiently at 30 h p.i. and decreased to nearly undetectable levels by 45 h p.i. Primary CPAF IPs (panels 3 and 4) confirmed the findings of primary CD1d IPs. CPAF was first detected at 10 h p.i., and the levels of total and CD1d-associated CPAF increased by 20 h p.i. and then decreased by 45 h p.i. To assess the role of proteasomal activity in C. trachomatis-associated degradation of CD1d HC, C. trachomatis-infected cells were exposed to the cytosolic proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (left panel) and to lactacystin (right panel) (Fig. 2B). Total CD1d HC was detected by IP-IB with the anti-CD1d D5 mAb. In the absence of proteasomal inhibition, CD1d HCs could not be detected at 45 h p.i. In the presence of either MG132 or lactacystin, the 37-kDa non-glycosylated CD1d was detectable, and levels of this HC increased with increasing inhibitor dose. In turn, in the presence of lactacystin, but not MG132, the 45-kDa immature glycosylated CD1d could be detected, and levels of this HC increased with lactacystin dose. The rescued 45-kDa HC form was confirmed to be sensitive to endoglycosidase-H. The immature glycosylated CD1d HC was degraded without deglycosylation (Fig. 2C). As illustrated in panels 3 and 4 of Fig. 2A, CD1d-associated CPAF was no longer detectable by 45 h p.i., despite the continued presence of some CPAF protein. Indeed, CD1d-associated CPAF was rescued by both MG132 and lactacystin, indicating that at least the classic cytosolic proteasome is involved in the degradation of CPAF together with the CD1d HC (Fig. 3A). Fractionation experiments have demonstrated that CPAF is localized to the cytosol and is active in this location (4Zhong G. Liu L. Fan T. Fan P. Ji H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 6Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, neither properly assembled nor aberrant forms of CD1d are normally present in the cytosol (11Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Still, CD1d and CPAF interact physiologically. We hypothesized that CPAF associates with CD1d HCs via a site on the CD1d cytoplasmic tail. To address this hypothesis, we synthesized three peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to the 12 amino acids that comprise the entire wild-type CD1d cytoplasmic tail (RFKRQTSYQGVL), to a mutated cytoplasmic tail lacking tyrosine and lysine residues (RFKRQTSFQGVA), and to a truncated cytoplasmic tail lacking six amino acids (RFKRQT) (20Cho S. Knox K.S. Kohli L.M. He J.J. Exley M.A. Wilson S.B. Brutkiewicz R.R. Virology. 2005; 337: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All peptides were conjugated to a His tag. Total cell lysates from infected and control PURL cells were incubated with the synthetic His-tagged CD1d cytoplasmic tail, and peptide-associated proteins were recovered with an anti-His tag antibody. Western immunoblotting of the precipitated proteins demonstrated that CPAF interacted physically with the CD1d cytoplasmic tail, and these interactions occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In comparison to the CPAF band precipitated by the wild-type peptide (wt), CPAF was barely detectable after precipitation by the point-mutated peptide (mut1) and undetectable after precipitation with the truncated peptide (mut2) (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that CPAF interacts directly or indirectly to CD1d HC via sites on the CD1d cytoplasmic tail. The classic cellular proteasome requires ubiquitination of host N-linked glycoproteins prior to their degradation (21Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). PURL cells were infected with C. trachomatis and exposed to proteasome inhibitors. Total cell lysates harvested at 30 h pi were subjected to IP with either anti-CD1d D5 (Fig. 4A) or anti-CPAFn n54b (Fig. 4B) mAbs.

In the present studies, we investigated the mechanism through which BMP-2 activates the Smad6 gene. A -2006/+45 Smad6 promoter-luciferase construct was generated along with deletions and Runx2 binding site mutations to examine the role of Smad1 and Runx2 signaling following BMP-2 stimulation in osteoblasts.

Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Runx2 binds the OSE2-a element. ChIP assays demonstrated that Smad1 also interacts with the OSE2-a site at the Smad6 promoter through Runx2. The protein degradation of Runx2 is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1. In the present studies, we found that Smurf1 binds the OSE2-a site through Runx2 and inhibits Smad6 gene transcription. Treatment with BMP-2 and transfection of Smad1 abolished Smurf1 binding to the OSE2 site. These results show that Smad1 binding excludes Smurf1 interaction with the OSE2 site and promotes Smad6 gene transcription.

Recent studies demonstrate that chondrocyte maturation was completely absent in Runx2 and Runx3 double knock-out mice (26Yoshida C.A. Yamamoto H. Fujita T. Furuichi T. Ito K. Inoue K. Yamana K.

We identified and characterized a Runx2 binding site at the Smad6 promoter and found that Smad1-mediated BMP-2 signaling on Smad6 gene transcription is through direct binding to the OSE2 site of the Smad6 promoter, while the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 binds the OSE2 site and suppresses Smad6 promoter activity. A BMP-2/Smad1 inhibits Smurf1 interaction with the promoter and permits Smad6 gene transcription.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2T3 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Deletion constructs of the Smad6 promoter were co-transfected with Runx2, Smad1, Smurf1, or control expression plasmids into C2C12 and 2T3 cells and treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) or control medium in 6-cm culture dishes using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA transfected was constant in the experiments. Luciferase assays were performed 24 h after transfection, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed 2 h after BMP-2 treatment.Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—C2C12 and 2T3 cells were treated with different concentrations of BMP-2 (50, 100, and 200 ng/ml) or transfected with different amounts of Runx2 or Smurf1 expression plasmids (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 μg/dish, 6-mm culture dish). Total RNA of cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After reverse transcription reaction, real-time PCR was performed by an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture contained 1× EvaGreen dye, 0.5 pm of each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μl of cDNA from 20 μl of reverse transcription reaction. The conditions of real-time PCR were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1.5 min. There is no nonspecific amplification determined by dissolve curve. There are four samples in each group. The real-time RT-PCR results were reported as the fold induction of relative light units for the treatment over vehicle after normalization to GAPDH expression. The primers used for this analysis were: Smad6: 5′-TACCACTTCAGCCGGCTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTACGCCACGCTGCACCAGT-3′ (reverse); GAPDH: 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (reverse).Western Blot Analysis—C2C12 and 2T3 cells were treated with different concentration of BMP-2 (50, 100, and 200 ng/ml) or transfected with different amounts of Runx2 or Smurf1 expression plasmids (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 μg/dish, 6-mm culture dish). Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected using the anti-Smad6 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. Immunostaining was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences).Luciferase Assay—C2C12 and 2T3 cells were co-transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant deletion constructs of the Smad6 promoter (-2006/+45, -1191/+45, -829/+45, and -374/+45) and Runx2, Smad1, Smurf1, mutant Smurf1 (C710A), or control expression plasmids and treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) or control medium. Cell lysates were extracted 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a Promega dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI).PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis—Smad6 promoter constructs, -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 with mutations at either OSE2-a or OSE2-b site were constructed using Stratagene QuikChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit and cloned into pGL3 vector (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire promoter fragment.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts (5 μg) from C2C12 cells were incubated with radioactive end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing consensus binding sites for Runx2 in the mouse Smad6 promoter (5′-CCGGGTCGCGGTGGGTTCACC-3′, the binding site is highlighted). Incubation was performed in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol), for 15-20 min at room temperature. For competition, the cold wild type or mutant oligonucleotides (5′-CCGGGTCGCGGTGTTTTCACC-3′ for the mutant oligo, nucleotide mutations indicated by underscore) were added in a 1:1 or 1:20 excess. For supershift assay, the nuclear extract was incubated with Runx-2 specific (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or control antibodies for 30 min before addition of the labeled probe. After incubation with labeled probe for an additional 20-30 min, samples were fractionated on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by exposing dry gel to Kodak Film.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP assay was performed using a kit from Upstate Technologies (Lake Placid, NY) with the following modifications. C2C12 or 2T3 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C in the presence of 4% CO2 for 15 min. Cells were sonicated on ice for 6 times at 50 watts using a Sonic Dismembrator (Scientz, China) for 25 s with a 60-s interval between each sonication. The following antibodies (10 μg) were used: anti-Runx2 antibody (MBL), anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) with 100 μg of chromatin per ChIP. The amounts of each specific DNA fragment in immunoprecipitates were determined by PCR or quantitative PCR reactions. The primers used for this analysis were: A (-1108 to -937) 5′-GTGCTATGCGCGTTTGCAAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCAAGCTCACGTCGTGCCTT-3′ (reverse); B (-1968/-1839) 5′-CAGTCCAGAGCACAGGTATCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGAGCTCAATGAAAGAAATTCC-3′ (reverse); C (+281/+432) 5′-GCGCCAAAGGGTATCGTATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGCTCAGCTCGGCTGCCCA-3′ (reverse). The conditions of PCR for the detection of each specific DNA fragment were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 28 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s.Quantitative ChIP—For the quantitative ChIP (qChIP), a standard curve was generated using primer set A. Copy numbers for the DNA fragment -1108 to -937 in each anti-Runx2- and anti-Smurf1-immunoprecipitated samples were determined and compared with copy numbers of the DNA fragment without IP (input DNA). Anti-FLAG antibody was used as control for IP. The percentage of the input was then calculated. The final value was the percentage input obtained with specific antibody minus the percentage input obtained with the anti-FLAG control antibody. The dissociation curve was determined for each quantitative PCR reaction to assure that a single band was produced. Each data point represents four independent samples.RESULTSBMP-2 and Runx2 Stimulate and Smurf1 Inhibits Smad6 mRNA and Protein Expression—Smad6 is a downstream target gene of BMP signaling (2Ishida W.

In contrast, Smurf1 (0.2-0.8 μg/dish) inhibited Smad6 mRNA and protein expression in C2C12 (Fig. 1a) and 2T3 (data not shown) cells.BMP-2 Stimulates Smad6 Gene Transcription—To investigate the mechanism of BMP-2 on Smad6 gene transcription, we amplified the mouse Smad6 promoter -2006/+45 by PCR (GenBank™ accession number: AF010133) using mouse genomic DNA as a template (Fig. 2a) and generated three deletion constructs, -1191/+45, -829/+45, and -374/+45. The various Smad6 promoter fragments were cloned into pGL3 vector. A significant reduction in the promoter activity was observed in -1191/+45 reporter compared with -2006/+45 reporter (Fig. 2b), suggesting the positive transcription units exist in the -2006/-1191 region of the Smad6 promoter. In -1906/-1878 region of the Smad6 promoter, three overlapping GC-rich sequences have been identified and Smad1/5 binds this region of the Smad6 promoter (2Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K.

To determine the effect of BMP-2 on Smad6 promoter, we transfected the deletion constructs of the Smad6 promoter and treated cells with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) in C2C12 cells. The luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. BMP-2 stimulated the promoter activity of the -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 reporters but not the -829/+45 and -374/+45 reporters (Fig. 2b). BMP-2 stimulated the -1191/+45 reporter over 5-fold although no Smad1/5 binding site has been found in the -1191/+45 region of the Smad6 promoter by sequence analysis. The results suggest that BMP-2 may activate the -1191/+45 Smad6 promoter indirectly or through other transcription factor binding sites, such as Runx2.FIGURE 2BMP-2 and Runx2 activate the Smad6 promoter. a, diagram shows the structure of the mouse Smad6 promoter -2006/+45 construct. The putative Runx2 binding sites (OSE2-a, OSE2-b), and Smad1/5 binding region (three overlapping GC-rich sequences) are indicated. b, C2C12 cells were co-transfected with the Smad6 promoter construct (-2006/+45) or three deletion constructs (-1191/+45, -829/+45, and -374/+45) with Runx2 or Smad1 expression plasmid or treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml). Cell lysates were collected 24 h after transfection, and a luciferase assay was performed. BMP-2 and Runx2 stimulated the promoter activity of -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 constructs with similar potency but had no effect on -829/+45 and -374/+45 reporters. Transfection of Smad1 further enhanced Runx2-induced promoter activity of -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 constructs compared with the transfection of each plasmid separately. *, p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test, compared with vector transfection alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Runx2 Activates Smad6 Gene Transcription—In the present studies, we identified two putative Runx2 binding sites located at -1036/-1031 (OSE2-a) and -579/-574 (OSE2-b) regions of the Smad6 promoter by sequence analysis (Fig. 2a). Transfection of Runx2 stimulated the promoter activity of -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 reporters but not -829/+45 and the -374/+45 reporters (Fig. 2b). Co-transfection of Smad1 with Runx2 further enhanced Runx2-induced promoter activity of the -2006/+45 and -1191/+45 reporters (Fig. 2b). To determine if these OSE2 sites are functional, we performed site-direct mutagenesis. The sequences of the wild type and mutant OSE2-a and OSE2-b are shown in Fig. 3a. Mutation of the OSE2-b at -579/-574 did not affect basal promoter activity and had no significant effect on the responsiveness of the -1191/+45 reporter to BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) treatment or Runx2 transfection (Fig. 3b). In contrast, mutation of OSE2-a at -1036/-1031 caused a significant reduction in the basal promoter activity and completely abolished BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) and Runx2-induced promoter activity of the -1191/+45 and -2006/+45 reporters (Fig. 3, b and c). These results indicate that OSE2-a is the major functional site for Runx2 at the Smad6 promoter and suggest that Runx2 is required for BMP-2 to activate Smad6 promoter. Runx2 and BMP-2 retain their stimulatory activity when the multiple copies of OSE2-a elements (6xOSE2-a) was cloned in front of the TK basal promoter (data not shown), suggesting that OSE2-a is a true Runx2 responsive element.FIGURE 3BMP-2 and Runx2 activate Smad6 promoter through the OSE2-a site. a, diagram shows the construct harboring wild-type (wt) or mutant (mt) OSE2-a and OSE2-b sites derived from -1191/+45 reporter. The wt and mt sequences of OSE2-a and OSE2-b sites are indicated. b, C2C12 cells were transfected with wt and mt -1191/+45 Smad6 reporter with Runx2 expression plasmid or treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml). Cell lysates were collected 24 h after transfection, and a luciferase assay was performed. Mutation of OSE2-a caused a significant reduction in basal promoter activity and completely abolished BMP-2- or Runx2-induced promoter activity of the -1191/+45 reporter. Mutation of OSE2-b had no significant effect on the basal promoter activity or the responsiveness to Runx2 or BMP-2. *, p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test, compared with vector alone. c, C2C12 cells were transfected with wt and mt -2006/+45 Smad6 reporter with Runx2 or Smad1 expression plasmid or treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml). Mutation of OSE2-a in -2006/+45 reporter significantly reduced basal promoter activity and inhibited BMP-2, Runx2, or Smad1-induced promoter activity. *, p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test, compared with vector alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate the direct binding of Runx2 to the Smad6 promoter in vitro, electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using nuclear protein extracts from C2C12 cells. The oligonucleotide sequence used was derived from the Runx2 consensus site in the mouse Smad6 promoter (-1046/-1026). Following the incubation, binding complexes were detected. The specificity of the complex was suggested by the competition and supershift assays. An unlabeled consensus binding sequence competed with the binding complex in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a, lanes 3 and 4), while oligonucleotides mutated in Runx2 binding site had no effect (Fig. 4a, lanes 5 and 6), confirming the specificity of the complex for the Runx2 binding. Moreover, antibody specific for Runx2 but not control antibody resulted in supershift of the Runx2 binding complex (Fig. 4a, lane 7), indicating the presence of Runx2 in the DNA-protein complex. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Runx2 binds to the OSE2-a site in the Smad 6 promoter. To determine if Smad1 or Smurf1 binds directly to the OSE2-a site, we performed gel shift assay using GST-Smad1 and GST-Smurf1. The results demonstrated that neither Smad1 nor Smurf1 directly binds the OSE2-a site of the Smad6 promoter (Fig. 4b, lanes 3 and 5). To investigate if Smurf1 interferes with Runx2 binding to the OSE2-a site, we examined Runx2 binding in the absence or presence of Smurf1 in gel shift assay using GST-Runx2 and GST-Smurf1. The results showed that Smurf1 slightly reduced Runx2 binding to the OSE2-a site (Fig. 4b, lane 4), suggesting that Smurf1 does interfere with Runx2 binding to the Smad6 promoter.FIGURE 4Runx2 binds OSE2-a site gel shift assay. a, nuclear extracts from C2C12 cells were assayed by gel shift using 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probes derived from the mouse Smad6 promoter (-1046/-1026). Lane 1, free probe control (without nuclear extracts); lane 2, addition of nuclear extracts only. The binding of OSE2-a was competed with excess amounts of cold wild-type (lanes 3 and 4) or mutant (lanes 5 and 6) oligonucleotide (1:10 and 1:100 ratio). The same nuclear extracts were also examined in supershift assays using antibody for Runx2 (lane 7) or IgG control antibody (lane 8). DNA protein binding complexes and the Runx2-specific supershifted band were observed (lane 7). b, binding of Runx2, Smad1, or Smurf1 was further determined by gel shift assay using in vitro translated GST-Runx2, GST-Smad1, and GST-Smurf1 proteins. Smad1 or Smurf1 did not bind the OSE2-a site (lanes 3 and 5). The binding of Runx2 was reduced in the presence of Smurf1 (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further determine the interactions of Runx2, Smad1 and Smurf1 with the OSE2-a site, we performed ChIP assays. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using the anti-Runx2 antibody. Anti-FLAG antibody was used as a control in IP experiment. A segment of the Smad6 promoter containing the OSE2-a (-1108/-937) site was amplified by PCR using the primer set A, and DNA templates were extracted from protein/DNA cross-linked samples. As negative controls, primer sets recognizing 5′- and 3′-distal regions (primer sets B and C) of the Smad6 gene were used in the PCR assays (Fig. 5a). ChIP assay showed that Runx2 binds specifically to -1108/-937 region (containing OSE2-a) of the Smad6 promoter (Fig. 5b). These findings further confirmed the binding of Runx2 to the OSE2-a site of the Smad6 promoter.FIGURE 5Interaction of Smad1 with Runx2 at the OSE2-a site-ChIP assay. a, diagram shows the structure of the mouse Smad6 gene. The putative Runx2 binding site (OSE2-a) and priming sites for ChIP assay are indicated. b, IP was performed using anti-Runx2 antibody (lanes 1, 3, and 4) or anti-FLAG control antibody (lane 2). The PCR was performed using primer set A (lanes 1, 2, and 5) to detect Runx2 binding and the PCR product (171 bp) of OSE2-a region (-1108/-937, lane 1) was amplified using the samples of cross-linked IP products as templates. Primer set B (-1968/-1839, lanes 3 and 6) and set C (+281/+432, lanes 4 and 7) were used as negative controls for PCR. Results showed that Runx2 binds specifically to the OSE2-a region (lane 1). c, C2C12 cells were transfected with Myc-Smad1 plasmid and treated with or without BMP-2 for 2 h before the ChIP assay.

https://openalex.org/W1973940513,"The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a pivotal role in tumour growth and progression, and HIF-1 is regulated through a number of signalling pathways. Here, we investigated the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway in HIF-1 regulation. We found that overexpression of wild-type (WT) extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1 (ERK1) greatly potentiated HIF-1 activation in hypoxia and HIF-1α induced in response to insulin growth-like factor 1 (IGF-1). Conversely, treatment of tumour cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or U0216, or expression of a dominant-negative form of ERK1 blocked HIF-1 activation in hypoxia without affecting HIF-1α induction, localization or binding of HIF-1β. Interestingly however, the highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 did not inhibit HIF-1 activity or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced in response to hypoxia but blocked HIF-1α protein and HIF-1 activity induced by IGF-1 stimulation without affecting HIF-1α mRNA levels. Finally, we found that ERK5 phosphorylation status was not significantly affected by hypoxia in the presence or absence of PD184352. Taken together, our data suggest that although ERK1/2 signalling is important for HIF-1α induction and HIF-1 activity in response to IGF-1, it is dispensable for the induction of HIF-1α and activation of HIF-1 in response to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2055069497,"Impaired expression of mitochondrial genes causes alterations in life span of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Intriguingly, although some of these genes have been shown to extend life expectancy and reduce aging processes, others are known to shorten life span in the same model organism. Reduced expression of a mitochondrial protein called frataxin causes a neurodegenerative disorder named Friedreich Ataxia, which decreases life span in humans. Surprisingly, reduced expression of the C. elegans frataxin homologue frh-1 has been associated with both increased as well as decreased life span by different laboratories. To further elucidate these conflicting findings, here we show that different RNA interference (RNAi) constructs directed against frh-1 reduce C. elegans life span. Moreover, we show that frh-1-inhibiting RNAi impairs oxygen consumption and that respiratory rate is positively correlated with life span in this multicellular eukaryote (r=0.8566), suggesting that >73% of life span variance in C. elegans is explained by changes in respiratory rate. Taken together, impaired mitochondrial metabolism due to RNAi-mediated inhibition of the frataxin homologue frh-1 causes both impaired respiration as well as decreased life span in the multicellular eukaryote C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1992216397,"The Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB) has long been known to be involved in the repair of DNA modifications that block the RNA polymerase in transcribed DNA sequences (transcription-coupled repair). Recent evidence suggests that it also has a more general role in the repair of oxidative DNA base modifications such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG). In mammalian cells, 8-oxoG is a substrate of the repair glycosylase OGG1. Mice without this enzyme accumulate 8-oxoG in the genome and have elevated spontaneous mutation rates. To elucidate the role of CSB in the prevention of mutations by oxidative DNA base damage, we have generated mice that are deficient in Csb or Ogg1 or both genes and carry a non-transcribed bacterial lacI gene for mutation analysis (Big Blue mice). Our results indicate that the overall spontaneous mutation frequencies in the livers of Csb(m/m)/Ogg1-/- -mice are elevated not only compared with heterozygous control mice (factor 3.3), but also with Ogg1-/- -animals (factor 1.6). Sequence analysis revealed that the additional mutations caused by CSB deficiency in an Ogg1-/- background are mostly G:C to T:A transversions and small deletions. For all mouse strains, the background levels of oxidative purine modifications in the livers correlate linearly with the numbers of G:C to T:A transversions observed. The data indicate that CSB is involved in the inhibition of mutations caused by spontaneous oxidative DNA base damage in a non-transcribed gene."
https://openalex.org/W2021260196,"Octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) has recently been shown to function as a stress sensor that promotes cell survival subsequent to DNA damage. Here, we show that the survival signal imparted by Oct-1 following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is dependent upon DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)-dependent phosphorylation of a cluster of 13 specific ser/thr residues within the N-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of Oct-1. Although IR treatment did not affect the recruitment of Oct-1 to the histone H2B promoter, the recruitment of RNA polymerase II, TATA-binding protein and histone H4 acetylation were strongly reduced, consistent with a decrease in Oct-1 transcriptional regulatory potential following IR exposure. Ser/Thr-Ala substitution of 13 sites present in Oct-1 transcriptional regulatory domain eliminated Oct-1 phosphorylation subsequent to IR exposure. Further, these substitutions prevented Oct-1 from rescuing the survival of IR-treated Oct-1/ murine embryonic fibroblasts, providing a direct link between DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation and the contribution of Oct-1 to cell survival. These results implicate Oct-1 as a primary effector in a DNA-PK-dependent cell survival pathway that is activated by double-stranded DNA breaks."

Here we describe a paradoxical inhibitory effect of bacteriostatic antibiotics on key mediators of mammalian innate immunity.

Survival of the bacteria in human whole blood, human wound fluid, or a mouse wound infection model was in turn increased after antibiotic-induced bacteriostasis. These findings provide a further rationale against the indiscriminate use of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1999141845,"Deer antlers are the only mammalian organs that can fully regenerate each year. During their growth phase, antlers of red deer extend at a rate of approximately 10 mm/day, a growth rate matched by the antler nerves. It was demonstrated in a previous study that extracts from deer velvet antler can promote neurite outgrowth from neural explants, suggesting a possible role for Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in antler innervation. Here we showed using the techniques of Northern blot analysis, denervation, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization that NGF mRNA was expressed in the regenerating antler, principally in the smooth muscle of the arteries and arterioles of the growing antler tip. Regenerating axons followed the route of the major blood vessels, located at the interface between the dermis and the reserve mesenchyme of the antler. Denervation experiments suggested a causal relationship exists between NGF mRNA expression in arterial smooth muscle and sensory axons in the antler tip. We hypothesize that NGF expressed in the smooth muscle of the arteries and arterioles promotes and maintains antler angiogenesis and this role positions NGF ahead of axons during antler growth. As a result, NGF can serve a second role, attracting sensory axons into the antler, and thus it can provide a guidance cue to define the nerve track. This would explain the phenomenon whereby re-innervation of the regenerating antler follows vascular ingrowth. The annual growth of deer antler presents a unique opportunity to better understand the factors involved in rapid nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2000000081,"Yeast Cox4 is a zinc binding subunit of cytochrome c oxidase. Cox4 is the only cofactor-containing subunit that is not directly part of the catalytic core of the enzyme located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The Zn(II) site is shown to be distinct from the bovine ortholog, as it results from the x-ray structure of the entire cytochrome c oxidase in having a single histidyl residue and three conserved cysteines residues in the coordination sphere. Substitutions at the Cys ligand positions result in non-functional Cox4 proteins that fail to lead to cytochrome oxidase assembly. Limited function exists in His-119 mutants when overexpressed. Zn(II) binding in Cox4 is, therefore, important for the stability of the complex. The solution structure of yeast Cox4 elucidated by multidimensional NMR reveals a C-terminal globular domain consisting of two β sheets analogous to the bovine ortholog except the loop containing the coordinating His in the yeast protein and the fourth Cys in the bovine protein are in different positions in the two structures. The conformation of this loop is dictated by the different sequence position of the fourth coordinating zinc ligand.

Complex IV is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotes, where it is embedded within the inner membrane (IM). CcO catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water (1Yoshikawa S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 341-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of CcO pumps eight protons from the matrix to both the reaction center and into the inner membrane space. Four of the protons are directed to the heme a3-CuB reaction center to participate in the formation of water. The remaining protons are released into the inner membrane space to create a proton gradient, which is used to drive the synthesis of ATP via ATP synthase. The bulk of ATP in eukaryotic cells is produced through the respiratory chain. The importance of the pathway has generated interest in understanding the mechanism of CcO assembly and the function of individual subunits in forming the oligomeric holoenzyme. The subunits of CcO are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. The core subunits, Cox1–3, are mitochondrial gene products and either bind cofactors involved in the electron transport pathway or are involved in proton translocation (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 3Hosler J. Ferguson-Miller S. Mills D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 165-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cox1 contains the heme a, heme a3, and the mononuclear CuB site. One histidine ligand bridges CuB and heme a3, having a role in water formation (4Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Tsukihara T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cox2 contains the binuclear CuA site responsible for accepting the reducing electrons from cytochrome c. Cox3 is a core subunit containing no cofactors and has been proposed to regulate proton uptake through the D-channel (5Gilderson G. Salomonsson L. Aagaard A. Gray J. Brezezinski P. Hosler J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7400-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The core CcO complex is surrounded by 10 small peripheral subunits, many of which consist of a single transmembrane helix. The peripheral subunits are encoded by the nuclear genome (6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), but only a subset of these subunits shows sequence similarity between animals and yeast orthologs. Many of these subunits are functionally important, since deletion of genes in yeast for some peripheral subunits results in respiratory deficiency (6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). One conserved peripheral subunit is CoxVb, designated Cox4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cox4 is an essential subunit of CcO as the enzyme fails to assemble in cox4Δ cells, and core subunits Cox1 and Cox2 fail to accumulate, thus inducing respiratory deficiency (7McEwen J.E. Ko C. Kloeckner-Gruiissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The importance of CoxVb is apparent from the crystal structure of bovine CcO, as the subunit is closely packed onto Cox1 and Cox3 on the matrix side of the IM (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). CoxVb does not penetrate the lipid bilayer. CoxVb coordinates a single Zn(II) ion through four cysteinyl residues (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Because the nomenclature for this subunit varies between mammals and yeast, we will use the yeast Cox4 designation for this study as the focus of the work is on the yeast protein. The physiological roles of Cox4 and Zn(II) coordination in CcO remain unclear. Zn(II) has been suggested to be a structural component of the subunit, but this has not been tested. Yeast Cox4 has only three of the four conserved cysteinyl residues in its primary sequence (8Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic inertness of Zn(II) makes direct determination of its coordination environment difficult, but metal substitution is a useful alternative. Zn(II) prefers tetrahedral coordination geometry. Cd(II) and Co(II) can be substituted in zinc proteins, since they can be accommodated by the same coordination geometry and utilize similar donor ligands as Zn(II). 113Cd(II) has a nuclear spin of ½ and is amenable to NMR analysis. The chemical shift observed of a cadmium nucleus is indicative of the coordination environment. A single one-dimensional measurement can provide clues as to which atoms are directly coordinated to the cadmium nucleus (9Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Co(II) is a useful probe using electronic spectroscopy. Ligand to metal charge transfer bands and absorption in the visible region due to d-d transitions provide information on the coordination environment for both geometry and ligand atoms (10Bertini I. Luchinat C. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Advances in Inorganic Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984Google Scholar, 11Maret W. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 52-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We show in this report that yeast Cox4 binds Zn(II) through three cysteinyl residues and a single histidine. The structure of the C-terminal globular domain Cox4 reveals an overall fold similar to that of bovine CoxVb but with local structural difference on the loop accommodating the His ligand. A structural comparison of the conserved hydrophobic residues between the yeast and bovine homologues identify which of them can play a key role in the Cox4-Cox1 interaction. Strains and Vectors—The Δcox4 yeast strain was generously provided by Dr. A. Tzagoloff (12Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The wild-type COX4 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR such that 1000 base pairs upstream of the ATG translation start were included. The primers for the 5′ and 3′ ends of COX4 were 5′-AAAAAGCTTCAGTGTGTATACCCTCC and 5′-AAAGGATCCTATAGATAGAGCAAAGCGTTCG, respectively. The PCR product was then restriction enzyme-digested with HindIII and BamHI for insertion into pRS425 (YEp plasmid with LEU2 selection) and pRS415 (YCp plasmid with LEU2 selection). Mutant COX4 plasmids were constructed by PCR using the WT plasmid as a template. Primers were designed according to the protocol suggested by Stratagene, and the codons selected were based on the optimal frequency in S. cerevisiae. COX4 used for recombinant studies in Escherichia coli was a construct encoding a truncated protein lacking the first 78 residues from the N terminus that form the mitochondrial targeting sequence and an extended segment in the bovine CoxVb structure. The truncated gene was inserted into pET20b+. Mutant variants were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange protocol. The codons selected for mutagenesis were based on the optimal frequency in E. coli. The recombinant had a three residue (MMA) N-terminal extension arising from the PCR protocol. The C-terminal truncate used in the 113Cd NMR and cobalt and zinc titration studies terminated at Asn-75. Yeast Analyses—Transformation of Δcox4 cells was by the lithium acetate procedure. The transformed yeast was grown to stationary phase in the synthetic glucose media to provide strain (+Ura) and plasmid (+Leu) selection. The cells were harvested, spun at 3000 rpm, and subsequently washed with sterile distilled water. Crude mitochondria of all transformed yeast samples were prepared according to the established protocol (13Diekert K. De Kroon A.I.P.M. Kisplal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels with 20 μg of total mitochondrial protein applied per lane. Protein was quantified by the Bradford procedure (14Bradford N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The separated protein was then electrolytically transferred to nitrocellulose. The primary antibody was mouse monoclonal yeast Cox4 (Molecular Probes), and the secondary antibody was anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes). The blot was developed using ECL reagents (Pierce). Porin and phosphoglycerolkinase (Pgk1) were used as markers for the mitochondrion and the cytoplasm using monoclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes). Cox4 Purification—COX4 expression plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) bacterial cells (Novagen) for recombinant protein production. Cultures were grown to an absorbance of ∼0.6 at 37 °C before induction using 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and washed in 0.25 mm sucrose before storage at -80 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in 2× phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The sonication was done for five 1-min intervals at continuous full power with 1 min on ice in between the intervals. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.22 μ membrane. The filtered lysate solution was concentrated (VIVA Spin cutoff 3000 Da) and successively diluted with sterile distilled water to bring the conductance down below 4 millisiemens. Purification of Cox4 was performed with an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using a Hi Prep DEAE FF anion exchange column. The wash buffer was 20 mm phosphate, pH 8.2, and elution was with a linear gradient up to 500 mm NaCl. The elution position of Cox4 was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Cox4 fractions were concentrated and injected onto a Hi Load Superdex 75 Prep Grade 26/60 size exclusion column equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl at pH 6.9. Cox4 eluted as a single band with minimal impurities as verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractions containing pure Cox4 were pooled and concentrated (VIVA Spin 3000 Da) for analyses. The final stock solution of Cox4 was assessed for protein concentration at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16,860 m-1 cm-1. The zinc content was quantified by atomic absorption using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 100. Isotopically labeled proteins were produced and purified using the same procedures except the recombinant protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium. The broth contained 15NH4Cl (Isotec Inc.) as the nitrogen source and d-[13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) as the carbon source. The cultures were induced with freshly prepared isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The cultures also contained 0.1 mm exogenous ZnSO4. The induction was carried out for 16–18 h at 30 °C. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy Data Collection and Analysis— X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beamline 9-3 using a Harmonic rejection mirror cutoff of 13 keV. The incident and transmitted x-ray intensities were monitored using N2-filled ionization chambers, and x-ray absorption was measured as the zinc Kα fluorescence excitation spectrum using an array of 30 germanium detectors (15Cramer S.P. Tench O. Yocum M. George G.N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 1988; 266: 586-591Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Samples were maintained at a temperature of 10 K using an Oxford instruments liquid helium flow cryostat, and four 45-min scans were accumulated. The x-ray energy was calibrated by simultaneous measurement of a zinc metal foil assuming a lowest energy inflection point of the metal to be 9659 eV. The energy threshold of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations (k) was assumed to be 9675 eV. EXAFS were quantitatively analyzed by curve-fitting using the EXAFSPAK suite of computer programs. Ab initio theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the program FEFF Version 8.2 (16Rehr J.J. Albers R.C. Zabinsky S.I. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 69: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). No smoothing, filtering, or related operations were performed on the data. Cobalt and Cadmium Spectroscopy—ApoCox4 was prepared by acid denaturation of purified Cox4 to a final pH of 2.0. The solution was gel-filtered on G-25 Sephadex in 0.01 n HCl to separate the protein from Zn(II). Apoprotein in acid was concentrated and titrated with CoCl2 to 1.5 mol eq. The pH of the sample was adjusted to 7.2 using Tris base. The CoCox4 sample was scanned in a Beckman DU 640 spectrometer. The H119D Cox4 mutant was prepared anaerobically as the Co(II) complex was less stable aerobically. ApoCox4 was also titrated with 113CdCl2 and concentrated to 2 mm. The protein was loaded in a 3-mm NMR tube for analysis on a 500-MHz Varian ANOVA spectrometer with a MDBG-500 Nalorac 3-mm dual broad band gradient probe. The samples were referenced against Cd(ClO4)2. The frequency used was 110.924 MHz. Transients were collected overnight with a pulse width of 4 μs and a delay time of 1 s. Final spectrum processing included a line broadening factor of 150. Multidimensional NMR and Structure Calculation—NMR spectra were acquired on Avance 800, 700, and 500 Bruker spectrometers operating at proton nominal frequencies of 800.13, 700.13, and 500.13 MHz, respectively. All the triple resonance (TXI 5-mm) probes used were equipped with pulsed field gradients along the z axis. The 800 and 500 MHz spectrometers were equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe. The NMR experiments were recorded on 13C,15N- and 15N-labeled Zn-Cox4 samples at 1–1.5 mm and at 298 K. The NMR experiments used for the backbone and the side-chain assignment and for obtaining structural restraints are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of Zn-Cox4 are reported in supplemental Table S2. The completeness of proton and heavy atoms assignments are 92 and 89%, respectively. All the three- and two-dimensional experiments were processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR) and analyzed on PC Linux computers through the CARA program (17Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial.1st Ed. Verlag, Cantina, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed with the software package ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA using as input the amino acid sequence, the chemical shift lists, and three 1H,1H NOE experiments; two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (NOESY), three-dimensional 13C-resolved NOESY, and three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY were all recorded at 800 MHz with a mixing time of 100 ms. The standard protocol with seven cycles of peak picking using ATNOS (18Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), NOE assignment with CANDID (19Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), and structure calculation with CYANA-2.1 (20Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) was applied. ϕ and Ψ dihedral angle constraints were derived from the chemical shift index (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). In each ATNOS/CANDID cycle, the angle constraints were combined with the updated NOE upper distance constraints in the input for the subsequent CYANA-2.1 structure calculation cycle. In the seventh ATNOS/CANDID/CYANA cycle, a total of 3226 NOE cross-peaks were assigned from 3751 peaks picked in the spectra of Zn-Cox4, which yielded 1172 meaningful NOE upper distance limits. The zinc ion was finally included in the calculations of the zinc-loaded form by adding a new residue in the amino acid sequence. This residue is formed from a chain of dummy atoms that have the van der Waals radii set to zero so they can freely penetrate into the protein and one atom with a radius of 1.4 Å, which mimics the zinc ion. The sulfur atoms of Cys ligands and Nϵ2 of His-119 were linked to the metal ion through upper distance limits of 2.3 and 2.1 Å, respectively, on the basis of EXAFS data. This approach does not impose any fixed orientation of the ligands with respect to the zinc ion. The 30 conformers with the lowest residual target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization with AMBER 8.0 (22Case D.A. Cheatham T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz K.M.J. Onufriev C. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6709) Google Scholar). NOE and torsion angle constraints were applied with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 32 kcal mol-1 rad-2, respectively. The force field parameters for the zinc(II) ion and the ligands were adapted from those already reported for similar zinc sites in zinc proteins and complexes (23Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S.

The quality of the structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK and PROCHECK-NMR (26Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar, 27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 28: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure visualization was done with the program MOLMOL (28Koradi R. BIlleter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Yeast Cox4 Is a Zinc-binding Protein—Four cysteine residues in the C-terminal domain of bovine CoxVb coordinate a single Zn(II) ion. Yeast Cox4 contains only three of the coordinating cysteine residues. No candidate ligand exists in the position of the fourth Cys from the bovine CoxVb sequence (8Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). To determine whether yeast Cox4 is a zinc-binding protein, an N-terminal truncate of yeast Cox4 was expressed in E. coli. The truncation removed 26 residues that contribute to the mitochondrial target sequence (29Taanman J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22481-22485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an additional 52 residues on the N-terminal side that in bovine CoxVb has an extended helical conformation (Fig. 1). The purified recombinant Cox4 (80 residues) was found to be a monomeric protein containing Zn(II) in a 1:1 ratio. Zn(II) Coordination Sphere—Because Zn(II) is a d10 metal with no outer shell unpaired electrons, Zn(II) is spectroscopically silent. To address the coordination environment of yeast Cox4, Cd(II) was exchanged into Cox4 using 113Cd. The ½ nuclear spin of 113Cd allows facile detection by NMR. The cadmium nucleus has its magnetic field influenced by nearby and ligating atoms. NMR spectroscopy of the 113Cd-Cox4 complex revealed a resonance at 664 ppm based on a Cd(ClO4) 2 reference standard (Fig. 2A). This chemical shift position is suggestive of coordination by three sulfurs and one nitrogen/oxygen atom based on reference 113Cd-substituted proteins (9Coleman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 16-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Three sulfur atoms are presumably provided by the three conserved cysteines in Cox4. Yeast Cox4 contains four histidines with one (His-119) positioned eight residues after the first cysteine with the remaining three in the C-terminal segment. A Cox4 construct was prepared that lacked the last 6 C-terminal residues (NDDHHH), removing all histidyl residues except His-119. Purification of the recombinant C-terminal truncate revealed 1 mol eq of bound Zn(II). Exchanging the Zn((II) with 113Cd(II) resulted in a complex with bound Cd(II). NMR of the 113Cd-Cox4 truncate showed a resonance of 662 ppm (Fig. 2B). The similar chemical shift of the Cd-Cox4 C-terminal truncate suggests that the C-terminal His residues do not contribute to Zn(II) coordination, leaving His-119 as the likely nitrogen donor to Zn(II) in the WT protein. The C-terminal His-rich sequence in Cox4 is able to bind an additional Zn(II). Cox4 purified from E. coli cultured in the presence of supplemental ZnCl2 was recovered with 1.7 mol eq of bound Zn(II), whereas a Cox4 truncate lacking the C-terminal 6 residues bound only a single Zn(II) ion. Zn(II) binding to the C-terminal His-rich motif results in Cox4 aggregation. Titration of 15N-labeled Cox4 with additional ZnSO4 results in a broadening of the resonances, whereas a similar titration with the C-terminal truncate failed to show any resonance broadening (supplemental Fig. S1). EXAFS analysis of the C-terminal truncate Zn-Cox4 complex was used to confirm the coordination environment of the metal (Fig. 3). Quantitative analysis of the EXAFS using curve fitting indicated a mixed coordination environment with three sulfurs at 2.32 Å and either 1 or 2 nitrogen or oxygen ligands at 2.02 Å. The four-coordinate and five-coordinate alternatives gave equivalent fits, but which of these is present can be revealed by comparison of bond lengths. Examination of the Cambridge Crystal Structure data base indicates that the bond lengths are fully consistent with a four-coordinate species, whereas a five-coordinate alternative is precluded as this would give much longer bond lengths for both Zn–S and Zn–O/N ligands. Fourier transform peaks near 3 and 4 Å are often taken as a fingerprint of histidine coordination. These are not clearly observed in our data; however, their absence does not definitely preclude His coordination, especially in the presence of very large backscattering from three sulfur ligands. Mutagenesis Analysis of Zinc Ligands in Cox4—To assess the role of His-119 and the three conserved Cys residues in Zn(II) coordination and function, mutagenesis analysis was undertaken. Yeast (cox4Δ) transformed with a vector containing either WT COX4 or a mutant gene was tested on glycerol-containing medium for respiratory growth. Cox4 mutants with Cys > Ser substitutions at the three conserved positions individually failed to support cell growth on glycerol-containing medium regardless of whether the mutant gene was expressed on a low copy (Fig. 4A) or high copy (data not shown) vector, whereas the WT COX4 rescued glycerol growth. The addition of 8 mm ZnCl2 to the mutant cultures failed to support glycerol growth (data not shown). The Cys > Ser mutant variants of Cox4 are each unstable proteins and fail to accumulate (Fig. 4B). CcO fails to assemble in cells lacking Cox4 (12Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test whether assembly is precluded in cells with Cys > Ser mutant Cox4, mitochondria purified from cox4Δ cells containing C111S Cox4 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed for Cox2. No Cox2 was detected in the mutant cells, although a robust Cox2 band was detected in WT cells (data not shown). Mutational analysis was carried out on His-119 to evaluate its importance in Cox4 function. Alanine, aspartate, and cysteine substitutions were engineered. Aspartate and cysteine substitutions were attempted to provide a potential Zn(II) donor ligand. Each His mutant Cox4 enabled cells to propagate on glycerol medium when overexpressed but not when expressed from a low copy plasmid (Fig. 5A), and as expected, mutant protein levels were detected (Fig. 5B). Partial CcO activity was observed in cells containing the high copy mutants (Fig. 5C). In contrast, cells harboring either the H119D or H119C mutant Cox4 exhibited limited growth on zinc-supplemented glycerol medium when the mutants were on low copy plasmids (Fig. 5A). These results are consistent with low affinity Zn(II) binding to the H119D and H119C mutant Cox4 proteins. Consistent with the 113Cd NMR studies above, the C-terminal truncate lacking the C-terminal 3 His residues resembled WT Cox4 in respiratory growth (data not shown). These results implicate His-119 as the fourth Zn(II) ligand in yeast Cox4. Biophysical Studies on the H119D Mutant Cox4—Because the H119D mutant Cox4 was less stable for metal substitution, we elected to use Co(II) electronic spectroscopy as a more rapid analysis probe to monitor the coordination environment. Wild-type and mutant Cox4 were converted to Co(II) complexes for UV-visible spectroscopy. The absorption in the visible range between 550 and 700 nm arises from d-d transitions of unpaired electrons and provides information on the Co(II) coordination environment (10Bertini I. Luchinat C. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Advances in Inorganic Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984Google Scholar). The absorption envelope of Co-Cox4 lies between 600 and 720 nm and is typical of a distorted tetrahedral environment with coordination by three sulfurs and one nitrogen ligand based on known Co+2-substituted proteins (Fig. 6). The molar absorptivity greater than 500 m-1 cm-1 is consistent with three sulfurs. The absorption envelope for the d-d transitions of Co-Cox4 H119D is red-shifted compared with the envelope of the wild-type protein (Fig. 6). The wild-type construct has maxima at 648 and 698 nm and a prominent shoulder at 620 nm, whereas the H119D mutant displays absorbance maxima near 700 and 720 nm. If His-44 were the fourth ligand in Cox4, the H119D substitution would now present an oxygen donor that is a weaker field ligand compared with a nitrogen atom. The lower crystal field splitting energy would make the d-d transition less energetic, resulting in a red shift of the spectral envelope. Cobalt electronic spectroscopy data substantiates His-119 as the fourth ligand. Solution Structure of Zn-Cox4—The 80-residue Zn-Cox4 complex was subjected to multidimensional NMR spectroscopy for structure determination. His-119 was confirmed to be the fourth Zn(II) ligand by virtue of the chemical shift difference of 15N resonances of the imidazole ring of a histidine residue for coordinated versus noncoordinated His residues (about 220 ppm for the metal-bound nitrogen versus 180 or 250 ppm, the two latter values depending on whether the nitrogen is protonated or not) (31Chen Y.L.

https://openalex.org/W2074071454,"We have previously shown that MEF (myeloid ELF1-like factor, also known as ELF4) functions as a transcriptional activator of the interleukin (IL)-8, perforin, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-3 genes in hematopoietic cells. MEF is also expressed in non-hematopoietic tissues including certain ovarian cancer cells. To define the function of MEF in these cells, we examined primary human ovarian epithelial tumors and found that MEF is expressed in a significant proportion of ovarian carcinomas, and in the CAOV3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines, but not in normal ovarian surface epithelium. Manipulating MEF levels in these cell lines altered their behavior; reducing MEF levels, using short hairpin RNA expressing vectors, significantly inhibited the proliferation of SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells in culture, and impaired the anchorage-independent growth of CAOV3 cells. Overexpression of MEF in SKOV3 cells (via retroviral transduction) significantly increased their growth rate, enhanced colony formation in soft agar and promoted tumor formation in nude mice. The oncogenic activity of MEF was further shown by the ability of MEF to transform NIH3T3 cells, and induce their tumor formation in nude mice. MEF is an important regulator of the tumorigenic properties of ovarian cancer cells and could be used a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2081692950,"The proto-oncoproteins ETS1 and growth factor independent-1 (GFI1) are implicated in cell growth and differentiation in various types of cells, and their deregulated expression is involved in malignant transformation. Here, we report that ETS1 and GFI1 interact and affect gene expression through their cross-talk. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that ETS1 bound directly to GFI1 via its Ets domain, and GFI1 bound to ETS1 via its zinc-finger domain. Luciferase (Luc) assays using artificial reporters showed that GFI1 repressed ETS1-mediated transcriptional activation and ETS1 repressed GFI1-mediated transcriptional activation, in a dose-dependent manner. However, in the Bax promoter where the Ets- and Gfi-binding sites (EBS and GBS) are adjacent, ETS1 and GFI1 cooperatively reduced activation. Site-directed mutagenesis on the EBS and GBS of the Bax promoter showed that both binding sites were necessary for full repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed that an ETS1-GFI1 complex formed on the Bax promoter even when either EBS or GBS was mutated. Introduction of small interfering RNA against ETS1 and/or GFI1 enhanced endogenous Bax gene expression. Our results suggest that the interaction between ETS1 and GFI1 facilitates their binding to specific sites on the Bax promoter and represses Bax expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2065793590,"Fbs1 is an F-box protein present abundantly in the nervous system. Similar to the ubiquitously expressed Fbs2, Fbs1 recognizes N-glycans at the innermost position as a signal for unfolded glycoproteins, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. Here, we show that the in vivo majority of Fbs1 is present as Fbs1-Skp1 heterodimers or Fbs1 monomers but not SCFFbs1 complex. The inefficient SCF complex formation of Fbs1 and the restricted presence of SCFFbs1 bound on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane were due to the short linker sequence between the F-box domain and the sugar-binding domain. In vitro, Fbs1 prevented the aggregation of the glycoprotein through the N-terminal unique sequence of Fbs1. Our results suggest that Fbs1 assists clearance of aberrant glycoproteins in neuronal cells by suppressing aggregates formation, independent of ubiquitin ligase activity, and thus functions as a unique chaperone for those proteins.

The SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein) complex, the largest known class of sophisticated E3 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin ligase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; RNaseB, ribonuclease B; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin ligase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; RNaseB, ribonuclease B; HA, hemagglutinin. ubiquitin ligases, consists of common components, Skp1, Cul1, and Roc1/Rbx1, as well as variable components known as F-box proteins that bind the substrates (1Feldman R.M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In this complex, the scaffold protein Cul1 (alias cullin1) interacts at the N terminus with the adaptor subunit Skp1 and at the C terminus with the RING-finger protein Roc1/Rbx1 that recruits a specific ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E2) for ubiquitylation. F-box proteins, interacting with Skp1 through the ∼40 amino acid F-box motif, play an indispensable role in the selection of target proteins for degradation because each distinct F-box protein usually binds a protein substrate(s) with a degree of selectivity for ubiquitylation through C-terminal protein-protein interaction domains (3Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The human genome contains 69 genes for F-box proteins and a large number of F-box proteins function in the specific ubiquitylation of a wide range of substrates. The F-box proteins are divided into three classes according to the type of substrate-binding domains. The two classes of binding domains are WD40 repeats and leucine-rich repeats, which are named Fbw (or FBXW) and Fbl (or FBXL) families, respectively (4Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The third class of F-box proteins is the Fbx (or FBXO) family that does not contain any of these domains. It has been reported that a subfamily under the Fbx family consists of at least five homologous F-box proteins containing a conserved FBA motif (5Ilyin G.P. Serandour A.L. Pigeon C. Rialland M. Glaise D. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Among them, Fbs1/Fbx2/NFB42/Fbg1 and Fbs2/Fbx6b/Fbg2 can bind to proteins with high mannose oligosaccharides modification that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (7Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Experiments using a fully reconstituted system showed that both Fbs1 and Fbs2 can form SCF-type ubiquitin ligase complexes specific for N-linked glycoproteins (7Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the Fbs1 or Fbs2 dominant-negative form or decrease of endogenous Fbs2 by small interfering RNA resulted in inhibition of degradation of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates, suggesting the involvement of SCFFbs1 and SCFFbs2 in the ERAD pathway. Interestingly, x-ray crystallographic and NMR studies of the substrate-binding domain of Fbs1 have revealed that Fbs1 interacts with the innermost chitobiose in N-glycans of glycoproteins by a small hydrophobic pocket located at the top of the β-sandwich, indicating that both Fbs1 and Fbs2 efficiently recognize the inner chitobiose structure in Man3–9GlcNAc2 glycans (9Mizushima T. Hirao T. Yoshida Y. Lee S.J. Chiba T. Iwai K. Yamaguchi Y. Kato K. Tsukihara T. Tanaka K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Indeed, the introduction of point mutation into the residues in the pocket impaired the binding activity toward its glycoprotein substrates. In general, the internal chitobiose structure of N-glycans in many native glycoproteins is not accessible by macromolecules. Fbs1 interacted with denatured glycoproteins more efficiently than native proteins, indicating that the innermost position of N-glycans becomes exposed upon protein denaturation and used as a signal of unfolded glycoproteins to be recognized by Fbs1 (10Yoshida Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Of the Fbs family proteins, whereas Fbs2 is distributed ubiquitously in a variety of cells and tissues, Fbs1 is expressed only in neurons (7Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In considering the involvement of these F-box proteins in the ERAD pathway in general, the restricted expression of Fbs1 in neurons remains a mystery. In this study, we found that the major population of Fbs1 protein did not form the SCFFbs1 complex in cells although Fbs1 is known to act as a compartment of SCF-type ubiquitin ligase (8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results showed that the sequence of the intervening segment between the F-box domain and the substrate-binding domain of the Fbs1 hampered the assembly of the SCFFbs1 complex in the cytosol without affecting the association with Skp1. The Skp1-Fbs1 heterodimers as well as SCFFbs1 complex effectively prevented the aggregation of the glycoprotein in vitro, and this activity was dependent on the presence of the N-terminal domain and the substrate-binding domain of Fbs1. Our data thus imply that Skp1 and Fbs1 may function in both SCF and non-SCF complexes. Affinity Purification and Immunoprecipitation of Brain Lysate—The preparation of lysates from mouse brains and purification of Fbs1 by using a ribonuclease B (RNaseB) column were performed as described previously (10Yoshida Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, we used polyclonal antibody to Fbs1 as described previously (11Yoshida Y. Adachi E. Fukiya K. Iwai K. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, we used rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Fbs1, Cul1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and Skp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for Fbs1 and Skp1 blots or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG light chain (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for Cul1 blots. Lectin blotting was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ConA (Seikagaku-kogyo, Japan) as described previously (11Yoshida Y. Adachi E. Fukiya K. Iwai K. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glycerol Gradient Analysis—The fraction eluated with 0.1 m chitobiose from the RNaseB resin was prepared from 0.5 ml of lysates (14 mg/ml) from mouse brains. The eluate was dialyzed against TBS. The resultant fraction and a 1-mg lysate of brains were used for glycerol gradient analysis. Samples and molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) were fractionated by 4–17% (v/v) linear glycerol density gradient centrifugation (22 h, 100,000 × g) as described previously (12Tanahashi N. Murakami Y. Minami Y. Shimbara N. Hendil K.B. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14336-14345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Immunological Analysis—PC12 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. For neuronal differentiation, PC12 cells were treated with 10–20 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Invitrogen) on collagen-coated plates. 293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected as described previously (8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Fbs1 mutant vectors consisting of Fbs1 and Fbs2 fragments were generated by PCR, and those sequences were verified. Whole cell lysates were prepared with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant and precipitate fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant that was prepared by centrifugation of freezing-and-thawing cell lysates in TBS at 8,000 × g for 20 min and at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitate fraction was solubilized with Triton X-100. Each immunoprecipitation analysis was performed for whole cell lysates or subcellular fraction of cells by using the same amount of proteins. Monoclonal antibodies to calnexin and rhodopsin were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), respectively. Antibodies to FLAG, HA, and fetuin have been described previously (8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase Analysis—The expression plasmid for P23H rhodopsin was kindly provided by M. E. Cheetham (University College London). Pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (7Yoshida Y. Tokunaga F. Chiba T. Iwai K. Tanaka K. Tai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of P23H rhodopsin expression plasmid and 1 μg of FLAG-tagged Fbs1 derivatives or pcDNA3-FLAG plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were starved for 30 min and labeled for 1 h with 150 μCi of Pro-Mix l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences) per milliliter. After washing, the cells were chased with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum in the presence or in the absence of 50 μg/ml MG132 (Peptide Institute, Tokyo, Japan) for the indicated time intervals. After the harvested cells were lysed by TBS containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Nonidet P-40, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-rhodopsin and FLAG antibodies. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The His-tagged Fbs1 ΔF, Fbs1 ΔP baculovirus were produced by Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The SCFFbs1, Skp1-Fbs1 dimers, Fbs1 Fbs1 ΔF, Fbs1 ΔP, Skp1-ΔP dimers, and Fbs1 ΔN were obtained by baculovirus-infected HighFive cells as described previously (10Yoshida Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using RNaseB-immobilized beads as a ligand and chitobiose as an eluent, and the eluates were dialyzed to 1,000 volumes of TBS three times. In vitro ubiquitylation assays were performed as described previously (10Yoshida Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Aggregation Assay—Jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma) was desalted using a NAP-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The desalted protein was lyophilized and redissolved at 21.7 μm in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 6 m GdnHCl as described previously (13Paquet M.E. Leach M.R. Williams D.B. Methods (Oxf.). 2005; 35: 338-347Google Scholar). After denaturation for 60 min at room temperature, samples were diluted to 0.3 μm in 1 ml of TBS containing various concentrations of bovine serum albumin or recombinant Fbs1 derivatives. Protein aggregation was monitored at 25 °C over a period of 60 min by measuring absorbance at 360 nm. Multiple States of Fbs1 in Brain—Fbs1 has been found in the fraction eluted with di-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (thereafter referred to as chitobiose) from GlcNAc-terminated fetuin of lysates prepared from mouse brain (8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Fbs1 and Skp1 proteins were detected in the eluted fraction with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, but we could not detect the apparent band of Cul1. However, the formation of the SCFFbs1 complex was confirmed not only by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells but also by reconstitution of baculovirally expressed recombinant SCFFbs1 proteins. To address these contradictory observations, we tested whether endogenous Fbs1 in the mouse brain forms the SCF complex by examining the interaction of Fbs1 with Cul1 (Fig. 1A). Fbs1 can be easily purified by affinity chromatography using RNaseB that contains a high mannose oligosaccharide as a ligand and chitobiose as an eluent (10Yoshida Y. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since Fbs1 contains a single binding domain toward an N-glycan, it seems likely that the eluated Fbs1 protein or its complex from the RNaseB-immobilized resin is free from its substrates. Indeed, the glycoproteins modified with high mannose oligosaccharides were not included in the eluates by chitobiose (Fig. 1B). Although Skp1 was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with Fbs1 from the lysate of mouse brain, the amount of Skp1 that was eluted with Fbs1 from the RNaseB resin was small (Fig. 1A). Despite the difference in the quantities of Skp1 bound to Fbs1 in the fractions between eluates from the RNaseB resin and immunoprecipitation with an anti-Fbs1 antibody, almost the same and small quantities of Cul1 were detected in these fractions. These results suggest that major populations of substrate-free Fbs1 and substrate-binding Fbs1 are present as Fbs1 monomers and Fbs1-Skp1 dimers, respectively, and the binding of substrates to Fbs1 does not influence the weak SCF complex formation. To examine the behavior of endogenous Fbs1 in more detail, eluates from the RNaseB resin and lysates from the mouse brain were separated by a 4–17% glycerol density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1C). The distribution of Fbs1 (∼42 kDa) in the chitobiose eluates corresponded to the position of Fbs1 monomers (fraction 4) and Skp1-Fbs1 dimers (∼63 kDa)(fraction 6). Although Cul1 was not detected in any fractions, the peak of Skp1 in eluates from the RNaseB resin was in the position of the Skp1-Fbs1 dimer. On the other hand, Fbs1 protein in brain lysate was detected in a broad range of fractions mainly larger than Fbs1-Skp1 dimers, indicating that most Fbs1, if not all, is associated with various glycoprotein substrates; i.e. Fbs1-Skp1 dimers maintain the association with glycoproteins in vivo. Cul1 (∼90 kDa) in brain lysate was distributed broadly in higher density fractions, indicating its association with various other SCF-components. Minor Population of Fbs1 Forms SCF Complex on ER—We next expressed FLAG-tagged F-box proteins alone or their combination with HA-tagged Skp1 in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2A). The expression of HA-tagged Skp1 increased the amount of exogenous F-box proteins, suggesting that Skp1 stabilizes F-box proteins (lanes 1–8). Cul1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Fbs2 and Fbg3, which are highly homologous with Fbs1, or βTrCP1/Fbw1, one of the Fbw family members (lanes 11–16). The interaction between Cul1 and these F-box proteins increased upon co-expression of Skp1. However, unlike these F-box proteins, Fbs1 was almost undetectable in the immune complex with Cul1, regardless of the overexpression of exogenous Skp1 (lanes 9 and 10), although Fbs1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Skp1 as well as other F-box proteins (lanes 18, 20, 22, and 24 in the αFlag panel). Moreover, the amount of Cul1 associated with exogenous Skp1 was lower in the presence of Fbs1 than in those of other F-box proteins, suggesting that expression of Fbs1 prevents forming other SCF complexes by dimerizing with Skp1 (lanes 18, 20, 22, and 24 in the αCul1 panel). These results suggest that Fbs1 can strongly bind Skp1 but is weak in forming the SCFFbs1 complex. We have recently reported that Fbs1 is a cytosolic protein but that part of Fbs1 associates with the ER membrane through interaction with p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) (11Yoshida Y. Adachi E. Fukiya K. Iwai K. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the ER membrane-associated Fbs1 formed the SCF complex. Lysates of 293T and HeLa cells expressing FLAG-tagged Fbs1 were fractionated into the 100,000 × g supernatant and precipitate fractions excluding the 8,000 × g precipitate, and then Fbs1 was immunoprecipitated from these fractions by anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, Cul1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Fbs1 mainly from the precipitate (p) fraction (lanes 4 and 8). Although the association of Fbs1 with Skp1 occurred more effectively in the supernatant (s) fraction, the formation of the SCF complex, including Fbs1, was hardly detected in the supernatant fraction (lanes 3 and 7). Moreover, we examined whether endogenous Fbs1 formed the SCF complex in the precipitate fraction using nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells, which endogenously express Fbs1 (14Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W. DiBenedetto A. Shen N. Stone N. Paulson H. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35222-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, part of Cul1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Fbs1 from the precipitate (p) fraction. These results indicate that the major population of endogenous Fbs1 is present as the Fbs1-Skp1 heterodimers or the Fbs1 monomers in the cytosol, and a minor population of Fbs1 forms the SCF complex bound on the ER membrane. Linker Sequence of Fbs1 Prevents SCF Complex Formation—Although the SCF complex formation of Fbs1 was inefficient, Fbs2 formed the SCF complex effectively (Fig. 2A). To identify the region(s) of Fbs1 that impedes SCF complex formation, we examined the ability of various fusion proteins containing Fbs1 and Fbs2 fragments to form the complex and compared these findings with the full-length proteins in co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3A). Fbs1 ΔF was used as negative control that did not bind to Skp1 (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Fbs1 YW and Fbs1 ΔC, both of which are deficient in substrate binding, could not restore SCF complex formation, indicating that the interaction between Fbs1 and its substrates does not affect the complex formation (lanes 4 and 5). The N-terminal sequence of Fbs1 called the P domain is unique and is not seen in other F-box proteins, but the removal of this domain from Fbs1 or the addition to Fbs2 did not affect the complex formation (Fbs1 ΔP and Fbs2 P1: lanes 6 and 13). Exchange of the F-box domains between Fbs1 and Fbs2 caused the loss of the Skp1 binding activity, probably due to the incorrect folding (Fbs1 F2, Fbs1 ΔPF2, Fbs2 F1, and Fbs2 PF1: lanes 7, 8, 10, and 11, respectively). However, the replacement of the Fbs1 N-terminal region (which contains P and F-box domains and linker sequence) with the Fbs2 N-terminal region rescued the complex formation (Fbs-2N1C: lane 9). In contrast, the addition of the Fbs1 N-terminal region instead of the Fbs2 N-terminal region markedly reduced the activity of Fbs2 to form the SCF complex but did not affect the Skp1 binding (Fbs-1N2C: lane 12). The linker sequences of the intervening segments between the F-box domain and the substrate-binding domain showed lower homology than other portions between Fbs1 and Fbs2, suggesting that the Fbs1 linker sequence is responsible for impeding the SCFFbs1 complex formation. Indeed, only the Fbs1 mutant protein that contained the Fbs2 linker sequence could form the SCF complex, but the efficiency of the SCF complex formation was less than that of Fbs-2N1C (Fbs1 I2: lane 15). On the other hand, Fbs2 protein containing the Fbs1 linker sequence and the Fbs1 protein without its linker sequence did not seem to show the correct folding for Skp1 binding (Fbs2 I1 and Fbs1 ΔI: lanes 16 and 17). The Fbs1 mutant in which the F-box domain and the linker sequence are replaced with those of Fbs2 forms the SCF complex effectively. Thus, we conclude that the Fbs1 linker sequence between the F-box and substrate-binding domains hampers the SCFFbs1 complex formation. We next compared the localization of Fbs1, Fbs2, and the mutant Fbs1 proteins capable of forming the SCF complex: Fbs-2N1C and Fbs1 I2 (Fig. 3C). Although a minor population of Fbs1 in the precipitate (p) fraction formed the SCF complex, most Fbs2 formed the SCFFbs2 complex in the supernatant (s) fraction as well as the precipitate fraction. Fbs-2N1C could form the SCF complex mainly in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the amount of Cul1 co-immunoprecipitated with Fbs1 I2 was similar in both fractions. These results suggest that the linker sequence of Fbs1 does not only impede the formation of the SCF complex but also restricts the localization of the SCF complex bound on the ER membrane. Expression of Mutant Fbs1 That Forms E3 Easily Induces Proteolysis of Its Substrates—To confirm that most Fbs1 in the cells is inactive to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we next examined the ability of the mutant Fbs1 that readily forms the SCF complex (Fbs-2N1C) to ubiquitylate the substrates. It has been shown that P23H mutated rhodopsin (hereafter referred to as P23H) is an ERAD substrate, and its N-linked glycosylation is required for the degradation (15Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported previously, rhodopsin monomer is ∼40–43 kDa, but the majority of P23H was detected as high molecular weight complex multimers by immunoblotting with anti-rhodopsin antibody (Fig. 4A). Wild-type Fbs1, but not the substrate-binding defective mutant Fbs1 YW, was able to associate with P23H effectively, suggesting that Fbs1 binds to P23H through its N-glycans. On the other hand, Fbs-2N1C could bind to P23H, although its binding to P23H seemed weaker than that of wild-type Fbs1 (Fig. 4A, left panel). Since the activity to bind RNaseB was not different between Fbs1 and Fbs-2N1C (data not shown), it seems likely that the SCFFbs-2N1C causes degradation of P23H through its ubiquitylation. Interestingly, the quantity of P23H decreased upon Fbs-2N1C expression (Fig. 4A, right panel). It has been reported that the degradation of P23H was suppressed by MG132 treatment (15Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Saliba R.S. Munro P.M. Luthert P.J. Cheetham M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The quantities of both P23H associated with Fbs-2N1C and the P23H protein were recovered by the addition of MG132. Moreover, we performed pulse-chase analysis using 293T cells co-expressing the P23H mutant and FLAG-tagged Fbs1 derivatives. The degradation of P23H was suppressed by MG132 treatment as reported previously (Fig. 4B). Although wild-type Fbs1 or the YW mutant did not influence the kinetics of P23H degradation, co-expression of Fbs-2N1C efficiently promoted its degradation. On the other hand, like wild-type Fbs1, Fbs1 I2, could associate with P23H, but its expression did not influence both the amount of P23H and the kinetics of P23H degradation (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the non-SCF complex of Fbs1 can be converted to an active E3 ligase by introducing the complex-forming activity mapped onto the F-box domain and the linker sequence of Fbs2. Fbs1 Suppresses Aggregation of Denatured Glycoprotein in Vitro—We reported previously that the expression of Fbs1 inhibits aggresome formation in Cos7 cells (8Yoshida Y. Chiba T. Tokunaga F. Kawasaki H. Iwai K. Suzuki T. Ito Y. Matsuoka K. Yoshida M. Tanaka K. Tai T. Nature. 2002; 418: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since Fbs1 interacts with denatured glycoproteins more efficiently than native glycoproteins, we examined whether Fbs1 functions as a molecular chaperone for glycoproteins in vitro. To this end, we prepared recombinant SCFFbs1, Skp1-Fbs1 dimers, Fbs1, Fbs1 ΔF, Fbs1 ΔP, Skp1-ΔP dimers, and Fbs1 ΔN, all of which were produced by using a baculovirus system (Fig. 5A). To obtain highly purified recombinant proteins, we purified them by using the affinity for the RNaseB resin but not nickel resin toward His tag. The purified SCFFbs1 but not Skp1-Fbs1 dimers could ubiquitylate GlcNAc-terminated fetuin (GTF) effectively (Fig. 5B). We next assessed the ability of these proteins or their complexes to suppress the aggregation by using denatured α-mannosidase that contains high mannose type oligosaccharides, a typical substrate for the glycoprotein aggregation assay (17Stronge V.S. Saito Y. Ihara Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39779-39787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although Fbs1 alone suppressed the aggregation of denatured α-mannosidase in a concentration-dependent manner, the Fbs1-Skp1 dimers as well as the SCFFbs1 complex suppressed the aggregation much more effectively than Fbs1 alone (Fig. 5C). Although the addition of half-molar of Fbs1 ΔF did not affect the aggregation of denatured α-mannosidase, ΔF was also active to suppress the aggregation at a level similar to that of Fbs1 alone in an equal molar ratio, suggesting that the partial suppression by Fbs1 is independent of the hydrophobic F-box domain. On the other hand, ΔN, consisting of substrate-binding domain alone, enhanced its aggregation. Both the aggregation-suppressing activity of SCFFbs1, Skp1-Fbs1 dimers, or Fbs1 and the aggregation-enhancing activity of ΔN were inhibited by chitobiose (Fig. 5D and not shown). In contrast, these recombinant Fbs1 protein complexes had no effect on the aggregation of non-glycosylated proteins such as citrate synthase and luciferase (data not shown). Importantly, ΔP as well as the Skp1-ΔP dimers could not suppress the aggregation of α-mannosidase in an equal molar ratio (Fig. 5, C and E, and not shown). These results indicate that the Skp1-Fbs1 dimers effectively suppress the aggregation of denatured glycoproteins by recognizing the exposed chitobiose in N-glycans and that the P domain of Fbs1 is required for this aggregation suppressing activity. The F-box family of proteins, which are the substrate-recognition subunits of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, play important roles in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in eukaryotes (18Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 19Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether all F-box proteins indeed function as receptor subunits of SCF complexes. For example, it has been reported that at least two F-box proteins, Ctfl3 and Rcy1, out of 11 F-box proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, do not form SCF complexes (20Galan J.M. Wiederkehr A. Seol J.H. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Deshaies R.J. Riezman H. Peter M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Kaplan K.B. Hyman A.A. Sorger P.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Russell I.D. Grancell A.S. Sorger P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 933-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since not all RING-finger proteins are ubiquitin ligases, it is possible that non-canonical F-box proteins that fail to form the SCF complex play some important roles other than ubiquitin ligase activity. In the present study, we showed that the SCF complex formation of Fbs1, which recognizes N-glycans, is not efficient and that the intervening segment between the F-box domain and the sugar-binding domain of Fbs1 suppresses the formation of the SCF complex. The major population of Fbs1 is present as Fbs1-Skp1 heterodimers or Fbs1 monomers, which can inhibit the aggregation of the glycoproteins. Our results show that Fbs1 contributes to a chaperone function in addition to the role of the SCFFbs1 ubiquitin ligase, opening new perspectives for cellular activities of F-box proteins. Although most endogenous Fbs1 was not assembled into the SCFFbs1 complex, a minor population of Fbs1 was capable of forming the SCFFbs1 complex in cells. Moreover, the SCFFbs1 complex could be produced in insect cells by infection with the baculovirus, indicating that Fbs1 can intrinsically form the SCF complex. It is worth noting that the SCFFbs1 was mainly present in the 100,000 × g precipitate fraction including the microsome (Fig. 2, B and C). It is not clear why the SCFFbs1 is bound to the ER membrane, although it is plausible that it plays a pivotal role in the ERAD pathway. To examine how the SCF complex formation of Fbs1 was promoted in vivo, we treated Fbs1-expressing cells with ER stress inducers, such as thapsigargin and dithiothreitol or a proteasome inhibitor MG132. These treatments, however, did not affect the SCF complex formation (data not shown). Furthermore, although the interaction between Fbs1 and its substrate glycoproteins did not affect the SCF complex formation (Figs. 1A and 3B), we examined the effects of overexpression of p97/VCP, Fbs1 substrates, Skp1, or Cul1. No protein other than Cul1 accelerated the SCFFbs1 formation not only in the 100,000 × g precipitate fraction but also in the cytosol (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Intriguingly, whereas Fbs1 and Skp1 were mainly located in the cytosol (100,000 × g supernatant fraction), Cul1 was detected not only in the cytosol but also in the 100,000 × g precipitate fraction (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3C), suggesting that Cul1 is recruited to the microsome membrane where the SCFFbs1 complex will be assembled to ubiquitylate efficiently the N-linked glycosylated ERAD substrates. Fbs1 belongs to a subfamily consisting of at least five homologous F-box proteins that contain a conserved FBA motif in their C termini (5Ilyin G.P. Serandour A.L. Pigeon C. Rialland M. Glaise D. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Winston J.T. Koepp D.M. Zhu C. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Among them, at least Fbs2 recognizes high mannose oligosaccharides as well as Fbs1 and forms an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase. The Fbs1 protein sequence shows highly homologous to that of Fbs2 other than the P domain of Fbs1 and C-terminal part of Fbs2, but the linker sequence between the F-box and FBA domains shows lower homology than other portions (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the difference in the ability for assembling into the SCF complex between Fbs1 and Fbs2 is ascribed to the short linker sequence (92–117 amino acids of Fbs1). Although Fbs2 formed the SCF complex efficiently in the cytosol as well as the 100,000 × g precipitate fraction, the SCFFbs1 formation was mainly present bound on the ER membrane (Fig. 3C). Although it is not clear whether the linker sequence of Fbs1 prevents the SCFFbs1 from being in the cytosol or causes the formation of the SCFFbs1 bound on the ER membrane, this limited localization of SCFFbs1 is also due to the linker sequence (Fig. 3C). Crystal structure and mutational analyses of Cdc4 and βTrCP1 revealed the importance of orientation and rigidity in the linker sequence between F-box and WD40 domains for their in vivo function (23Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 24Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The linker sequences of Cdc4 and βTrCP1 are longer than that of Fbs1 and form three or four helix globular domains. On the other hand, the linker sequence of Fbs1 is an unstructured domain that consists of a flexible linker loop and an α-helix and is too far from Cul1 to influence directly the SCF complex formation. 3Mizushima, T., Yoshida, Y., Kumanomidou, T., Hasegawa, Y., Suzuki, A., Yamane, T., and Tanaka, K., unpublished data. The information of the structure of Skp1-Fbs1 suggests that the prevention of the SCF complex formation by this unstructured linker sequence can be cancelled by binding to the membrane or unidentified proteins on the ER. In this study, we demonstrated that the Fbs1 could suppress the aggregation of denatured glycoproteins. This activity is due to the N-terminal P domain that is not seen in other F-box proteins. This N-terminal domain has been reported as a PEST sequence rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, which are often found in short-lived proteins (25Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence in Fbs1, however, did not seem to act as a general PEST because the deletion of the P domain from Fbs1 or the addition to Fbs2 did not affect the protein stability (Fig. 3). More recently, it has been reported that U-box type E3 CHIP (C terminus of Hsc-70-interacting protein) is associated with Fbs1 through the P domain (26Nelson R.F. Glenn K.A. Miller V.M. Wen H. Paulson H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20242-20251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect the E3 activity of the Skp1-Fbs1 dimers produced in the insect cells toward glycoprotein substrate GlcNAc-terminated fetuin (Fig. 5B), it is possible that an unknown chaperone molecule of insect cells was bound to the P domain of Fbs1. Skp1-Fbs1 dimers and Fbs1 monomers as well as the SCFFbs1 complex showed activity to suppress the denatured glycoprotein aggregation, suggesting that the majority of Fbs1 is present as Skp1-Fbs1 dimers or Fbs1 monomers in cells and is not an intermediate prior to assembly of the SCFFbs1 complex, but rather, a novel functional unit. It is predicted that more than 30% of eukaryotic proteins contain substantial regions of disordered structure (27Fink A.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). One feature of intrinsically disordered proteins is their rapid degradation. Intracellular protein quality control, especially the degradation of proteins with aberrant structures, is thought to be important particularly in quiescent cells such as neurons (28Forman M.S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Fbs1 is expressed mainly in neuronal cells in the adult brain (14Erhardt J.A. Hynicka W.

Recently, it has been reported (29Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N.

Nature. 2006; 441: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) that loss of autophagy leads to neurodegeneration even in the absence of any aggregation-prone mutant proteins. Moreover, these reports have shown that the primary role of autophagy under normal conditions is the turnover of diffused cytosolic proteins, rather than direct elimination of inclusion bodies (29Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar, 30Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Nature. 2006; 441: 880-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that Fbs1 contributes to the clearance of such cytosolic proteins by constitutive autophagy, like other chaperone systems, to suppress the aggregation of abnormal glycoproteins in neurons. For this, the N-terminal unique sequence of Fbs1, the P domain, having chaperone function, may have been made up during evolution. Since Cul1 is a common component of the SCF complexes and Fbs1 is abundant in neuronal cells, Fbs1 may also evolutionally acquire the linker sequence that suppresses the SCFFbs1 complex formation to supply Cul1 toward other F-box proteins. It also seems possible that Fbs1 functions as a chaperone to keep the solubility of a particular glycoprotein(s) in the cytosol in neuronal cells. Further studies are needed to identify the Fbs1 target glycoproteins in neuronal cells, which may reveal the role of Fbs1 in maintaining homeostasis of neuronal cells. We thank M. E.

https://openalex.org/W2039679053,"PsbT is a small chloroplast-encoded hydrophobic polypeptide associated with the D1/D2 heterodimer of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center and is required for the efficient post-translational repair of photodamaged PSII. Here we addressed that role in detail in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild type and ΔpsbT cells by analyzing the activities of PSII, the assembly of PSII proteins, and the redox components of PSII during photoinhibition and repair. Strong illumination of cells for 15 min decreased the activities of electron transfer through PSII and QA photoreduction by 50%, and it reduced the amount of atomic manganese by 20%, but it did not affect the steady-state level of PSII proteins, photoreduction of pheophytin (pheoD1), and the amount of bound plastoquinone (QA), indicating that the decrease in PSII activity resulted mainly from inhibition of the electron transfer from pheoD1 to QA. In wild type cells, we observed parallel recovery of electron transfer activity through PSII and QA photoreduction, suggesting that the recovery of QA activity is one of the rate-limiting steps of PSII repair. In ΔpsbT cells, the repairs of electron transfer activity through PSII and of QA photoreduction activity were both impaired, but PSII protein turnover was unaffected. Moreover, about half the QA was lost from the PSII core complex during purification. Since PsbT is intimately associated with the QA-binding region on D2, we propose that this polypeptide enhances the efficient recovery of QA photoreduction by stabilizing the structure of the QA-binding region.

Light energy absorbed by antenna pigments is transferred to reaction centers where excitons are converted into redox energy that is used to drive photosynthetic electron transfer and generate NADPH. ATP synthesis is coupled to the electron transfer reaction and, together with NADPH, is used to assimilate carbon dioxide. Although light is an essential energy source for photosynthesis, strong light causes a significant steady-state decrease in photosynthetic activity in vivo, a process referred to as photoinhibition. The main target of photoinhibition is believed to be D1, one of the PSII 2The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; TAP, Tris acetate-phosphate; Chl, chlorophyll; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DPC, diphenylcarbazide; DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; TAP, Tris acetate-phosphate; Chl, chlorophyll; DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DPC, diphenylcarbazide; DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. reaction center proteins preferentially damaged by strong light (1Aro E.M.

Soc. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that photoinhibition occurs through a singlet oxygen (1O2), a potential D1-damaging agent, produced by the triplet state of P680 generated by charge recombination in PSII (1Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 3Noguchi T.

A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The mechanism that generates the triplet state of P680 may depend on light intensity. Under low light, where consecutive photochemical reactions within a PSII reaction center decrease, the unstable charge-separated states, such as QB–/S2 and QB–/S3, are maintained relatively longer, which accelerates the charge recombination to the QB/S1 and QB/S2 states, respectively. This charge recombination generates the P680 triplet state (5Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Strong light, in contrast, causes full reduction of the plastoquinone pool and results in the reduction of the secondary quinone acceptor QB to QBH2. QBH2 is released from its binding pocket on D1, leaving the QB-binding site unoccupied. In the absence of QB, the single-reduced primary quinone acceptor QA (QA–) is stabilized. Further strong illumination leads to further reduction of QA– to the double-reduced state, QAH2, resulting in the release of QAH2 from its binding pocket of D2. The PSII complex without QA generates the triplet state of P680 by charge recombination between the oxidized primary donor (P680+) and the reduced intermediate electron acceptor of pheophytin (pheoD1–) (1Aro E.M.

An alternative hypothesis is that reactive oxygen species do not stimulate PSII photodamage but inhibit its repair (6Nishiyama Y. Yamamoto H. Allakhverdiev S.I. Inaba M. Yokota A. Murata N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5587-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Analysis of the photoinhibition action spectra led to a third hypothesis; donor-side photoinhibition (7Keren N. Ohad I.

Murata N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8494-8499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and since ultraviolet and blue light inactivate the oxygen-evolving complex (11Ohnishi N. Allakhverdiev S.I. Takahashi S. Higashi S. Watanabe M. Nishiyama Y. Murata N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8494-8499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the manganese cluster is the site of primary photodamage and that the excitons absorbed by chlorophylls damage the PSII reaction center (10Hakala M. Tuominen I. Keränen M. Tyystjärvi T. Tyystjärvi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). If that were the case, light would generate the highly reactive cation radical P680+, which could oxidize surrounding proteins and cofactors. PSII photoinhibition occurs even in low light (12Tyystjärvi E. Aro E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), although the damage might not be apparent in vivo because it is rapidly repaired. One of the earliest events in PSII repair is proteolysis of photodamaged D1 by proteases such as FtsH (13Bailey, S., Thompson, E., Nixon, P. J., Horton, P., Mullineaux, C. W., Robinson, C., and Mann, N. H. (2002) 277, 2006–2011Google Scholar, 14Lindahl M. Spetea C. Hundal T. Oppenheim A.B. Adam Z. Andersson B.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and incorporation of the newly synthesized D1 into PSII complexes. Several factors, such as cpSRP54 (19Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and cpSecY (20Zhang L. Paakkarinen V. Suorsa M. Aro E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37809-37814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), assist the targeting of the nascent D1 chain and its integration into the PSII complex. This light-induced rapid turnover of D1, as well as the replacement of its associated cofactors, is essential for maintaining PSII activity in all kinds of light conditions. Chloroplast-encoded PsbT is a hydrophobic polypeptide of 3.5 kDa with a single transmembrane helix associated with the PSII core complex (21Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Partial disintegration of the PSII core complex reveals that PsbT binds directly to the D1/D2 heterodimer of PSII (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recently determined three-dimensional structure of the PSII core complex places PsbT at the PSII dimer interface (23Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaouli K.B.J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). A psbT deletion mutant (ΔpsbT) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii accumulates functional PSII complex at 90% of wild type level and grows photoautotrophically like the wild type in low and moderate light (21Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, PsbT is not essential for the function and assembly of the PSII complex. An intriguing characteristic of ΔpsbT is that growth and PSII activity are significantly impaired under strong light (21Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that PsbT is not involved in protecting PSII against strong light but is required for the efficient repair of photodamaged PSII, in particular, post-translationally (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is expected that the repair of photodamaged PSII involves multiple steps, such as the degradation and replacement of the photodamaged proteins and the integration and activation of the redox components associated with D1. In the present study, we compared the repair of photodamaged PSII in wild type and ΔpsbT cells to identify the repair step(s) involving PsbT. Characterization of photoinhibition revealed that the steady-sate activity of QA photoreduction was the most significantly decreased during strong illumination and that the reactivation of QA was one of the rate-limiting repair steps. QA photoreduction activity took four times as long to recover in ΔpsbT cells than in wild type cells. In addition, the binding of QA to PSII core complex was destabilized in the absence of PsbT. These findings led us to conclude that PsbT maintains the stability of QA in the binding pocket and stimulates the efficient reactivation of QA after photoinhibition, which allows cells to grow in strong light. Strains and Growth Conditions—We used C. reinhardtii wild type strain 137c and the psbT deletion mutant ΔpsbT (21Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-log phase (3–4 × 106 cells ml–1) in Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (24Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in dim light (10 μmol photons m–2 s–1). Photoinhibition and Recovery—Mid-log phase cells were collected by centrifugation (3,200 × g for 10 min at 25 °C) and then resuspended in TAP medium at 10 μg Chl ml–1. 15 ml of cell suspension that had been transferred to a plastic dish (35 mm) was subjected to photoinhibition by strong light (4,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1) for 15 min and then incubated in low light (40 μmol photons m–2 s–1) for recovery of photodamaged PSII. 1 ml of cell suspension was collected at each indicated time point and then either used for measurement of O2-evolving activity or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Isolation of Thylakoid Membranes—Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described previously (25Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S. Franzen L. Rochaix J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Isolation of thylakoid membranes on a small scale was carried out by breaking cells with beads. Cells (200 μg Chl) were collected by centrifugation, washed once with Solution 1 (0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), and resuspended in 100 μl of Solution 1. The cells were broken by vortexing with 800 mg Zirconia/Silica beads (0.5 mm, BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK) for 5 min. The broken cells were recovered by washing the beads with 1.5 ml of Solution 1 and were then pelleted by centrifugation at 17,000 × g. The pellets were washed with Solution 2 (0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), suspended in 1.25 ml of Solution 3 (1.8 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), and then overlaid with 0.5 ml of Solution 4 (1.3 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) and 1.25 ml of Solution 5 (0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). The discontinuous sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 208,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (TLA100.3 rotor, Beckman Coulter). The green band containing the thylakoid membranes was separated in a 1.3 m sucrose layer, collected, diluted with 3 volumes of Solution 6 (10 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min, and then resuspended in Solution 6 at 0.8 mg Chl ml–1. Pulse Labeling Experiments—Cells grown to mid-log phase were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in TAP medium lacking sulfur, and incubated for 2 h as described previously (25Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S. Franzen L. Rochaix J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cells (10 μg Chl ml–1) were exposed to strong light (4,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1) for 15 min and then incubated with 50 μCi ml–1 [35S]Na2SO4. Pulse labeling was performed for 30 min in low light (40 μmol photons m–2 s–1) and terminated by addition of chloramphenicol (200 μgml–1). The pulse-labeled cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen at –20 °C. Thylakoid membranes (0.8 mg Chl ml–1) were isolated after the cells were broken with beads as described above and then solubilized on ice for 30 min with 0.8% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM). Chlorophyll proteins were separated by continuous sucrose density gradient (0.4–1.6 m) centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 14 h at 4 °C (TLS-55 rotor, Beckman Coulter) and then fractionated from the top of the gradient. Proteins were solubilized at 100 °C for 1 min with 2% SDS and 0.1 m dithiothreitol and separated by urea-SDS-PAGE as described previously (26Takahashi Y. Utsumi K. Yamamoto Y. Hatano A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolation of PSII Core Complex—We isolated the PSII core complex to estimate the amount of plastoquinone associated with it and to measure the photoaccumulation of reduced pheophytin and QA. Cells (400 μg Chl ml–1) were broken by vortexing with Zirconia/Silica beads for 5 min or with a French pressure cells, suspended in Solution 6 at 0.8 μg Chl ml–1, and solubilized with 0.8% DM on ice for 1 h. The resulting extracts were overlaid on a continuous sucrose density gradient (0.1–1.3 m), centrifuged at 197,000 × g for 14 h at 4 °C (SW-41Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter), and the second green band (A-2) was collected. A-2 was highly enriched in the PSII core complex but slightly contaminated by PSI complex. The relative concentration of PSII complex in each preparation was estimated by Western blotting using anti-D1 antibody when necessary. Freezing cells before breaking was avoided because it may increase in PSI contamination into A2. Gel Filtration Column Chromatography—Gel filtration column chromatography was performed using a Superose 6HR 10/30 column with a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (27Sakamoto W. Zaltsman A. Adam Z. Takahashi Y. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2843-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The elution buffer contained 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% DM. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. The molecular weight marker kit for gel-filtration chromatography (MW-GF-1000, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used to estimate apparent molecular masses. Estimation of Amount of Manganese, Pheophytin, and Plastoquinone—The amount of manganese atom bound to isolated thylakoid membranes was determined with a flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer, AA-660G, equipped with graphite furnace atomizer GFA-4B (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Pheophytin was extracted from cells and plastoquinone from purified PSII core complex with dimethylformamide, and both were separated by reverse-phase HPLC with a Shimadzu LC-10AD using a SCL-10A system controller and equipped with a Prodigy 5 (ODS 3, 100A) column (150 × 4.60 mm) (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA), as described previously (28Kashino Y. Kudoh S. Phycol. Res. 2003; 51: 168-172Crossref Google Scholar). The molar ratios of pheophytin to chlorophylls and plastoquinone to pheophytin were estimated as described previously (29Isogai Y. Nishimura M. Okayama S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1301-1306Google Scholar). The plastoquinone used for calibration was isolated from spinach and purified (30Barr R. Crane F.L. Avron M. Photosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1971: 372-408Google Scholar). The concentration of the standard plastoquinone solution was determined spectrophotometrically (MPS-2000, Shimadzu Co.) by chemical titration using sodium borohydride (30Barr R. Crane F.L. Avron M. Photosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1971: 372-408Google Scholar). HPLC elution profiles were analyzed at 255 nm for plastoquinone and 290 nm for plastoquinol. Electron Transfer Activity—The light-induced O2-evolving activity of cells (10 μg Chl ml–1) in TAP medium was measured using a Clark-type O2 electrode with an actinic light at 5,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1 in the presence of 0.2 mm phenyl-p-benzoquinone. Light-induced electron transport activity from diphenylcarbazide (DPC) to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) was measured with cells that were broken and treated with NH2OH. Cells were broken by vortexing in the presence of Zirconia/Silica beads for 30 s, resuspended in Solution 7 (5 mm NH2OH, 0.4 m sucrose, 20 mm NaCl, 40 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The broken cells were washed twice and then resuspended in Solution 8 (0.4 m sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 40 mm Mes-NaOH, pH 6.5). Photoreduction of DCIP was determined by measuring the light-induced absorbance decrease at 580 nm using a UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co.). The reaction mixture contained broken cells (5 μg Chl ml–1), 80 μm DCIP, and 0.5 mm DPC. Photoaccumulation of pheoD1– was analyzed by measuring the light-induced absorbance increase at 450 nm with a spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu Co.). A Corning 4–96 filter and a VR-67 red cutoff filter (Toshiba Co., Tokyo) were used for the measuring beam and for the actinic light, respectively. The reaction mixture contained PSII core complex (10 μg Chl ml–1), 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 μm methyl viologen, and 1–5 mg ml–1 sodium dithionite (31Klimov V.V. Klevanik A.V. Shuvalov V.A. Kransnovsky A.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Photoreduction of QA by continuous illumination (500 μmol photons m–2 s–1) was determined by measuring the absorption increase at 320 nm (32Takahashi Y. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 848: 183-192Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33van Gorkom H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The measuring beam was filtered with a U-340 filter (Edmund Japan Co., Tokyo), while the actinic light was filtered with a VY-50 filter (Toshiba, Tokyo). The reaction mixture contained PSII core complex (10–15 μg Chl ml–1), 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, and 2.55 μm ferricyanide. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Cellular and thylakoid proteins were solubilized in 2% SDS and 0.1 m dithiothreitol at 100 °C for 1 min and were separated by urea-SDS-PAGE (26Takahashi Y. Utsumi K. Yamamoto Y. Hatano A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, separated polypeptides were electrophoretically blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and were probed with specific polyclonal antibodies. The signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Analysis of Three-dimensional Structure of PSII Core Complex—Atomic coordinates for the cyanobacterial PSII core complex were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (1S5L and 2AXT) and were analyzed with the three-dimensional imaging software MolFeat (version 2.1) (FiatLux, Tokyo). Recovery of the Electron Transfer Activities through PSII—In a previous report, we showed that PsbT is involved in the efficient repair of photodamaged PSII via post-translational event(s) (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present report, we investigated the mechanism of that repair. We examined and compared light-induced electron transport activities through PSII during and after photoinhibition. As we observed previously (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the drop in O2-evolving activity over 15 min of strong illumination was similar in both strains, but recovery was much slower in ΔpsbT cells (Fig. 1A). The ΔpsbT cells need more than 3 h to fully recover the PSII activity under the present condition (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, photoinhibition and repair of the electron transfer activity from DPC to DCIP (DPC-DCIP activity) paralleled the O2-evolving activity (Fig. 1B). In contrast to that, the amount of PSII protein remained constant (Fig. 1C) (22Ohnishi N. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33798-33804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and we detected no D1 degradation products in the lower molecular mass regions (data not shown). Phenyl-p-benzoquinone, which is used in measuring O2 evolution, accepts electrons from QA, while DCIP accepts electrons mainly from QB, and DPC donates an electron to the secondary electron donor YZ (34Satoh K. Oh-hashi M. Kashino Y. Koike H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 597-605Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the inactivated site or sites that are responsible for the net decrease in PSII activity during strong illumination and the slower recovery of photodamaged PSII in ΔpsbT are redox components located between YZ and QA. We also estimated the number of manganese atoms bound to the thylakoid membranes isolated from cells before and after photoinhibition. The mean initial number ± S.D. per PSII (based on two pheophytin molecules) was 4.7 ± 0.3 for wild type and 4.5 ± 0.2 for ΔpsbT. Those numbers decreased by 20% under strong illumination in both strains and recovered to nearly their original level at 60 min under low light (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the strong light released only a small portion of manganese from the manganese-cluster. In addition, it does not appear that the absence of PsbT affected the release of manganese or the recovery rate, although it is not easy to confirm this small difference definitively. We cannot exclude the possibility that strong illumination caused functional damage to the manganese cluster as it did to PSII electron transfer activities because the loss of an manganese atom may result from the release of one or two manganese atoms from the 4-atom manganese-cluster. Integration of Newly Synthesized Proteins into PSII Core Complexes—To study the effects of the absence of PsbT on the repair of photodamaged PSII proteins, we analyzed the integration of newly synthesized PSII proteins into PSII complexes. After pulse labeling whole cellular proteins, we separated the chlorophyll protein complexes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fig. 2A shows the polypeptide profiles of the fractions separated from wild type, which were basically the same as those obtained from ΔpsbT (data not shown). A-1 contains mainly LHCII complexes, A-2 PSII complexes, and A-3 PSI complexes (35Sugimoto I. Takahashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45004-45010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using Western analysis with anti-D1 antibody, we confirmed that the PSII complex was exclusive to A-2 in the wild type (Fig. 2B) and mutant (Fig. 2C) strains. Under those conditions, A-2 was deficient in the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ and was slightly contaminated by a small amount of PSI protein. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that the PSII core complex in A-2 was 430 kDa in both wild type and ΔpsbT, while the well defined monomer and dimer forms of the O2-evolving PSII core complex in Thermosynechococcus vulcanus are 480 and 640 kDa (36Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Thus the Chlamydomonas PSII core complex in A-2 is a monomer. Fig. 2, B and C, show the autoradiograms of pulse-labeled proteins in wild type and ΔpsbT cells. Because the pulse labeling was performed on logarithmic phase cells that were actively synthesizing their photosynthetic apparatus, many thylakoid proteins were also labeled, including major PSII proteins such as D1, D2, CP43, and CP47. The labeling intensity, however, was much stronger for D1 than for the other PSII proteins, which was consistent with the previous finding that D1 turns over rapidly in light (1Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar, 2Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Soc. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In both strains, D1 labeled during the recovery process was detected exclusively in A-2 but not in the upper region of gradients, where unassembled proteins should be detected. Therefore, the newly synthesized D1, as well as the other major PSII proteins, were integrated efficiently into the PSII complex within 30 min, even in the absence of PsbT. These observations strongly suggest that the slower repair of photodamaged PSII in ΔpsbT is due not to a lowered protein integration efficiency during recovery but to a slower reactivation of the redox component(s) of PSII, as described above. Effects of Strong Light on pheoD1—To identify the redox component(s) responsible for the slower recovery of PSII in ΔpsbT cells, we estimated the amount and photochemical activity of pheophytin. The crystal structure of the PSII core complex contains two pheophytin molecules, pheoD1 on D1 and pheoD2 on D2-and pheoD1 functions as the intermediate electron acceptor (37Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). We extracted pheophytin molecules from cells before and after photoinhibition"
https://openalex.org/W2152671947,"c-Myc is a transcription modulator proto-oncogene. When overexpressed, it becomes an important contributor to the multi-hit process of malignant transformation. In two earlier papers in this journal (see refs. 19 , 20) we reported that retro-inverso peptidomimetic molecules inspired by the Helix-1 of c-Myc motif could be sequence-specific antiproliferative agents active in the low micromolar range. We also found that our peptides were not opening the four-alpha-helix Myc:Max bundle. Their antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines needs the presence of side chains projecting outside of the bundle in the corresponding native H1 motif. This observation suggested interference with an external partner. In this study we investigated the INI1:Myc interaction. INI1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex (component of the enhanceosome surrounding Myc:Max heterodimer). The INI1:Myc interaction was confirmed via pull down, ELISA, and fluorescence anisotropy assays. According to the length of INI1 fragments used, we calculated Kds ranging between 1.3x10(-6) and 4.8x10(-7) M. The three different techniques applied showed that the INI1:Myc interaction was also the target of our retro-inverso peptidomimetic molecules, which seem to bind specifically at INI1. A Myc binding, 21aa INI1 fragment (minimum interacting sequence), could inspire the synthesis of a new class of more selective c-Myc inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2005808540,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a key regulator in wound healing that orchestrates tissue remodeling. In the present study the spatial and temporal distribution of MMP-2 gene transcription, protein synthesis, and enzymatic activity were analyzed following polymeric mesh (polyglactin, polypropylene) implantation in transgenic reporter mice harboring MMP-2 regulatory sequences -1686/+423 or -1241/+423. Polymers induced MMP-2 promoter activity in macrophages within the foreign body granuloma via sequences -1686/+423 with concomitantly up-regulated protein synthesis and enzymatic activity. Macrophages distant from mesh filaments exhibited low MMP-2 expression levels. Fibroblasts surrounding mesh material displayed strong MMP-2 gene transcription independent of the included promoter sequences, whereas fibroblasts without close contact to mesh material had low MMP-2 synthesis rates due to silencing activity of sequences -1686/-1241. In vitro studies support a cellular crosstalk concept, as macrophages trans-repressed MMP-2 gene transcription in fibroblasts. The zonal and cell-specific regulation of MMP-2 gene transcription illuminates an intimate cellular crosstalk in foreign body reaction that may provide a new approach for mesh modification."

https://openalex.org/W2011199364,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) all signal through the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase RET. The signalling complex consists of GFLs, GPI-anchored ligand binding GDNF family receptor alphas (GFRαs) and RET. Signalling via RET is required for the development of the nervous system and the kidney, as well as for spermatogenesis. However, constitutive activation of RET is implicated as a cause in several diseases. Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). Recently, it has been suggested that mutations in the persephin binding GFRα4 receptor may have a potentially modifying role in MEN 2. Several naturally occurring, different splice variants of the mammalian GFRα4 have been reported. A 7 bp insertion–mutation in the human GFRα4 gene causes a shift of reading frame and thereby changes the balance between the transcripts encoding GPI-anchored and soluble GFRα4 receptors. We report here that the mammalian soluble GFRα4 can activate RET independently of its preferential ligand, persephin. Our data show that soluble GFRα4 can associate with, and induce, phosphorylation of RET. In addition, our data show that this isoform of GFRα4 can induce downstream signalling, as well as neuronal survival and differentiation, in the absence of persephin. These results suggest that, in line with the previous report, GFRα4 may be a candidate gene for, or modifier of, the MEN 2 diseases."
