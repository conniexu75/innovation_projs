https://openalex.org/W2811310577,"Expanding the role of rivers The surfaces of rivers and streams are interfaces for a host of chemical exchanges with the atmosphere and biosphere. For instance, carbon dioxide outgassing from rivers is estimated to be equivalent to one-fifth of combined emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production. Allen and Pavelsky used satellite imagery to estimate the surface area of rivers and streams (see the Perspective by Palmer and Ruhi). The stunning map that they generated results in an upward revision, by about one-third, to the total surface area of rivers and streams on Earth. Science , this issue p. 585 ; see also p. 546"

Thus, a discovery of unconventional symmetry can provide a new opportunity to reach a novel quantum state. Recently, Dirac and Weyl electrons have been observed in crystals with discrete translational symmetry. Here we experimentally demonstrate Dirac electrons in a two-dimensional quasicrystal without translational symmetry. A dodecagonal quasicrystal was realized by epitaxial growth of twisted bilayer graphene rotated exactly 30 degree. The graphene quasicrystal was grown up to a millimeter scale on SiC(0001) surface while maintaining the single rotation angle over an entire sample and was successfully isolated from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cone replicated with the 12-fold rotational symmetry were observed in angle resolved photoemission spectra, showing its unique electronic structures with anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a new way to explore physical properties of relativistic fermions with controllable quasicrystalline orders."

Mukhopadhyay et al. developed a class of thallium selenides with glass-like thermal conductivity. These materials may be promising for applications, but they also require the combination of glass-like and crystal-like thermal transport to explain their thermal properties. This two-channel model can be used to identify potential ultralow-thermal-conductivity compounds. Science , this issue p. 1455"
https://openalex.org/W2811347531,"The first step in Hedgehog signaling The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is important in embryogenesis; overactivation is associated with cancer. Central to the pathway is the membrane receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1), which indirectly inhibits a G protein–coupled receptor called Smoothened. This inhibition is relieved when Ptch1 binds the secreted protein Hh. Gong et al. report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of human Ptch1 alone and in complex with its Hh ligand at 3.9 and 3.6 Å, respectively. Both structures include two steroid-shaped densities, and mutational analysis indicates that the interaction between Ptch1 and Hh is steroid-dependent. Science , this issue p. eaas8935"

On the basis of high-quality data from Italians aged 105 and older, Barbi et al. show that mortality is constant at extreme ages but at levels that decline somewhat across cohorts.

However, fast melting leaves simulation as the only option for probing the process. Mo et al. performed ultrafast electron diffraction experiments on laser-pulsed gold films. This allowed detailed mapping of the melting process, which proceeds through two distinct regimes while the bonding behavior changes in unexpected ways. The results require adding new physical processes to high-energy melting models. Science , this issue p. 1451"
https://openalex.org/W2811026760,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) conduct nucleocytoplasmic transport through an FG domain-controlled barrier. We now explore how surface-features of a mobile species determine its NPC passage rate. Negative charges and lysines impede passage. Hydrophobic residues, certain polar residues (Cys, His), and, surprisingly, charged arginines have striking translocation-promoting effects. Favorable cation-π interactions between arginines and FG-phenylalanines may explain this apparent paradox. Application of these principles to redesign the surface of GFP resulted in variants that show a wide span of transit rates, ranging from 35-fold slower than wild-type to ∼500 times faster, with the latter outpacing even naturally occurring nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). The structure of a fast and particularly FG-specific GFPNTR variant illustrates how NTRs can expose multiple regions for binding hydrophobic FG motifs while evading non-specific aggregation. Finally, we document that even for NTR-mediated transport, the surface-properties of the ""passively carried"" cargo can strikingly affect the translocation rate."

A calcium-selective channel called the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) mediates calcium entry into mitochondria. Yoo et al. report the high-resolution structure of MCU from Neurospora crassa. The channel is formed by four MCU protomers with differing symmetry between the soluble and membrane domains. The structure, together with mutagenesis, suggests that two acidic rings inside the channel provide the selectivity for calcium. Science , this issue p. 506"
https://openalex.org/W2794833512,"Macrophages protect the body from damage and disease by targeting antibody-opsonized cells for phagocytosis. Though antibodies can be raised against antigens with diverse structures, shapes, and sizes, it is unclear why some are more effective at triggering immune responses than others. Here, we define an antigen height threshold that regulates phagocytosis of both engineered and cancer-specific antigens by macrophages. Using a reconstituted model of antibody-opsonized target cells, we find that phagocytosis is dramatically impaired for antigens that position antibodies >10 nm from the target surface. Decreasing antigen height drives segregation of antibody-bound Fc receptors from the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 in an integrin-independent manner, triggering Fc receptor phosphorylation and promoting phagocytosis. Our work shows that close contact between macrophage and target is a requirement for efficient phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies should target short antigens in order to trigger Fc receptor activation through size-dependent physical segregation."

Despite extensive studies of innate sequences in relation to central pattern generators, how learned action sequences are controlled and whether they are organized as a chain or a hierarchy remain largely unknown. By training mice to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we demonstrate that striatal direct and indirect pathways preferentially encode different behavioral levels of sequence structure. State-dependent closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of the striatal direct pathway can selectively insert a single action element into the sequence without disrupting the overall sequence length. Optogenetic manipulation of the striatal indirect pathway completely removes the ongoing subsequence while leaving the following subsequence to be executed with the appropriate timing and length. These results suggest that learned action sequences are not organized in a serial but rather a hierarchical structure that is distinctly controlled by basal ganglia pathways.

Action sequences form the basic functional units of behavior and contribute to the numerous acquired motor repertoires observed in animals and humans (Brainard and Doupe, 2002Brainard M.S. Doupe A.J.

Spatial features of angular drawing movements in Parkinson’s disease patients.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 1998; 100: 177-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early theories suggested that action sequences are organized as response chains, activated in series by reflex-like processes based on sensory feedback or efference copies (Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C.S. The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. Yale University Press, 1906Google Scholar). In contrast, other theories propose that action sequences might be organized hierarchically with multiple layers of control at the individual element, intermediate subsequence, and overall sequence levels (Gallistel, 1980Gallistel C.R. The Organization of Action: A New Synthesis. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1980Google Scholar, Jin and Costa, 2015Jin X. Costa R.M. Shaping action sequences in basal ganglia circuits.Curr. Opin.

John Wiley Press, 1951Google Scholar). Compared to a serial chain, a hierarchical organization is more error tolerant at the cost of requiring multiple controllers at different hierarchies (Gallistel, 1980Gallistel C.R. The Organization of Action: A New Synthesis. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1980Google Scholar, Jin and Costa, 2015Jin X. Costa R.M. Shaping action sequences in basal ganglia circuits.Curr. Opin.

John Wiley Press, 1951Google Scholar). Still, exactly how a learned action sequence is organized remains inconclusive, and the neural substrates supporting this sequence structure are largely unknown (Graybiel, 1998Graybiel A.M. The basal ganglia and chunking of action repertoires.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1998; 70: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, Hikosaka et al., 1999Hikosaka O. Nakahara H. Rand M.K.

Shaping action sequences in basal ganglia circuits.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 33: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm by training mice to perform spatiotemporally heterogeneous action sequences. It was found that sequence learning takes place in a non-back-propagation manner that critically depends on striatal NMDA receptors. By employing in vivo neuronal recording with cell-type-specific optogenetic tagging, we found that although both striatal pathways are involved in element-level action control, the direct pathway preferentially signals sequence-level initiation/termination, while the indirect pathway encodes the switch between subsequences. Consistently, selective diphtheria toxin (DT)-mediated ablation of neurons in the striatal direct or indirect pathway impairs sequence initiation and subsequence transitions, respectively. Using state-dependent closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of striatal direct or indirect pathways, we can selectively insert or remove actions within a learned sequence without necessarily disrupting the overall sequence structure or the execution of the remaining sequence. These results show that learned action sequences are organized in a hierarchical structure that is dually supported by basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways in distinct ways and have important implications for a wide range of neurological diseases, from Parkinson’s disease to speech disorders (Brainard and Doupe, 2002Brainard M.S.

We developed a new self-paced operant task to investigate the learning and organization of heterogeneous action sequences in mice. In a customized operant chamber with two levers placed opposite a food magazine, mice were trained to press the left and right levers in the specific spatiotemporal combination “left-left-right-right” (LLRR) (denoted as “penguin dance” sequence; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7WNgpXPeTc; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny_hop_(dance)) to earn a food pellet as reward (Figure 1A, Video S1, and STAR Methods). Extra presses besides this combination did not exclude the reward as long as the sequence contained the consecutive LLRR pattern. The task follows a completely self-paced design, with no experimentally provided cues signaling sequence correctness or reward availability (STAR Methods). At the behavioral level, this penguin dance sequence could be organized as either a serial chain, “L → L → R → R,” or in a hierarchical structure where L or R action elements are organized into two subsequences—LL and RR—which are then concatenated into the target sequence LLRR (Figure 1B) (Gallistel, 1980Gallistel C.R.

John Wiley Press, 1951Google Scholar). With training, mice gradually chunked their lever pressing into robust spatiotemporal sequences with a significant increase in performance speed and decreases in sequence variability (Figures 1C–1E and S1) (Jin and Costa, 2010Jin X.

The animals’ performance efficiency, measured as the percentage of rewarded lever presses (LLRR) out of total presses, significantly increased with training (Figure 1F), indicating a progressive learning of the specific penguin dance sequence with time.Figure S1Detailed Quantification of the Sequence Microstructure across Training in Two Different Versions of the LLRR Sequence Task, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Task design of the LLRR self-paced version.(B) The mean lever press rate within a session increased with training (main effect of training F4,84 = 15.76, p < 0.0001).(C) Sequence duration decreased with training (main effect of training F4,84 = 6.808, p < 0.0001).(D) The averaged number of L-R switches per sequence increased across training (main effect of training F4,84 = 37.01, p < 0.0001) and remained around one after day 7.(E) The averaged inter-press intervals within the sequence decreased with training (Left: main effect of training F4,84 = 13.82, p < 0.0001; Switch: main effect of training F4,84 = 10.65, p < 0.0001; Right: main effect of training F4,84 = 3.497, p = 0.0108).(F) Sequences with an overall total sequence length of 4 or 5 presses (22% and 19%, respectively) were the most frequent on day 28 of training.(G) Sequences were most likely to contain 1 or 2 left presses (28% and 31%, respectively) and 2 right presses (52%) on day 28 of training.(H) The frequency distribution of all sequences performed on day 1 and day 28 of training (main effect of days F1,21 = 5.396, p = 0.0303).

Performance of Learned LLRR Sequence in a Wild-Type Mouse, Related to Figure 1The video shows a top-down bird view of the operant chamber with the left and right levers located at one side and the magazine located at another. The mouse performed a heterogeneous action sequence containing the ‘left-left-right-right’ pattern and received rewards after three weeks of LLRR sequence training. Analysis of the sequence substructure indicated that the RR subsequence was acquired first, followed by the slow acquisition of the LL subsequence (Figure 1G). Further analysis of the sequence microstructure across learning revealed that at the element level, animals first identified the final and then the penultimate sequence elements as R presses (Figure 1H). The identification of the first element of the sequence as L took place afterward, followed lastly by correctly identifying the second sequence element as L (Figure 1H). These data indicate that animals tended to chunk actions into subsequences (RR and LL) before crystalizing these subsequences into the complete target sequence (LLRR). Noticeably, the order of element-level action learning is inconsistent with the classic back-propagation rule in reinforcement learning theory (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, 1998Google Scholar), which predicts action sequence learning takes place in the reverse order of execution. Furthermore, we observed that the behavioral pattern “L – RR” is acquired before “– LRR” (“–” denotes either L or R press in the sequence; Figure S1I). The same order of action learning is also observed when mice acquire a lever-retraction version of the LLRR task (Figures S1J–S1N and STAR Methods). Together, these learning data are incompatible with the simple back-propagation rule in reinforcement learning theory and underscore the significance of the start and stop elements of a sequence (Jin and Costa, 2010Jin X.

Instead, striatal NR1-KO mice developed a consistent right-lever bias. While the frequency of executing the right press as the final and penultimate elements of the sequence increased across training, the frequency of executing the left press in the first and second positions decreased rather than increased (Figure 1H). Thus, unlike their littermate controls, striatal NR1-KO mice were not able to chunk action elements into the correct subsequences and crystalize them into the target sequence (Figures 1F and 1G). This selective impairment of sequence learning in striatal NR1-KO mice was not due to differences in reinforcement history or lack of practicing the target sequence, because the same chunking deficits were evident compared to a separate control cohort trained with the amount of reinforcers matched to striatal NR1-KO mice (Figures S2E and S2F). Together, these data suggest that mice learn to chunk actions into heterogeneous sequences in a non-back-propagation manner, and NMDA receptors in the striatum are critical for this modular process of sequence learning. Impairments in action sequences could result from deficits in sequence initiation and termination (i.e., sequence level), failure to switch from one subsequence to another (i.e., subsequence level), or incorrect execution of a specific action within the sequence (i.e., element level). Since the striatal direct and indirect pathways have been shown to play distinct yet complementary roles in controlling actions (Jin et al., 2014Jin X. Tecuapetla F. Costa R.M.

Among the task-related neurons (84% of all positively identified neurons, n = 50 dSPNs and n = 44 iSPNs), over half of dSPNs showed sequence-level start/stop-related activity, which was less frequently observed in iSPNs (Figures 2I–2K). At the element level, over one-quarter of dSPNs showed phasic activation related to each individual press within the sequence, while more iSPNs were inhibited instead (Figures 2L–2N). Notably, some SPNs were selectively active during the transition from the left to the right subsequences (Figure 2O). This “switch-related” activity appeared after the last press in the left subsequence, terminated before the initiation of the first press in the right subsequence, and spanned most of this transition period (Figure 2P). In particular, 31% of iSPNs, compared to only 6% of dSPNs, demonstrated switch-related activity (Figure 2Q).Figure S3In Vivo Recording and Identification of dSPNs versus iSPNs during Sequence Performance by ChR2-Aided Photo Tagging and Comparison of the Performance of dSPN- and iSPN-Ablation Mice to Naive Control Mice, Related to Figures 2, 3, and 4Show full caption(A) Example of recording array placement in the dorsal striatum of a D1-Ai32 animal.

But this interpretation presumes knowledge of who will die and when. Here we analyze how spending is distributed by predicted mortality, based on a machine-learning model of annual mortality risk built using Medicare claims. Death is highly unpredictable. Less than 5% of spending is accounted for by individuals with predicted mortality above 50%. The simple fact that we spend more on the sick-both on those who recover and those who die-accounts for 30 to 50% of the concentration of spending on the dead. Our results suggest that spending on the ex post dead does not necessarily mean that we spend on the ex ante ""hopeless."""

Although the psychometric properties of the scale have been well established through many studies worldwide, so far there is no study examining the validity and reliability of BDI-II in Republic Dominican. The purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to examine the latent structure of BDI-II by testing several competing models proposed in the literature; and (b) to provide evidence of validity and reliability of the BDI-II in Republic Dominican. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a bifactor model with a general depression factor and three specific factors consisting of cognitive, affective and somatic showed the best fit to the data. Internal reliability was moderate to high for all subscales and for the total scale. Scores on BDI-II discriminated between clinical and general population, supporting for external validity.

https://openalex.org/W2809859618,"In speech, the highly flexible modulation of vocal pitch creates intonation patterns that speakers use to convey linguistic meaning. This human ability is unique among primates. Here, we used high-density cortical recordings directly from the human brain to determine the encoding of vocal pitch during natural speech. We found neural populations in bilateral dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (dLMC) that selectively encoded produced pitch but not non-laryngeal articulatory movements. This neural population controlled short pitch accents to express prosodic emphasis on a word in a sentence. Other larynx cortical representations controlling voicing and longer pitch phrase contours were found at separate sites. dLMC sites also encoded vocal pitch during a non-speech singing task. Finally, direct focal stimulation of dLMC evoked laryngeal movements and involuntary vocalization, confirming its causal role in feedforward control. Together, these results reveal the neural basis for the voluntary control of vocal pitch in human speech. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2810440707,"Functional redundancy shared by paralog genes may afford protection against genetic perturbations, but it can also result in genetic vulnerabilities due to mutual interdependency1–5. Here, we surveyed genome-scale short hairpin RNA and CRISPR screening data on hundreds of cancer cell lines and identified MAGOH and MAGOHB, core members of the splicing-dependent exon junction complex, as top-ranked paralog dependencies6–8. MAGOHB is the top gene dependency in cells with hemizygous MAGOH deletion, a pervasive genetic event that frequently occurs due to chromosome 1p loss. Inhibition of MAGOHB in a MAGOH-deleted context compromises viability by globally perturbing alternative splicing and RNA surveillance. Dependency on IPO13, an importin-β receptor that mediates nuclear import of the MAGOH/B-Y14 heterodimer9, is highly correlated with dependency on both MAGOH and MAGOHB. Both MAGOHB and IPO13 represent dependencies in murine xenografts with hemizygous MAGOH deletion. Our results identify MAGOH and MAGOHB as reciprocal paralog dependencies across cancer types and suggest a rationale for targeting the MAGOHB-IPO13 axis in cancers with chromosome 1p deletion. Analysis of paralog gene pairs using data from loss-of-function genetic screens in cancer cells identifies MAGOH and MAGOHB as reciprocal paralog dependencies across cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2810389807,"Perceptual and judgment creep Do we think that a problem persists even when it has become less frequent? Levari et al. show experimentally that when the “signal” a person is searching for becomes rare, the person naturally responds by broadening his or her definition of the signal—and therefore continues to find it even when it is not there. From low-level perception of color to higher-level judgments of ethics, there is a robust tendency for perceptual and judgmental standards to “creep” when they ought not to. For example, when blue dots become rare, participants start calling purple dots blue, and when threatening faces become rare, participants start calling neutral faces threatening. This phenomenon has broad implications that may help explain why people whose job is to find and eliminate problems in the world often cannot tell when their work is done.

https://openalex.org/W2810826647,"Breast cancer has a multifactorial etiology. One of the supposed and novel mechanisms is an alteration of circadian gene expression. Circadian genes play a crucial role in many physiological processes. These processes, such as genomic stability, DNA repair mechanism and apoptosis, are frequently disrupted in breast tumors. To assess the significance of circadian gene expression in breast cancer, we carried out an analysis of CLOCK, BMAL1, NPAS2, PER1, PER2, PER3 and CRY1, CRY2, TIMELESS, CSNK1E expression by the use of the quantitative Real-Time PCR technique in tumor tissue and non-tumor adjacent normal tissue sampled from 107 women with a newly diagnosed disease. The obtained data were compared to the clinical and histopathological features. PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2 were found to be significantly down-expressed, while CLOCK, TIMELESS were over-expressed in the studied tumor samples compared to the non-tumor samples. Only gene expression of CRY1 was significantly down-regulated with progression according to the TNM classification. We found significantly decreased expression of CRY2, PER1, PER2 genes in the ER/PR negative breast tumors compared to the ER/PR positive tumors. Additionally, expression of CRY2, NPAS2 genes had a decreased level in the poorly differentiated tumors in comparison with the well and moderately differentiated ones. Our results indicate that circadian gene expression is altered in breast cancer tissue, which confirms previous observations from various animal and in vitro studies."

We aimed to extend knowledge regarding the clinical relevance of CMD-associated variation of circulating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell abundance and to explore underlying cellular mechanisms. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 439 participants of the Metagenomics in Cardiometabolic Diseases (MetaCardis) study, stratified into 6 groups: healthy control subjects and patients with metabolic syndrome (MS), obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD) without, or with congestive heart failure (CAD-CHF). Blood MAIT cell frequency was significantly decreased in all CMD groups, including early (MS) and later (CAD and CAD-CHF) stages of disease progression. Reduced MAIT cell abundance was associated with increased glycosylated hemoglobin, inflammation markers, and deterioration of cardiac function. Glucose dose dependently promoted MAIT cell apoptosis in vitro, independently of anti-CD3 and cytokine-mediated activation. This outcome suggests the prominence of metabolic over an antigenic or cytokine-rich environment to promote MAIT cell reduction in patients with CMD. In summary, all stages of CMDs are characterized by reduced circulating MAIT cells. Chronically elevated blood glucose levels could contribute to this decline. These data extend the pathologic relevance of MAIT cell loss and suggest that MAIT cell abundance may serve as an indicator of cardiometabolic health.—Touch, S., Assmann, K.

https://openalex.org/W2810615935,"Consolidated evidence indicates that astroglial cells are critical in the homeostatic regulation of cellular volume by means of ion channels and aquaporin-4. Volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is the chloride channel that is activated upon cell swelling and critically contributes to cell volume regulation in astrocytes. The molecular identity of VRAC has been recently defined, revealing that it belongs to the leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 (LRRC8) protein family. However, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that LRRC8A underpins VRAC currents in astrocyte. Nonetheless, direct evidence of the role of LRRC8A in astrocytic regulatory volume decrease remains to be proved. Here, we aim to bridge this gap in knowledge by combining RNA interference specific for LRRC8A with patch-clamp analyses and a water-permeability assay. We demonstrated that LRRC8A molecular expression is essential for swelling-activated chloride current via VRAC in primary-cultured cortical astrocytes. The knockdown of LRRC8A with a specific short interference RNA abolished the recovery of the cell volume after swelling induced by hypotonic challenge. In addition, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, confocal imaging, and immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that LRRC8A is expressed in the plasma membrane of primary cortical astrocytes and in situ in astrocytes at the perivascular interface with endothelial cells. Collectively, our results suggest that LRRC8A is an essential subunit of VRAC and a key factor for astroglial volume homeostasis.-Formaggio, F., Saracino, E., Mola, M. G., Rao, S.

https://openalex.org/W2809716692,"Music psychology defines groove as humans’ pleasureable urge to move their body in synchrony with music. Past research has found that rhythmic syncopation, event density, beat salience, and rhythmic variability are positively associated with groove. This exploratory study investigates the groove effect of 248 reconstructed drum patterns from different popular music styles (pop, rock, funk, heavy metal, rock’n’roll, hip hop, soul, R&B). It aims at identifying factors that might be relevant for groove and worth investigating in a controlled setting in the future. Drum patterns of eight bars duration, chosen from 248 popular music tracks, have been transcribed and audio reconstructions have been created on the basis of sound samples. During an online listening experiment, 665 participants rated the reconstructions a total of 8,329 times using a groove questionnaire. Results show that, among 15 tested variables, syncopation (R2 = 0.010) and event density (R2 = 0.011) were positively associated with the groove ratings. These effects were stronger in participants who were music professionals, compared to amateur musicians or mere listeners. A categorisation of the stimuli according to structural aspects was also associated with groove (R2 = 0.018). Beat salience, residual microtiming and rhythmic variability showed no effect on the groove ratings. Participants’ familiarity with a drum pattern had a positive influence on the groove ratings (η2 = 0.051). The largest isolated effect was measured for participants’ style bias (R2 = 0.123): groove ratings tended to be high if participants had the impression that the drum pattern belonged to a style they liked. Combined, the effects of style bias and familiarity (R2 = 0.152) exceeded the other effects as predictors for groove by a wide margin. We conclude that listeners’ taste, musical biographies and expertise have a strong effect on their groove experience. This motivates groove research not to focus on the music alone, but to take the listeners into account as well."
https://openalex.org/W2810338268,"Colon cancer recurrence after therapy, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), remains a challenge in the clinical setting. Chemotherapy reduces tumor burden by inducing cell death; however, the resulting dead tumor cells, or debris, may paradoxically stimulate angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumor growth. Here, we demonstrate that 5-FU-generated colon carcinoma debris stimulates the growth of a subthreshold inoculum of living tumor cells in subcutaneous and orthotopic models. Debris triggered the release of osteopontin (OPN) by tumor cells and host macrophages. Both coinjection of debris and systemic treatment with 5-FU increased plasma OPN levels in tumor-bearing mice. RNA expression levels of secreted phosphoprotein 1, the gene that encodes OPN, correlate with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer and are elevated in chemotherapy-treated patients who experience tumor recurrence vs. no recurrence. Pharmacologic and genetic ablation of OPN inhibited debris-stimulated tumor growth. Systemic treatment with a combination of a neutralizing OPN antibody and 5-FU dramatically inhibited tumor growth. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of tumor progression mediated by OPN released in response to chemotherapy-generated tumor cell debris. Neutralization of debris-stimulated OPN represents a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome the inherent limitation of cytotoxic therapies as a result of the generation of cell debris.—Chang, J., Bhasin,S.

https://openalex.org/W2810377515,"VEGF signaling via VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) is a major regulator of endothelial cell (EC) functions, including angiogenesis. Although most studies of angiogenesis focus on soluble VEGF signaling, mechanical signaling also plays a critical role. Here, we examined the consequence of disruption of mechanical signaling on soluble signaling pathways. Specifically, we observed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of a mechanosensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), significantly reduced perinuclear (Golgi) VEGFR2 in human ECs with a concomitant increase in phosphorylation at Y1175 and membrane translocation. TRPV4 knockout (KO) ECs exhibited increased plasma membrane localization of phospho-VEGFR2 compared with normal ECs. The knockdown also increased phospho-VEGFR2 in whole cell lysates and membrane fractions compared with control siRNA-treated cells. siRNA knockdown of TRPV4 enhanced nuclear localization of mechanosensitive transcription factors, yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif via rho kinase, which were shown to increase VEGFR2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, TRPV4 deletion/knockdown enhanced VEGF-mediated migration in vitro and increased expression of VEGFR2 in vivo in the vasculature of TRPV4 KO tumors compared with wild-type tumors. Our results thus show that TRPV4 channels regulate VEGFR2 trafficking and activation to identify novel cross-talk between mechanical (TRPV4) and soluble (VEGF) signaling that controls EC migration and angiogenesis.—Kanugula, A.

https://openalex.org/W2810201367,"Although convincing in genetic models, the relevance of β-cell insulin resistance in diet-induced type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains unclear. Exemplified by diabetes-prone, male, C57B1/6J mice being fed different combinations of Western-style diet, we show that β-cell insulin resistance occurs early during T2DM progression and is due to a combination of lipotoxicity and increased β-cell workload. Within 8 wk of being fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet, mice became obese, developed impaired insulin and glucose tolerances, and displayed noncompensatory insulin release, due, at least in part, to reduced expression of syntaxin-1A. Through reporter islets transplanted to the anterior chamber of the eye, we demonstrated a concomitant loss of functional β-cell mass. When mice were changed from diabetogenic diet to normal chow diet, the diabetes phenotype was reversed, suggesting a remarkable plasticity of functional β-cell mass in the early phase of T2DM development. Our data reinforce the relevance of diet composition as an environmental factor determining different routes of diabetes progression in a given genetic background. Employing the in vivo reporter islet-monitoring approach will allow researchers to define key times in the dynamics of reversible loss of functional β-cell mass and, thus, to investigate the underlying, molecular mechanisms involved in the progression toward T2DM manifestation.-Paschen, M., Moede, T., Valladolid-Acebes, I., Leibiger, B., Moruzzi, N., Jacob, S., García-Prieto, C.

https://openalex.org/W2810291710,"Members of the genus Circovirus are host-specific viruses, which are totally dependent on cell machinery for their replication. Consequently, certain mimicry of the host genome features is expected to maximize cellular replicative system exploitation and minimize the recognition by the innate immune system. In the present study, the analysis of several genome composition and codon bias parameters of circoviruses infecting avian and mammalian species demonstrated the presence of quite distinctive patterns between the two groups. Remarkably, a higher deviation from the expected values based only on mutational patterns was observed for mammalian circoviruses both at dinucleotide and codon levels. Accordingly, a stronger selective pressure was estimated to shape the genome of mammalian circoviruses, particularly in the Cap encoding gene, compared to avian circoviruses. These differences could be attributed to different physiological and immunological features of the two host classes and suggest a trade-off between a tendency to optimize the capsid protein translation while minimizing the recognition of the genome and the transcript molecules. Interestingly, the recently identified Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV-3) had an intermediate pattern in terms of genome composition and codon bias. Particularly, its Rep gene appeared closely related to other mammalian circoviruses (especially bat circoviruses) while the Cap gene more closely resembled avian circoviruses. These evidences, coupled with the high selective forces apparently modelling the PCV-3 Cap gene composition, suggest the potential recombinant origin, followed or preceded by a host jump, of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W2810974466,"Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is often used to assess an individual’s cardiorespiratory fitness. However, measuring this variable requires an athlete to perform a maximal exercise test which may be impractical, since this test requires trained staff and specialized equipment, and may be hard to incorporate regularly into training programs. The aim of this study is to develop a new model for predicting VO2max by exploiting its relationship to heart rate and accelerometer features extracted during submaximal running. To do so, we analyzed data collected from 31 recreational runners (15 men and 16 women) aged 19-26 years who performed a maximal incremental test on a treadmill. During this test, the subjects’ heart rate and acceleration at three locations (the upper back, the lower back and the tibia) were continuously measured. We extracted a wide variety of features from the measurements of the warm-up and the first three stages of the test and employed a data-driven approach to select the most relevant ones. Furthermore, we evaluated the utility of combining different types of features. Empirically, we found that combining heart rate and accelerometer features resulted in the best model with a mean absolute error of 2.33 ml ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ min−1 and a mean absolute percentage error of 4.92%. The model includes four features: gender, body mass, the inverse of the average heart rate and the inverse of the variance of the total tibia acceleration during the warm-up stage of the treadmill test. Our model provides a practical tool for recreational runners in the same age range to estimate their VO2max from submaximal running on a treadmill. It requires two body-worn sensors: a heart rate monitor and an accelerometer positioned on the tibia."

Objectives This is a feasibility, multicentre, randomized, controlled, open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design). Setting Children with autism and severe-injurious behaviours (SIB) were enrolled from 13 specialized clinics. Interventions Dry-sheet TBW (DRY group) vs. wet-sheet TBW (WET group). Primary outcome measures 3-month change in the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist irritability score (ABC-irritability) within per-protocol (PP) sample. Results From January 2008 to January 2015, we recruited 48 children (age range: 5.9 to 9.9 years, 78.1% male). Seven patients (4 in the DRY group, 3 in the WET group) were dropped from the study early and were excluded from PP analysis. At endpoint, ABC-irritability significantly improved in both groups (means (standard deviation) = -11.15 (8.05) in the DRY group and -10.57 (9.29) in the WET group), as did the other ABC scores and the Children Autism Rating scale score. However, there was no significant difference between groups. All but 5 patients were rated as much or very much improved. A repeated-measures analysis confirmed the significant improvement in ABC-irritability scores according to time (p < .0001), with no significant difference between the two groups (group effect: p = .55; interaction time x group: p = .27). Pooling both groups together, the mean 3-month change from baseline in ABC-irritability score was -10.90 (effect size = 1.59, p < .0001). Conclusions We found that feasibility was overall satisfactory with a slow recruitment rate and a rather good attrition rate. TBW was a safe complementary therapy in this population. There was no difference between wet and dry TBW at 3 months, and ABC-irritability significantly decreased with both wet and dry sheet TBW. To assess whether TBW may constitute an alternative to medication or behavioural intervention for treating SIB in ASD patients, a larger randomized comparative trial (e.g. TBW vs. antipsychotics) is warranted.

This study aimed to determine the physical activity of medical students, who played Pokémon GO, and the change in their use of Pokémon GO and physical activity over time. An observational study was conducted. Physical activity was measured by using self-administered questionnaires at baseline (phase 0), 1 month (phase 1) and 3 months (phase 2) post-Pokémon GO download. The changes in physical activity (phase 0 to 1 and phase 1 to 2) were analysed using Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test. The trend (3-point analysis) of physical activity from phase 0, 1 to 2 were analysed using Friedman’s test. The relationship between physical activity and time spent gaming was analysed by using Spearman’s rank correlation. Twenty-six participants (mean age 22.04±1.70 years) participated in the study. There was no statistically significant change in physical activity during the three-month period (p = 0.45). Only 11 participants (42.3%) were still playing Pokémon GO 3 months after download. The key reasons for playing game were ‘have fun’ and ‘pass time/boredom’. The most common commuting mode to play the game was walking; some drove a car or motorcycle while playing the game. There was no correlation between physical activity and time spent gaming. This study highlights how the lack of sustainability of the game and the motivation behind using Pokémon GO as a game rather than a physical activity app may have undermined the potential of using the game to improve physical activity. Further studies need to explore the reasons for the lack of sustainability and how to combine fun with behavioural change."
https://openalex.org/W2810758419,"Despite the flourishing research on the relationships between affect and language, the characteristics of pain-related words, a specific type of negative words, have never been systematically investigated from a psycholinguistic and emotional perspective, despite their psychological relevance. This study offers psycholinguistic, affective, and pain-related norms for words expressing physical and social pain. This may provide a useful tool for the selection of stimulus materials in future studies on negative emotions and/or pain. We explored the relationships between psycholinguistic, affective, and pain-related properties of 512 Italian words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) conveying physical and social pain by asking 1020 Italian participants to provide ratings of Familiarity, Age of Acquisition, Imageability, Concreteness, Context Availability, Valence, Arousal, Pain-Relatedness, Intensity, and Unpleasantness. We also collected data concerning Length, Written Frequency (Subtlex-IT), N-Size, Orthographic Levenshtein Distance 20, Neighbor Mean Frequency, and Neighbor Maximum Frequency of each word. Interestingly, the words expressing social pain were rated as more negative, arousing, pain-related, and conveying more intense and unpleasant experiences than the words conveying physical pain."
https://openalex.org/W2810354392,"Multiple factors can help predict knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients from healthy individuals, including age, sex, and BMI, and possibly metabolite levels. Using plasma from individuals with primary OA undergoing total knee replacement and healthy volunteers, we measured lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) analogues by metabolomics. Populations were stratified on demographic factors and lysoPC and PC analogue signatures were determined by univariate receiver-operator curve (AUC) analysis. Using signatures, multivariate classification modeling was performed using various algorithms to select the most consistent method as measured by AUC differences between resampled training and test sets. Lists of metabolites indicative of OA [AUC > 0.5] were identified for each stratum. The signature from males age > 50 years old encompassed the majority of identified metabolites, suggesting lysoPCs and PCs are dominant indicators of OA in older males. Principal component regression with logistic regression was the most consistent multivariate classification algorithm tested. Using this algorithm, classification of older males had fair power to classify OA patients from healthy individuals. Thus, individual levels of lysoPC and PC analogues may be indicative of individuals with OA in older populations, particularly males. Our metabolite signature modeling method is likely to increase classification power in validation cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2811230783,"Purpose Acute lung injury is a life threatening condition often requiring mechanical ventilation. Lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW, calculated on the basis of a patient’s sex and height), is part of current recommended ventilation strategy. Hence, an exact height is necessary to provide optimal mechanical ventilation. However, it is a common practice to visually estimate the body height of mechanically ventilated patients and use these estimates as a reference size for ventilator settings. We aimed to determine if the common practice of estimating visual height to define tidal volume reduces the possibility of receiving lung-protective ventilation. Methods In this prospective observational study, 28 mechanically ventilated patients had their heights visually estimated by 20 nurses and 20 physicians. All medical professionals calculated the PBW and a corresponding tidal volume with 6 ml/kg/PBW on the basis of their visual estimation. The patients’ true heights were measured and the true PBW with a corresponding tidal volume was calculated. Finally, estimates and measurements were compared. Results 1033 estimations were undertaken by 153 medical professionals. The majority of the estimates were imprecise and resulting data comprised taller body heights, higher PBW and higher tidal volumes (all p≤0.01). When estimates of patients´ heights are used as a reference for tidal-volume definition, patients are exposed to mean tidal volumes of 6.5 ± 0.4 ml/kg/PBW. 526 estimation-based tidal volumes (51.1%) did not provide lung-protective ventilation. Shorter subjects (<175cm) were a specific risk group with an increased risk of not receiving lung protective ventilation (OR 6.6; 95%CI 1.2–35.4; p = 0.02), while taller subjects had a smaller risk of being exposed to inadequately high tidal volumes (OR 0.15; 95%CI 0.02–0.8; p = 0.02). Furthermore, we found an increased risk of overestimating if the assessor was a female (OR 1.74; 95%CI 1.14–2.65; p = 0.01). Conclusion The common practice of visually estimating body height and using these estimates for ventilator settings is imprecise and potentially harmful because it reduces the chance of receiving lung-protective ventilation. Avoiding this practice increases the patient safety. Instead, height should be measured as a standard procedure."
https://openalex.org/W643188450,"Zinc finger BED domain containing protein 6 (Zbed6) has evolved from a domesticated DNA transposon and encodes a transcription factor unique to placental mammals. The aim of the present study was to investigate further the role of ZBED6 in insulin-producing cells, using mouse MIN6 cells, and to evaluate the effects of Zbed6 knockdown on basal β-cell functions, such as morphology, transcriptional regulation, insulin content, and release. Zbed6-silenced cells and controls were characterized with a range of methods, including RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, insulin content and release, subplasma membrane Ca2+ measurements, cAMP determination, and morphologic studies. More than 700 genes showed differential expression in response to Zbed6 knockdown, which was paralleled by increased capacity to generate cAMP, as well as by augmented subplasmalemmal calcium concentration and insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. We identified >4000 putative ZBED6-binding sites in the MIN6 genome, with an enrichment of ZBED6 sites at upregulated genes, such as the β-cell transcription factors v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A and Nk6 homeobox 1. We also observed altered morphology/growth patterns, as indicated by increased cell clustering, and in the appearance of axon-like Neurofilament, medium polypeptide and tubulin β 3, class III-positive protrusions. We conclude that ZBED6 acts as a transcriptional regulator in MIN6 cells and that its activity suppresses insulin production, cell aggregation, and neuronal-like differentiation.—Wang, X., Jiang, L., Wallerman, O., Younis, S., Yu, Q., Klaesson, A., Tengholm, A., Welsh, N., Andersson, L.

https://openalex.org/W2810020885,"Radiation therapy is a useful and standard tumor treatment strategy. Despite recent advances in delivery of ionizing radiation, survival rates for some cancer patients are still low because of recurrence and radioresistance. This is why many novel approaches have been explored to improve radiotherapy outcome. Some strategies are focused on enhancement of accuracy in ionizing radiation delivery and on the generation of greater radiation beams, for example with a higher dose rate. In the present study we proposed an in vitro research of the biological effects of very high dose rate beam on SK-Mel28 and A375, two radioresistant human melanoma cell lines. The beam was delivered by a pulsed plasma device, a “Mather type” Plasma Focus for medical applications. We hypothesized that this pulsed X-rays generator is significantly more effective to impair melanoma cells survival compared to conventional X-ray tube. Very high dose rate treatments were able to reduce clonogenic efficiency of SK-Mel28 and A375 more than the X-ray tube and to induce a greater, less easy-to-repair DNA double-strand breaks. Very little is known about biological consequences of such dose rate. Our characterization is preliminary but is the first step toward future clinical considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2810174045,"Many different physiological processes affect the growth of malignant lesions and their response to therapy. Each of these processes is spatially and genetically heterogeneous; dynamically evolving in time; controlled by many other physiological processes, and intrinsically random and unpredictable. The objective of this paper is to show that all of these properties of cancer physiology can be treated in a unified, mathematically rigorous way via the theory of random processes. We treat each physiological process as a random function of position and time within a tumor, defining the joint statistics of such functions via the infinite-dimensional characteristic functional. The theory is illustrated by analyzing several models of drug delivery and response of a tumor to therapy. To apply the methodology to precision cancer therapy, we use maximum-likelihood estimation with Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) data to estimate unknown patient-specific physiological parameters, ultimately demonstrating how to predict the probability of tumor control for an individual patient undergoing a proposed therapeutic regimen."

Health equity has been defined as the absence of systematic disparities and unwarranted differences between groups defined by differences in social advantages. A study was performed to investigate whether this was applicable to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) care in a setting with universal, tax-funded healthcare.This retrospective registry-study was based on patient-level data from individuals diagnosed with T1D during 2010-2011 (n = 16,367) in any of seven Swedish county councils (covering ~65% of the Swedish population). Health equity in T1D care was analysed through multivariate regression analyses on absolute HbA1c level at one-year follow-up, one-year change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and one-year change in cardiovascular risk score, using selected sociodemographic dimensions as case-mix factors.Higher educational level was consistently associated with lower levels of HbA1c, and so was being married. Never married was associated with worse eGFR development, and lower educational level was associated with higher cardiovascular risk. Women had higher HbA1c levels than men, and glucose control was significantly worse in patients below the age of 25.Patients' sociodemographic profile was strongly associated with absolute levels of risk factor control in T1D, but also with an increased annual deterioration in eGFR. Whether these systematic differences stem from patient-related problems or healthcare organisational shortcomings is a matter for further research. The results, though, highlight the need for intensified diabetes management education and secondary prevention directed towards T1D patients, taking sociodemographic characteristics into account."
https://openalex.org/W2811324943,"The current study suggests that the identification of predictive signatures of fluorouracil (5-FU) response for stage II and III colorectal cancer (CRC) could be confounded by chemotherapy-irrelevant low relapse risk. Using the samples of patients with stage II and III CRC who were treated with curative surgery only, we identified a signature with which to predict chemotherapy-irrelevant relapse risk for patients after curative surgery. By applying this signature to the samples of patients with stage II and III CRC who were treated with 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) after surgery, we predicted the relapse risk if treated with surgery only. From high-risk samples, we further identified another signature with which to predict therapeutic benefit from 5-FU–based ACT. On the basis of the relative expression orderings of gene pairs, a postsurgery relapse risk signature that consisted of 44 gene pairs was developed and verified in 3 independent data sets. A 5-FU therapeutic benefit signature that consisted of 4 gene pairs was then developed to predict the response of 5-FU–based ACT for those patients with high relapse risk after curative surgery. The signature was verified in 4 independent datasets. For patients with stage II and III CRC, the coupled signatures can first identify patients with high relapse risk after curative surgery, then predict therapeutic benefit from 5-FU–based ACT.—Song, K., Guo, Y., Wang, X., Cai, H., Zheng, W., Li, N., Song, X., Ao, L., Guo, Z., Zhao, W.

https://openalex.org/W2811341167,"SOX7 (SRY-related high mobility group box 7), a high mobility group protein, is reported to be down-regulated in several cancer types, which indicates an important role in tumorigenesis; however, its biologic role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) pathogenesis remains unknown. We studied the alterations and functions of SOX7 in RCC. We detected its broad expression in multiple human normal tissues, including kidney, but frequent down-regulation in RCC cell lines and primary tumors. Promoter CpG methylation seems to directly mediate SOX7 silencing in RCC cells, which could be reversed by demethylation treatment. SOX7 methylation was detected in primary RCC tumors, but rarely in normal kidney tissues. Restoration of SOX7 in silenced 786-O and A498 RCC cell lines inhibited their cell growth by inducing G0/G1 arrest, whereas SOX7 knockdown promoted RCC cell proliferation. We also found that SOX7 silencing resulted in the activation of WNT signaling and the induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that SOX7 is frequently inactivated by promoter CpG methylation in RCC and functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating WNT signaling.—Wang, L., Fan, Y., Zhang, L., Li, L., Kuang, G., Luo, C., Li, C., Xiang, T., Tao, Q., Zhang, Q., Ying, J.

https://openalex.org/W2810575673,"Introduction Perception of verticality is highly related to balance control in human. Head-on-body tilt <60° results in the E-effect, meaning that a tilt of the perceived vertical is observed contralateral to the head tilt in the frontal plane. Furthermore, somatosensory loss also impacts the accuracy of verticality perception. However, when several input sources are absent or biased, less options for sensory weighting and balance control occur. Therefore, this study aims to identify the E-effect and assess the effect of somatosensory loss on the extent of the E-effect. Methods All patients with a first stroke admitted to a Belgian rehabilitation hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients aged above 80 with other neurological and orthopaedic impairments as well as brainstem, cerebellar or multiple lesions were excluded. In addition, patients with visuospatial neglect and pusher behaviour were also excluded as this can affect verticality perception. The Rivermead Assessment of Somatosensory Performance (RASP), the Subjective Visual (SVV) and Subjective Postural (SPV) Vertical Test were administered. Results In total, 37 patients were included in the analysis of which 24 patients completed both SVV and SPV assessment. Results show that the E-effect occurred in our sample of stroke survivors for both SVV and SPV. In addition, the presence of somatosensory loss will increase the E-effect in both SVV as SPV assessment. A significant difference in verticality perception was noted for both SVV and SPV between the group with no (SVV: 5.13°(6.92); SPV: 0.30°(1.85)) and highly severe (SVV: 10.54°(13.19); SPV: 5.96°(9.27)) sensory loss. Conclusions The E-effect occurs in stroke subjects and increases when patients experience somatosensory loss. This suggests that the lack of available afferent information impede estimation of verticality. Therefore, stroke survivors have fewer alternative input sources as a result of impairments, leading to fewer options about sensory reweighting strategies and balance recovery after perturbations."

In this paper, we report the findings of an online survey on TV listening conducted among HI individuals with and without hearing aids (HAs) in the United States in 2015. The research investigated if and in what form TV listening experiences of unaided and aided HI individuals might differ with regard to their viewing habits, difficulties they experience, and compensation strategies they employ. 515 HI people of ages 50+ years participated, 260 of whom owned HAs. HA users reported that they watched TV or video on average for 6 hours 10 min per day, 57 minutes longer than the duration reported by non-HA owners. Furthermore, HA users indicated fewer difficulties when watching TV than non-HA owners, suggesting that HA usage alleviated difficulties with TV listening. Nevertheless, the most frequent problems were still encountered by more than 39% of the HA users. Difficulties increased with greater self-reported unaided hearing disability, and female participants indicated more problems than male participants. Finally, those with carpeted floors reported fewer difficulties than those without carpets. The most frequently used compensation strategies were changing TV or HA volumes and using closed captioning. Only few HA users used audio streaming accessories. Given the exploratory nature of this study, further research is needed to inform interventions and improve the TV listening experiences of HI viewers."

Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were prospectively enrolled. Cases were defined as cLBP patients with lumbar active discopathy detected on MRI and controls as cLBP patients without active discopathy. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the spine, femoral neck and total femur was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bone remodeling markers were assessed in fasting serum samples. Overall, 37 cLBP patients (13 cases and 24 controls) fulfilled inclusion criteria and were included.The median age was 42.0 years (Q1-Q3: 36.0-51.0) and mean (SD) LBP duration 72.3 (57.4) months. We found that BMD and levels of bone remodeling markers in cLBP patients did not differ with and without active discopathy.Our results do not support the association between active discopathy and systemic bone fragility."
https://openalex.org/W2810315834,"Few if any natural resource systems are completely understood and fully observed. Instead, there almost always is uncertainty about the way a system works and its status at any given time, which can limit effective management. A natural approach to uncertainty is to allocate time and effort to the collection of additional data, on the reasonable assumption that more information will facilitate better understanding and lead to better management. But the collection of more data, either through observation or investigation, requires time and effort that often can be put to other conservation activities. An important question is whether the use of limited resources to improve understanding is justified by the resulting potential for improved management. In this paper we address directly a change in value from new information collected through investigation. We frame the value of information in terms of learning through the management process itself, as well as learning through investigations that are external to the management process but add to our base of understanding. We provide a conceptual framework and metrics for this issue, and illustrate them with examples involving Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens)."
https://openalex.org/W2811157603,"The rice white tip nematode, Aphelenchoides besseyi, is widely distributed in rice planting areas worldwide and causes serious economic losses. Cathepsin genes have been demonstrated to have importance in studying the reproduction, development, pathogenicity, and control methods of plant nematodes. In this paper, a novel cathepsin B gene, Ab-cb-1, was found and cloned. The Ab-cb-1 gene was 1347 bp in length and encodes 369 amino acids. The Ab-CB-1 protein contains characteristic occluding loops but no signal peptide. A homology analysis showed that Ab-CB-1 had the highest identity value (64%) to the known amino acid sequence of cathepsin B-like cysteine protease 6 from Toxocara canis. When Ab-cb-1 was expressed in a prokaryotic system, the protein massed approximately 45 kDa and could decompose carrot callus. Ab-cb-1 mRNA was localized in the nematode intestine. The relative expression level of Ab-cb-1 in the A. besseyi Ab-S24 population, which had high reproductivity, was approximately 6.9 times that in the Ab-N10 population, which had low reproductivity, and the difference was significant (p<0.05). The Ab-cb-1 expression level was highest in females; the expression levels in males, juveniles and eggs were 30%, 12.2% and 5% of that in females, respectively, and the differences were significant among all four stages (p<0.05). Nematodes of the Ab-S24 population were treated with Ab-cb-1 dsRNA for 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h, and their reproduction decreased with increasing time. These results demonstrated that Ab-CB-1 was a digestive enzyme with hydrolytic protease properties and that Ab-cb-1 played an important role in the reproduction of A. besseyi."

Anti-METH monoclonal antibodies can reduce METH brain concentrations; however, this therapy has limitations, including the need for repeated dosing throughout the course of addiction recovery. An adeno-associated viral (AAV)-delivered DNA sequence for a single-chain variable fragment could offer long-term, continuous expression of anti-METH antibody fragments. For these studies, we injected mice via tail vein with 1 x 1012 vector genomes of two AAV8 scFv constructs and measured long-term expression of the antibody fragments. Mice expressed each scFv for at least 212 days, achieving micromolar scFv concentrations in serum. In separate experiments 21 days and 50 days after injecting mice with AAV-scFvs mice were challenged with METH in vivo. The circulating scFvs were capable of decreasing brain METH concentrations by up to 60% and sequestering METH in serum for 2 to 3 hrs.

https://openalex.org/W2810683641,"Hyperinsulinemia is a major risk factor for equine laminitis, a debilitating and painful foot condition. Sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) inhibitors have been used to reduce the insulin and glucose responses to oral carbohydrates in other species. However, their effect in horses has not been investigated. It would be useful to be able to attenuate the large post-prandial insulin response that typically occurs when a carbohydrate-rich meal is fed to insulin-dysregulated horses. Here we have determined the efficacy of two T1R2/3 inhibitors, lactisole and Gymnema sylvestre, for reducing glucose uptake by the equine small intestine in vitro; and post-prandial insulin secretion in ponies in vivo, following a carbohydrate-based meal. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure 2-deoxyglucose uptake by explants of small intestine, in the presence and absence of the T1R2/3 inhibitors. Lactisole and G sylvestre reduced 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the intestinal explants by 63% (P = 0.032) and 73% (P = 0.047), respectively, compared to control samples. The study in vivo investigated the effect of the inhibitors on the blood glucose and serum insulin responses to a meal containing D-glucose. Three doses of each inhibitor were tested using a Latin square design, and each dose was compared to a meal with no inhibitor added. Lactisole had no effect on glucose and insulin concentrations, whereas G sylvestre was partially effective at reducing post-prandial blood glucose (by ~10%) and serum insulin concentrations (~25%) in seven ponies, with a most effective dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight. These data provide preliminary support that T1R2/3 inhibitors may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the management of equine insulin dysregulation and the prevention of laminitis. However, further optimisation of the dose and delivery method for these compounds is required, as well as a direct investigation of their activity on the equine sweet taste receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2809983819,"Vulnerability assessments combine quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of species or natural communities to current and future threats. When combined with the economic, ecological or evolutionary value of the species, vulnerability assessments quantify the relative risk to regional species and natural communities and can enable informed prioritization of conservation efforts. Vulnerability assessments are common practice in conservation biology, including the potential impacts of future climate scenarios. However, geographic variation in scenarios and vulnerabilities is rarely quantified. This gap is particularly limiting for informing ecosystem management given that conservation practices typically vary by sociopolitical boundaries rather than by ecological boundaries. To support prioritization of conservation actions across a range of spatial scales, we conducted the Gulf Coast Vulnerability Assessment (GCVA) for four natural communities and eleven focal species around the Gulf of Mexico based on current and future threats from climate change and land-use practices out to 2060. We used the Standardized Index of Vulnerability and Value (SIVVA) tool to assess both natural community and species vulnerabilities. We observed greater variation across ecologically delineated subregions within the Gulf Coast of the U.S. than across climate scenarios. This novel finding suggests that future vulnerability assessments incorporate regional variation and that conservation prioritization may vary across ecological subregions. Across subregions and climate scenarios the most prominent threats were legacy effects, primarily from habitat loss and degradation, that compromised the adaptive capacity of species and natural communities. The second most important threats were future threats from sea-level rise. Our results suggest that the substantial threats species and natural communities face from climate change and sea-level rise would be within their adaptive capacity were it not for historic habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2810705963,"The activity of Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligases (CRL) is regulated by NEDD8 modification. DCN-like proteins promote Cullin neddylation as scaffold-like E3s. One DCNL, DCNL5, is highly expressed in immune tissue. Here, we provide evidence that DCNL5 may be involved in innate immunity, as it is a direct substrate of the kinase IKKα during immune signalling. We find that upon activation of Toll-like receptors, DCNL5 gets rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on a specific N-terminal serine residue (S41). This phosphorylation event is specifically mediated by IKKα and not IKKβ. Our data for the first time provides evidence that DCNL proteins are post-translationally modified in an inducible manner. Our findings also provide the first example of a DCNL member as a kinase substrate in a signalling pathway, indicating that the activity of at least some DCNLs may be regulated."

A challenging case study was selected: Veronica subsection Pentasepalae, a taxonomically intricate group. The “divide and conquer” approach was implemented—that is, a difficult primary dataset was split into more manageable subsets. Three techniques were explored: two data-mining tools (artificial neural networks and decision trees) and one unsupervised discriminant analysis. However, only the decision trees and discriminant analysis were finally used to select diagnostic traits. A previously established classification hypothesis based on other data sources was used as a starting point. A guided discriminant analysis (i.e. involving manual character selection) was used to produce a grouping scheme fitting this hypothesis so that it could be taken as a reference. Sequential unsupervised multivariate analysis enabled the recognition of all species and infraspecific taxa; however, a suboptimal classification rate was achieved. Decision trees resulted in better classification rates than unsupervised multivariate analysis, but three complete taxa were misidentified (not present in terminal nodes). The variable selection led to a different grouping scheme in the case of decision trees. The resulting groups displayed low misclassification rates when analyzed using artificial neural networks. The decision trees as well as the discriminant analysis are recommended in the search of diagnostic characters. Due to the high sensitivity that artificial neural networks have to the combination of input/output layers, they are proposed as evaluation tools for morphometric studies. The “divide and conquer” principle is a promising strategy, providing success in the present case study."

Dear younger self,

Today is your first day of graduate school. You fought hard to get here, and you deserve to be proud. You didn't let professors who gave you Cs make you feel like an impostor. You didn't let a so-called mentor kissing you in a dark parking lot throw you off course. You gave up a paid work-study job so that you could do your science for academic credit, all to earn the golden ticket to graduate school.

Now you need to buy a computer and repair the car that broke down on the drive across the country. Rent is due in a few days. You haven't gotten your first paycheck yet, so you will use the money you earned over the summer as a researcher. You won't have savings again for 13 years.

Once your paychecks start, you will be flabbergasted that someone is willing to pay you all of $23,000 per year to do science. You'll feel like an adult—until you realize that, living in the San Francisco Bay Area, you will barely be able to cover rent and food. Also, you won't get checks in the summer, so budget accordingly. The McDonald's Dollar Menu will help. When you're out of cash but need $2 for bridge tolls to get to work, you'll bum money off a friend. Don't worry—he knows you won't be able to pay him back.

When you finish your Ph.D., your student loans will be due. You will join a prestigious lab as a postdoc, but you will only have a salary if you get a grant. When your funding dries up, you will move out of your apartment and onto friends' sofas. This may sound like a fun adventure now, but it will be demoralizing when you are 32 years old, homeless, collecting unemployment, and hoping for a job at Walgreens (they don't call you back), all while doing your science for free. You will earn a few thousand dollars adjunct teaching, which will put food on the table for a few months.

You will then be one of the lucky ones to hit pay dirt on the tenure-track job market. Everyone will tell you that it's time to celebrate, but it won't be that easy. With no savings or paycheck, you will cash out your retirement to pay the movers. Relocation expenses will be reimbursed later. At least the job will be worth it. You will teach the most amazing students and work with them in your very own lab to do the science that you are passionate about. Your student loans won't be paid off until you are well into your 40s, but you will eventually have some savings.

The road to a secure academic position will feel like a hazing ritual. You will be in the tenuous early stages of your career for 20 years. But yours is not a sob story. It is one of luck and privilege. You don't have a family to support, but you do have one that will lend a helping hand when you have the courage to ask for it. Not everyone is so lucky—not all the students whom you will eventually mentor, not your future colleagues in permanent adjunct limbo, and not those university employees on the picket line.

Thus, I ask you this: First, don't cross that picket line today. Instead, stand up for the people who make your university run. You will soon depend on them. Second, join the graduate student union. You are wrong to think that making graduate school more financially accessible is someone else's problem. Paying your union dues is one small way to help. Finally, when the time comes, do everything in your power to lessen the financial hurdles that students and early career scholars face. Doing science is difficult enough. Your students don't need to be hazed just because you were.
