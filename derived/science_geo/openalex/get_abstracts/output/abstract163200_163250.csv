Mitochondrial Ca2+ (Ca2+mit) uptake was stimulated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-evoked Ca2+ release, capacitative Ca2+ entry, and Ca2+ leaking from the endoplasmic reticulum. For each Ca2+ source, the relationship between cytosolic Ca2+(Ca2+cyt) concentration and Ca2+mit was complex. With Ca2+cyt < 300 nm, a slow and persistent Ca2+mit uptake was observed. If Ca2+cyt increased above ∼400 nm, Ca2+mit uptake accelerated sharply. For equivalent Ca2+cyt increases, the rate of Ca2+mit rise was greater with InsP3-evoked Ca2+ signals than any other source. Spatial variation of the Ca2+mitresponse was observed within individual cells. Both the fraction of responsive mitochondria and the amplitude of the Ca2+mit response were graded in direct proportion to stimulus concentration. Trains of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations did not maintain elevated Ca2+mit levels. Only low frequency Ca2+ transients (<1/15 min) evoked repetitive Ca2+mit signals. Our data indicate that there is a lag between Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit increases but that mitochondria will accumulate calcium when it is elevated over basal levels regardless of its source. Furthermore, in addition to the characteristics of Ca2+ signals, Ca2+ uniporter desensitization and proximity of mitochondria to InsP3 receptors modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ responses.

Changes in the concentration of free calcium ions in the cytosol (Ca2+cyt)1of cells have been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological events (1Berridge M.J.

However, the toxic nature of Ca2+ requires any Ca2+cyt load to be cleared quickly. Ca2+cyt signals are either sequestered into endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) stores via Ca2+-ATPases or removed from the cell across the plasma membrane by Ca2+-ATPases or Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. Supporting these mechanisms, mitochondria act to rapidly clear cytosolic Ca2+ loads before slowly releasing the Ca2+back to the cytosol where it is dealt with by the aforementioned pumps and exchangers. Clearance of Ca2+cyt loads by mitochondria has been demonstrated in a wide range of cell types (3Babcock D.F. Herrington J. Goodwin P.C. Park Y.B. Hille B. J.

In addition to acting as a clearance mechanism, Ca2+mit accumulation is a physiological response of cells to Ca2+cyt-increasing stimuli, for example stimulating citric acid cycle enzymes and the respiratory chain (e.g. Refs 8Hajnoczky G.

Mitochondria sequester Ca2+ via a low-affinity, high-speed uniporter powered by the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψmit). The in vitro affinity of the uniporter for Ca2+ (K 0.5 = 10–20 µm) (11Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Dilisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) is low in comparison with the global Ca2+ concentrations observed in vivo during physiological responses (100 nm-2 µm). However, mitochondria have been shown to sense and modulate both capacitative Ca2+ entry (14Hoth M. Fanger C.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 633-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive stores (15Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J.

To explain the paradox that mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ during physiological responses despite the insensitivity of the Ca2+ uniporter, it has been suggested that mitochondria are located in close proximity to sites of either Ca2+ release or Ca2+ entry (21Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T.

Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). In these locations, mitochondria can respond to Ca2+ changes within the microdomains around the mouth of Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ concentrations attainable in such microdomains are thought to be much higher than the observed global Ca2+changes and closer to the in vitro affinity of the uniporter. If mitochondria have privileged access to Ca2+ signals emanating from open channels, it would follow that portions of the cellular mitochondrial population would preferentially access certain types of Ca2+ signal, i.e. entry or release (e.g. Ref. 24Lawrie A.M. Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Simpson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10753-10759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), depending upon their relative cellular locations. Intuitively, perinuclear mitochondria would sense ER-derived Ca2+ signals in preference to peripheral mitochondria, and, conversely, peripheral mitochondria would more likely respond to Ca2+ entry signals. The amplitude of Ca2+cyt signals is also a likely determinant of Ca2+mit accumulation. Previous studies have indicated a steep dependence of Ca2+mit uptake on Ca2+cyt, with a Hill coefficient ≥ 2 (for example see Ref. 25Colegrove S.L. Albrecht M.A. Friel D.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 371-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 26Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 27Gunter T.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1994; 26: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The steep dependence of Ca2+mit on Ca2+cytcould indicate the co-operative binding and activation of the uniporter by Ca2+. However, it has also been suggested that mitochondria express an “activatory” Ca2+binding site that allosterically stimulates the uniporter (reviewed in Refs. 26Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 27Gunter T.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1994; 26: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Aside from the source and amplitude of the Ca2+ signal, the kinetics of Ca2+cyt transients have been shown to affect mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (8Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 28Leisey J.R. Grotyohann L.W. Scott D.A. Scaduto R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1203-H1208PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Shen S.S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, Ca2+ oscillations were more efficient at activating Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases than sustained Ca2+ elevations of similar magnitude (8Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). However, isolated rat heart mitochondria were found to sequester Ca2+ independently of the frequency of Ca2+oscillations but in proportion to the mean extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration (28Leisey J.R. Grotyohann L.W. Scott D.A. Scaduto R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1203-H1208PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effect of different spatial and temporal Ca2+ signals on mitochondrial Ca2+uptake in HeLa cells. Our data indicate that Ca2+mit accumulation does not necessarily depend on microdomains of elevated Ca2+cyt, because sources that do not generate such local Ca2+gradients can be sequestered by mitochondria. The temporal response of mitochondria depends on the kinetics and amplitude of Ca2+cyt increases. High amplitude Ca2+cyt signals caused mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to desensitize, whereas low amplitude Ca2+cyt signals gave a slower but persistent Ca2+mit accumulation. Mitochondria did not display an all-or-none response to Ca2+cytincreases, but instead distinct mitochondria could be recruited on an individual basis, and the amplitude of their responses was graded in proportion to Ca2+cyt. HeLa cell culture was performed as described previously (30Bootman M.D. Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Bennett D.L. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24783-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All subsequent experimental steps were carried out at room temperature (20–22 °C). The culture medium was replaced with an extracellular medium (EM) containing (in mm): NaCl, 121; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 0.8; CaCl2, 1.8; NaHCO3, 6; d-glucose, 5.5; Hepes, 25, pH 7.3. Histamine, thapsigargin, and bromo-A23187 were obtained from Sigma. All fluorescent dyes were purchased from Molecular Probes. Transfection of HeLa cells was achieved with Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) using the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The pDsRed1-Mito construct was purchased from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The InsP3 ester was kindly provided by Dr. Jan Thuring and Dr. Andrew Holmes (Dept. of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, UK). Cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubation in 1 µm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) for 45 min followed by a 30 min de-esterification period. Coverslips were mounted on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope and imaged as described previously (30Bootman M.D. Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Bennett D.L. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24783-24791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this involved excitation with 340 and 380 nm from twin monochromators, the excitation wavelengths being switched with a rotating mirror chopper (Glen Creston Instruments, Stanmore, UK). Emitted light was filtered at 510 nm and collected with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Photonic Science, Tunbridge Wells, UK). The video signal was digitized, stored, and subsequently processed off-line with an Imagine image-processing unit (Synoptics Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Ratio images were acquired at 2-s intervals. Imaging of the Ca2+-sensitive dye Rhod-2 was used to provide simultaneous measurements of both Ca2+mit and Ca2+cyt(see also Ref. 15Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 1 µm Rhod-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) for 30 min followed by a 30 min de-esterification period. Imaging was performed with an Oz confocal microscope (Noran Instruments, Milton Keynes, UK). Rhod-2 was excited at 514 nm, and the Ca2+-sensitive emission >525 nm was selected using a long-pass filter. Median optical sections of cells loaded with Rhod-2 were acquired for 2 min at a rate of 1 image/0.533 s (i.e. 1.875 Hz). Ca2+mit was determined from either individual mitochondrion or small groups of adjacent mitochondria. Although most of the Rhod-2 was localized within mitochondria, a small proportion remained within the cytosolic and nuclear compartment. By monitoring the nuclear Rhod-2 signal, the dynamics of the Ca2+cyt signal were determined indirectly. Although the nucleoplasmic Rhod-2 fluorescence was low, averaging the signal over the entire nuclear optical section provided a sensitive measure of changes in Ca2+cyt. Furthermore, because of the narrow confocal section (<1 µm), the nuclear Rhod-2 fluorescence was independent of Ca2+mit changes. The Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) was calculated from background-corrected fluorescence values (F) using the equation, (Ca2+] = K d × [(F −F min)/(F max −F)). Fluorescence at minimum [Ca2+] (F min) was determined by incubating the cells with 10 µm bromo-A23187 in EM supplemented with 4 mm EGTA. Maximum fluorescence [Ca2+] (F max) was obtained by treating the cells with 10 µm bromo-A23187 in normal EM (i.e.containing 1.8 mm CaCl2). The dissociation constant (K d) of Rhod-2 was determined by equilibrating bromo-A23187-treated cells (10 µm) with standard Mg2+-containing Ca2+ solutions (Molecular Probes). The K d values of Rhod-2 were 1.0 µm for the nucleus and 1.3 µm for mitochondria (see “Results”). To aid the equilibration of intracellular and extracellular [Ca2+], the Rhod-2-loaded cells were pretreated with bromo-A23187 in EM containing no added CaCl2, plus 4 mm EGTA, 2 µm antimycin, and 2 µm oligomycin and with the d-glucose substituted with 5.5 mm2-deoxy-glucose. This pretreatment was necessary because HeLa cells are able to maintain resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels in the presence of A23187 despite large transmembrane Ca2+gradients. Cells were loaded with Fluo-3/AM (2 µm for 40 min plus 30 min de-esterification) before being loaded with Rhod-2 as described above. Simultaneous dual channel confocal images were acquired at 7.5 Hz with a Noran Oz confocal microscope (514 nm excitation; green emission, 510–560 band pass; red emission, 590 long pass filter). Cross-talk from the green into the red channel was calculated from Fluo-3 only loaded cells and corrected for in subsequent experiments. Cells were loaded with 2 µm cSNARF1 diacetate for 40 min, followed by 30 min de-esterification period. The base form of cSNARF1 was imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 LSCM (488 nm excitation; 680 emission with 30 nm band pass). Cytosolic pH was adjusted by the addition of pH 7.4 extracellular medium containing varying millimolar ratios of weak acid (butyric acid) and base (trimethylamine) to alter cytosolic pH from resting to 6.8 (butyric acid /trimethylamine of 16:1) to 7.4 (1:1) to 8.0 (1:16) (31Chow S. Hedley D. Tannock I. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The change in cSNARF1 fluorescence during manipulation of cytosolic pH is expressed asF/F 0 where F 0is the fluorescence resting before treatment with the acid/base mixture. The effect of these changes in pH on Rhod-2 was determined by imaging cells loaded with Rhod-2 preferentially loaded in the cytosol,i.e. cells were incubated with 10 µm Rhod-2 in the presence of (2 µm) antimycin and (2 µm) oligomycin. Cells were loaded with either 2 µm Magnesium Green/AM (40 min loading; 30 min de-esterification) or Rhod-2 preferentially in the cytosol (see above). Magnesium Green-loaded cells were imaged with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 LSCM (488 nm excitation; 515BP emission). Cytosolic Mg2+ was adjusted from near zero to 96 mm in the presence of 1.2 µm Ca2+with the addition of 1 µmA23187, 3 mm EDTA, 14 mm EGTA, and 16.3 mm CaCl2mixture followed by the addition of 1 µmA23187, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 100 mmMgCl2, and 2.0 mm CaCl2 (based on MaxChelator calculations). pDsRed1-Mito transfected cells were stained with MitoTracker Green (0.2 µm, 25 min). Dual channel emission images (525DF30 and 590LP) were acquired by simultaneous excitation with 514 and 488 nm laser lines. Please note that we did not find any detectable green emission from the DsRed1-expressing cells. In the present study, Ca2+mit and Ca2+cytwere simultaneously monitored using Rhod-2. The AM ester form of Rhod-2 is cationic, causing it to load relatively selectively into respiring mitochondria. To confirm the mitochondrial sequestration of Rhod-2, we compared the subcellular fluorescence distribution of cells loaded with Rhod-2, MitoTracker Green and pDsRed1-Mito, which encodes a fusion of red fluorescent protein, DsRed1, and the mitochondrial targeting sequence from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase. The co-localization of these reporters to mitochondria is illustrated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the loading of Rhod-2 into organelles was inhibited by agents that depolarize Δψmit (data not shown). These data indicate that the only intracellular structures in which Rhod-2 accumulated in HeLa cells were mitochondria. Because of the positive charge of Rhod-2 AM, most of the dye was sequestered into mitochondria. In addition, a small amount of Rhod-2 was localized to the cytosol and nucleus (see also ref 15Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+cyt and nuclear Ca2+ are in equilibrium in HeLa cells at the time resolution used in the present study (32Lipp P. Thomas D. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7166-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Tovey S.C. Thomas D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. J. Physiol. 1998; 509P: 200-201Google Scholar), confocal monitoring of Rhod-2 fluorescence in the nucleus allowed measurement of Ca2+cyt without contamination from Ca2+mit. Furthermore, as the cytosolic concentration of Rhod-2 was substantially less than that in the mitochondria, the determination of Ca2+mitwas not significantly affected by background changes of Ca2+cyt (see below). To allow accurate estimation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+concentrations, we calibrated the Rhod-2 fluorescence in both compartments as illustrated in Fig.2 A. Rhod-2 displayed similar affinities for Ca2+ in both the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments but showed a much smaller dynamic range (maximum fluorescence relative to minimum fluorescence) in the nucleus. The lower dynamic range of Rhod-2 in the nucleus is a disadvantage in discriminating small changes in Ca2+ concentration. However, averaging the Rhod-2 fluorescence over the large area of the nucleus observed in the confocal sections (∼100 µm2) gave signals with good signal to noise ratios (see below). Although a few mitochondria were quite motile, the majority did not move appreciably during the course of confocal recordings. Only non-motile mitochondria were analyzed in the present study. The protocol used to calibrate the Rhod-2 fluorescence would have collapsed any existing pH or Mg2+ gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. To determine whether the alkaline pH (34Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1994; 26: 471-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) of the mitochondria was affecting the Rhod-2 fluorescence or shifting theK d of the dye for calcium, the pH sensitivity of the indicator was determined. To do this, Rhod-2 was preferentially accumulated into the cytoplasm by incubating cells with 10 µm Rhod-2AM in the presence of antimycin (2 µm) and oligomycin (2 µm). This allowed us to more reliably manipulate the pH and Mg2+ concentration in the same compartment as the indicator, which would be difficult to achieve with the Rhod-2 localized to mitochondria. The cytosolic pH was adjusted from resting (∼7.4) to 6.8 to 7.4 to 8.0 using varying ratios of butyric acid and trimethylamine (31Chow S. Hedley D. Tannock I. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Changes in cytosolic pH were verified in parallel experiments using the pH-sensitive dye cSNARF1 (Fig. 2 B). Because the effects of pH on the affinity of Rhod-2 for Ca2+ would be most easily detected around theK d, the cells were treated with 1 µmA23187 in the presence of 1.2 µm external calcium during the manipulation of cytosolic pH. As shown in Fig. 2 B, changes in pH from 6.8 to 8.0 had no significant effect on Rhod-2 fluorescence. Similar observations were made in cells not treated withA23187, which would have a resting Ca2+ concentration of ∼100 nm (data not shown). In some cell types, there is also a severalfold Mg2+gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane: [Mg2+]cyt ∼ 1–5 mm; [Mg2+]mit ∼ 20–40 mm(35Flatman P.W. J. Memb. Biol. 1984; 80: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To determine whether high matrix Mg2+ was perturbing the calibration of Rhod-2, the sensitivity of Rhod-2 to Mg2+ was evaluated. Similar to the investigation of the effects of pH on Rhod-2 fluorescence described above, the indicator was loaded solely into the cytoplasm by depolarizing the mitochondria with antimycin + oligomycin. The fluorescence of Rhod-2 was then monitored after changing the cytoplasmic Mg2+ concentration from near zero to 100 mm while maintaining Ca2+cyt at 1.2 µm. See ”Materials and Methods“ for the composition of the Mg2+solutions. Although the change in cytoplasmic Mg2+concentration was detectable using Magnesium Green, Rhod-2 fluorescence was unaffected (Fig. 2 C). These results show that Rhod-2 is neither pH- nor Mg2+-sensitive over a wide range. Therefore, even though the calibration protocol may have altered the pH and Mg2+gradients within the cell, this would not have affected the subsequent conversion of Rhod-2 fluorescence into actual Ca2+concentration. To compare the sensitivity of mitochondria to cytosolic Ca2+ signals arising from distinct sources, HeLa cells were stimulated with a variety of treatments to elicit Ca2+ release from InsP3-sensitive stores, Ca2+ leak from the ER, capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) and ionophore-induced Ca2+ equilibration. For InsP3-evoked Ca2+ signals, HeLa cells were treated with 100 µm histamine in extracellular Ca2+(Ca2+cyt)-containing extracellular medium. The ER Ca2+ leak was unveiled by superfusion with the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 µm) in Ca2+o-free medium. Subsequent reapplication of Ca2+o evoked a cytosolic Ca2+ rise because of CCE. Finally, the addition of ionophore (10 µmbromo-A23187) in Ca2+o-containing medium was used to equilibrate Ca2+ throughout the cells. The typical cytosolic Ca2+ responses to these treatments are illustrated in Fig. 3 A. The least signal, in terms of amplitude, was consistently the thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+ leak. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, CCE, and ionophore-induced Ca2+ elevations were of similar amplitude. The kinetics of the cytosolic Ca2+ signals evoked by these treatments were different. Essentially, the order in which the Ca2+ signals arose was InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release > ionophore > CCE > ER Ca2+ leak (Fig. 3 B). The trace in Fig. 3 A was obtained using video imaging of Fura-2-loaded cells. Because Fura-2 is a ratiometric indicator and bleaches only slowly during excitation with a xenon arc lamp on our system, we were able to demonstrate the response to each Ca2+-increasing treatment when consecutively applied to the same cells. For subsequent experiments monitoring both mitochondrial Ca2+ (Ca2+mit) and cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca2+cyt), laser scanning confocal imaging of Rhod-2 was employed. As Rhod-2 is not a ratiometric indicator and bleaches detectably during laser excitation, the effect of each Ca2+-increasing treatment was investigated separately using naı̈ve cells. Essentially, the cells were treated/pretreated as depicted in Fig. 3 A, but the Rhod-2 signal was only recorded just prior to and during the test period. Each of the Ca2+cyt-increasing treatments illustrated in Fig. 3 also elevated Ca2+mit, although there were distinct differences in the characteristics of some of the Ca2+mit signals (Fig.4, A–D). Histamine stimulation resulted in the largest rise of Ca2+mit (TableI), with CCE and ionophore evoking significantly smaller responses (Table I). The thapsigargin-induced ER Ca2+ leak, which gave the least Ca2+cyt increase, also evoked the lowest Ca2+mit elevation (Table I).Table IMaximal amplitude (in nm) of Ca2+ signals in the cytoplasm and mitochondria in response to the various Ca2+cyt-increasing treatments listedCa2+cytCa2+mitHistamine1239 ± 2693582 ± 896ER Ca2+ leak433 ± 71946 ± 207CCE1086 ± 1861618 ± 81Br-A23187931 ± 2681928 ± 385The data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of at least 10 cells for each treatment.

The thapsigargin responses in HeLa cells were not due to activation of InsP3 receptors by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, as has been demonstrated for mouse lacrimal cells (36Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), because there was no effect of 40 mm caffeine (an InsP3 receptor antagonist) on the characteristics of thapsigargin-induced Ca2+cyt signals monitored with Fura-2. In contrast 40 mm caffeine was sufficient to completely inhibit responses to supramaximal concentrations of histamine (data not shown). The inclusion of 40 mm caffeine while monitoring Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit with Rhod-2 gave curves similar to those shown in Fig. 4 B (data not shown). The CCE response also did not involve any component of Ca2+ release, because the prior application of thapsigargin would have completely discharged the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool. For each Ca2+cyt-increasing treatment except ionophore, Ca2+cyt rose significantly earlier than Ca2+mit. This was true both for the time taken for Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit to reach half-maximal amplitude and for the absolute latency for Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit to show an increase over basal levels (Table II). The discrepancy in the kinetics of Ca2+mit and Ca2+mit increases is clearly apparent when these two parameters are plotted against each other (Fig. 4,E–H). For histamine, ER Ca2+ leak, and CCE, there was an initial increase in Ca2+cyt of a few hundred nanomolar with only a modest change in Ca2+mit. This was followed by a period when Ca2+cyt did not substantially change, although Ca2+mit rose markedly. Finally, Ca2+mit reached a plateau as Ca2+cyt started to decline (Fig. 4,E–G). As expected from its ability to shuttle Ca2+ across membranes, the response to ionophore treatment gave a linear relationship between Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit concentrations (Fig.4 H).Table IILatencies (in seconds) for Ca2+cyt and Ca2+mit signals to rise significantly over the basal level (110%) or reach half maximal amplitudeTime taken for signal to increase to 110% of resting levelTime taken for response to attain half-maximal amplitudeCa2+cytCa2+mitCa2+cytCa2+mitHistamine1.6 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.35.0 ± 1.510.0 ± 1.5ER Ca2+ leak9.0 ± 0.725.1 ± 1.520.0 ± 2.561.0 ± 4.5CCE6.7 ± 1.015.6 ± 1.517.5 ± 3.057.5 ± 6.0Br-A231871.5 ± 0.61.7 ± 0.36.5 ± 1.019.0 ± 4.0The data are given as the mean ± S.E. of at least 10 cells for each treatment.

Within endothelial cells that line the lumen of all blood vessels, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) catalyzes calcium-calmodulin-dependent NO synthesis through the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline and NO (4Forstermann U.

Dysfunction of the endothelium, often associated with a reduction in the activity or expression of eNOS or NO bioreactivity, is a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and atherosclerosis (5Rudic R.D. Sessa W.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 673-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Given the importance of eNOS to cardiovascular function, the investigation into whether mutations or polymorphisms within the eNOS gene correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease has become an active area of research. The human eNOS gene has 26 exon regions and covers 21 kilobase pairs on the long arm of chromosome 7 (6Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, there are no positive studies demonstrating that mutations in the eNOS gene are causally linked to a disease process using traditional linkage analysis (7Wang X.L. Wang J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, in patients with coronary spasm (8Nakayama M. Yasue H. Yoshimura M. Shimasaki Y. Ogawa H. Kugiyama K. Mizuno Y.

Conversely, many other studies do not show associations of the above polymorphisms with the disease (7Wang X.L. Wang J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The exon 7 polymorphism (894G→T) that specifies either a glutamate (E) or aspartate (D) residue at position 298 in the human eNOS protein has been analyzed in several patient populations with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cerebral vascular disease (12Hibi K.

Neurology. 1999; 53: 418-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This polymorphism is of particular interest because this conservative amino acid substitution within the oxygenase domain of eNOS may influence eNOS function. Within each disease category, there is evidence both for and against this polymorphism influencing eNOS and/or endothelial function. For example, two groups have differing results concerning the association of the exon 7 polymorphism and essential hypertension in the Japanese population (11Miyamoto Y. Saito Y. Kajiyama N. Yoshimura M. Shimasaki Y. Nakayama M. Kamitani S. Harada M. Ishikawa M. Kuwahara K. Ogawa E. Hamanaka I. Takahashi N. Kaneshige T. Teraoka H. Akamizu T. Azuma N. Yoshimasa Y. Yoshimasa T. Itoh H.

Hypertension. 1999; 33: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Based upon the crystal structure of the oxygenase domain of eNOS, the substitution of a glutamate residue for an aspartate at position 298 within the protein is unlikely to alter protein conformation to an appreciable extent (16Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). However, a recent report demonstrated that eNOS, as isolated from patients with an 894T allele (coding for aspartate at residue 298), was cleaved intracellularly by an unknown protease, thus providing a possible mechanism to explain an impairment in eNOS function (17Tesauro M. Thompson W.C. Rogliani P. Qi L. Chaudhary P.P. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2832-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Because most aspects of the proposed intracellular cleavage remain to be determined, we sought to: 1) elucidate the mechanism whereby the Glu298 → Asp variant of eNOS (E298D) is cleaved and 2) further characterize enzymatic differences between wild-type eNOS and cleaved E298D eNOS in cells andin vitro. Total RNA from single-donor human umbilical vein endothelial cells was isolated with TriZol reagent and subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR using an oligo(dT)17 primer. The reverse transcriptase-PCR product corresponding to human eNOS was PCR-amplified using the forward primer 5′-ccccgccaaagcttggacgcacagtaccatgggcaacttgaagagcg-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ggggctctagaggcggacctgagtcgggcagccgc-3′. The amplified product was ligated into (HindIII andXbaI) pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. The wild-type human eNOS sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The generation of E298D eNOS cDNA was performed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Complementary primers were used for mutagenesis (+ strand oligonucleotide: 5′-gcccctgctgctgcaggctccggatgatcccccagaactcttcc-3′). A 898-base pair fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into the original WT vector (FseI and NheI), and the DNA sequence was verified across the mutation site. All DNA sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis were carried out at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University School of Medicine. Unless otherwise noted, COS-7 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as described previously (18Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, an equal number of cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes, such that, typically, 24 h later the cells were 90% confluent and ready for transfection. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, transfected COS cells were treated with varying conditions to evoke cell stress. To examine the effects of hypoxia, the transfected cells were placed into an incubator and equilibrated with 1% oxygen for 48 h, as described previously (19Banasiak K.J. Haddad G.G. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To trigger cellular apoptosis, COS cells were treated with staurosporine (1 µm) for 6 h (20Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To initiate oxidative stress, transfected cells were incubated with H2O2 (5 mm) for 30 min. At the end of each incubation period, samples were prepared for electrophoresis using the NUPAGE buffer system (described below). For all experiments on lysates (except when intentionally altering pH), 48 h post-transfection COS-7 cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin). Sample preparation for SDS-PAGE was performed using either the traditional Laemmli method (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) or the commercial NUPAGE system (Novex/Invitrogen) that was designed to limit in vitro degradation of protein samples. A Laemmli-style loading buffer (6× concentrated SDS/Tris-based buffer/dye at pH 6.8 (22 °C) with β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the samples, and the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Alternatively, we followed the protocols of the NUPAGE system, where a lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (Tris/glycerol buffer, pH 8.5) was mixed with fresh dithiothreitol and added to samples. The LDS samples were then heated to 70 °C for 10 min. All cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. WT and the E298D eNOS were detected using a monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories,N30020) directed at the carboxyl terminus of human eNOS, an epitope conserved in WT and E298D eNOS. Ten plates of COS-7 cells (100-m plates) were transfected with WT or E298D eNOS cDNA. Cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer, and eNOS was isolated using 2′-5′ ADP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted by adding one volume of Laemmli-style sample buffer to the Sepharose bed and boiling for 5 min in a 100 °C block heater. Eluted proteins were subjected to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were visualized by staining the membrane with a Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain (Sigma), and the unique 100-kDa band generated from the E298D mutant was sequenced by Edman degradation (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University School of Medicine). WT and E298D cDNAs were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pCW (NdeI and XbaI). pCW-WT or pCW-E298D were transformed into BL-21 E. coli together with a vector coding for the chaperone proteins groES and groEL. Bacterial culture, induction, and eNOS purification were performed as previously described (23Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phosphate-citrate buffer solutions were mixed to pH 7.0, 5.0, and 3.0. Transfected cells were harvested using the above pH lysis solutions (buffers plus 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were rotated for 10 h at 37 °C. Lysates were adjusted to pH 7.4 using sodium hydroxide and prepared for SDS-PAGE using NUPAGE sample preparation. Chemiluminescent measurement of nitrite in media was performed as described previously (25Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Basal levels of NO release were acquired by sampling media from cells just prior to harvesting (48 h post-transfection). Hemoglobin capture assays and cytochrome c reduction assays were all performed as described previously (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Twelve hours post-transfection, confluent COS-7 cells from 100 mm cell culture plates were trypsinized and divided equally into 60-mm cell plates. Cells were grown to 70% confluency in complete medium. Medium was changed to methionine/cystine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min prior to labeling.35S-labeled methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to methionine/cystine-deficient medium, and cells were incubated with the 150 µCi/ml 35S medium (2 ml) for 1 h. Cells were rinsed quickly and incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before harvesting at various time points. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-eNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and protein A-Sepharose. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried for 3 h and then exposed to film at −80 °C for 12 h. Band intensity at 135 kDa was assayed by densitometry (26Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12333-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The allele frequency of the 894G polymorphism is greater than the 894T variant in populations studied to date (e.g.67.5% in Australians and 92.2% in Japanese (27Cai H. Wilcken D.E. Wang X.L. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 511-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). For this reason we have termed eNOS with glutamate at 298 as wild type and eNOS with aspartate at 298 as E298D eNOS. Recently it was shown that E298D eNOS may undergo enhanced intracellular cleavage (17Tesauro M. Thompson W.C. Rogliani P. Qi L. Chaudhary P.P. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2832-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of this cleavage, we transiently expressed both polymorphic versions of eNOS in COS-7 cells that do not express eNOS endogenously. As seen in Fig.1 A, a unique 100-kDa cleavage fragment (see arrow) was present in cell lysates containing the E298D eNOS, as previously reported (17Tesauro M. Thompson W.C. Rogliani P. Qi L. Chaudhary P.P. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2832-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). As the antibody used was raised against an epitope derived from the extreme carboxyl terminus of human eNOS, it was apparent that the cleavage took place within the amino-terminal domain of the protein. To determine the precise location of the cleaved bond, we isolated the 100-kDa fragment and sequenced the amino terminus by Edman degradation. The sequenced portion of the fragment corresponds precisely to residues Pro299 through Val310 of eNOS, showing that E298D eNOS was cleaved on the carboxyl side of the aspartate at position 298, as depicted in Fig.1 B. Because the cleavage site occurred at the Asp–Pro bond, we searched for proteases that may cleave at this site and found none. However, it has been recognized for many years that Asp-Pro bonds are particularly susceptible to acid hydrolysis (28Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In fact, one criticism of using the method of Laemmli when preparing samples for SDS-PAGE is that proteins are boiled in an acidic solution, a combination of conditions that can cause significant protein degradation (29Rittenhouse J. Marcus F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the Tris-based loading buffers commonly used in SDS-PAGE are near neutral pH (6.8), the solutions become significantly more acidic when heated. (For example, a 50 mm Tris buffer with pH 6.8 at 22 °C will drop to pH 5.3 at 100 °C.) Therefore, before investigating anin vivo mechanism of eNOS fragmentation, we investigated whether the cleavage phenomenon could be an artifact of our sample preparation method. As shown in Fig.2 A, when we used Laemmli-style buffers and increased the boiling time during sample preparation, we saw increased generation of the 100-kDa fragment of interest in E298D samples (arrow; compare 100-kDa fragment inlanes 3–8). All other degradation bands were found in both WT and E298D eNOS. Importantly, when we used a commercially available sample buffer containing LDS formulated to maintain a more basic pH throughout sample preparation, we observed absolutely no fragmentation of E298D (compare lanes 1 and2 with lanes 3–8). This suggests that the unique 100-kDa fragment generated in E298D eNOS may arise from acid hydrolysis of the Asp-Pro bond. Next, we surmised that if the cleavage of E298D eNOS occurs intracellularly, this should be reflected in a change in protein half-life relative to WT. To examine this hypothesis directly, we performed pulse-chase studies to determine the biosynthetic half-life of WT versus E298D eNOS. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the half-lives of the two proteins were virtually indistinguishable and close to the reported values (26Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12333-12340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). From these experiments, we conclude that sample preparation alone could account for cleavage of E298D eNOS and that the turnover of the two proteins was not different. Having established acid hydrolysis as a likely mechanism of cleavage of E298D eNOS, we investigated whether acidic conditions alone, without boiling, could account for fragmentation of the enzyme. To separate the heating of samples from the accompanying acidification, we switched to cell lysis solutions buffered by citrate-phosphate mixtures. The citrate-phosphate lysis solutions were much more resistant to acidification upon heating than Tris-based buffers (e.g. a pH 7.0 solution of citrate-phosphate buffer at 22 °C remained at pH 7.0 when temperature was raised to 100 °C, whereas Tris buffers commonly dropped 1–2 pH units upon heating to 100 °C). Experiments in total cell lysates were performed to test whether fragmentation of E298D could occur upon chronic exposure to acidic conditions. Cells were transfected with appropriate cDNAs and lysates processed and further incubated in various pH solutions while rotating, at 37 °C for 10 h. As seen in Fig.3 A, fragmentation of both E298D and WT eNOS occurs markedly at pH 3.0. The fragmentation pattern of E298D in pH 3.0 includes a unique 100-kDa band (to theright of the asterisk) just below a larger, more prominent band that is also seen in the WT eNOS, pH 3.0 lane (lanes 3 and 6). At pH 5.0, the larger, prominent band seen at pH 3.0 is not present. With a darker exposure, a unique band present in the E298D, the pH 3.0 lane, becomes apparent at pH 5.0 (to the left of the asterisk). The unique 100-kDa band in E298D is consistent in size with the fragment of interest seen in Figs. 1 and 2. These experiments provide evidence that only upon chronic exposure to nonphysiologic pH ranges (10 h at less than pH 5.0) will E298D be partially cleaved. Heating the enzyme to levels beyond 37 °C without substantial acidification does not cause significant cleavage (i.e. see Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2, where the samples are heated to 70 °C), thus suggesting that both a change in pH and temperature (acidic hydrolysis) were responsible for the cleavage. However, to test whether various manipulations to promote cellular stress could evoke the cleavage of eNOS, transfected COS cells were exposed to a variety of stimuli and samples were processed in LDS buffer. As seen in Fig. 3 B exposure of cells to hypoxia (48 h, 1% ambient oxygen), H2O2 to evoke oxidative stress or staurosporine, a known inducer of apoptosis (20Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), did not result in the formation of the 100-kDa eNOS fragment under these extreme conditions. Collectively, the above data suggest that the cleavage of the E298D eNOS to the 100-kDa species may be artifactually generated in vitro. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that in the uncleaved state, E298D eNOS may have properties and activities different from wild-type eNOS that may account for higher cardiac disease risk in carriers of the 894T allele. Thus, COS cells were transfected with WT and E298D eNOS cDNA and the amount of NO produced over a 16-h period was quantified using NO-specific chemiluminescence. As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, the production of NO2− and the levels of eNOS protein expression in these experiments were not different from cells expressing the two forms eNOS. Next, we cloned both WT and E298D eNOS cDNAs into a bacterial expression vectors and produced and purified the recombinant proteins. As seen in Fig.5 A, both proteins were more than 85% pure based on Coomassie staining. Direct analysis of the catalytic activity of recombinant WT or E298D eNOS using hemoglobin capture of NO as an assay to assess the rate of NO production or cytochrome c reduction as an assay to assess the ability of the eNOS reductase domain to transfer electrons to an artificial acceptor showed that these proteins were indistinguishable enzymatically (see Fig. 5 B). To confirm that cleavage of E298D is a product of sample preparation rather than proteolytically cleaved intracellularly, we prepared purified recombinant enzymes for Western blotting using NUPAGE (LDS buffers) or Laemmli-style methods to prepare samples. Fig. 5 C demonstrates that recombinant E298D is cleaved in a fashion similar to that from eukaryotic cell lysates prepared similarly.Figure 5Enzyme activity and cleavage of recombinantly expressed WT and E298D eNOS proteins. A, representative Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel of recombinant WT or E298D eNOS, purified from E. coli. B, comparison of catalytic activities of WT and E298D eNOS as determined by hemoglobin capture and cytochromec reduction, respectively. In C, recombinant WT or E298D was prepared for Western analysis using either LDS or Laemmli sample buffer. The results shown in B are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we show that the extensively documented E298D polymorphism in eNOS does not appear to influence the stability, half-life, or biologic activity of the enzyme isolated from cells or the enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein. Most importantly, isolation of samples in standard Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE will generate a 100-kDa fragment cleaved precisely at the Asp–Pro bond, suggesting that the presence of the 100-kDa fragment in human tissue from carriers of the E298D polymorphism is likely to arise because of sample preparation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this fragment can be generated in an in vivo context by an unknown proteolytic mechanism. In preliminary studies, we generated a 100-kDa protein corresponding to the fragment derived from the cleavage of E298D (Figs. 1 and 2) and expressed it as a recombinant protein in E. coli. Functional analysis of this protein missing the heme domain showed that it was an active reductase (based on cytochrome c reduction). If this cleavage can occur in a cellular context, it is possible for this protein to reduce oxygen to superoxide, which can contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Alternatively, because eNOS is subjected to various levels of regulation including protein-protein interactions, fatty acylation, and phosphorylation, these control steps may be influenced by the polymorphism. In conclusion, a causative linkage between the common polymorphism E298D in eNOS and the incidence of cardiovascular disease cannot be explained based on the cleavage or impaired function of the enzyme.

These systems are, however, often limited by the levels of transgene expression in the absence of dox administration. The tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS), a fusion protein containing thetet repressor and the KRAB-AB domain of the kid-1 transcriptional repressor, is inhibited by doxycycline. We hypothesized that tTS would tighten control of transgene expression in rtTA-based systems. To test this hypothesis we generated mice in which the CC10 promoter targeted tTS to the lung, bred these mice with CC10-rtTA-interleukin 13 (IL-13) mice in which IL-13 was overexpressed in an inducible lung-specific fashion, and compared the IL-13 production and phenotypes of parental mice and the triple transgenic CC10-rtTA/tTS-IL-13 progeny of these crosses. In the CC10-rtTA-IL-13 mice, IL-13, mucus metaplasia, inflammation, alveolar enlargement, and enhanced lung volumes were noted at base line and increased greatly after doxycycline administration. In the triple transgenic tTS animals, IL-13 and the IL-13-induced phenotype could not be appreciated without doxycycline. In contrast, tTS did not alter the induction of IL-13 or the generation of the IL-13 phenotype by doxycycline. Thus, tTS effectively eliminated the baseline leak without altering the inducibility of rtTA-regulated transgenes in vivo. Optimal “off/on” regulation of transgene expression can be accomplished with the combined use of tTS and rtTA.

This is nicely illustrated in the lung, where the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10)1 or surfactant apoprotein-C promoters can be used to selectively target genes of interest to the lung parenchyma and/or airway (1Schilz R. Elias J.A. Raeburn D. Giembycz M. Airways Smooth Muscle: Modeling the Asthmatic Response in Vivo. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 241-274Google Scholar). In early studies, these promoters were used to directly drive the expression of transgenes in the lung. These studies provided impressive insights into the chronic respiratory effector functions of inflammatory mediators and the pathogenesis of asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, lung development, and pulmonary fibrosis (2Zhu Z.

As a result, these modeling systems are limited in their ability to accurately model waxing and waning disease processes such as asthma and are unable to differentiate transgene-induced phenotypic alterations that are due to alterations in lung development from alterations that would otherwise be induced in an adult/mature lung. These systems are also unable to appropriately study genes whose products are toxic in early life and cannot be used to define the natural history and/or reversibility of transgene-induced phenotypic alterations (1Schilz R. Elias J.A. Raeburn D. Giembycz M. Airways Smooth Muscle: Modeling the Asthmatic Response in Vivo. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 241-274Google Scholar, 10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To deal with the limitations inherent in standard overexpression modeling, a number of investigators have established transgenic systems in which the expression of the transgene can be externally regulated. Although a variety of approaches have been utilized, tetracycline-controlled expression systems have been employed most frequently (10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A.

A. 1995; 92: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory were the first to establish the utility of this approach in the lung (10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This system is based on the generation of transgenic mice with two molecular constructs. In the first, the promoter of choice (CC10) drives the expression of the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), a fusion protein made up of the herpesvirus VP-16 transactivator and a mutantTet repressor from Escherichia coli. This transactivating fusion protein requires doxycycline (dox) (a tetracycyline derivative) for specific DNA binding. The second construct contains multimers of the tetracycline operator (tet-O), a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter, and the gene of interest. In the absence of dox, the transactivator does not recognize or weakly recognizes its specific target sequence (tet-O), and target gene transcription occurs at low levels or not at all. The addition of dox allows the transactivator to bind in trans to thetet-O, activating the transgene of interest. This system has been used successfully in our laboratory and others to define the development-dependent and -independent processes that cause alveolar enlargement in the lung, inflammatory events that may contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema, cytokine-mediated protective events in oxygen toxicity, and crucial windows in lung development that define cytokine effector profiles (4Waxman A.B.

Detailed analyses of these and other rtTA-based systems have, however, revealed some properties that restrict its application. One limitation stems from the fact that rtTA can exhibit a degree of residual affinity to tet-O in the absence of dox. This manifests as definable levels of transgene activation and phenotype induction in animals (or cells) that are not receiving dox (11Baron U. Bujard H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 401-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 16Furth P.A. St. Onge L. Boger H. Gruss P. Gossen M. Kistner A. Bujard H. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Helbl V. Lederer T. Urlinger S. Wittenburg N. Hillen W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 708-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Approaches that can be used to eliminate basal transgene leakin vivo have not been well characterized. The tet-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS) is a fusion protein made up of a mutant Tet repressor and the KRAB-AB domain of the Kid-1 protein, a powerful transcriptional repressor (24Freundlieb S. Schirra-Muller C. Bujard H. J. Gene Med. 1999; 1: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It binds to tet-O only in the absence of dox. Therefore, in systems containing tTS and tet-O-driven transgenes, tTS binds to the tet-O in the absence of dox and inhibits the expression of the gene of interest. As dox is added to the culture medium, the tTS dissociates from tet-O, relieving the transcriptional suppression. At sufficient concentrations, the dox also interacts with rtTA, allowing it to bind to tet-O and activate the gene of interest. The tTS system has been shown to confer exquisite regulating ability on transiently transfected and stably transfected rtTA-regulated reporter genes in cells in culture (24Freundlieb S. Schirra-Muller C. Bujard H. J. Gene Med. 1999; 1: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Forster K. Helbl V. Lederer T. Urlinger S. Wittenburg N. Hillen W.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the feasibility and efficacy of tTS in regulating basal gene expression in vivo in transgenic animals has not been investigated. We postulated that the principles involved in tTS inhibition of basal gene expression in vitro are also applicable to the in vivo state. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice in which the CC10 promoter targeted tTS to the lung and bred these mice with CC10-rtTA-IL-13 mice in which CC10 and rtTA were used to express IL-13 in the lung/airway in an externally regulatable fashion. These mice had been previously generated in our laboratory and shown to have a quantifiable level of transgene leak in the absence of dox administration (18Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We then compared the IL-13 production and phenotypes of the dual transgenic CC10-rtTA-IL-13 and the triple transgenic CC10-rtTA/tTS-IL-13 mice. These studies demonstrate that tTS totally abrogates basal transgene leak and phenotype induction in our transgenic system. They also demonstrate that tTS mediates this inhibition without decreasing the ability of dox to stimulate the rtTA-regulated transgene or the ability of the transgene to induce a tissue phenotype. In order to express tTS in a lung specific fashion, the construct CC10-tTS-hGH was generated (Fig.1 A). The plasmid containing tTS, pTet-tTS, was obtained from Dr. Andrew Farmer (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized that would introduceHindIII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites 5′ and 3′ of the tTS coding region respectively. Furthermore a silent mutation was introduced to disrupt the original BamHI site right before the stop codon. The primers were, tTSUP1: 5′-GTG AAC AAG CTT ATC GCC TGG AGA CG-3′ and tTSLO1: 5′-CTT AGT GGA TCC ATT TAC CAG GGG TCC TCT CT TGC-3′. The tTS fragment was amplified by PCR and then inserted between CC10 promoter and hGH polyadenylation and intronic sequence in place of the rtTA sequences in construct CC10-rtTA-hGH that was previously described by our laboratory (10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). After verifying the junction areas and tTS DNA by sequencing, the construct was isolated by electrophoresis. The DNA was then purified through an Elutip-D column following the manufacturer's instructions (Schleicher and Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH) and dialyzed against microinjection buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl/0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Transgenic mice were generated in (CBA X C57BL/6) F2 eggs using standard pronuclear injection as previously described (6Tang W. Geba G.P. Zheng T. Ray P. Homer R. Kuhn C. Favell R.A. Elias J.A. J.

The resulting animals and their progeny were genotyped using tail DNA and Southern blot analysis with 32P-labeled tTS DNA as a probe or PCR. For PCR reactions, primers were designed to cover the area that was unique to the tTS transgene (TableI). The primers were tTSUP2: 5′-GAG TTG GCA GCA GTT TCT CC-3′ and tTSL02: 5′-GAG CAC AGC CAC ATCTTC AA-3′. The PCR protocol was 95 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min; 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.

Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These dual transgenic mice express IL-13 in the lung in an externally regulatable fashion. The first construct in these mice, CC10-rtTA-hGH, contains the CC10 promoter, rtTA and human growth hormone (hGH) intronic and polyadenylation sequences (hGH) (10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The second construct,tet-O-IL-13-hGH, contains a tet-O and minimal cytomegalovirus promoter, murine IL-13 cDNA and hGH intronic and polyadenylation sequences. The constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1A. CC10-rtTA/tTS-IL-13 triple transgenic mice were generated by breeding CC10-rtTA-IL-13 mice with CC10-tTS-hGH mice. The genotypes of the progeny of these crosses were analyzed by PCR performed with tail DNA with primers designed to determine if rtTA, tTS and/or IL-13 were present (Table I). The protocols that were used to detect rtTA and IL-13 have been previously described (2Zhu Z. Homer R.J. Wang Z. Chen Q. Geba G.P. Wang J. Zhang Y. Elias J.A. J. Clin.

Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The PCR protocols for tTS were noted above. All mice were maintained on normal water until transgene activation was desired. At that time, dox (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the animal's drinking water. Sucrose (2%) was also added to mask the bitter taste of dox and the dox water was kept in dark brown bottles to prevent light-induced dox degradation. Mice were euthanized and a median sternotomy was performed. The trachea was then isolated via blunt dissection and small caliber tubing was inserted and secured in the airway. Three successive volumes of 0.75 ml of PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin were then instilled and gently aspirated. Total cell counts and differentials were evaluated as described previously (18Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin.

Med. 2000; 192: 1587-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). BAL fluid aliquots were centrifuged and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C until utilized. The levels of IL-13 were determined immunologically using commercial ELISA kits as per the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Selected samples were concentrated 10 X by volume using Microcon YM-10 following the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). mRNA levels were assessed using Northern analyses and/or RT-PCR as previously described by our laboratory (18Zheng T.

In the RT-PCR experiments, total RNA from mouse lungs was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) after treatment with DNase I following the manufacturer′s instructions. The RNA samples were reverse transcribed and gene-specific primers were used to amplify selected regions of each target moiety. Optimal annealing temperature and cyclings were derived for each individual cytokine. Equal amounts of RNA were tested in each reaction and β-actin was used as an internal standard. Amplified PCR products were visualized using ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis and finally confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. IL-13, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, eotaxin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), cathepsin K and β-actin mRNA were assessed using the primers and conditions listed in Table I as described previously by our laboratory (18Zheng T.

In selected experiments the IL-13 RT-PCR product was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and evaluated with a labeled internal primer, 5′-TTT CCG CGG CTA CAG CTC CCT GGT TCT CTC-3′. The tTS transcripts were evaluated as described above. In these experiments, mice were euthanized, median sternotomies were performed and right heart perfusion was accomplished with calcium and magnesium-free PBS to clear the intravascular space. The heart and lungs were then removed en bloc, inflated to 25 cm pressure with Streck tissue fixative solution (Streck Laboratories, Inc. Omaha, NE), embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 microns. Hematoxylin and eosin, Mallory's trichrome and periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PAS) stains were performed in the Research Pathology Laboratory at Yale University. To evaluate the size of the alveoli, lungs from transgenic and control mice were obtained, fixed to pressure and sectioned and stained as described above. Alveolar chord length was then measured as described previously by our laboratory (18Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The histologic mucus index is a measure of the number of mucus secreting airway epithelial cells per unit basement membrane. It was calculated from PAS stained histologic sections as previously described by our laboratory (18Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin.

Lung volume and compliance were assessed as described previously by our laboratory (18Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese R. Chapman H. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin.

In these experiments mice were anesthetized, the trachea was cannulated and the lungs were ventilated with 100% O2 via a “T” piece attachment. The trachea was then clamped and oxygen absorbed in the face of ongoing pulmonary perfusion. At the end of this degassing, the lungs and heart were removed en bloc and inflated with PBS at gradually increasing pressures from 0–30 cm. The size of the lung at each 5 cm interval was evaluated via volume displacement. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. As appropriate, groups were compared by analysis of variance with Scheffe's procedure post hoc analysis, Student's t test or nonparametric assessments (Wilcoxon's rank sum, Mann-WhitneyU test) using Stat View software for the Macintosh (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). To characterize the effects of tTS in our transgenic system, we generated multiple lines of mice in which tTS was targeted to the lung using the CC10 promoter (Fig. 1A). The CC10-tTS-hGH construct was prepared, linearized and microinjected as previously described (6Tang W. Geba G.P. Zheng T. Ray P. Homer R. Kuhn C. Favell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2845-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Ray P. Tang W. Wang P. Homer R. Kuhn C.I. Flavell R.A. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PCR using tail biopsy-derived DNA was used for genotyping and RT-PCR of whole lung RNA was used to evaluate tTS gene expression. Four transgene (+) founder animals were obtained from the microinjection (Fig. 1B). Each was bred onto a C57BL/6 background and independent lines were generated. In all cases, the transgene was propagated in a Mendelian fashion. tTS mRNA was readily detected in total lung RNA from transgene (+) animals. tTS mRNA was not detected in lung RNA from transgene (-) littermate control animals. In addition, tTS was not detected in a variety of extra thoracic organs in transgene (+) or (-) progeny mice (Fig. 1C and data not shown). These studies demonstrate that CC10 appropriately targets tTS to the murine lung. To determine if tTS altered lung structure, we compared the hematoxylin and eosin, PAS and trichrome evaluations, alveolar morphometry and compliance of 1–3 month old CC10-tTS-hGH mice and wild type littermate controls. In all cases, differences could not be appreciated (data not shown). Thus, tTS expression did not alter the histology, morphometry or compliance of the murine lung. To determine if tTS altered the levels of IL-13 that were produced in the absence of dox administration, we compared the levels of BAL IL-13 protein and lung IL-13 mRNA in double transgenic (CC10-rtTA-IL-13) and triple transgenic (CC10-rtTA/tTS-IL-13) mice. Single transgenic (CC10-tTS-hGH) and transgene (-) littermate control animals were also evaluated. IL-13 was not detected in the BAL fluid from the transgene (-) littermate controls or the CC10-tTS-hGH animals. IL-13 (50–110 pg/ml) was, however, readily appreciated in the BAL fluids from the dual transgene (+) animals. In striking contrast to this finding, IL-13 protein was undetectable in BAL fluids from uninduced triple transgenic animals containing the tTS construct (Fig. 2). After 10-fold BAL fluid concentration, IL-13 was still unable to be detected in BAL fluids from triple transgenic mice, whereas significant levels (0.9–1.5 ng/ml) of IL-13 were detected in similarly concentrated BAL fluids from dual transgene (+) animals (Fig. 2). These studies demonstrate that the tTS construct decreased the BAL IL-13 content of uninduced mice by at least 3 orders of magnitude. In accord with these observations, mRNA encoding IL-13 was readily detected via RT-PCR analysis in dual transgene (+) animals. In contrast, IL-13 mRNA was unable to be detected in lungs from triple transgenic tTS mice even after 35 cycles of RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2). When viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that the inclusion of the tTS construct totally eliminated the background leak in our dual transgenic rtTA-regulated animals. Lungs from CC10-rtTA-IL-13 animals that did not receive dox were enlarged and had larger alveoli and enhanced compliance when compared with lungs from transgene (-) littermate controls (Fig. 3). They also manifest increased BAL cellularity, eosinophil, lymphocyte and macrophage rich BAL and tissue inflammation, mucus metaplasia and enhanced accumulation of eotaxin, MCP-1, MMP-12 and cathepsin K mRNA (Fig.4, Table IIand data not shown) (2Zhu Z.

In contrast to these findings, the lung volumes, alveolar size and pulmonary compliance of triple transgenic tTS containing animals were unable to be differentiated from the same parameters in transgene (-) littermate control animals or CC10-tTS-hGH mice (p < 0.01 comparing triple and dual transgene (+) animals for each parameter) (Fig. 3).

The net production of apoB can be regulated by presecretory degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and cytosolic hsp70. To further explore the mechanisms of apoB degradation, we have established a cell-free system in which degradation can be faithfully recapitulated. Human apoB48 synthesized in vitro was translocated into microsomes, glycosylated, and ubiquitinylated. Subsequent incubation with rat hepatic cytosol led to proteasome-mediated degradation. To explore whether hsp90 is required for apoB degradation, geldanamycin (GA) was added during the degradation assay. GA increased the recovery of microsomal apoB48 ∼3-fold and disrupted the interaction between hsp90 and apoB48. Confirming the hsp90 effect in the cell-free system, we also found that transfection of hsp90 cDNA into rat hepatoma cells enhanced apoB48 degradation. Finally, apoB48 degradation was reconstituted in vitro using cytosol prepared from wild type yeast. Notably, degradation was attenuated when apoB48-containing microsomes were incubated with cytosol supplemented with GA or with cytosol prepared from yeast strains with mutations in the homologues of mammalian hsp70 and hsp90. Overall, our data suggest that hsp90 facilitates the interaction between endoplasmic reticulum-associated apoB and components of the proteasomal pathway, perhaps in cooperation with hsp70.

ApoB is the major protein component of low density lipoprotein, the atherosclerosis-causing particle that transports cholesterol in the blood. During the translation of apoB in the liver, lipids are transferred to the nascent protein by the ER-resident microsomal triglyceride transfer protein to form a “primordial lipoprotein.” In hepatocytes and hepatocarcinoma-derived cell lines, apoB either undergoes assembly with lipids and secretion or is subjected to ER retention and intracellular degradation (1Borchardt R.A.

We have previously shown that this degradation in HepG2 cells is accomplished by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and involves cytosolic hsp70 (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S.

The degree of proteasomal degradation appeared to be regulated by the availability of the lipid ligands for apoB (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).There are a number of ER luminal and ER transmembrane proteins (7Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) that have also been reported to undergo proteasomal degradation. This process has been referred to as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and for a number of substrate proteins, a common scenario appears to be that the nascent protein undergoes translocation, followed by retrotranslocation and release into the cytosol, where it is degraded by the proteasome. Although the route by which apoB is targeted to the proteasome is not completely defined, certain features of its degradation may differ from this model. In particular, apoB can assume a bitopic topology during or shortly after translocation, resulting in domains that can be accessed by cytosolic or ER luminal factors, with degradation by the proteasome accomplished without the requirement of apoB to be fully retrotranslocated (6Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Welch W.J. Johnson A.E. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).As noted above, the molecular chaperone hsp70 facilitates ERAD of apoB in HepG2 cells (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones play important roles in assisting the folding and assembly of proteins, facilitating protein translocation across a variety of intracellular membranes, and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation, including secretory or transmembrane proteins destined for ERAD (9Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 10Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The most abundant chaperone in the eukaryotic cytosol is hsp90, which has been shown to be involved in the maturation of signal transduction proteins, such as steroid hormone receptors (11Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 12Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The effect of hsp90 can be specifically inhibited by geldanamycin (GA), an ansamycin antibiotic that competes for the ATP binding site (13Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). A positive role for hsp90 in the maturation of CFTR has recently been proposed (14Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) based on data showing that proteasomal degradation was accelerated by the disruption of hsp90 association with CFTR by the addition of GA to the cell culture medium. Alternatively, other recent studies have suggested that hsp90 can destabilize and promote the ERAD of mutant proteins (e.g. CFTR Δ508 (15Fuller W. Cuthbert A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37462-37468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and insulin receptor ΔEx13-IR (16Imamura T. Haruta T. Takata Y. Usui I. Iwata M. Ishihara H. Ishiki M. Ishibashi O. Ueno E. Sasaoka T. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11183-11188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)).Given this recent controversy, we were particularly interested in investigating the role of hsp90 in the ERAD of apoB. In order to define the mechanisms by which apoB enters the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the cytosolic factors involved (including hsp90), we sought to develop a cell-free degradation system. One particular advantage of such a system would be the ability to examine the interactions of chaperones with apoB without changing their steady-state levels. In this report, we summarize the characteristics of the system and the evidence obtained from it suggesting that hsp90 promotes apoB degradation. Importantly, the results from the cell-free system were consistent with those from hepatoma cells transfected with hsp90 cDNA.DISCUSSIONThe majority of apoB is subjected to proteasome-mediated ERAD in cells of hepatic origin that are either deprived of exogenous fatty acids (which stimulate lipid synthesis) or deficient for microsomal triglyceride transfer activity (4Fisher E.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the association of apoB with lipid ligands is required for the achievement of its native conformation, and when the concentration or transfer of lipids is reduced, apoB is detected by quality control mechanisms that prevent the exit of malfolded proteins from the ER (46Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar).That chaperones may have important functions in apoB degradation stems from the growing recognition that these molecules influence the ERAD process of other proteins (for a review, see Ref. 9Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and from our demonstration that increasing the expression of hsp70 in fatty acid-deprived human liver-derived HepG2 cells promoted the proteasomal degradation of apoB (4Fisher E.A.

Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Further hints that hsp70 and other chaperones may be involved in the quality control of apoB come from Linnik and Herscovitz (38Linnik K.M. Herscovitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), who showed in HepG2 cells that BiP/GRP78, calreticulin, Erp72 and GRP94 co-immunoprecipitate with apoB, and from Olofsson and colleagues (48Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), who have found recently that BiP, PDI, calreticulin, and GRP94 are associated with apoB-containing lipoprotein particles in rat hepatoma cells.Because of the limited ability in intact hepatic cells to modulate the interactions of chaperones without affecting their steady state levels, we developed a cell-free degradation assay system in order to best explore the roles of these proteins in apoB ERAD. The previous report that apoB48, synthesized in a coupled transcription/translation system, was translocated into dog pancreatic microsomes (24Rusinol A.E. Jamil H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8019-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested the feasibility of this goal. Under such conditions, there is neither microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity nor active lipid synthesis, thereby mimicking the lipid-ligand-deficient state in liver-derived cells deprived of fatty acids or lipid transfer activity. In the present studies, we have extended the previous results by showing that the nascent protein was modified by glycosylation and ATP-dependent ubiquitinylation, both known to occur under native conditions (4Fisher E.A.

By isolating the microsome-associated apoB48 and demonstrating its proteasome-mediated degradation after resuspension in hepatic cytosol, we have established a cell-free system in which ERAD of apoB can be reconstituted. As with other mammalian and yeast ERAD substrates studied in similar systems (e.g. Refs. 8McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 50Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21224-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this now allows us to decipher the molecular requirements for the degradation of apoB by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.As noted in the Introduction, we were interested in studying the potential influence of hsp90 on apoB degradation, given its abundance in mammalian cells and its controversial role as a protective or susceptibility factor in the proteasomal degradation of other proteins (14Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Fuller W. Cuthbert A.W. J. Biol.

Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11183-11188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence implicate hsp90 as a prodegradative factor for apoB. First, there was increased recovery of apoB in the cell-free degradation assay when GA was added to the rat hepatic cytosol (Fig. 6). GA is widely considered to be a specific inhibitor of protein interactions with members of the hsp90 family (e.g. Refs. 34Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar and 37Chavany C. Mimnaugh E. Miller P.

Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Fuller W. Cuthbert A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37462-37468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Further support that GA was operating through a specific hsp90-mediated mechanism was our finding that it disrupted the interaction between hsp90 and apoB48 (Fig. 7) without perturbing the total pool of hsp90. Importantly, despite the interaction of apoB and GRP94 in HepG2 cells (38Linnik K.M. Herscovitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), there was no evidence for this in the cell-free system, consistent with the suggestion that GRP94 plays a role in the maturation of lipoproteins containing apoB escaping ERAD (48Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).The prodegradative effect of hsp90 on apoB in the cell-free assay was also found in rat hepatoma cells, McArdle-RH7777, transfected with hsp90 cDNA (Fig. 9). This cell line is a standard model of hepatic mammalian lipoprotein metabolism and also exhibits ERAD of apoB (39Wang H. Fisher E.A. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I543Google Scholar,52Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the cells produced predominately apoB100, the small amount of apoB48 in the control cells was also reduced in the hsp90 cDNA-transfected cells (data not shown). These effects on cellular apoB were not attributable to a nonspecific effect of hsp90 or the transfection procedure, since albumin recoveries from the cell and medium were not significantly changed and the control cells were subjected to the same transfection protocol. Overall, these results imply that the cell-free system is an accurate reflection of the role of hsp90 in intact cells of hepatic origin.The availability of yeast strains with mutations in the homologues of mammalian hsp90 and hsp70, hsp82 and ssa1, respectively, has allowed us to confirm and to examine further the roles of these chaperones in apoB degradation (Fig. 10). The suitability of this system was first evidenced by the fact that the degradation of microsome-associated apoB48 in the presence of the wild type yeast cytosol had characteristics resembling those observed with rat hepatic cytosol; i.e. >60% of apoB48 was degraded, which was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor (data not shown) or GA. Second, consistent with the results summarized here and our previous studies implicating a prodegradative effect of hsp70 (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), cytosols from the strains with either chaperone mutated did not support significant degradation. This implied that both chaperones are required for the proteasomal degradation of apoB. This requirement was specific, as supported by our finding that degradation was reconstituted in the complementation (mixing) experiment. Other studies have shown that hsp90 and hsp70 cooperate. For example, both chaperones participate in the activation of hormone binding by glucocorticoid receptor (53Rajapandi T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22597-22604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Multichaperone complexes containing hsp90 and hsp70 have also been shown to mediate refolding of denatured luciferase and β-galactosidase in a cooperative manner (54Schumacher R.J. Hurst R.

Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar); rather, there appears to be an extraction process in which factors interact with apoB domains as they appear on the cytosolic surface of the ER membrane. It has been proposed that hsp70 (58Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) can facilitate such an extraction, perhaps by binding to a domain and serving as a molecular motor or a ratchet. This would be consistent with our finding that increased expression of hsp70 decreased the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins even when lipid synthesis was stimulated in HepG2 cells (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), suggesting a competition between the cytosolic factors targeting apoB to ERAD and the ER luminal factors promoting lipoprotein assembly and exit from the ER.Increased expression of hsp70 enhances apoB ubiquitinylation (4Fisher E.A.

Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, GA did not change apoB ubiquitinylation (Fig. 8), implying that the hsp90 acted after ubiquitin tagging of apoB48. Because hsp90 has been shown to be associated with the proteasome, it has been proposed recently that it may facilitate the unfolding of substrates into the relatively narrow mouth of the 19 S cap of the proteasome (59Wagner B.J. Margolis J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,60Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In this scenario, we envision hsp70 and hsp90 working sequentially, with hsp70 being an early participant as an “extraction” and, perhaps, a ubiquitinylation factor and hsp90 as a factor acting later to facilitate the association with and entry into the proteasome of the ubiquitinylated apoB. Thus, for maximal degradation, both chaperones should be expected to be required for apoB degradation. Because of the length of apoB (2152 and 4536 amino acids for apoB48 and apoB100, respectively) and the nature of an extraction process, however, it is likely that at steady state in the hepatic cell, both chaperones are bound to apoB targeted for ERAD, as we have recently observed in HepG2 cells (6Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Welch W.J. Johnson A.E. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 3R. Pariyarath and E. Fisher, unpublished results. The participation of both chaperones in apoB degradation is consistent also with the recent finding that hsp70 and hsp90 have roles in the folding and ubiquitinylation of wild type and ΔF508 CFTR in mammalian cells (15Fuller W. Cuthbert A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37462-37468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that hsp70 facilitates the degradation of CFTR in yeast (21Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).In summary, we have established a powerful and convenient cell-free system to study the ERAD pathway for apoB. With this system and confirmation in transfection studies, we have now obtained clear evidence that both hsp90 and hsp70 promote apoB ERAD. The effects of these two chaperones and other cytosolic factors on this process can now be studied by using purified factors or cytosols from yeast strains with relevant mutations, singly or in combination, to allow the biochemical characterization and the kinetic ordering of events related to the targeting of apoB to the proteasome. Apoprotein B (apoB)1 is a very large (540 kDa) protein and is essential for the assembly and secretion of hepatic lipoproteins. ApoB is the major protein component of low density lipoprotein, the atherosclerosis-causing particle that transports cholesterol in the blood. During the translation of apoB in the liver, lipids are transferred to the nascent protein by the ER-resident microsomal triglyceride transfer protein to form a “primordial lipoprotein.” In hepatocytes and hepatocarcinoma-derived cell lines, apoB either undergoes assembly with lipids and secretion or is subjected to ER retention and intracellular degradation (1Borchardt R.A.

We have previously shown that this degradation in HepG2 cells is accomplished by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and involves cytosolic hsp70 (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S.

The degree of proteasomal degradation appeared to be regulated by the availability of the lipid ligands for apoB (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). There are a number of ER luminal and ER transmembrane proteins (7Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) that have also been reported to undergo proteasomal degradation. This process has been referred to as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and for a number of substrate proteins, a common scenario appears to be that the nascent protein undergoes translocation, followed by retrotranslocation and release into the cytosol, where it is degraded by the proteasome. Although the route by which apoB is targeted to the proteasome is not completely defined, certain features of its degradation may differ from this model. In particular, apoB can assume a bitopic topology during or shortly after translocation, resulting in domains that can be accessed by cytosolic or ER luminal factors, with degradation by the proteasome accomplished without the requirement of apoB to be fully retrotranslocated (6Pariyarath R.

As noted above, the molecular chaperone hsp70 facilitates ERAD of apoB in HepG2 cells (4Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Molecular chaperones play important roles in assisting the folding and assembly of proteins, facilitating protein translocation across a variety of intracellular membranes, and targeting misfolded proteins for degradation, including secretory or transmembrane proteins destined for ERAD (9Brodsky J.L.

Hepatic CETP gene expression is increased in response to dietary hypercholesterolemia, an effect that is mediated by the activity of liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) on a direct repeat 4 element in the CETPpromoter. In this study we show that the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 also transactivates the CETP promoter by binding to a proximal promoter element distinct from the DR4 site. LRH-1 potentiates the sterol-dependent regulation of the wild typeCETP promoter by LXR/RXR. Small heterodimer partner, a repressor of LRH-1, abolishes the potentiation effect of LRH-1 but not its basal transactivation of the CETP promoter. Since this mode of regulation of CETP is very similar to that recently reported for the bile salt-mediated repression of Cyp7a(encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of cholesterol into bile acid in the liver), we examined the effects of bile salt feeding on CETP mRNA expression in human CETPtransgenic mice. Hepatic CETP mRNA expression was repressed by a diet containing 1% cholic acid in male mice but was induced by the same diet in female mice. Microarray analysis of hepatic mRNA showed that about 1.5% of genes were repressed, and 2.5% were induced by the bile acid diet. However, the sexually dimorphic regulatory pattern of the CETP gene was an unusual response. Our data provide further evidence for the regulation ofCETP and Cyp7a genes by similar molecular mechanisms, consistent with coordinate transcriptional regulation of sequential steps of reverse cholesterol transport.

In humans and animals, plasma CETP and tissue mRNA levels are increased in response to high fat, high cholesterol diets or endogenous hypercholesterolemia. These increases are due to elevated CETP gene transcription especially in the liver (2Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

The mechanism of this effect was recently shown to involve the transcription factor LXR, binding as a heterodimer with RXR to a site in the CETPproximal promoter, a direct repeat of a nuclear receptor binding sequence separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4 element, −384 to −399). This response was seen with both LXRα and LXRβ, related nuclear hormone receptors that bind and are activated by specific hydroxylated sterols at physiological concentrations (5Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

In addition to stimulating reverse cholesterol transport and cholesterol excretion, LXRs activate the promoter of SREBP-1c, indicating a role in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis (17Repa J.J.

LRH-1 has also been shown to act as a competence factor, enhancing the ability of LXRα/RXRα to mediate a sterol response on the Cyp7a gene (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A.

Since CETP and Cyp7a are both regulated by LXR/RXR, we investigated the role of LRH-1 and SHP-1 in the regulation of CETP gene expression. Our study shows a marked similarity between the effects of these factors on theCETP and Cyp7a promoters. This supports the idea of coordinate regulation of the sequential metabolic steps mediated by CETP and CYP7A. However, divergent responses of these two genes to a cholic acid-containing diet indicate additional complexity in thein vivo response to bile acids.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 binds and transactivates the human CETP promoter. In 293 cells, the native CETP promoter showed modest sterol induction in the presence of LXRα/RXRα or LXRβ/RXRα (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. 2). The expression of LRH-1 enhanced the response of LXR/RXR to sterols. The principal tissue expressing LRH-1 is the liver, which also is a major site where CETP is expressed (4Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though CETP is expressed in peripheral tissues, the sterol regulation in peripheral tissue is less pronounced than in liver (4Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for LRH-1 in the sterol induction mediated by LXR might confer tissue specificity for the induction of genes by sterols, since the ubiquitously expressed LXRβ could otherwise mediate sterol induction of CETPgene. Additional physiological significance might be that LRH-1 abolishes the requirement for RXR ligands, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid or docosahexanoic acid (35de Urquiza A.M. Liu S. Sjoberg M. Zetterstrom R.H. Griffiths W. Sjovall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), in order to obtain significant LXR-mediated sterol induction of gene expression. Thus, in response to endogenous hypercholesterolemia, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, which is synthesized from a shunt pathway (36Nelson J.A. Steckbeck S.R. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1067-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to act as an LXR ligand (6Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), may bind and activate LXR/RXR without the requirement for additional RXR ligands. This effect is clearly shown in Fig. 8 and Supplemental Fig. 2. The presence of LRH increased the induction of CETP by sterol but had no additional incremental effect as a result of the addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid.The effect of LRH-1 was strikingly specific for the LXR-dependent sterol induction of CETPexpression. The mechanism of the LRH-1 potentiation effect required the binding of LRH-1 to a site (−75 to −83) (LRHBS) on theCETP promoter, and the DNA binding ability is required for the potentiation function of LRH-1, since mutation of the LRH-1 DNA-binding zinc finger motif abolished this effect (not shown). The activity of LRH-1 on the CETP promoter might enhance ligand binding to LXR or cooperatively work with LXR/RXR to recruit ligand-dependent co-activators. The co-activator SRC-1 (nuclear receptor co-activator) has been shown to interact with LXRβ/RXR upon binding of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and/or 9-cis-retinoic acid (37Wiebel F.F. Steffensen K.R. Treuter E. Feltkamp D. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1105-1118PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that sterol-dependent binding of co-activator is enhanced either by the LRH/LXR activation or by retinoid binding to RXR. This would explain why in the presence of sterols the expression of LRH or activation by 9-cis-retinoic acid achieved similar promoter activity (Fig. 8).Recently, considerable evidence has been obtained to support the idea that LXR/RXR coordinates the regulation of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (9Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), such as ABCA1 (10Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). It appears that ABCA1 does not need LRH-1 as a competence factor for the regulation by LXR/RXR, since the LXR/RXR-binding site is sufficient to mediate sterol induction in cultured cells in the context of the native promoter (10Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). ApoE and ABC1 are involved in the initial step of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells, resulting in enrichment of HDL particles with cholesterol and cholesteryl ester. CETP transfers cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins in the bloodstream, and thereby facilitates the transport of HDL cholesterol ester into the liver. Cyp7a converts cholesterol into bile acids in the liver, leading to excretion from the body.The mechanism of regulation of CETP by LXR/RXR and LRH is strikingly similar to the regulation of Cyp7a by these factors. The sterol induction of Cyp7a has also been shown to require LRH-1 as a potentiation or competence factor (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The competence effect requires binding of LRH-1 to both CETP andCyp7a promoters. Similar to its effects on the humanCETP promoter, LRH-1 (CPF) transactivates the humanCYP7A promoter in 293 cells (19Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, little basal transactivation of the rat Cyp7a promoter by LRH-1 was seen in 293 cells (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). In the rat Cyp7a promoter, LRH-1 not only increased the induction by sterol but also the additive or synergistic induction by both sterols and 9-cis-retinoic acid. However, in the CETP promoter, LRH-1 only increased the induction by sterol. These results imply that the competence mechanism of LRH-1 onCETP and Cyp7a might be slightly different.Cyp7a is not only regulated by hydroxysterols, but also is under feedback control by bile salts in the entero-hepatic circulation. The nuclear receptor FXR was recently identified as a receptor for the bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (40Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D.

Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Binding of FXR to the promoters of several bile salt-induced genes, such as ileal bile acid-binding protein and phospholipid transfer protein, resulted in bile acid-dependent promoter activation (40Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar, 43Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R.

It has been suggested that FXR/RXR may also mediate the bile acid repression of Cyp7a; however, since FXR/RXR does not bind the bile acid response element in the Cyp7a promoter, an indirect mechanism is implied (44Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Weinberger C. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10918-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Disruption of FXR has provided strong evidence for a role of FXR in up-regulating expression of genes such as the ileal bile acid transporter and the basal bile salt exporter (29Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). FXR knock-out mice also failed to repress hepatic Cyp7a mRNA levels in response to a cholic acid-containing diet (29Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this factor in bile salt-mediated gene repression.Recently, it has been proposed that FXR induces SHP, which then interacts with LRH-1, preventing its activation of the Cyp7apromoter (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 27Goodwin B. Jones S.A.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). SHP, a transcriptional repressor, was induced by bile acid treatment as a result of activity of FXR/RXR on the SHP promoter; furthermore, SHP directly interacts with LRH-1 and represses LRH-1 activity in cell culture (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 27Goodwin B. Jones S.A.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The abolition of LRH facilitation of the LXR-mediated sterol response by SHP was strikingly similar in the CETP and Cyp7a promoters (this study and (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar)). A weak or absent effect of SHP on basal promoter activity in the presence of LRH also appears to be similar for CETP and Cyp7a (20Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). However, in previous studies (4Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we observed that a high fat, high cholesterol diet containing bile salts induced hepatic CETP mRNA expression, whereas Cyp7a mRNA is repressed in response to the same diet. In the present study a somewhat different response ofCETP and Cyp7a genes to a chow diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid was seen. Whereas Cyp7a mRNA was repressed by the bile salt-supplemented diet in both sexes,CETP mRNA was repressed in males but induced in female mice.In an attempt to understand these different responses, we characterized the responses of about 1200 different cDNAs and ESTs to the bile salt diet. The majority of differentially expressed genes were either induced or repressed in parallel fashion in both sexes. However, 11 genes gave a sexually dimorphic response, with the majority showing an induction in males but not in females. Thus, the CETPresponse is unusual and is unlikely to be mediated by a simple mechanism, such as induction of a single transcription factor in one sex but not the other. The array results provide an intriguing hint for how the differential response could be mediated. Thus, the TNFα-induced protein 2 was increased in males and decreased in females, suggesting that there could be a dimorphic effect of TNFα signaling in male versus female mice. Hepatic TNFα expression is induced by the cholic acid diet (it is probably made in Kupffer cells) (33Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and TNFα has been shown to repress bothCETP (34Hardardottir I. Moser A.H. Fuller J. Fielding C. Feingold K. Grunfeld C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2585-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Cyp7a (32Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the effect of TNFα is larger in male mice, this could explain why CETP is repressed in this sex. One has to then hypothesize an additional factor that up-regulates CETP in response to bile acids and only becomes apparent in females because of a lessened TNFα effect. The related gene PLTP is up-regulated by the bile salt diet, through an FXR mechanism (43Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and it is conceivable thatCETP could be similarly regulated. Induction of TNFα and interleukin-1 by the bile salt diet has also been suggested as a possible mechanism of repression of Cyp7a (33Miyake J.H. Wang S.L. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21805-21808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 45Urizar N.L. Dowhan D.H. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39313-39317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), but this response was not dimorphic. There could be additional mechanisms of repression of Cyp7a, such as that proposed involving FXR, SHP, and LRH, affecting both sexes.In summary, we have shown that the competence factor, LRH, enhances the LXR-mediated sterol response of the CETP promoter, probably contributes to the moderate tissue specificity of this response (46Oliveira H.C.F. Chouinard R.A. Agellon L.B. Bruce C. Ma L. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31831-31838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and provides a way for the CETP promoter to respond to sterols, independent of RXR agonists. Both of these effects,i.e. tissue-specific responses and responses to LXR/RXR that are independent of RXR ligands, may be general properties of competence factors in transcriptional responses. The interaction of LXR and LRH in the sterol-dependent induction of the CETP andCyp7a promoters, and the repression of this effect by SHP, is strikingly similar for CETP and Cyp7a, supporting the idea of coordinate regulation of these two genes in the liver (9Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the divergent responses of these and other genes to diets containing bile salts highlights the complexity of the in vivo response to this challenge. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)1 catalyzes the transfer of cholesterol ester from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (1Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). CETP is expressed in liver, intestine, and a number of peripheral tissues, such as adipose (1Tall A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In humans and animals, plasma CETP and tissue mRNA levels are increased in response to high fat, high cholesterol diets or endogenous hypercholesterolemia. These increases are due to elevated CETP gene transcription especially in the liver (2Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Masucci-Magoulas L. Plump A. Jiang X.C. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing human CETP, controlled by its natural flanking region, also increase expression of CETP in response to hypercholesterolemia (4Jiang X.C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this effect was recently shown to involve the transcription factor LXR, binding as a heterodimer with RXR to a site in the CETPproximal promoter, a direct repeat of a nuclear receptor binding sequence separated by 4 nucleotides (DR4 element, −384 to −399). This response was seen with both LXRα and LXRβ, related nuclear hormone receptors that bind and are activated by specific hydroxylated sterols at physiological concentrations (5Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 6Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). LXRα also transactivates the Cyp7a gene, encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway converting cholesterol to bile acids (7Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B.

Furthermore, disruption ofLXRα in mice abolished the induction of Cyp7aexpression by dietary cholesterol (8Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M."

However, at present Vitreoscillahemoglobin (VHb)1 remains the most studied of these bacterial hemoglobins, including its potential use in biotechnological applications. The cellular concentration of VHb in Vitreoscilla increases roughly two orders of magnitude (to about 50 nmol heme/g wet weight) when the oxygen concentration of its growth medium falls to a microaerobic level (7Boerman S.J. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1982; 28: 35-43Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Enhanced biosynthesis of VHb is mediated at the transcriptional level by an oxygen-sensitive promoter that turns on under hypoxic conditions (below ∼10% of air saturation) in both its native and recombinant host,Escherichia coli (8Dikshit K.L. Spaulding D. Braun A. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2601-2609PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A.

The presence of a relatively large cellular concentration of VHb under oxygen-limiting conditions suggests that its primary function is to trap molecular oxygen and facilitate its transfer to the respiratory apparatus to enableVitreoscilla to survive under these conditions despite its being a strict aerobe.It has been demonstrated through genetic engineering that the intracellular expression of VHb in various heterologous hosts often results in the enhancement of cell density, oxidative metabolism, engineered product formation, and bioremediation, especially under oxygen-limiting conditions. Some examples of the in vivoeffects of VHb include (i) increased cell density in recombinantE. coli and Pseudomonads (9Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A.

Wei M.L. Stark B.C. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 101-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene degradation by Burkholderia (18Patel S. Stark B.C. Hwang K.W. Dikshit K.L. Webster D.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies conducted so far on biosynthesis, functional characteristics, and genetic regulation of VHb suggest two possible working models to account for the mechanism of VHb action. The first one, called the facilitated diffusion hypothesis (19Wittenberg J.A. Bergensen F.J. Appleby C.A. Turner G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4057-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implies that the presence of VHb enhances the oxygen flux to one or both of the terminal oxidases (cytochromes boand bd) under hypoxic conditions. This is supported by the fact that the respiratory activity and ATP production increased in anE. coli strain that contained VHb relative to a control strain lacking VHb (20Kallio P.T. Kim D.J. Tsai P.S. Bailey J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The oxygen-binding properties of VHb are presumed to contribute to its postulated function; it has a relatively normal association rate constant (k on) for oxygen binding, thus showing a relatively high “avidity” for oxygen, but its rate constant for oxygen dissociation (k off) is unusually large (21Orii Y. Webster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3544-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively large static equilibrium dissociation constant, K d , which differs 10-fold from the one determined kinetically (22Webster D.A. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1987; 7: 245-265Google Scholar), is 6 μm (equivalent to P 50 = 3.3 mm). These oxygen-binding characteristics are consistent with its putative role of sequestering oxygen from the environment and feeding it to the respiratory terminal oxidases. A possible alternative mechanism of action of VHb may be that oxy-VHb influences the activity of some key redox-sensitive component of the cell, which could be a sensor, a regulator, or even an allosteric site of a respiratory enzyme. Such an influence could in turn be transduced into an increase in the efficiency of energy conservation. There is also the possibility that VHb has a totally different function or more than one function. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the related flavohemoglobin from E. coli is a nitric-oxide dioxygenase that dioxygenates nitric oxide to form nitrate (23Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Satzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) to protect the cell from this free radical that can be generated by oxidation-reduction systems including the respiratory chain.The proposed function of VHb as an oxygen carrier suggests that close proximity to the respiratory membrane would enable it to perform its cellular function most efficiently. It was reported previously that ∼40% of the VHb expressed in E. coli is found in the periplasmic space (24Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This result was based on the isolation of periplasmic VHb protein from the recombinant E. coli by lysozyme osmotic shock treatment. Further, aphoA-VHb fusion study indicated that the N terminus of VHb may have a transport function. These observations supported the function of VHb as a facilitator of oxygen transfer by placing it closest to the environmental source of oxygen. However, the N-terminal sequence of VHb is not a typical export signal sequence, and it is known that recombinant protein that is overexpressed in E. coli often ends up in the periplasm or inclusion bodies or is even secreted from the cell (25Hockney R.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the localization of oxy-VHb near the respiratory apparatus would be preferable if VHb facilitates oxygen delivery by generating sufficient oxygen flux and directly interacting with the respiratory apparatus of the cell. In the homologous mitochondrial protein, cytochrome-c oxidase, the oxygen-reactive sites are oriented in the membrane on the cytoplasmic side (26Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Thus, a specific cellular location for VHb may be required for the optimal performance of its cellular function. Because the periplasmic localization of VHb was determined through indirect experimental observations and could be an artifact, we reexamined the question of the cellular localization of VHb by determining the location of VHb inside the cell through electron microscopy. This led to a derivative study of the membrane binding properties of VHb. This paper shows that the location of VHb in Vitreoscilla and recombinant E. coli is cytoplasmic and concentrated adjacent to the cell membrane, and evidence is provided that because of its membrane association properties, it may perform its cellular function by interacting directly with the respiratory apparatus of the cell.DISCUSSIONA model for studying oxygen transfer to living cells is theVitreoscilla-VHb system, the VHb being synthesized when environmental oxygen becomes limiting. How the presence of VHb enables the bacterium to grow better under oxygen limitation is not conclusively known, but knowledge of its subcellular localization is vital to understanding its function. The ultrastructural studies described here have established the cytoplasmic location of hemoglobin, both in Vitreoscilla and recombinant E. colioverexpressing VHb. Although cells grown under low oxygen synthesize large amounts of VHb in E. coli, little VHb-specific signal was detected in the periplasm, a result in contrast to a previous study, which indicated that ∼40% of the VHb in E. coliwas located in the periplasmic space (24Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It might seem that a periplasmic location would have the advantage of locating the VHb closest to the source of environmental oxygen. However, the accumulation of large amounts of oxy-Hb in the relatively small volume of the periplasm may change the redox environment of the periplasm, which may not be favorable to the cell. On the other hand, the presence of VHb in the cytosol may provide an oxygen buffer, and its subcellular localization in close proximity to the cell membrane could facilitate oxygen transfer to the oxygen-binding sites of the terminal oxidases that are oriented toward the cytoplasm (26Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 38Riistama S. Puustinen A. Garcia-Horsman A. Iwata S. Michel H. Wikstrom M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, a cytoplasmic localization of VHb in the proximity of respiratory membranes, as demonstrated in the present study, is consistent with its proposed function to feed molecular oxygen to the respiring membranes under oxygen limitation.Although the detection of VHb in the periplasmic fraction in the 1989 study (24Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) could have been an experimental artifact of VHb leakage through the membranes during osmotic shock, it is more likely the result of overproduction and extrusion of the VHb, because the extrusion of overproduced cytoplasmic recombinant proteins into the periplasmic space has often been observed (25Hockney R.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 456-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Generally, true periplasmic proteins are compartmentalized in the periplasmic space and not divided between there and the cytoplasm. In the work reported here, virtually no VHb was detected in the periplasmic space, but VHb leakage from recombinant E. coli has occasionally been observed while washing harvested cells with buffer. 2D. A. Webster, unpublished observations. The extrusion of VHb could be a function of growth medium, growth phase, physiological state of the cells, the strain of E. coli bearing thevgb, other genetic determinants, etc.Based on the finding of VHb in the periplasmic space, it was proposed (24Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that the first 16 N-terminal residues of VHb may be an export signal, but this N-terminal sequence does not conform to the usual signal-peptide characteristics, and it was not excised during transport; further, unlike most transport signals, it is important for the protein function. The first 16 residues of VHb are an integral part of the A-helix structure (39Tarricone C. Galizzi A. Coda P. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Structure. 1997; 5: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and a VHb mutant lacking the first 14 N-terminal residues is incapable of binding heme. 3K. L. Dikshit, unpublished observations. In the present study, VHb was determined to have a cytosolic location, raising the question of whether VHb can be transported into the periplasmic space and whether a periplasmic location is in any way superior to a cytoplasmic localization. The OmpA-VHb fusion study clearly suggested that there is no hindrance to the transport of VHb across the membrane by the structure or folding of the protein per se, because ∼50% of the peptide-VHb fusion protein was localized in the periplasm. This enhanced periplasmic localization did not provide any distinct advantage over the cytoplasmic accumulation of VHb under oxygen-limited growth conditions. However, the lack of an effect could be caused by the accumulation of nonfunctional apoprotein in the periplasmic space, which has been observed for E. coli flavohemoglobin (40Vasudevan S.G. Tang P. Dixon N.E. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 219-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).If the primary function of VHb is to trap and feed oxygen to the membrane-bound terminal oxidases, it may actually associate with the cellular membrane to facilitate this process. Initial evidence for this association was the observation that the respiratory membranes of lysedVitreoscilla cells retained significant amounts of VHb, and extensive washing of the membrane fragments was required to remove it (35Georgiou C.D. Webster D.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The study of VHb binding to bacterial membranes in the present work found K d values that were in the micromolar range, 5.4–6.5 μm (Table IV), which were 4.2–8.3 and 4.1–8.6 times greater than the affinities of the control equine globins for Vitreoscilla and E. coli membranes, respectively. Assuming a value of 50 nmol of VHb heme/g wet weight of bacterial cells (7Boerman S.J. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1982; 28: 35-43Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Dikshit K.L. Spaulding D. Braun A. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2601-2609PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4149-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it can be estimated that there will be about 15,000 molecules of dimeric VHb per bacterial cell. From theN value of 7 nmol of binding sites/mg of membrane protein, it can be estimated that there are roughly four times as many VHb binding sites (69,000) in the membrane of a single bacterial cell as there are VHb molecules in the cell. For a K d of 6 μm, this would indicate that most of the VHb would be bound (94%). For comparison, the K d for human Hb binding to human red blood cell membranes is 1.0 × 10−4 m, which was considered physiologically significant (41Fung L.W.-M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity of VHb for bacterial membranes is likely to be important physiologically and is very probably the reason for the subcellular localization of VHb adjacent to the cellular membrane.The binding of VHb could involve interactions of residues with membrane lipids and/or specific membrane proteins. In the globin domains of flavohemoglobins, which are structurally similar to VHb, Lys-11 is generally conserved (39Tarricone C. Galizzi A. Coda P. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Structure. 1997; 5: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, a hydrophobic N terminus carrying a positively charged residue (Lys-11 in VHb) could play a role in the interaction of VHb with the membrane. Lys-11 is an obvious target for site-directed mutagenesis to test whether it plays any role in the membrane interactions of VHb. Whatever the mechanism by which VHb associates with membranes, binding studies with proteoliposomes implicated an interaction with a specific protein, the cytochrome-bo terminal oxidase. When this protein was incorporated into liposomes, the affinity for VHb increased 2.4 times relative to the control liposomes without the cytochrome, and the number of binding sites for VHb increased 6.1-fold to 0.21 nmol/μmol of liposomal phospholipid phosphate. Using this latter value and assuming a molecular mass of 700 daltons for a phospholipid molecule, there are 4,760 molecules of phospholipid for each binding site. Because the proteoliposomes were made using a cytochromebo/phospholipid ratio of 1:150 (weight/weight), there will be ∼1 cytochrome bo incorporated for every 2,240 phospholipid molecules, about twice as many protein molecules as binding sites. Although these estimates may be fortuitous, previous work has indicated that the cytochrome bo in these proteoliposomes is randomly oriented, i.e. 50% in the inside-out and 50% in the outside-in orientation (33Park C. Moon J.Y. Cokic P. Webster D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, there may be preferential binding to one side of the cytochrome. Although the binding experiment with inverted membrane vesicles (Table IV) was inconclusive, VHb did stimulate the ubiquinol-1 respiratory activity of inverted membrane vesicles significantly more than that of periplasmic side-out membranes (Figs. 7 and 8), suggesting a preference for cytosolic side binding.Although the results of this report are consistent with the proposed role of VHb being to facilitate oxygen transfer to the terminal respiratory apparatus under hypoxic conditions and increase respiratory efficiency, they do not exclude other possible functions for this protein. For example, there is evidence that it can function as a terminal oxidase under some conditions (42Dikshit R.P. Dikshit K.L. Liu Y. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The related flavohemoglobin from E. coli has been demonstrated to be a nitric-oxide dioxygenase that dioxygenates this free radical to form nitrate (23Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Satzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This enzyme is inducible under oxygen-limiting conditions and protects the cell from the nitric oxide, which can be generated by the respiratory chain and other oxidation-reduction systems, probably more so under the more reducing conditions of hypoxia. Whether VHb (in conjunction with its flavoprotein metVHb reductase) has a similar role remains to be tested. In the years following the discovery of hemoglobin in the Gram-negative bacterium Vitreoscilla in 1986 (1Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Webster D.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), other hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins have been found in a variety of microbes, indicating the widespread occurrence of Hb-like proteins in the microbial world (2Andrew S.C.

Urushihara H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, at present Vitreoscillahemoglobin (VHb)1 remains the most studied of these bacterial hemoglobins, including its potential use in biotechnological applications. The cellular concentration of VHb in Vitreoscilla increases roughly two orders of magnitude (to about 50 nmol heme/g wet weight) when the oxygen concentration of its growth medium falls to a microaerobic level (7Boerman S.J. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1982; 28: 35-43Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Enhanced biosynthesis of VHb is mediated at the transcriptional level by an oxygen-sensitive promoter that turns on under hypoxic conditions (below ∼10% of air saturation) in both its native and recombinant host,Escherichia coli (8Dikshit K.L. Spaulding D. Braun A. Webster D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 2601-2609PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A.

The presence of a relatively large cellular concentration of VHb under oxygen-limiting conditions suggests that its primary function is to trap molecular oxygen and facilitate its transfer to the respiratory apparatus to enableVitreoscilla to survive under these conditions despite its being a strict aerobe. It has been demonstrated through genetic engineering that the intracellular expression of VHb in various heterologous hosts often results in the enhancement of cell density, oxidative metabolism, engineered product formation, and bioremediation, especially under oxygen-limiting conditions. Some examples of the in vivoeffects of VHb include (i) increased cell density in recombinantE. coli and Pseudomonads (9Dikshit K.L. Dikshit R.P. Webster D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4149-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Khosla C. Bailey J.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 13Khosla C.

Biotechnol. 1995; 44: 419-424Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), (ii) increased production of α-amylase in E. coli (15Khosravi M. Webster D.A. Stark B.C. Plasmid. 1990; 24: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and cephalosporin C in Acremonium chrysogenum (16DeModena J.A. Gutierrez S. Velasco J. Fernandez F.J. Fachini R.A. Galazzo J.L. Hughes D.E. Martin J.F. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and (iii) enhanced degradation of toxic wastes such as benzoic acid degradation by Pseudomonads (17Liu S.C. Webster D.A. Wei M.L. Stark B.C. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 101-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene degradation by Burkholderia (18Patel S. Stark B.C. Hwang K.W. Dikshit K.L. Webster D.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies conducted so far on biosynthesis, functional characteristics, and genetic regulation of VHb suggest two possible working models to account for the mechanism of VHb action. The first one, called the facilitated diffusion hypothesis (19Wittenberg J.A. Bergensen F.J. Appleby C.A. Turner G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4057-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implies that the presence of VHb enhances the oxygen flux to one or both of the terminal oxidases (cytochromes boand bd) under hypoxic conditions. This is supported by the fact that the respiratory activity and ATP production increased in anE. coli strain that contained VHb relative to a control strain lacking VHb (20Kallio P.T. Kim D.J. Tsai P.S. Bailey J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The oxygen-binding properties of VHb are presumed to contribute to its postulated function; it has a relatively normal association rate constant (k on) for oxygen binding, thus showing a relatively high “avidity” for oxygen, but its rate constant for oxygen dissociation (k off) is unusually large (21Orii Y. Webster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3544-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively large static equilibrium dissociation constant, K d , which differs 10-fold from the one determined kinetically (22Webster D.A. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1987; 7: 245-265Google Scholar), is 6 μm (equivalent to P 50 = 3.3 mm). These oxygen-binding characteristics are consistent with its putative role of sequestering oxygen from the environment and feeding it to the respiratory terminal oxidases. A possible alternative mechanism of action of VHb may be that oxy-VHb influences the activity of some key redox-sensitive component of the cell, which could be a sensor, a regulator, or even an allosteric site of a respiratory enzyme. Such an influence could in turn be transduced into an increase in the efficiency of energy conservation. There is also the possibility that VHb has a totally different function or more than one function. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that the related flavohemoglobin from E. coli is a nitric-oxide dioxygenase that dioxygenates nitric oxide to form nitrate (23Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Satzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) to protect the cell from this free radical that can be generated by oxidation-reduction systems including the respiratory chain. The proposed function of VHb as an oxygen carrier suggests that close proximity to the respiratory membrane would enable it to perform its cellular function most efficiently. It was reported previously that ∼40% of the VHb expressed in E. coli is found in the periplasmic space (24Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol.

G1 arrest induced by vitamin D3 or vitamin D3 analogues has been attributed to a number of molecular changes, including induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p21Waf1 and p27Kip1, inhibition of cdk2 activity, hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and suppression of E2F activation (4Zhuang S.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, vitamin D3-induced apoptosis in these cell lines is blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 (27Blutt S. McDonnell T. Polek T. Weigel N. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Mathiasen I. Lademann U. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results suggest a possible role for Bcl-2 down-regulation in vitamin D3-induced apoptosis, it is not clear whether reduction of Bcl-2 expression is sufficient of itself to induce apoptosis. In addition, vitamin D3-induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells is not dependent on Bcl-2 down-regulation but is more tightly associated with up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bak (5Diaz G. Paraskeva C. Thomas M. Binderup L. Hague A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar). Another body of work suggests that vitamin D3 induces insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, which bind to insulin-like growth factor-1, preventing it from stimulating the pro-survival insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, and thereby promote apoptosis (30Rozen F. Pollak M. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 589-594PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xie S. Pirianov G. Colston K. Eur. J.

Finally, Mathiasen et al. (29Mathiasen I. Lademann U. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to vitamin D3-induced apoptosis does not depend on expression of a functional p53 tumor suppressor protein and does not involve the activation of known caspases. Thus far, the involvement of stress and survival signal transduction pathways in the mechanism of vitamin D3-induced apoptosis has not been carefully examined. The integration of multiple signals from numerous transduction pathways plays a critical role in regulating cell survival and execution of programmed cell death (reviewed in Refs. 33Jarpe M.

When the integrated signals from these pathways begin to favor apoptosis, caspases can become activated, resulting in the selective cleavage of a distinct set of proteins and greatly enhancing the potential toward commitment to apoptosis. Although cleavage of target proteins by caspases typically results in their inactivation, exceptions to this include the caspases themselves as well as two stress-signaling proteins, MEKK-1 and PAK2 (46Cardone M. Salvesen G. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 47Rudel T. Bokoch G. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). MEKK-1 is a 196-kDa Ser/Thr kinase, which, upon phosphorylation, becomes activated and transduces stress signals that lead to the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK (48Xu S. Robbins D. Christerson L. English J. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thereby promoting apoptosis. Upon treatment of cells with genotoxic agents (e.g. etoposide or UV-C irradiation), MEKK-1 initially undergoes phosphorylation-dependent activation and is subsequently cleaved by caspase-3, releasing the N-terminal regulatory domain and producing a constitutively active C-terminal kinase domain (49Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Similarly, MEKK-1 cleavage is also observed in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by Fas ligation (50Deak J. Cross J. Lewis M. Qian Y. Parrott L. Distelhorst C. Templeton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5595-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and by detachment from the extracellular matrix (anoikis) (46Cardone M. Salvesen G. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells expressing a non-cleavable MEKK-1 mutant are impaired in their ability to undergo apoptosis after treatment with DNA-damaging agents (although mutant MEKK-1 is still phosphorylated) (49Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, MEKK-1 cleavage is not only a common biological event observed during apoptosis induced by a variety of agents but appears to play a necessary role in the execution of the apoptotic program. Caspase-mediated cleavage of PAK2, a Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cytoskeletal changes in many cell types, also appears to play a role in the apoptotic process (47Rudel T. Bokoch G. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). We have investigated the mechanism by which vitamin D3induces apoptosis in SCC cells, particularly with respect to its effects on survival and stress signaling pathways. We report here that vitamin D3 induces the caspase-dependent cleavage of MEK, not previously described, resulting in nearly complete loss of MEK expression and ERK1/2 signaling. Moreover, Akt signaling is potently inhibited in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by vitamin D3. Furthermore, vitamin D3 strongly induces MEKK-1 expression in cells prior to onset of apoptosis and subsequently promotes N-terminal proteolysis such that numerous MEKK-1 fragments are observed in the apoptotic cells. Finally, direct comparison of vitamin D3 with genotoxic agents revealed that the molecular events described above, with the exception of Akt inhibition, were selective for vitamin D3. Murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells (either 3 × 105 or 6 × 105 cells/T-75 flask) were plated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12% fetal bovine serum (FBS), unless otherwise noted (see Fig. 2 below). After 1 or 2 days, the cells were treated at sub-confluence with either vehicle (<0.001% ethanol, EtOH), 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-D3), 1 µg/ml cisplatin, or 10 µm etoposide. After 2 days of treatment, medium in the flasks was gently swirled to suspend floating (apoptotic) cells, which were then harvested by centrifugation, and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Attached (non-apoptotic) cells were rinsed once with PBS and either scraped off the flask surface into PBS and placed in a separate tube (for Western blotting) or trypsinized, suspended in PBS, and combined with the floating cells (for YO-PRO-1 staining). For experiments assessing the role of caspases in vitamin D3-induced MEK cleavage, cells were treated with either vehicle or 10 nm vitamin D3 in the presence or the absence of either 20 µm Z-DEVD-FMK or 20 µm Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK and the cells were harvested, as described above. Both attached and floating cell populations were then lysed in buffer containing the following: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm vanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 12 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 10 nm okadaic acid. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and aliquots were incubated with an equivalent volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for at least 4 min at 100 °C. Equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were electrophoresed on either 7.5% SDS-PAGE (for PARP and MEKK-1) or 12.5% SDS-PAGE (for all other antibodies) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and then probed with either anti-PARP (PharMingen, 65196E), anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (New England BioLabs, 9121S), anti-MEK1/2 (New England BioLabs, 9122), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz, sc-7383), anti-ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-182), anti-phospho-Akt (New England BioLabs, 9271), anti-Akt (New England BioLabs, 9272) anti-MEKK-1 (Santa Cruz, sc-252), anti-SEK1 (Santa Cruz, sc-964), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (New England BioLabs, 9211), anti-p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz, sc-535), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz, sc-822), or anti-actin (Oncogene, CP01) in 3% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS. Anti-phospho-MEK, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-Akt, and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibodies selectively detect MEK phosphorylated at serines 217 and 221, ERK1/2 phosphorylated at tyrosine 204, Akt phosphorylated at serine 473, and p38 MAPK phosphorylated at threonine 180 and tyrosine 182, respectively, sites of phosphorylation necessary for full activation of these kinases. The immunogen used to generate the anti-MEKK-1 antibody (sc-252) was a 22-amino acid peptide, the sequence of which corresponded to a region lying within the last 50 amino acids of the rat MEKK-1 C terminus (identical in sequence to that region found in the mouse MEKK-1 C terminus). Positive antibody reactions were visualized using an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (for PARP immunoblotting, ECL SuperSignal (Pierce) was used). It is important to note that, although both the anti-phospho-MEK and anti-MEK antibodies recognized both MEK isoenzymes (MEK1 and MEK2), these two proteins were typically not completely resolved under the electrophoresis conditions used for this work. Both proteins, however, appeared to behave in a similar manner in response to the various treatment conditions described above. Therefore, in this report, we have represented both of the isoenzymes together by denoting them as “MEK” in the text and in the figures. As described above, at the time of harvest, floating cells were first removed with the medium and placed in a conical tube; attached cells were rinsed once, trypsinized, suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 12% FBS, and combined with the floating cells. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 1.0–1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured using the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay Kit #4 (Molecular Probes). According to the manufacturer's instructions, 1.0 µl each of YO-PRO-1 dye and propidium iodide solutions was added to 1.0-ml aliquots of suspended cells, allowed to incubate for at least 20 min, and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. We have reported previously that vitamin D3 predominantly induces murine SCC cells to undergo cytoplasmic spreading (flattening) and become growth-arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle (19McElwain M. Dettlebach M. Modzelewski R. Russell D. Uskokovic M. Smith D. Trump D. Johnson C. Mol. Cell. Diff. 1995; 3: 31-50Google Scholar, 51Light B., Yu, W.-D. McElwain M. Russell D. Trump D. Johnson C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3759-3764PubMed Google Scholar). However, a significant population of cells is also observed detached and floating in the culture medium after vitamin D3 treatment and possibly represents apoptotic cells. To determine whether this population of cells exhibits characteristics of apoptosis, SCC cells were treated with vitamin D3 (10 nm) for 2 days and assessed for apoptosis by various criteria. As shown in Fig.1 A, vitamin D3induced a fraction of the cells to remain attached and to spread out while another fraction became detached and exhibited cellular condensation and membrane blebbing, characteristics of cells undergoing apoptosis. The cells were then harvested, stained with propidium iodide and YO-PRO-1, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. YO-PRO-1 is a fluorescent dye taken up by cells in early and late apoptosis (as well as necrotic cells). Based on this type of analysis, vitamin D3 increased the proportion of cells in early apoptosis (0.2–11%) and the total number of cells in apoptosis/necrosis (14–40%) (the average induction of total apoptotic/necrotic cells from four independent experiments was from 13 to 36%, or 2.8-fold) (Fig. 1 B). Although flow cytometry detected significant basal levels of apoptosis in vehicle-treated cultures, no apoptosis could be detected in these cultures using the other two methods employed (morphological changes and caspase activation (see below)). Thus, it appears that the basal level of apoptosis in vehicle-treated cultures is artifactual and probably due to the trypsinization procedure used to prepare the cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Finally, we assessed induction of apoptosis by vitamin D3 on the molecular level by examining caspase activation (i.e. by measuring the extent of cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP). After treating SCC cells as described above, the floating cells were removed from the attached cells, and lysates of both cell populations were prepared (described under “Experimental Procedures”). The number of floating cells in the medium after vehicle treatment was low, and it was not possible to collect sufficient amounts to process for immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 C (lanes 1–2), lysates of vehicle-treated (attached) cells, as well as the attached cell population of vitamin D3-treated cultures, exhibited no PARP cleavage. However, lysates of floating cells from cultures treated with vitamin D3 demonstrated complete cleavage of PARP (116 kDa) to an 85-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). Taken together, these results indicate that vitamin D3induces programmed cell death in SCC cells. The fact that PARP cleavage was exclusively observed in lysates from vitamin D3-treated, non-attached cells and that this population is easily isolated from the attached cell population affords the use of this model for investigating at the molecular level the role of signaling pathways in vitamin D3-induced apoptosis. The Ras-Raf1-MEK-ERK signaling pathway transduces signals from growth factor receptors to the nucleus, which can lead not only to mitogenesis and differentiation but also to survival (34Dent P. Jarvis W. Birrer M. Fisher P. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Grant S. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1843-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Some investigators studying vitamin D3-induced apoptosis have reported that culturing cells under serum-free conditions enhances the apoptosis-promoting activity of vitamin D3 (31Xie S. Pirianov G. Colston K. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1717-1723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, growth factor signaling may attenuate the apoptotic signal induced by vitamin D3, or, conversely, vitamin D3 may attenuate growth factor signaling as part of its mechanism to promote programmed cell death. We investigated the effects of vitamin D3 on levels of activated MEK, a key mediator of signaling through the Ras-Raf1-MEK-ERK pathway, in SCC cells cultured in the presence or the absence of 12% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Significant apoptosis (based on morphology) was observed under both culture conditions, but levels of apoptosis were greater under serum-starved conditions (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho-MEK antibody that selectively detects activated MEK (described under “Experimental Procedures”) was then performed on lysates prepared from attached and non-attached cells. As shown in Fig. 2, vitamin D3 nearly completely inhibited MEK activation in the floating population of cells in the presence or the absence of serum but had little effect on MEK phosphorylation in the attached populations from either vehicle- or vitamin D3-treated cultures. Results from immunoblotting with an anti-MEK antibody demonstrated that the vitamin D3-induced decrease in MEK phosphorylation was not simply due to inhibition of its activation but to down-regulation of MEK protein itself (Fig. 2). This result was confirmed using two other anti-MEK antibodies, which recognized distinct regions of the MEK protein (data not shown). Interestingly, the apoptotic, floating cells exhibited a lower molecular weight band that was also immunoreactive with the anti-MEK antibody (33 kDa in the presence of serum; 28 kDa in the absence of serum; Fig. 2 A), suggesting that down-regulation of MEK protein levels might be due to MEK proteolysis. Levels of phosphorylated/activated ERK1/2 were then analyzed and found to be virtually undetectable in the lysates of the floating cells (Fig.2), indicating that the MEK-ERK signaling pathway is blocked in these cells. It is perhaps noteworthy that vitamin D3 also modestly inhibited ERK1/2 in vitamin D3-treated attached cells (Fig. 2) despite the fact that levels of phosphorylated MEK and intact MEK protein were unaffected (Fig. 2). The molecular basis of vitamin D3-induced ERK1/2 inhibition in attached cells is currently under investigation. ERK1/2 expression was unaltered in lysates of vitamin D3-treated attached cells, and, in contrast to MEK, was only slightly reduced in floating cells (Fig. 2). Reduction of ERK1/2 expression was more apparent under serum-starved conditions and was coincident with the appearance of a putative 23-kDa fragment (Fig. 2). Because culturing cells in the presence of serum is more phys"

The last three constitute the xanthophyll cycle, which has been suggested to participate in the process of dissipation of excess excitation energy, giving rise to nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching (1Demmig-Adams B.

LHA consists of a number of pigment-protein complexes accommodating different types and amounts of xanthophylls (5Peter G.F. Thornber P. J. Biol.

The major and most characterized LHA complex, the trimeric LHCIIb, binds 2 luteins, 1 neoxanthin, and between 0.1 and 1 violaxanthin per monomer (7Sandora D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The amount of bound violaxanthin was found to depend on the treatment during purification (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as well as on plant growth conditions (10Verhoeven A.S. Adams W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiology. 1999; 120: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The two luteins of LHCIIb are thought to correspond to the two carotenoid molecules located near the transmembrane helixes A and B in the inner core of the complex (11Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 130-135Crossref Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), thus being tightly associated with it and probably having a structural role. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have suggested that neoxanthin is associated with helix C (12Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Neoxanthin was found to have the highest affinity of binding to the complex (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding affinity of violaxanthin to the complex is the lowest, and it can be easily removed by various treatments. This biochemical work has therefore established that a large population of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids is peripherally bound to LHA complexes.The structure of the minor PSII antenna complexes as well as all LHCI complexes is not known; therefore, it is not clear where xanthophyll molecules are bound to them, what the nature of this binding is, or what the carotenoid configuration is involved. The data on xanthophyll stoichiometry in the minor PSII antenna are controversial (4Lee A.L. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 85: 495-502Google Scholar, 6Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and may well again reflect natural variation of xanthophyll ratios. However, it is clear that unlike LHCIIb, the minor antenna PSII complexes, CP24, CP26, and particularly CP29, contain at least one strongly bound xanthophyll cycle carotenoid. The efficiency of violaxanthin de-epoxidation—a prerequisite for the photoprotective energy dissipation state in thylakoid—was found to be the reciprocal of the relative affinity of binding of this xanthophyll to various antenna components, suggesting that only loosely bound molecules are accessible to the violaxanthin de-epoxidase (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A similar tendency was observed for the PSI antenna, which contains at least 50% tightly bound violaxanthin that was not converted into zeaxanthin even under conditions favoring maximum de-epoxidation (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Farber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be argued that the “structural” violaxanthin molecules, which are strongly coordinated within the minor LHA complexes, do not play a role in the xanthophyll cycle.It is clear that new methodologies are needed to identify, locate, and analyze xanthophylls and their configuration and function in LHA complexes. One powerful approach has been to reconstitute light-harvesting complexes from Lhcb polypeptides and pigment mixtures of varying composition. Site-directed mutagenesis of these polypeptides has been used to determine the location and specificity of carotenoid binding sites (12Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The effects of carotenoid binding to peripheral sites in LHA complexes has allowed investigation of their role in energy dissipation (14Ruban A.V. Young A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Bioenerg. 1994; 1186: 123-127Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Ruban A.V.

Along with the development of these biochemical techniques there has been progress toward the development of instrumental methods to analyze antenna xanthophylls. Absorption, linear and circular dichroism, and triplet state spectroscopies have been applied to identify their electronic absorption bands and energy transfer pathways to and from chlorophyll molecules (18Peterman E.J.G.

However, it remains difficult to make unambiguous assignments for even simpler systems, such as those containing only three xanthophylls, and impossible to make reasonable spectral assignments in the Soret absorption region of whole thylakoid membranes. Recently, we have combined optical absorption spectroscopy with selective excitation resonance Raman spectroscopy in order to identify the absorption transitions of lutein and neoxanthin in LHCIIb trimers (23Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unlike previous work (18Peterman E.J.G. Gradinaru C.C. Calkoen F. Borst J.C. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12208-12215Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which used LHCIIb containing three types of carotenoids, we have prepared LHCII, which contained only lutein and neoxanthin, a more simple system. The characteristic Raman feature for neoxanthin and lutein, the ν1 maximum position, was identified and used to build the Raman excitation profiles for the isolated complex. This allowed not only an estimation of the energies for the three absorption bands (0-0, 0-1, and 0-2) but also an observation of the dynamics of carotenoid configuration upon oligomerization of the complex.The approaches mentioned above are susceptible to various artifacts and limitations, such as the removal of lipids and pigments by the detergents used in the isolation and reconstitution procedures and the resulting alteration in protein conformation, xanthophyll binding affinity, and xanthophyll environment. One way forward would be the isolation of a more integrated LHA, in which pigments are less perturbed by detergent treatment. For example, we have recently isolated an oligomeric LHCIIb-enriched antenna complex using very mild detergent treatment of PSII particles and unstacked thylakoid membranes (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and this preparation contained a higher proportion of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin. However, the most ideal approach would be to analyze carotenoid structure and dynamics in situ in intact thylakoid membranes.The aim of the work described in this paper is to further develop the new spectroscopic methodologies to analyze xanthophylls, and most importantly to make progress toward their application to more complex systems including the whole thylakoid membrane. This approach not only enables the determination of the electronic transitions of all xanthophylls in vivo but also allows monitoring of their conformational and configurational dynamics and binding within the native LHA. To achieve this aim, we have first undertaken a systematic search for the characteristic features of isolated carotenoids that are found in the photosynthetic membrane, in order to use them for constructing the resonance Raman profiles. This allowed absorption band assignments not only for xanthophylls of isolated antenna complexes but also violaxanthin and zeaxanthin of intact antennae in thylakoid membranes. We have obtained for the first time the resonance Raman spectra of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in vivo. It is concluded that zeaxanthin adopts a configuration that is likely to reflect its well defined binding within the antenna, rather than a free location in the membrane. This work establishes a new approach to the study of complex carotenoid-containing systems and offers a broad range of applications, from identification and assessment of xanthophyll configuration in reconstituted/isolated complexes to in vivoinvestigation of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids in order to establish their role in photoprotective mechanisms.MATERIALS AND METHODSCarotenoid samples were prepared as described in Ref. 24Phillip D.

LHCIIb was prepared from dark-adapted spinach leaves using isoelecrofocusing of PSII-enriched particles, as described in Ref. 8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. Purification of LHCIIb trimers and removal of violaxanthin was carried out on a sucrose gradient (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). LHCIIb monomers were prepared by phospholipase A2 treatment of LHCIIb trimers for 36 h in the presence of 20 mm of CaCl2 at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by purification on a sucrose gradient as described previously (9Ruban A.V.

Intact thylakoid membranes were obtained by the procedure described in Ref. 8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar. To induce maximum violaxanthin de-epoxidation, thylakoids were incubated at room temperature at a chlorophyll concentration of 200 μm for 2 h in a medium containing 5 mmd-isoascorbate, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm sodium citrate at pH 5.5 with or without 5 mm Mg2+.Absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary E5 double-beam scanning spectrophotometer; measurements at 4 K were performed using a helium bath cryostat (Utreks). Low temperature resonance Raman spectra were obtained in a helium flow cryostat (Air Liquide, Paris, France) using a Jobin-Yvon U1000 Raman spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled devices detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon, Paris, France) as described in Ref.25Sturgis J.N. Robert B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. Excitation was provided by Coherent Argon (Innova 100) and Krypton (Innova 90) lasers (at 457.9, 476.5, 496.5, 488.0, 501.7, and 514.5 nm and at 528.7 and 413.1 nm, respectively) and a Liconix helium-cadmium laser (at 441.6 nm). The choice of this wavelength range was determined by the absorption profiles of the xanthophylls used. Fig. 1 displays absorption spectra of the four major xanthophylls that have been studied. The number of laser excitation lines (indicated in Fig. 1 by dotted arrows) covers all of the 0-0 transitions and also part of the electron-vibrational bands (0-1 and 0-2). It is likely that carotenoid absorption maxima in vivo will be somewhat shifted from those in organic solvent. However, from previous experience with LHCIIb xanthophylls, we have found that pyridine provides an environment with polarizability (n = 1.5092) much closer to that of lipid and membrane protein environments than such commonly used solvents as n-hexane (n = 1.3750) or ethanol (1.3611). The amplitude of the resonance effect is proportional to the square of the absorption probability. This offers an efficient line-narrowing effect in the Raman excitation profiles compared with absorption spectra, and the increased selectivity makes it possible to resolve complex bandshapes.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have demonstrated a new approach to the characterization of higher plant xanthophylls using comparison of absorption band structure and resonance Raman excitation profiles. The approach proved to be an effective methodology for identification and monitoring of the molecular conformation and configuration of carotenoids both in isolated pigment-protein complexes and, most significantly, in intact thylakoid membranes. This method is based on the identification of a number of characteristic fingerprints in the resonance Raman spectrum for each carotenoid involved. Analysis of isolated LHCIIb monomers and trimers containing only two types of xanthophylls, lutein and neoxanthin, allowed the identification of their corresponding absorption bands and molecular configuration.In the monomeric state of LHCIIb, the configuration and environment of the two LHCIIb luteins are very similar, both absorbing at 495 nm. The broader full width at half maximum for the band at 495 nm in the monomer spectrum compared with that of the trimer (Fig. 4) may suggest that their maxima positions differ within this region and therefore that their environment is also slightly different. In the trimer there is a 510 nm band not found in the monomer; this band was assigned to a red-shifted lutein in the former. Its intensity was significantly reduced in the second derivative spectrum because of the much broader FWHM compared with the short wavelength form of the pigment. In the trimer, the 510 nm lutein undergoes significant twisting, as a result either of an influence of the protein or of interaction with the other pigments or lipids present. It is not clear from our data whether this lutein plays a specific role in, for example, stabilization of the trimer and/or photoprotection of chlorophylls. However, these large differences in environment of the two luteins are important from structural and spectroscopic viewpoints (11Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y.

B. 1997; 101: 1902-1909Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This approach has revealed the molecular dynamics of a bound xanthophyll as a function of the state of oligomerization of the complex, and this for the first time. These factors may (at least in part) be behind the existence of monomeric (minor antenna), trimeric (major LHCIIb), and oligomeric states of antenna proteins in vivo. In addition, the methodology described here could be also used in the investigation of the LHC reconstitution process, using various types of xanthophylls (33Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Paulsen H. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands1999: 123-135Google Scholar).The application of RR spectroscopy to thylakoid membranes has revealed important new information about the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids, zeaxanthin and violaxanthin. The physiological role of these carotenoids is unclear, as is their location in the thylakoid membrane. Indirect measurements (correlating nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching with de-epoxidation state) have suggested that xanthophyll cycle carotenoids may be completely free in the thylakoid membrane and can only move to a very small number of quenching centers in LHCII proteins upon ΔpH formation (35Gilmore A. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-205Crossref Google Scholar). Some data on isolated LHCII have suggested that only the minor LHCII can bind violaxathin and zeaxanthin tightly and that therefore these must be the functional proteins in nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching (36Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have suggested that all of these carotenoids are bound, mostly to peripheral sites on each of the proteins. The strongly associated violaxanthin molecules located within minor complexes were found to be inaccessible to the de-epoxidase enzyme and therefore unlikely to be involved in photoprotection (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Farber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have suggested that the peripheral violaxanthin and zeaxanthin molecules play the key role in photoprotective energy dissipation. In this study, we have been able to obtain the first data on the state of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids in the thylakoid membrane. The more structured RR spectrum for both violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the thylakoid membrane compared with those free in solution indicate that both of these carotenoids are in fact in well coordinated environments in the thylakoid membrane, almost certainly bound to protein and not free to move. Zeaxanthin appeared to be more distorted than violaxanthin. Indeed, the ν4region is more structured and intense for zeaxanthin than violaxanthin, suggesting that the former is in a tight association with the protein, consistent with estimations of binding affinities to LHCII proteins (9Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).Ultra-low temperature absoprtion spectroscopy has also revealed new information about these carotenoids. The zeaxanthin-minus-violaxanthin absorption spectrum of thylakoids had a complex structure. The heterogeneity within this spectrum suggested that violaxanthin exists in two different populations. This suggestion is consistent with the observation that violaxanthin was found to be differently bound to the minor and major LHCII and LHCI complexes. It is possible that one population corresponds to violaxanthin associated with the minor LHCII or LHCI, whereas the other is peripherally bound to LHCIIb. An alternative explanation is that the dual band structure of the difference spectrum zeaxanthin minus violaxanthin originates from excitonically coupled violaxanthin. In this case, the coupling energy (V) will be within 180 cm−1 taking into account the Davidov's splitting (E) of approximately 360 cm−1 (E = 2·V). In the case of a moderate transition dipole moment and a parallel orientation of two interacting violaxanthin molecules, they should be located within 0.5–0.7 nm of each other (37Davidov A.S. Theory of Molecular Excitons. McGraw-Hill, New York1962Google Scholar, 38Kenkre V.M. Knox R.S. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1974; 33: 803-806Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar).It is interesting to mention that acidification did not cause alteration in violaxanthin maximum positions, which one would anticipate in the case of ΔpH-induced detachment of violaxanthin from antenna to undergo de-epoxidation. Resonance Raman spectra were also found to be unaffected (data not shown). This indicates that acidification has no immediate effect on the state of violaxanthin.Clearly, the application of spectroscopic methods to the analysis of xanthophylls in isolated complexes and intact thylakoids provides a new approach to understanding the structure and dynamics of these molecules. In particular, the selectivity of the RR technique and its freedom from the artifacts and problems normally associated with absorption and fluorescence measurements on complex intact systems have provided new information about violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in vivo. In the future, we hope to apply a similar methodology to whole leaves.AcknowlegdementsWe acknowledge Dr. Denise Phillip and Prof. Andrew Young for a kind gift of carotenoid samples. The light-harvesting antenna (LHA)1 of higher plants binds five types of xanthophylls: lutein, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and antheraxanthin. The last three constitute the xanthophyll cycle, which has been suggested to participate in the process of dissipation of excess excitation energy, giving rise to nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching (1Demmig-Adams B.

Several important questions concerning these xanthophylls remain unanswered: why is there such a variety of xanthophyll types in antenna; what is the exact molecular mechanism of zeaxanthin action in nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching; where are xanthophylls located; and what is the nature of their interaction with the protein and other pigments? LHA consists of a number of pigment-protein complexes accommodating different types and amounts of xanthophylls (5Peter G.F. Thornber P. J. Biol.

An additional proposed role for DNA ligase I is sealing nicks generated during excision repair. Previous studies have shown that there is a physical interaction between DNA ligase I and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), another important component of DNA replication and repair. The results shown here indicate that human PCNA enhances the reaction rate of human DNA ligase I up to 5-fold. The stimulation is specific to DNA ligase I because T4 DNA ligase is not affected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that PCNA improves the binding of DNA ligase I to the ligation site. Increasing the DNA ligase I concentration leads to a reduction in PCNA stimulation, consistent with PCNA-directed improvement of DNA ligase I binding to its DNA substrate. Two experiments show that PCNA is required to encircle duplex DNA to enhance DNA ligase I activity. Biotin-streptavidin conjugations at the ends of a linear substrate inhibit PCNA stimulation. PCNA cannot enhance ligation on a circular substrate without the addition of replication factor C, which is the protein responsible for loading PCNA onto duplex DNA. These results show that PCNA is responsible for the stable association of DNA ligase I to nicked duplex DNA. DNA ligase I is responsible for joining Okazaki fragments during DNA replication.

These include flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1),1 proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and DNA ligase I. During lagging strand DNA synthesis, numerous initiator RNA primers must be removed. The resulting gaps are filled in and sealed by ligation to complete DNA synthesis. Two nucleases, Dna2 and FEN1, are responsible for excising the RNA primer (4Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell.

The preferred substrate contains a flap structure in which the RNA primer has been displaced to form a single-stranded tail (1Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol.

The flap structure probably arises as a result of displacement synthesis from an upstream Okazaki fragment by a complex of DNA polymerase δ and its accessory factors, PCNA and replication factor C (RFC) (14Mossi R.

Dna2 is thought to cleave beyond the RNA segment within the tail, and the remaining displaced DNA is removed by FEN1 (5Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

During the repair process, an abasic site is generated after removal of a damaged base by a DNA N-glycosylase. An apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease subsequently cleaves on the 5′-side of the abasic sugar to create a nick within the DNA. Similar to the removal of initiator RNA primers, synthesis by a DNA polymerase lifts the damaged residue and a few additional downstream nucleotides to form a flap. As during replication, this structure is removed endonucleolytically by FEN1 followed by ligation of the resulting nick by DNA ligase I (2Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S.

Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PCNA is a toroidal homotrimer that is assembled around double-stranded DNA to form a sliding clamp (23Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 24Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It has long been known to act as a processivity factor for DNA polymerases by tethering the polymerase to its template (25Bambara R.A. Jessee C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, PCNA also interacts with other replication proteins and appears to be responsible for recruiting these proteins to replication foci in vivo (26Cardoso M.C. Joseph C. Rahn H.P. Reusch R.

Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2036-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 13Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between the PCNA toroid and FEN1 enhances the binding stability of FEN1 to cleavage sites (13Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this way, PCNA serves to clamp FEN1 to its substrate in much the same way as this protein clamps DNA polymerases to sites of DNA synthesis. The ability of PCNA to enhance cleavage by FEN1 leads to more efficient DNA replication and base excision repair. A physical interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I has also been identified (27Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E.

DNA ligases have essential roles in many important cellular pathways including DNA replication, recombination, and repair (34Tomkinson A.E. Levin D.S. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Of the four DNA ligases in mammalian cells, DNA ligase I has been linked to DNA replication (36Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and base excision repair (37Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This ligase has been identified as a component of a high molecular weight replication complex (38Li C. Goodchild J. Baril E.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Wu Y. Hickey R. Lawlor K. Wills P., Yu, F. Ozer H. Starr R. Quan J.Y. Lee M. Malkas L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA ligase I has been shown to be responsible for a major part of ligation activity in proliferating cells (40Elder R.H. Rossignol J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6009-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 41Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 251-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 42Montecucco A.

Cytostaining experiments with antibodies against DNA ligase I revealed that the enzyme co-localizes in the nucleus with DNA polymerase α, implicating DNA ligase I in DNA replication (44Lasko D.D. Tomkinson A.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12618-12622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA ligase I mutant human cell line, 46BR, exhibits abnormal joining of Okazaki fragments (45Henderson L.M. Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Lehmann A.R. Broughton B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but the replication defect in extracts from this cell line can be complemented by the addition of DNA ligase I (49Mackenney V.J. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11550-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A recent study with the DNA ligase I mutant cell line 46BR.1G1 reveals that the interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I is integral to coordinating the ligation steps that complete long patch base excision repair (37Levin D.S. McKenna A.E. Motycka T.A. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These observations imply an important role for DNA ligase I in DNA replication and repair. Human DNA ligase I is comprised of a C-terminal catalytic domain and a hydrophilic N-terminal domain. Although the N-terminal region is dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro (50Tomkinson A.E. Lasko D.D. Daly G. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12611-12617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Prigent C. Lasko D.D. Kodama K. Woodgett J.R. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), this region is essential in vivo (52Petrini J.H. Xiao Y. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I is regulated by phosphorylation at the N-terminal region of the protein (28Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the nuclear localization site of the protein has been identified in the N-terminal domain (26Cardoso M.C. Joseph C. Rahn H.P. Reusch R. Nadal-Ginard B. Leonhardt H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 53Montecucco A. Savini E. Weighardt F. Rossi R. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5379-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and this region is also responsible for interaction with PCNA (27Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I has been characterized as a potential means by which DNA ligase I is recruited to a replication site. Because the interaction of PCNA with FEN1 improves the catalytic rate of the nuclease, we considered here whether the binding of PCNA to DNA ligase I also improves the efficiency of catalysis. In this report, we initiate an investigation of the consequences of the interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA using purified proteins in vitro. The advantage of this approach is that all of the observed changes in ligase function can be attributed exclusively to the presence of PCNA. Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or by Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Radionucleotide [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were from Roche Diagnostics. Casein kinase II was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein was obtained from Promega. Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were the best available commercial grade. Recombinant human DNA ligase I (19DeMott M.S. Zigman S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. Purified DNA ligase I was dialyzed into a storage buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 15% sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Purified PCNA was dialyzed into a storage buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Oligomer sequences are listed in Table I. The primer-template substrates were constructed as described in the figure legends. In all substrates, the 3′-end regions of the downstream primers share homology with the 5′-ends of their respective templates. Each upstream primer was annealed to the proper template to create a nick between the 3′-end of the upstream primer and the 5′-end of the downstream primer. Prior to annealing, the 5′-radiolabeled primers were generated utilizing [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated radionucleotides were removed with Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns. All radiolabeled primers were purified by gel isolation from a 15% polyacrylamide, 7m urea denaturing gel prior to annealing. Substrates were annealed by mixing 2 pmol of the respective downstream primer with 5 pmol of the corresponding template in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris base, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) to a final volume of 30 μl. The mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. A corresponding upstream primer (10 pmol) was subsequently added and annealed by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The circular substrate was generated by annealing the downstream primer (D2), the template (pBS(+)), and the upstream primer (U3) at a molar ratio of 1:2.5:5, respectively. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subsequently cooled to room temperature.Table IOligonucleotide sequences (5′–3′)Downstream primersD1(18-mer)GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGD2(30-mer)GCTCACAATTCCACACAACATACGAGCCGGD3(37-mer)ACTAACAGGCGTGAAACGGGCGAATTCGAGCTCGGTAUpstream primers1-aThe underlined nucleotide indicates a biotin modification.U1(25-mer)CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCU2(25-mer)CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCU3(30-mer)ATAGCTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCU4(38-mer)CCCAGTCACGTCGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTATemplates1-aThe underlined nucleotide indicates a biotin modification.T1(44-mer)GCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGT2(44-mer)GCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACGGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACCCTGGCGT3(61-mer)TCCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATT4(76-mer)GTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGCCCGTTTCACGCCTGTTAGTTAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGACGTGACTGGG1-a The underlined nucleotide indicates a biotin modification. Open table in a new tab The reactions containing the indicated amounts of substrate, DNA ligase I or T4 DNA ligase, and PCNA were performed in reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mmKCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, terminated with 20 μl of formamide dye (90% formamide (v/v) with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole), and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. After separation on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel, products were detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Phosphorylation of DNA ligase I was performed by incubating 10 fmol of DNA ligase I with 5 × 10−3 milliunits of casein kinase II at 30 °C for 10 min (0.1 mm ATP). For the biotin-streptavidin assay, the substrate was incubated with PCNA either before or after the addition of streptavidin. Conjugation of streptavidin (added in a 50-fold molar excess over substrate) to the biotinylated substrate was accomplished by placing the reactions at 4 °C for 10 min. These reactions contained 1 fmol of DNA ligase I. The reactions utilizing human RFC were performed in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. Reactions were performed in binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm ATP) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, products were separated on a 1% agarose, 0.5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (8.9 mm Tris base, 8.9 mm boric acid, and 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. The assays were performed at least in triplicate. We first examined whether the presence of PCNA influences catalysis by DNA ligase I (Fig.1 A). Lane 1 only contains PCNA, and lane 2 only contains DNA ligase I. Titration of PCNA into the reactions (lanes 3–7) results in a progressive stimulation of product formation. Because the only proteins in these reactions are DNA ligase I and PCNA, the observed enhancement of ligation activity must derive from PCNA. There is an approximate 5-fold enhancement of ligation activity at the highest concentration of PCNA. The addition of an unrelated protein, E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein, to the DNA ligase I reaction did not result in any stimulation of ligation activity (data not shown). All experiments were performed in excess bovine serum albumin. The presence of this added protein did not affect DNA ligase I activity (data not shown). It was also important to determine the specificity of the interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I. Stimulation of other ligases would imply that the mechanism is nonspecific and does not depend on contacts between the two proteins. Therefore, PCNA was titrated into a T4 DNA ligase reaction (Fig. 1 B). The results (lanes 3–7) show no additional accumulation of ligation product. This observation illustrates the specificity of the interaction between PCNA and DNA ligase I. Fig. 2 A shows a time course illustrating the activity of DNA ligase I in the absence and the presence of PCNA. A fixed concentration of PCNA was utilized as determined by the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A. The presence of PCNA caused a substantial stimulation of ligation activity throughout the time course. Fig. 2 B shows a second time course demonstrating stimulation of ligation with a substrate of different sequence and different length upstream and downstream primers than the substrate in Fig. 2 A. In both cases, the rate of ligation was enhanced 3–4-fold. PCNA enhances the binding of various proteins to their corresponding substrates (24Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Analysis of the interaction between PCNA and FEN1 reveals that PCNA enhances FEN1 binding stability, allowing for greater cleavage efficiency (13Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that PCNA stimulates DNA ligase I by a similar mechanism. We examined the effect of PCNA on DNA ligase I interaction with its substrate using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.3). Incubation of the substrate with a high concentration of DNA ligase I clearly results in the formation of a DNA-ligase complex (lane 7). Lane 7 of Fig. 3identifies the band corresponding to the DNA-ligase complex. Utilizing a lower concentration of DNA ligase I, the addition of progressively higher concentrations of PCNA increased the observed amount of the DNA-ligase complex (lanes 4–6). These results demonstrate that the binding of DNA ligase I to its substrate is enhanced by PCNA in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, incubation of the substrate with a high level of PCNA alone failed to result in the formation of a protein complex with DNA (lane 2). These results suggest that greater ligation efficiency is the result of higher affinity binding of the ligase to DNA, which is achieved through an interaction with PCNA. DNA ligase I is a substrate for casein kinase II (51Prigent C. Lasko D.D. Kodama K. Woodgett J.R. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2925-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of DNA ligase I possesses several putative phosphorylation sites. This region contains seven casein kinase II consensus sites, and two of these sites (Ser66 and Ser141) have properties that are optimal for casein kinase II phosphorylation (28Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At the end of the S phase of the cell cycle, DNA ligase I is thought to be phosphorylated by casein kinase II (28Rossi R. Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation does not inactivate DNA ligase I for catalysis, it prevents interaction of DNA ligase I with the DNA replication apparatus (24Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether phosphorylation of DNA ligase I affects PCNA stimulation of ligation activity. In Fig.4, the addition of PCNA to reactions with unphosphorylated DNA ligase I leads to enhanced formation of the product (lanes 3–4). Phosphorylation of DNA ligase I results in a slight reduction of catalytic activity (lane 6). This small reduction in activity is possibly a result of phosphorylation itself or of the presence of casein kinase II. Titration of PCNA into the reactions with phosphorylated DNA ligase I does not reveal any stimulat"
https://openalex.org/W2071456434,"Recent data revealed that DEK associates with splicing complexes through interactions mediated by serine/arginine-repeat proteins. However, the DEK protein has also been shown to change the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro. This could indicate that the DEK protein resides on cellular chromatin. To investigate the in vivo localization of DEK, we performed cell fractionation studies, immunolabeling, and micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis. Most of the DEK protein was found to be released by DNase treatment of nuclei, and only a small amount by treatment with RNase. Furthermore, micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation revealed that DEK co-sedimentates with oligonucleosomes, clearly demonstrating that DEK is associated with chromatin in vivo. Additional chromatin fractionation studies, based on the different accessibilities to micrococcal nuclease, showed that DEK is associated both with extended, genetically active and more densely organized, inactive chromatin. We found no significant change in the amount and localization of DEK in cells that synchronously traversed the cell cycle. In summary these data demonstrate that the major portion of DEK is associated with chromatin in vivo and suggest that it might play a role in chromatin architecture.

It has become widely accepted that modification of nucleosome structure is an important mechanism that regulates the accessibility of chromatin to DNA binding factors (1Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 2Peterson C.L. Logie C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the search for factors that change the structure of chromatin and the replicational activity of chromatin templates, we recently identified the proto-oncogene protein DEK as a candidate protein that changes the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro (3Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). DEK is a 43-kDa phosphoprotein that was first isolated as part of a fusion protein expressed in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemias with (t6;9) chromosomal translocations (4von Lindern M. Fornerod M. van Baal S. Jaegle M. de Wit T. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). DEK was later identified as an autoimmune antigen in patients with pauciarticular onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune diseases (5Szer I.S. Sierakowska H. Szer W. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 2136-2142PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dong X. Michelis M.A. Wang J. Bose R. DeLange T. Reeves W.H.

Immunol. 2000; 119: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, DEK has been reported to be a site-specific DNA binding factor, which recognizes a specific DNA element in the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer (8Fu G.K. Grosveld G. Markovitz D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that DEK associates with splicing complexes through interactions promoted by SR1 proteins. It was shown that DEK associates with mRNA in a splicing-dependent manner, indicating that it could function to coordinate splicing with subsequent steps in gene expression (9McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition DEK was found in a ∼335-kDa five-component complex at a conserved position 20–24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions (10Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Our recent experiments have identified DEK as a protein that induces alterations in the superhelical density of DNA in chromatin (3Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). The change in topology was only observed with chromatin but not with naked DNA and depends on the presence of histone H2A/H2B dimers. In addition we could show that DEK inhibits the replication efficiency of chromatin templates but not of naked DNA in vitro, demonstrating that DEK acts in a chromatin-specific manner. Association with chromatin has already been reported by Fornerod et al. (11Fornerod M. Boer J. van Baal S. Jaegle M. von Lindern M. Murti K.G. Davis D. Bonten J. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1739-1748PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that DEK is associated with condensed chromosomes during metaphase. Thus, DEK seems to be a factor with dual RNA and DNA binding properties. In order to elucidate the localization of DEK in the cell, we performed fractionation studies. We found that DEK is an abundant protein in the cell and is eluted from the nuclei with 250 mm salt. Treatment of nuclei with RNase released only ∼10% of the DEK protein, whereas DNase treatment released most of the DEK protein, indicating that most of DEK is associated with chromatin in vivo. Treatment of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation revealed that DEK is associated with oligonucleosomes. Chromatin fractionation studies demonstrated that DEK is more or less equally distributed on transcriptional active and inactive chromatin regions. The amount and localization of DEK does not change during the cell cycle. Human HeLa S3 cells were grown on plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block at the beginning of S phase and released into thymidine-free medium (12Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). S phase was determined by cell counting and by pulse-labeling with [3H]thymidine and mitosis by mitotic indexes exactly as described recently (Fig. 1) (12Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out according to standard procedures. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked in Rotiblock solution (Roth) and incubated with different antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for detection. The polyclonal DEK antibodies (raised against His-DEK) were kindly provided by Gerald Grosveld (St. Jude Hospital, Memphis, TN) and the anti-SR antibodies mAb NM4 were a gift from Benjamin Blencowe (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The MCM5 antibodies have been described (12Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times on the plate with ice cold hypotonic buffer A (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) and lysed by Dounce homogenization. After 15 min on ice, the cytosolic supernatant was separated from the nuclear pellet by centrifugation (5 min, 600 × g). Nuclei were resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 0.5% Nonident P40 (Nonidet P-40) and kept on ice for 15 min to lyse the nuclear envelope. Centrifugation separated the free nucleosolic proteins from the pelleted nuclei (5 min, 1000 × g). The pellet was extracted for 15 min on ice in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.3m sucrose) plus NaCl in concentrations from 0.1 to 0.45m to release structure-bound proteins. The final pellet was extracted in RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate). Proteins of each fraction were precipitated according to Wessel and Flügge (14Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Histone H1 was isolated from the individual fractions by perchloric acid extraction as described previously (15Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and visualized by silver staining. Nuclei were prepared as described above and finally washed in elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.3m sucrose) containing 100 mm NaCl. Nuclei (500 µg of DNA/ml) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 17 units of DNase I/100 µl of cell nuclei or 40 units of RNase/100 µl of cell nuclei; enzymes (Roche) were RNase- and DNase-free, respectively. The reaction was stopped on ice with 8 mm EDTA. Supernatant and pellet were separated by one centrifugation step. For micrococcal nuclease digestion, nuclei (500 µg of DNA/ml) were adjusted to 2 mm CaCl2 and digested with micrococcal nuclease with the concentration and time indicated under “Results.” The reaction was stopped on ice with 8 mm EDTA. Released chromatin fragments were separated from insoluble material by centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g, 4 °C). Proteins were removed from the DNA for 30 min at 50 °C in 2% SDS, extracted as described by Wessel and Flügge (14Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. DNA was visualized on agarose gels by ethidium bromide staining. The supernatant from the micrococcal nuclease digestion was separated for 14 h (40,000 rpm, SW40) on 5–40% glycerol gradients (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP). Proteins and DNA from the individual fractions were analyzed as described above. The isolation of S1, S2, and P chromatin fractions was based on the procedure described by Rose and Garrard (16Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 107 nuclei were isolated in HNB buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 15 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.125 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 µm spermine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche)) and finally resuspended in 200 µl of nuclear buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, supplemented with protease inhibitors). Nuclei suspension was incubated with 300 units of micrococcal nuclease at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice after 1, 2, and 4 min of digestion, and samples were centrifuged (12 min, 12,000 rpm, 4 °C). The first supernatant was designated the S1 fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of 2 mmEDTA, incubated for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged again. The supernatant and the pellet were designated the S2 and P fractions, respectively. Equal aliquots of the fractions were deproteinized, and the DNA was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%) and ethidium bromide staining. Proteins were extracted according to Wessel and Flügge (14Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with DEK-specific antibodies. HeLa S3 cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3.5% paraformaldehyde, followed by a 3-min permeabilization step in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked for 60 min at room temperature in a humid chamber in PBS containing 3% BSA, followed by the incubation with the primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washing steps in PBS, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with species-specific secondary antibodies. These antibodies were either Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit or Oregon Green-labeled goat anti-mouse. After washing in PBS, the DNA was labeled with Hoechst 33258 in PBS containing 40% glycerol. For cell fractionation, cells were first permeabilized and then extracted with CSK (10 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 0.3 m sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0, 5% Triton X-100) containing different NaCl concentrations. Mitotic cells, obtained after double thymidine block, were permeabilized for 5 min in PHEM (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mmMgSO4, 0.5% Triton X-100) and then fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde followed by blocking in PBS with 3% BSA and incubation with the first and secondary antibodies. Metaphase chromosome spreads were obtained from HeLa S3 cells treated for 14 h with 40 ng/ml nocodazole. Blocked cells were collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2), and kept for 5 min at room temperature. Hypotonically swollen cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, resuspended in fixation buffer (methanol:acetic acid 3:1), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After another centrifugation step, the pellet was resuspended in a few droplets fixation buffer and kept on ice. The solution was pipetted on coverslips and dried at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed for rehydration three times for 2 min in TEEN (1 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 0, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100), then incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h in TEEN at 37 °C. After washing in KB+ (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0, 1% BSA, 0, 1% Triton X-100), chromosomes were covered for 30 min at 37 °C with the secondary antibodies, diluted in KB+. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258. The DEK protein changes the topology of chromatin in vitro at a ratio of two to three molecules of DEK/nucleosome by specifically interacting with histone H2A/H2B dimers (3Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest to investigate the subcellular distribution of the protein. For that purpose, we performed cell fractionation experiments. HeLa cells were disrupted in hypotonic buffer including 5 mm MgCl2 (17Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to prepare a supernatant containing cytosolic proteins. The isolated nuclei were then lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged again to obtain nucleosolic proteins. The remaining nuclear structure including chromatin and the nuclear matrix was successively extracted with a buffer containing increasing NaCl concentrations and finally with RIPA. Most of the DEK protein dissociated at 0.25 m NaCl, and only small amounts were also present in the nucleosol or extracted with 100 or 450 mm salt (Fig. 1 A). The salt extractability of the DEK protein was compared with that of other nuclear proteins. We found that the DEK protein behaved much like typical chromatin-bound proteins, namely hCdc6 and hOrc2 protein (18Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar,19Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The transcription factor SP1 was, however, found predominately in the nucleoplasm and only traces in the 250 mm and 450 mm extract. As already known, most of the linker histone H1 eluted from the nuclei with 450 mm salt (see,e.g., Ref. 20Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), a minor portion was also detected after extraction of the nuclei with RIPA. The distribution of nuclear proteins found by this cell fractionation technique reflects only the steady state level of a protein; however, proteins seem to move in the nucleus and to exchange continuously between chromatin regions (see “Discussion”). Immunofluorescence studies revealed a strictly nuclear signal, whereby the nucleoli were excluded from staining (Fig. 1 B,control). The signal disappeared upon extraction of nuclei with increasing salt concentrations, and most of the DEK protein was released between 250 and 400 mm salt (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with the biochemical fractionation studies of Fig.1 A. DEK could be linked to nuclear structures via RNA or DNA. To address this point, we treated nuclei with DNase I or RNase. The mobilization of DEK was determined by Western blotting (Fig.2 A) and by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of nuclei with DNase I released a large fraction of DEK, whereas RNase released only a small portion of DEK (Fig. 2 A). This was supported by immunofluorescence analysis: A bright nuclear signal remained after RNase treatment of nuclei, which was substantially reduced after DNase digestion (Fig.2 B). Residual DEK staining was detected after DNase treatment and could be due to the association of some DEK with splicing complexes (9McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found indeed that the DEK staining, remaining after DNase digestion, overlapped with regions stained by SR-specific antibodies (21Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Kim J. McCaw P. Sharp P.A. RNA. 1995; 1: 852-865PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this fraction of DEK might be associated with splicing complexes in vivo. The cell fractionation experiment and the immunofluorescence data both implied that DEK is an abundant protein in the nucleus. To estimate the number of DEK molecules and the possible ratio of the DEK protein to nucleosomes in vivo, we prepared whole cell extracts of HeLa cells. The amount of DEK in a given cell number was determined by Western analysis with DEK-specific antibodies in comparison with known amounts of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-DEK protein (data not shown). The calculation revealed that 4–6 × 106 molecules of DEK/cell are present, which corresponds to a theoretical ratio of 0.25–0.4 molecules of DEK/nucleosome. Thus, DEK is an abundant protein in the cell. To further characterize the subnuclear distribution of the DEK protein, we treated HeLa nuclei with increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease (Fig.3), an endonuclease that preferentially attacks the linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes. We thus produced DNA fragments of the size of mono- and oligonucleosomes (Fig.3 A). Proteins were extracted from the soluble and insoluble chromatin and investigated by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B,S and P). With increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease, up to 40% of DNA in chromatin became solubilized. Higher enzyme concentrations degraded the released oligonucleosomal fragments to mononucleosomes, but failed to mobilize additional DNA from the chromatin pellet (Fig. 3 A). This is consistent with earlier studies, which have reported that a fraction of chromatin is refractory to nuclease attack even at high enzyme concentrations (22Clark R.J. Felsenfeld G. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23Klempnauer K.H. Fanning E. Otto B. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 136: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Richter A. Baack M. Holthoff H.P. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1181-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of the DEK protein were released already at rather low enzyme concentrations (2 units, Fig. 3 B). However, the second half of DEK remained associated with an insoluble nuclear structure, even at very high micrococcal nuclease concentrations (Fig.3 B) and after prolonged incubation times (data not shown). To quantify the immunoblots, the stained bands of Fig. 3 Bwere investigated by NIH imager and plotted together with the fraction of solubilized DNA as a function of the enzyme concentration used (Fig.3 B). The quantitation shows again that a fraction of DEK was already released with low micrococcal nuclease concentrations, indicating that a fraction of DEK resides in chromatin regions that are more accessible to nucleases than bulk chromatin. To obtain further information on the DEK-carrying chromatin, the products of micrococcal nuclease digestion were separated on glycerol gradients. Equal aliquots of the individual fractions were deproteinized and investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis, to determine the position of chromatin fragments in the gradient (Fig.4, upper part). Other aliquots of the gradient fractions were used to localize the DEK protein (Fig. 4, untreated). We found that all of the DEK protein released after treatment of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease co-sedimentated with chromatin fragments of various lengths, suggesting that DEK remained associated with chromatin after nuclease digestion. We considered the possibility that at least some DEK may be bound to ribonucleoprotein, and treated the chromatin fragments with RNase before separation on glycerol gradients. Indeed, a small portion of DEK was released from fast sedimenting material and migrated after RNase treatment just like isolated soluble DEK (Fig. 4, RNase andDEK−chromatin). However, the majority of DEK was clearly bound to chromatin because DNase I digestion of chromatin fragments resulted in their complete degradation (not shown) and the release of the DEK protein (Fig. 4,DNase). Our conclusion is that a major portion of DEK is associated with chromatin. Rose and Garrard (16Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that differential extraction of micrococcal nuclease-treated chromatin allows a separation of active and inactive chromatin. We have used their procedure to investigate the partition of DEK to functionally different chromatin regions. Briefly, nuclei were digested for 1, 2, and 4 min with micrococcal nuclease and centrifuged to prepare the supernatant fraction S1. This fraction has been described to consist of transcriptionally active chromatin that is deficient in histone H1 and enriched in HMG proteins (16Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in an EDTA-containing buffer and centrifuged to obtain supernatant fraction S2, which has been shown to be depleted of transcribed sequences (16Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining insoluble fraction P includes the nuclear matrix with actively transcribed genes. The resistance to nucleases may be due to associated protein complexes as RNA polymerase (16Rose S.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8534-8544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the SWI/SNF complex, which has also been detected in fraction P (25Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown by DNA analysis on an agarose gel, the fractions represent differences in nuclease accessibility of chromatin (Fig.5). Fraction S1, containing between 5% and 10% of the cellular DNA, is mainly composed of mononucleosomal-sized DNA, whereas fraction S2, containing ∼50% of cellular DNA, showed a typical nucleosomal ladder of DNA fragments. The P fraction, with ∼40% of cellular DNA, consisted of heterogeneously sized DNA (Fig. 5 A). Equal aliquots of fractions S1, S2, and P were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the DEK protein was detected by immunoblotting with DEK-specific antibodies (Fig. 5 B). We found that the DEK protein is present in all three fractions. However, taking into account that fraction S2 contains the major part of the DNA, the DEK protein is enriched approximately 5-fold in fraction S1 with respect to fraction S2. This indicates that the DEK protein is more abundant in transcriptionally active chromatin. In order to investigate the localization of DEK during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were arrested at the transition between G1 and S phase by a double thymidine block (26Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 1-24Google Scholar). Synthesis of DNA, as determined by the incorporation of labeled DNA precursors, started between 1 and 2 h after thymidine removal and continued for ∼7 h (data not shown). Equal cell aliquots were taken at the indicated times after thymidine release and fractionated as described above (Fig. 1). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the DEK protein was detected after immunoblotting with DEK-specific antibodies. As a control Western blots were also stained with MCM5-specific antibodies (Fig.6). Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are known to dissociate from chromatin during S phase (27Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but rapidly bind to chromatin again at the end of mitosis (12Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, DEK remained on chromatin during all stages of the cell cycle. Furthermore, DEK in all cases could be eluted at 250 mm salt from chromatin, suggesting that the mode of DEK-chromatin interaction does not change during S phase when chromatin is newly assembled. The internal control here is the MCM5 protein, which was found on G1 phase chromatin (Fig. 6, 3 h), but not on chromatin from S phase and post-S phase cells (Fig.6, 6–11 h). Similar results were obtained after release of HeLa cells from a nocodazole block, where no change in the amount and localization of the DEK protein occurred during the following G1 phase (data not shown). Immunofluorescence was used to investigate the association of DEK with chromatin during mitosis. HeLa cells were released from a thymidine block and 9 h later permeabilized and fixed with formaldehyde. The localization of DEK was detected with DEK-specific antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Fig.7 A). We found that DEK is associated with chromatin during all phases of mitosis, starting in pro-phase to metaphase, anaphase, and telophase (data not shown). In addition, we prepared metaphase chromosomes from nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 7 B). After treatment with DEK-specific antibodies, we found a homogenous staining of the metaphase chromosomes. Thus, DEK remains bound to mitotic chromatin. Our recent experiments have shown that DEK changes the topology of DNA in chromatin in vitro (3Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to know whether DEK is in contact with chromatin in vivo. In this work we present evidence that the DEK protein is associated with chromatin in vivo. We found that ∼50% of the DEK protein can be released from nuclei with low micrococcal nuclease concentrations. The resistant fraction remains in the nucleus even after prolonged incubation with high amounts of micrococcal nuclease. Analysis of released chromatin fragments on glycerol gradients revealed that DEK co-sediments with oligonucleosome-sized DNA fragments. After treatment of these preparations with RNase, a small fraction of DEK was released and appeared at the position of free DEK protein. This indicates that a minor fraction of DEK is associated with RNA-containing complexes in vivo, as has been shown previously (9McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A co-localization of a fraction of DEK protein with splicing complexes was also confirmed by immunostaining with anti-SR antibodies. In addition to the fractions of DEK, which are solubilized by short treatment with micrococcal nuclease and include chromatin- and RNP-bound DEK, a third fraction exists, which could not be released from nuclei by micrococcal nuclease or DNase treatment but is eluted with 250 mm salt and might be associated with heterochromatic regions. Whether the distribution of DEK in the nucleus reflects different forms of the protein has yet to be shown. In fact, DEK can be phosphorylated (11Fornerod M. Boer J. van Baal S. Jaegle M. von Lindern M. Murti K.G. Davis D. Bonten J. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1739-1748PubMed Google Scholar), but whether this or other post-translational modifications direct the protein to different chromatin compartments or to ribonucleoprotein is not known. DEK is not unique among nuclear proteins that bind to chromatin and to RNA containing structures. Interestingly, several examples of factors with dual RNA and DNA binding properties are known. Like the DEK protein, some of these factors are also involved in human malignancies. To this class belongs the Wilm's tumor protein (WT-1), which binds to DNA but also concentrates within splicing factor domains in the nucleus (28Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D.

Lamond A.I. Hastie N.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition the oncoprotein TLS/FUS binds to DNA and also interacts with SR protein splicing factors (30Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Ets-related transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1, a hematopoietic specific transcription factor has been shown to influence splicing activity (31Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,32Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An intriguing question is whether the fusion of the DEK protein with CAN, expressed in acute myelogenous leukemia (4von Lindern M. Fornerod M. van Baal S. Jaegle M. de Wit T. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), alters the location of DEK on chromatin and thus contributes to the transforming potential of the protein or whether alterations in RNA processing are responsible for the oncogenic processes. DEK is an abundant protein with more than a million copies per nucleus. A comparison of the DEK amino acid sequence with sequences in data bases identified homologous sequences within predicted open reading frames of zebrafish, fly, and plant expressed sequence tag cDNAs, but did not reveal a significant homology with any characterized protein. Interestingly, amino acids 149–183 of the DEK protein show strong homology to the SAF (scaffold attachmentfactor) box (33Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), also termed SAP domain (afterSAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) (35Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), a DNA-binding motif involved in chromosomal organization. This 31-amino acid motif reveals a bipartite distribution of strongly conserved hydrophobic, polar, and bulky amino acids separated by a region that contains an invariant glycine (34Kipp M. Gohring F. Ostendorp T. van Drunen C.M. van Driel R. Przybylski M. Fackelmayer F.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The positions enriched in positively charged amino acids might make contacts with the DNA backbone. SAF boxes have been found in many different proteins as, for example, polyADP-ribose polymerase, the Ku autoantigen, and the RAD18 protein, involved in DNA repair. Furthermore, the SAF box is associated with different proteins involved in the assembly of RNA-processing complexes (35Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and might tether a diverse set of domains involved in pre-mRNA processing to transcriptionally active chromatin. It has also been shown that the SAF box organizes interphase chromosomes by binding to SAR regions, and its release by caspases causes the chromosomes to collapse during apoptotic cell death and facilitates chromatin degradation (33Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Kipp M. Schwab B.L. Przybylski M. Nicotera P. Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5031-5036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the SAF box targets a variety of proteins to specific chromosomal locations. In the case of the DEK protein, the association with chromatin might be mediated by the binding of the SAF box to DNA and by additional protein-protein interactions with histone H2A-H2B dimers (3Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with previous experiments (11Fornerod M. Boer J. van Baal S. Jaegle M. von Lindern M. Murti K.G. Davis D. Bonten J. Buijs A. Grosveld G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1739-1748PubMed Google Scholar), our immunofluorescence data show a co-localization of the DEK protein with chromatin during mitosis. In addition we could demonstrate that there is no change in the amount and localization of the DEK protein during the cell cycle, indicating that DEK is associated with chromatin during the whole cell cycle. This suggests that the DEK protein might be involved in maintaining architectural features of chromatin. Recent experiments using photobleaching techniques have demonstrated that different proteins as the nucleosomal binding protein HMG-17, the pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2/ASF, and the rRNA processing protein fibrillarin, which are involved in diverse nuclear processes move rapidly throughout the entire nucleus (37Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In addition it was found that almost the entire population of histone H1-green fluorescence protein is bound to chromatin at any one time, but is exchanged continuously between chromatin regions (20Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 38Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, H1-green fluorescence protein molecules reside on chromatin in living cells for ∼220 s before dissociating and rapidly rebinding to an available binding site (20Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Our studies on the association of the DEK protein with nuclear structures have analyzed the steady-state level of the DEK protein. In light of the new data that most proteins constantly move in the nucleus, it seems, however, quite likely that the DEK protein may also move between chromatin regions or even between chromatin and RNA.

We performed studies in L-cells to explore whether prior exposure to oxidative stress (“oxidative preconditioning”) can protect the cell against the apoptotic consequences of subsequent oxidative insults and to establish the mediators in the preconditioning signaling cascade. Cells were preconditioned with three 5-min exposures to H2O2, followed by 10-h recovery and subsequent exposure to 600 µmH2O2 for 10 h. A single 10-h exposure to H2O2 induced substantial apoptotic cell death (∼90%), as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, TUNEL (terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling), and Annexin V methods, but apoptosis was largely prevented in preconditioned cells. The degree of cytoprotection depended on the strength of preconditioning or H2O2concentration (20∼600 µm). Transient increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, and JNK/SAPK activities and sustained protein kinase B (Akt) activation, accompanied by drastically reduced caspase 3 activity, were seen after preconditioning. The expression levels of these kinases were unaltered. Inhibitors of p38 (SB203580) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K, LY294002) pathways abolished the protection provided by preconditioning. We conclude that oxidative preconditioning protects cells against apoptosis and that this effect involves MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.

Apoptosis, a specific form of programmed cell death, plays an important role in development, growth regulation, diseases of the heart, immune system, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Potentially lethal stressors can take different forms, including reactive free radicals, inflammatory cytokines, ischemia, ATP depletion, endotoxin, genotoxin stress, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress constitutes a major threat to organisms living in an aerobic environment, and for humans is believed to play a causative role in many disease states, as well as in the aging process. One of the primary mechanisms of oxidative damage is cellular apoptosis (1Jiménez L.A. Zanella C. Fung H. Janssen Y.M.W. Vacek R. Charland C. Goldberg J. Mossman B.T. Am. J.

Oxidative stress is an important mediator of ischemic injury and plays a significant role in a variety of developmental and pathological processes. It is presently unknown whether brief exposures to oxidative stress can alter the response to subsequent exposures and, if so, which signaling pathways are involved. The present study was therefore designed to determine whether oxidative preconditioning can protect against apoptotic cell death in a mouse L-cell model and, if so, to define key mediators in the cytoprotective pathways.DISCUSSIONThe purposes of this study were to examine whether cells respond to oxidative stress with apoptosis and whether and how oxidative preconditioning can prevent apoptosis due to oxidative stress. Our data indicate that L-cells have intrinsic mechanisms that respond to short-lived oxidative stresses by increasing cellular resistance to the induction of apoptosis by subsequent sustained oxidative exposures. The activities of p38, SAPK, and Akt were increased by oxidative preconditioning, and the inhibition of p38 and PI3K/Akt prevented the inhibitory effects of oxidative preconditioning on both caspase 3 activation and apoptosis induction due to prolonged oxidative stress. PI3K/Akt activation appeared to be particularly linked to the effects of oxidative preconditioning, because its activity was more affected by transient than maintained oxidative stress (Fig. 8) and its inhibition prevented the protective effect of preconditioning without altering the apoptotic effect of prolonged oxidative stress (Fig. 10).Oxidative Preconditioning Is an Intrinsic Property of CellsIschemic preconditioning was initially described by Murray and colleagues in 1986 (8Murray C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (6962) Google Scholar) as a phenomenon whereby myocardium exposed to periods of brief ischemia develops protection against irreversible damage during a subsequent sustained ischemic episode. Ischemic preconditioning subsequently emerged as a universal mechanism of cytoprotection in a variety of non-cardiac tissues and organs (11Kitagawa K. Matsumoto M. Tagaya M. Hta R. Ueda H. Niinobe M.

Moreover, the concept has also been extended to PC triggered by non-ischemic stresses, such as reactive oxygen radicals, hypoxia, stretch, and some chemicals (16Pang C. Yang R. Zhing A. Xu N. Boyd B. Forrest C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 288-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21De Zeeuw S. Van Den Doel M.A. Duncker D.J. Verdouw P.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Xu N. Boyd B. Forrest C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 29: 288-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that acute ischemic preconditioning protects against skeletal muscle infarction in the pig. DeFily and Chilian (18DeFily D. Chilian W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H700-H706PubMed Google Scholar) found that preconditioning protects coronary arteriolar endothelium from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Transient ischemia in remote organs (such as the kidney) has been shown to be able to precondition myocardium (22Verdouw P.D. Gho B.C.G. Koning M.M.G. Schoemaker R.G. Duncker D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 793: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The outcome of PC is reduced cell death, which results in improved function at the organ level (23Maulik N. Yoshida T. Engelman R.M. Deaton D. Flack III J.E. Rousou J.A. Das D.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 186: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The PC protection described by most previous studies was produced at the organ level and could involve multiple tissue and organism factors, including environmental homeostatic adaptation, hormonal and neuronal readjustment, energy demand and supply balance, etc. In the present study, we found that brief periods of oxidative stress can prevent apoptosis induced by subsequent H2O2 exposure in cultured L-cells. Moreover, protection was a discrete function of H2O2 concentration and appears to be an intrinsic cellular property of L-cells. We have observed similar cellular adaptation to apoptosis induced by H2O2 in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) and a rat ventricular cell line (H9c2). 2H. Han, H. Wang, H. Long, and Z. Wang, unpublished data. Use of H2O2 to study preconditioning protection in perfused hearts or in cultured myocytes has been reported previously (24Takeshima S. Vaage J. Valen G. Acta Physiol.

Our findings suggest that preconditioning is likely an intrinsic property of cells. It is quite conceivable that apoptotic preconditioning at the cellular level contributes to the protective effects of ischemic preconditioning in various organ systems. In addition, apoptosis is an important mechanism in organ development and the notion that pre-conditioning by brief apoptotic stimuli may alter the response to subsequent prolonged stimuli may have significant consequences for mechanisms involved in development.Critical Roles of IP3K/Akt and MAPKs in Apoptotic PreconditioningCaspase 3 and 7 are effector proteases that degrade most of the cellular targets leading to apoptotic cell death. Under normal situations, activity of these caspases is kept at a level low enough to avoid the occurrence of apoptosis. Caspase activation by apoptotic stimuli is an important component of the processes leading to cell death. In our study, caspase 3 and 7 activities were markedly increased in cells exposed to prolonged oxidative stress. However, caspase activity was unaltered by brief oxidative stresses and this low level of caspase activity remained even in cells exposed to otherwise lethal H2O2 concentrations after oxidative preconditioning. Protection against caspase activation is likely a central distal mediator of the effects of oxidative preconditioning.Among the major signaling pathways known to influence survival of cells exposed to oxidants are the phosphorylation cascades leading to activation of MAPKs (1Jiménez L.A.

The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is activated via a PI3K-dependent pathway. Akt has received widespread attention as a key anti-apoptotic protein through which various survival signals suppress cell death induced by a variety of stressful stimuli (30Konishi H. Matsuzaki H.

Activation of Akt can phosphorylate and thereby inactivate downstream apoptosis mediators such as GSK-3α/β.It is well recognized that activation of p38 and JNK/SAPK is pro-apoptotic in many situations (4Obata T.

Consistent with these notions, our data showed important increases in the phosphorylated forms of p38 and SAPKs in cells exposed to prolonged oxidative stress without preconditioning. Phosphorylated Akt protein density was also increased in H2O2 cells, but Akt enzyme activity was not significantly increased. The evidence for a role for MAPKs in apoptosis was further strengthened by the fact that inhibition of p38 by SB prevented oxidative cell death. Brief oxidative stresses also activate p38 and SAPKs, and SB prevented the protective effect of oxidative preconditioning. These results suggest that MAPK activation by oxidative stress initiates both pro- and anti-apoptotic processes, the balance of which determines the outcome. With brief stresses, anti-apoptotic mechanisms are activated and remain active for over 10 h after removal of the initial stresses. With prolonged H2O2 exposure, pro-apoptotic mechanisms dominate. Roulston et al. (41Roulston A. Rainhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) found that tumor necrosis factor α activates SAPK and p38 kinases with biphasic kinetics. The first phase is transient and caspase-independent, whereas the second phase is coincident with apoptosis and is caspase-dependent. A similar dual function of p38 was also observed in hematopoietic cells (40Birkenkamp K.U. Dokter W.H.A. Esselink M.T. Jonk L.J.C. Kruijer W. Vellenga E. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PI3K/Akt activation appears to play a predominant role in anti-apoptotic pathways, because PI3K inhibition eliminated the effects of oxidative preconditioning but did not alter the pro-apoptotic effects of prolonged oxidative stress (Fig.9).Another possible explanation for our observation is that the isoforms of p38 and SAPK activated during PC are different from those activated during long exposure to H2O2. At least four members of the p38 subfamily have been identified, namely p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. It has been shown that individual isoforms possess distinct physiological functions (5Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 42Ping P. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 921-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); the α isoform promotes and the β isoform prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis (39Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is possible that p38β was the major isoform activated during PC, whereas the predominant isoform activated in cells during long exposure to H2O2 was p38α.Our data in no way exclude potential contributions of other signaling pathways and mediators. Mitochondrial death pathways involving Bcl-2, Bad, and Bax and the protein kinase C pathway are involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes (2Li P. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3602-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 44Von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). A number of genes and proteins have been identified as possibly involved in the development of myocardial preconditioning, including heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, nitric oxide synthase, Bcl-2, AP-1, NF-κB, as well as ATPase 6 and cytochrome b subunits (45Maulik N. Goswami T.S. Galang N. Das D.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further studies of other signaling pathways and in other cell models are warranted to provide a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of preconditioning-induced cytoprotection.In conclusion, we have provided evidence for a cytoprotective effect of preconditioning against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. We have found that activation of MAPKs and the PI3K/Akt pathway are involved, with the latter being particularly important in mediating protective effects of oxidative preconditioning. The low levels of reactive oxygen species produced during physiological metabolism may continually precondition cells and defend them against damage caused by oxidant stress under pathological conditions. The pathways we elucidated may be important in regulating cellular apoptosis, both physiological and pathological, under circumstances in which cells are repeatedly exposed to oxidant activity. Manipulation of the underlying pathways, particularly PI3K/Akt, which is selectively involved in protective preconditioning, may provide useful new therapeutic approaches. Physiological and pathological stimuli from either extracellular or intracellular milieus can result in cell death, via either passive (necrotic) or active (apoptotic) pathways. Apoptosis, a specific form of programmed cell death, plays an important role in development, growth regulation, diseases of the heart, immune system, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer. Potentially lethal stressors can take different forms, including reactive free radicals, inflammatory cytokines, ischemia, ATP depletion, endotoxin, genotoxin stress, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress constitutes a major threat to organisms living in an aerobic environment, and for humans is believed to play a causative role in many disease states, as well as in the aging process. One of the primary mechanisms of oxidative damage is cellular apoptosis (1Jiménez L.A. Zanella C. Fung H. Janssen Y.M.W. Vacek R. Charland C. Goldberg J. Mossman B.T. Am. J.

One example of such cytoprotection is ischemic preconditioning, by which a brief ischemic episode protects against the potentially lethal effect of subsequent ischemic events. Ischemic preconditioning is now recognized to have important protective effects against ischemic damage in the heart (8Murray C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A.

Oxidative stress is an important mediator of ischemic injury and plays a significant role in a variety of developmental and pathological processes. It is presently unknown whether brief exposures to oxidative stress can alter the response to subsequent exposures and, if so, which signaling pathways are involved. The present study was therefore designed to determine whether oxidative preconditioning can protect against apoptotic cell death in a mouse L-cell model and, if so, to define key mediators in the cytoprotective pathways. DISCUSSIONThe purposes of this study were to examine whether cells respond to oxidative stress with apoptosis and whether and how oxidative preconditioning can prevent apoptosis due to oxidative stress. Our data indicate that L-cells have intrinsic mechanisms that respond to short-lived oxidative stresses by increasing cellular resistance to the induction of apoptosis by subsequent sustained oxidative exposures. The activities of p38, SAPK, and Akt were increased by oxidative preconditioning, and the inhibition of p38 and PI3K/Akt prevented the inhibitory effects of oxidative preconditioning on both caspase 3 activation and apoptosis induction due to prolonged oxidative stress. PI3K/Akt activation appeared to be particularly linked to the effects of oxidative preconditioning, because its activity was more affected by transient than maintained oxidative stress (Fig. 8) and its inhibition prevented the protective effect of preconditioning without altering the apoptotic effect of prolonged oxidative stress (Fig. 10).Oxidative Preconditioning Is an Intrinsic Property of CellsIschemic preconditioning was initially described by Murray and colleagues in 1986 (8Murray C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (6962) Google Scholar) as a phenomenon whereby myocardium exposed to periods of brief ischemia develops protection against irreversible damage during a subsequent sustained ischemic episode. Ischemic preconditioning subsequently emerged as a universal mechanism of cytoprotection in a variety of non-cardiac tissues and organs (11Kitagawa K. Matsumoto M. Tagaya M. Hta R. Ueda H. Niinobe M.

In contrast to previous studies that used relaxed, circular plasmids as templates, we have found that negatively supercoiled templates reveal the distinct roles of NAP-1 and ACF in histone deposition and the formation of an ordered nucleosomal array. NAP-1 can efficiently deposit histones onto supercoiled plasmids. Furthermore, NAP-1 exhibits a greater affinity for histones H2A-H2B than does naked DNA, but in the presence of H3-H4, H2A-H2B are transferred from NAP-1 to the plasmid templates. These observations underscore the importance of a high affinity between H2A-H2B and NAP-1 for ordered transfer of core histones onto DNA. In addition, recombinant ACF composed of imitation switch and Acf1 can extend closely packed nucleosomes, which suggests that recombinant ACF can mobilize nucleosomes. In the assembly reaction with a supercoiled template, ACF need not be added simultaneously with NAP-1. Regularly spaced nucleosomes are generated even when recombinant ACF is added after core histones are transferred completely onto the DNA. Atomic force microscopy, however, suggests that NAP-1 alone fails to accomplish the formation of fine nucleosomal core particles, which are only formed in the presence of ACF. These results suggest a model for the ordered deposition of histones and the arrangement of nucleosomes during chromatin assembly in vivo.

Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, consisting of 145 base pairs (bp)1 of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Crystallographic studies have shown that an H3-H4 tetramer occupies the central region of the nucleosome, and the H2A-H2B dimers bind to the peripheral region (8Richmond T.J. Finch J.T. Rushton B. Rhodes D. Klug A. Nature. 1984; 311: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 9Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6987) Google Scholar). Thus, it is implicit in the structure of the nucleosome that H3 and H4 must be deposited prior to the incorporation of H2A and H2B. In agreement with this, several studies of histone transfer and of chromatin assembly during DNA replication have indicated that H3-H4 deposition occurs first, then H2A-H2B, followed by linker histones (such as histone H1) and the establishment of the ordered nucleosomal arrays that are characteristic of bulk chromatin in vivo(for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E.

Biochemical studies have led to the identification of proteins that mediate the reconstitution of core histones into nucleosomes. Nearly all of these factors are core histone-binding proteins that contain stretches of acidic amino acid residues. Some of these histone chaperones, such as nucleoplasmin and nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP-1), exhibit a preference for binding to histones H2A and H2B relative to histones H3 and H4. Other histone chaperones, including replication-coupling assembly factor, chromatin assembly factor-1, N1/N2, and Spt6, associate preferentially with H3 and H4 (for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E.

It has also been observed that newly synthesized histones are acetylated (such as at positions 5 and 12 of histone H4) and then subsequently deacetylated after assembly into chromatin (for reviews, see Refs. 15Annunziato A.T. Eason M.B. Perry C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 16Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, factors that mediate histone acetylation or deacetylation may participate in the chromatin assembly process indirectly by the covalent modification of histones. Among H3 and H4 chaperones, Drosophilaanti-silencing function-1 and chromatin assembly factor-1 were shown to be associated with newly synthesized, acetylated core histones (17Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 18Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To varying extents, these core histone chaperones can mediate the deposition of histones onto DNA via an ATP-independent process that yields chromatin consisting of randomly distributed nucleosomes. A similar distribution of nucleosomes can be accomplished by the method of salt gradient dialysis or by using polyanions, such as polyglutamate or RNA, which can interact with the histones and prevent their nonspecific aggregation with DNA. This random deposition process, however, is generally inefficient and does not yield periodic arrays of nucleosomes that resemble those seen in native chromatin (for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, and 13Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). The assembly of regularly spaced nucleosome arrays is an ATP-dependent process, as was initially observed in an extract derived from Xenopus oocytes (19Glikin G.C. Ruberti I. Worcel A. Cell. 1984; 37: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In studies of chromatin assembly factors from Drosophila embryos, the ATP-utilizing component of the chromatin assembly machinery (termed ACF for ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor) was identified, and its subunit Acf1 was cloned (20Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 21Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recombinant ACF consisting of dAcf1 and Drosophilaimitation switch acts as a catalyst in the deposition of histones to yield periodic nucleosome arrays in an ATP-dependent manner, as does the native ACF. This chromatin assembly reaction, which can be carried out in a purified reconstituted system, requires ACF, core histones, DNA, ATP, and NAP-1. In this study, we used this purified assembly system to examine how the chromatin assembly machinery ensures the ordered transfer of core histones onto DNA to form nucleosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the assembly of nucleosomal arrays is a multistep process consisting of ordered core histone transfer by NAP-1 and subsequent nucleosome maturation by ACF. Recombinant proteins and ACF were prepared essentially as described previously (21Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T.

His6-tagged Drosophila NAP-1 was purified from baculo-virus-infected Sf9 cells by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA) affinity chromatography, followed by three conventional chromatographic steps: Q-Sepharose FF, SP-Sepharose FF, and Q-Sepharose FF (all media were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peak fractions of the final Q-Sepharose FF column were pooled and used in the assays. Chromatin assembly reactions were performed essentially as described by Bulger et al.(22Bulger M. Ito T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using supercoiled plasmid DNA. A standard reaction contained plasmid DNA (0.4 µg), purified core histones from Drosophila embryos (0.33 µg), purified recombinant dNAP-1, purified recombinant ACF, ATP (3 mm), and an ATP-regenerating system (30 mmphosphocreatine and 1 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase). All experiments were done a minimum of three times to ensure the accuracy of our results. After chromatin was assembled, reaction mixtures were subjected to 15–40% glycerol density gradient sedimentation in an SW60 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) rotor at 60,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Part of the gradient fractions were digested with proteinase K, deproteinized with phenol-chloroform, and subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. The remaining portions of the samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Chromatin was assembled as described above, except with 7 mm KCl instead of 50 mm KCl; reaction mixtures were then subjected to 15–40% glycerol density gradient sedimentation. Part of the fraction was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The peak fraction was fixed with 0.1% glutal aldehyde at 4 °C for 10 h and subsequently dialyzed against 7 mm KCL HE (25 mm Hepes and 0.1 mmEDTA) for 10 h. Samples were applied on a 1 nmspermidine-treated mica surface. After 5 min the mica was gently washed with water and dried under nitrogen gas. Imaging was done with an SPA400 SPI3800N probe station (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Matsudo, Japan) in air under cyclic mode at room temperature using a cantilever with a spring constant of 40 N/m (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Matsudo, Japan). Several in vivo and in vitroexperiments have proven that chromatin assembly is a staged process. Worcel et al. (24Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L. Cell. 1978; 15: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) have shown that newly synthesized DNA is enriched with newly synthesized histones H3 and H4, whereas newly synthesized H2A and H2B associate with chromatin that has properties similar to those of bulk nonreplicating chromatin. Worcel et al. (24Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L. Cell. 1978; 15: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) concluded that newly synthesized histones associate with newly synthesized DNA in a sequential order; histones H3 and H4 are deposited first, and then histones H2A and H2B are deposited (for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, and 13Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). From crystallographic studies of the structure of the nucleosome, it is clear that histones H3 and H4 need to be deposited prior to the incorporation of H2A and H2B. It is also well characterized that the histone octamer is unstable under physiological ionic conditions in the absence of DNA, dissociating into the H3-H4 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers (for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholarand 13Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). However, it is still yet to be clarified how the chromatin assembly machinery ensures this ordered deposition of core histones. To understand the mechanisms of coordinated histone deposition in vivo, we attempted to decipher how histones are transferred onto DNA in vitro. ACF and NAP-1 can assemble nucleosomes from different templates, such as relaxed, supercoiled, and linearized plasmid DNA in vitro (20Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). When the plasmid is in a relaxed state, in addition to NAP-1, ACF is essential for efficient nucleosome formation (20Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 22Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Pfaffle and Jackson (25Pfaffle P. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16821-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed, however, that if the plasmid is negatively supercoiled, nucleosome transfer occurs very rapidly even when using polyglutamic acid as a histone chaperone. In this study, we used supercoiled plasmid, which facilitated core histone transfer only via a histone chaperone. The manner by which core histones bind to NAP-1 and DNA demonstrates how stepwise transfer occurs. NAP-1 was originally identified in mammalian cells as a core histone-binding protein that facilitates random, ATP-independent nucleosome deposition (26Ishimi Y. Yasuda H. Hirosumi J. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), as monitored by the supercoil of DNA that arises upon formation of the nucleosomes (28Germond J.E. Hirt B. Oudet P. Gross-Bellark M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In the reaction that mediates the ATP-facilitated assembly of regularly spaced nucleosomal arrays in chromatin, we have shown that NAP-1 works with ACF. NAP-1 binds to histones H2A and H2B in vivo (23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) as well as in vitro (23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The comparison of the affinity between NAP-1 and core histones H2A-H2B and that between DNA and H2A-H2B indicates an important role of NAP-1 in this stepwise transfer (Fig. 1,A–C). Core histones H2A-H2B bound to NAP-1 (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3); when DNA was added in the absence of H3-H4, the H2A-H2B dimer was not transferred onto the DNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, Xenopus nucleoplasmin transfers H2A-H2B to DNA even in the absence of H3-H4 (31Kleinschmidt J.A. Seiter A. Zentgraf H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In Drosophila dNAP-1, which has a higher affinity to core histones than nucleoplasmin-like protein (32Ito T. Tyler J.K. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25041-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), works better than nucleoplasmin-like protein in the assembly reaction. These results strengthen the importance of NAP-1 as an H2A and H2B chaperone in chromatin assembly. Our results showed that in the absence of NAP-1, core histones H2A-H2B bound to DNA without aggregation (Fig.1 C, lane 6). Core histones H3-H4 bound to NAP-1 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 3 and 4) in vitro, as previously reported (23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 30Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When DNA was added, the H3-H4 tetramer was transferred onto DNA (Fig. 1 E,lanes 5–7), as expected. When core histones H3-H4 and DNA were mixed, they formed aggregates (Fig. 1 F, lane 11). Based on the observations of Pfaffle and Jackson (25Pfaffle P. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16821-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when all four core histones are added, they apparently go onto the supercoiled plasmid DNA. Thus, we examined what happens when different amounts of H3-H4 are added to a reaction consisting of H2A-H2B, NAP-1, and DNA (Fig. 2). The H2A-H2B bound to NAP-1 even in the presence of DNA (see Figs. 1, A and B and2 A). When H3-H4 was added, the H2A-H2B dimers were transferred from NAP-1 to DNA in proportion to the amount of H3-H4 added (Fig. 2, B and C). If a stoichiometric amount of H3-H4 was added, all of the H2A-H2B was transferred onto the DNA (Fig. 2 D). Thus, for core histones H2A-H2B, the order of the affinity is: 1) H2A-H2B and a subnucleosome consisting of DNA and H3-H4, 2) H2A-H2B and NAP-1, and 3) H2A-H2B and DNA. In the case of H3-H4, the order of the affinity is: 1) DNA and H3-H4 and 2) H3-H4 and NAP-1. These affinities explain why H3-H4 transfer occurs prior to H2A-H2B transfer. Furthermore, these results underscore the importance of a high affinity between NAP-1 and the H2A-H2B dimer and the role of NAP-1 in stepwise histone transfer. The role of chromatin assembly factor-1 (or replication-coupling assembly factor) as a core histone H3-H4 chaperone in vitro remains to be clarified. Recently, we found that NAP-1 is also involved in the disassembly of the histone octamer, resulting in the transfer of H2A-H2B from the nucleosome to NAP-1 during GAL4VP16-mediated nucleosome remodeling and subsequent core histone acetylation (33Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that NAP-1 is found mainly in the nucleus during early S phase but not during the G2 phase (23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, staining reveals the presence of a small amount of NAP-1 in the nucleus at all stages of the cell cycle. In addition to NAP-1 being a chaperone for core histones, these data support the idea that NAP-1 plays a role in the fine-tuning of chromatin assembly and disassembly coupled with transcriptional activation. Kellogg and Murray (34Kellogg D.R. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported that in yeast the deletion of NAP-1 in the wild-type strain has no obvious effect on cell growth; however, the cells of the Δ nap-1 strain are often found in clumps of connected cells with elongated shapes. There might be functional redundancy between NAP-1 and another NAP-1-related protein, SET, in Drosophila and in humans (35von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 36Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and it remains to be extensively investigated whether there are any fine changes in the chromatin structure or transcriptional regulation associated with the function of NAP-1in vivo. To decipher the timing of histone octamer formation, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation with anti-H2A-H2B antibody (Fig.3). Core histones H3-H4 were not precipitated with anti-H2A-H2B. When NAP-1 and a stoichiometric amount of H2A-H2B were added, however, half of the H3-H4 precipitated. By using mononucleosomes made by salt dialysis, all H3 and H4 histones were precipitated with H2A and H2B. That is, if there is a histone octamer, almost all H3 and H4 are coimmunoprecipitated with H2A and H2B. Because NAP-1 appears to be multimeric, its acidic region can simultaneously associate with both H2A-H2B dimer and H3-H4 tetramer even if a histone octamer is not made. Using crudeDrosophila extract, we also found that anti-NAP-1 coimmunoprecipitated H2A and H2B but not H3 and H4 (23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that a histone octamer does not form efficiently on NAP-1 in solution and that the formation of a histone octamerin vitro is a stepwise, ordered process including: 1) the transfer of H3-H4 onto DNA and 2) the recruitment of H2A-H2B from NAP-1 to the subnucleosome due to a change of affinity. In a previous study we have shown that native ACF can extend a closely packed nucleosomal repeat (∼146 bp) made by salt dialysis to a more physiological repeat length of ∼160 bp (20Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We tested whether recombinant ACF comprised of imitation switch and Acf1 also has this property. Chromatin that is closely packed (i.e. not evenly spaced) made by dialysis from 1.0 m to 50 mm KCl was used in this reaction. To test whether this reaction occurs gradually, a micrococcal nuclease assay was performed at different time points. Without ACF, the repeat length of the nucleosomal array was 148 bp (Fig. 4,reaction 1). Two h after adding ACF, the repeat length of the nucleosomal array was 160 bp (Fig. 4, reaction 6). One h after adding ACF, the repeat length of the nucleosomal array (Fig.4, reaction 4) was between the repeat lengths of the nucleosomal arrays incubated with ACF for 30 min and 2 h (Fig. 4,reactions 2 and 6). These results indicate that, in the presence of ACF, the repeat length extends gradually from 148 to 160 bp and that recombinant ACF can mobilize nucleosomes gradually. The imitation switch family of remodeling complexes, such as ACF, nucleosome remodeling factor, chromatin accessibility complex, and remodeling and spacing factor, exhibit a variety of properties, including: 1) the ordering of disordered nucleosomal arrays (20Ito T.

Nature. 1997; 388: 598-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), 4) the stimulation of nucleosome sliding (42Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 43Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and 5) the assembly of free histones into nucleosomes (20Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 21Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that recombinant ACF can mobilize nucleosomes, which is similar to activities 1 and 4 listed above. It is reasonable to think that the nucleosome mobilization activity of recombinant ACF plays a role in chromatin maturation. Recently McQuibban et al. (44McQuibban G.A. Commisso-Cappelli C.N. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6582-6590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that yeast nucleosome assembly protein-1 can space nucleosomes without any ATP present. The major difference between chromatin made by yNAP-1 and that made by dNAP-1 and ACF is the repeat length of the nucleosomal array: 146 bp by yeast nucleosome assembly protein versus160 bp by dNAP-1 and ACF. This difference supports our model that ACF plays a role in chromatin maturation by mobilizing nucleosomes. Based on a supercoiling assay, NAP-1 and ACF cooperatively introduced negative supercoiling into closed, relaxed, circular DNA (22Bulger M. Ito T. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11726-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The formation of one nucleosome causes a change in the linking number of about −1, and thus the number of the nucleosomes assembled on a closed circular template is approximately equal to the number of negative supercoils that remain after removal of the histones in the presence of topoisomerase I (for reviews, see Refs. 10van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 12Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, and 13Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). When a supercoiled template was used, topoisomerase I added at the start of the reaction never relaxed the template (Fig.5 A). The same amount of topoisomerase I used in this experiment relaxed this plasmid DNA in 2 min; relaxation was completed within 10 min without core histones (Fig.5 B). Thus, kinetics with a supercoiled template suggested that core histone transfer by NAP-1 was completed within 10 min. This is comparable with similar experiments using polyglutamic acid (24Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L. Cell. 1978; 15: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Consistent with the supercoiling assay, glycerol gradient sedimentation with supercoiled plasmid and recombinant NAP-1 showed that core histones were transferred from NAP-1 (Fig. 5 C, lane 2) onto DNA (Fig. 5 C, lanes 4, 5, and 6) within 10 min, and there was no change 60 min later (compare Fig. 5, C and D). Both the supercoiling assay and glycerol gradient sedimentation showed that core histone transfer is very rapid with a supercoiled template. Thus, we can focus on the distinct role of NAP-1 and ACF. By itself, NAP-1 was able to transfer core histones onto supercoiled plasmid DNA, and a periodic nucleosomal array was observed when ACF was added. This evidence strongly suggested that nucleosomal maturation was mainly comprised of nucleosome mobilization by ACF. In addition, ACF did not have to be added simultaneously with NAP-1. Regularly spaced nucleosomes were generated even if ACF was added at different time points throughout the reaction (Fig. 6). The 10-min transfer reaction should have been completed by the time ACF was added 1, 2, and 3 h after starting the assembly reaction by NAP-1. Although NAP-1 and ACF work cooperatively in the chromatin assembly, the reactions mediated by each factor can be separated into two distinct steps; 1) core histones are transferred by NAP-1, and 2) chromatin is matured by ACF using a supercoiled template in vitro. Although we have made progress with our biochemical studies of chromatin assembly, many structural questions remain to be answered. At low ionic strength, electron microscopy typically shows that chromatin looks like beads on a string. However, there has been concern that strong interactions of the fiber with the electron microscope support surface and the dehydration produced by the intense vacuum conditions could distort the structure. Atomic force microscopy does not present these problems. Leuba et al. (45Leuba S.H. Yang G. Robert C. Samori B. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11621-11625Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) used tapping mode atomic force microscopy to observe chicken chromatin fibers. It is possible to observe in vitro assembled chromatin relatively easily by this technique. In addition, direct images can provide more information than just biochemical assays can. Images from tapping mode atomic force microscopy are shown in Fig.7, A–C. By using this technique, we observed the core histone transferred onto DNA in the presence of the NAP-1. The size of each particle was irregular, and the mean size (calculated by the long axis and short axis) was 15.9 nm (n = 26; S.D. = 1.0). The mean number of particles on one plasmid was 8.7 (S.D. = 2.3; Fig. 7 A). Most of the particles did not look like nucleosomes, which suggests two possibilities. First, because of the irregular spacing, more than one nucleosome may appear to be one particle. Alternatively, some sort of non-nucleosomal histone-DNA complex may be formed in the absence of ACF. Naked DNA without nucleosomal particles was often seen in the absence of ACF (indicated with arrowheads in Fig.7 A). However, with the addition of ACF before and after histone transfer, the mean size of the particle was 13.8 nm (n = 37; S.D. = 0.56) and 12.9 nm (n = 43; S.D. = 0.35), respectively, and the mean number of particles on one plasmid was 12.3 (S.D. = 2.3) and 14.3 (SD = 2.3; Fig. 7B, C), respectively. This experiment was done more than five times to ensure the accuracy of our results, which suggest that ACF, when added either before or after histone transfer, can generate fine nucleosomal structures. These data are direct evidence that ACF plays a role in chromatin maturation, possibly through its nucleosome-mobilizing activity. Both biochemical and atomic force microscopy analyses illustrate the chromatin assembly consisting of stepwise core histone transfer by a chaperone and subsequent chromatin maturation by ACF (Fig. 8). It should be noted that these distinctly ordered steps can be separated in vitro (Fig.8 A), or may lead directly to the formation of a nucleosomal array without allowing us to witness the clumpy complexes obtained with NAP-1 and histones through the process (Fig. 8 B). We used a purified recombinant system to clarify the mechanisms of chromatin assembly. This biochemical approach allowed us to decipher finer aspects of the chromatin assembly process. Our results reveal the important role of the NAP-1 in the stepwise transfer of core histones and the role of ACF in chromatin maturation. This system, together with atomic force microscopy, should be a useful tool for the direct examination of detailed mechanisms of other phenomena, including chromatin remodeling coupled with transcription, repair, and recombination."

We have shown that p53 is required for efficient nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA photoproducts from global genomic DNA but has no effect on transcription-coupled repair. In order to evaluate whether p53 influences repair indirectly through cell cycle arrest following DNA damage or plays a direct role, we examined repairin vivo in human cells genetically altered to disrupt or regulate the function of p53 and p21. Both primary human fibroblasts and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells wild type for p53 but in which the p21 gene was inactivated through targeted homologous recombination showed no decrease in global repair of UV photoproducts. Human bladder carcinoma cells mutant for p53 and containing a tetracycline-regulated p21 cDNA showed no significant enhancement of repair upon induction of p21 expression. All of the cell lines, including the mismatch repair-deficient, MLH1 mutant HCT116 cells, were proficient for transcription-coupled repair. Clonogenic survival of HCT116 cells following UV irradiation showed no dependence on p21.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ford J.M.

Res. 2000; 459: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NER is a versatile and evolutionarily conserved DNA repair pathway with the ability to remove a wide range of DNA adducts induced by environmental and endogenous sources (6Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 221: 47-70PubMed Google Scholar, 7Petit C. Sancar A. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The most well studied of the lesions repaired by NER are the UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and [6-4] pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs). In humans, three inherited diseases are associated with defects in NER: xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy (8van Steeg H. Kraemer K.H. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 86-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Patients with XP have a very high predisposition to skin cancer, whereas Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy patients are not cancer-prone but exhibit developmental and neurological abnormalities. The mechanism of action of NER in eukaryotes has been well characterized and is attributed to a complex network of proteins that recognize the DNA adducts, produce dual incisions on either side of the lesion, facilitate removal of the excised oligonucleotide, and promote DNA resynthesis and subsequent ligation (9Wood R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The process of NER can be divided into two genetically distinct pathways: the repair of lesions over the entire genome, referred to as global genomic repair (GGR), and the repair of transcription-blocking lesions present in transcribed DNA strands, which is known as transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (10Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 11de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). The loss of p53 function specifically results in decreased GGR of CPDs but has no significant effect on TCR (2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

This specific loss of GGR activity in p53-deficient cells suggests that the defect may involve proteins required specifically for GGR and not TCR, including those required for lesion recognition in genomic DNA, such as XPC; hHR23B, which binds to and stimulates XPC (16Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A. Maekawa T. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4852-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); and XPE (17Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Although a role for p53 in NER has been well established, the precise molecular mechanism governing this effect is not completely understood. It has been suggested that p53 may regulate NER through protein-protein interactions (18Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Freidberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), protein-nonspecific DNA binding (19Jayaraman J. Prives C.

Cancer Res. 2000; 41: 1131Google Scholar), or even indirect roles such as through cell cycle checkpoint functions (21Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). The p53-regulated p21 gene (also known as waf1, cip1, orsdi1) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and has been well documented as a mediator of the p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest following DNA damage (22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). The G1-S phase cell cycle arrest occurs by the binding of p21 to cyclin-dependent kinases responsible for phosphorylation of cell cycle proteins such as the retinoblastoma protein that provide for entry into S phase (23Adams P.D. Li X. Sellers W.R. Baker K.B. Leng X. Harper J.W. Taya Y. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1068-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). p21 also binds to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inhibits DNA replication following damage by neutralizing the function of PCNA (24Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). It has been clearly demonstrated that p21 function is not required for p53-dependent apoptosis and that a different set of p53-transcriptionally regulated genes are responsible for the apoptotic activities mediated by p53 (25Attardi L.D. Lowe S.W. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the role of p21 in other p53-mediated biological processes, such as DNA repair, remains controversial. It has been suggested that p53 indirectly regulates DNA repair following DNA damage through a checkpoint function governed by p21, thereby “allowing time” for repair (21Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct, induced expression of p21 in the absence of wild type p53 or inhibition of p21 expression in the presence of wild type p53 should reproduce the effect of p53 function on NER. Due to different experimental approaches for assessing NER, significant controversy exists in the literature with regard to the potential role of p21 in NER in vivo. For example, using an exogenously introduced damaged reporter plasmid to assess in vivo cellular DNA repair, several groups have suggested that p21 is essential for NER (26Sheikh M.S. Chen Y.Q. Smith M.L. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27McDonald III, E.R. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2250-2255PubMed Google Scholar), whereas using in vitro repair assays others have found p21 dispensable for NER (28Shivji M.K. Ferrari E. Ball K. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that p21 may actually be inhibitory for NER (30Cooper M.P. Balajee A.S. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2119-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Pan Z.Q.

To ascertain whether the role of p53 in NER is through cell cycle arrest following DNA damage, we have evaluated the effect of p21 on NER activity in vivo systematically using a panel of both primary and transformed human tumor cell lines. To measure NER, we have utilized sensitive assays for UV-induced lesions in genomic DNA and in specific DNA sequences at various times following cellular irradiation. Here, we report results obtained with human cell lines wild type for p53 with heterozygous or homozygous knockouts of p21 and with human cell lines with mutant p53, allowing for inducible expression of p21. We present evidence that the absence of p21 has no effect on GGR or TCR and that overexpression of p21 in p53 mutant lines does not enhance NER. We conclude that the p53-regulated cell cycle protein, p21, is not required for either GGR or TCR. The role of p53 in regulating NER thus appears to be independent of its cell cycle checkpoint activity and is potentially mediated by directly regulating the expression and/or activity of target NER gene products. Primary human LF1 fibroblasts, wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous for disruptions of the p21 gene, were a generous gift from Dr. John Sedivy (Brown University). The p21 knockouts were generated using a combination of novel strategies for efficient gene targeting in somatic cells and by establishing a culture system that enabled high single-cell cloning efficiency (32Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). LF1 fibroblasts were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, G418, hygromycin B, and penicillin-streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HCT116 colon adenocarcinoma cells and its derivatives were obtained from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University) (33Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar) and grown in McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HCT116 cells contain a homozygous truncating mutation in the human mismatch repair gene MLH1 (34Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Wei Y.F. Ruben S.M. Carter K.C. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W.A. Fleischmann R.D. Fraser C.M. Adams M.D. Venter J.C. Hamilton S.R. Peterson G.M. Watson P. Lynch H.T. Peltomaki P. Mecklin J.P. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1994; 263: 1625-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Derivatives of HCT116 carrying homozygous deletions of p21 or p53 were generated by a procedure similar to the one described by Brown et al. (32Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). EJ human bladder carcinoma lines and a derivative, EJp21, containing a tetracycline-regulated p21 transgene, were obtained from Dr. Stuart Aaronson (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). These cells contain both an oncogenically activated Ha-ras gene (35Fang L. Igarashi M. Leung J. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and a mutant p53 gene with a mutation in exon 5 that renders it nonfunctional and incapable of transactivating the p21 gene. EJ cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. The EJp21 lines were additionally grown in G418 sulfate (750 µg/ml) and hygromycin B (100 µg/ml) to maintain integration of the two constructs containing the wild type p21 cDNA and the tetracycline-regulated transactivator element. Tetracycline (1 µg/ml) was added to the medium when suppression of p21 expression was required. The EJ and EJp21 lines were grown at 37 °C in 7% CO2.

Open table in a new tab The panel of cell lines used in this study is listed below along with the status of the p53 and/or the p21 protein function. MLH1 status is also indicated in the HCT116 lines. The levels of p53, p21, MLH1, and MSH2 (mismatch repair) proteins in the various cell lines following UV damage were assayed by immunoblot analysis. Total cellular protein was obtained by lysing cells in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, and 100 µg/ml aprotinin. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein quantitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total protein were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in TBS-Tween (TBS-T) with 2% Blotto and detected using mouse monoclonal antibodies to p53 (1:1000 in TBS-T-2% Blotto) (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and p21 (1:200 in TBS-T-2% Blotto) (SX118, PharMingen), followed by a 1-h incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 in TBS-T-2% Blotto). To confirm the MLH1 deficiency in HCT116 cells, anti-MLH1 (Ab1) and anti-MSH2 (Ab2) (Oncogene) antibodies were used. Anti-tubulin antibodies (B512, Sigma) were used to control for protein loading. Protein bands were detected using the Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography (Eastman Kodak Co.). Repair of CPDs and 6-4PPs in the various cell lines at different times following UV irradiation was measured using an immunoslotblot assay (4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were prelabeled with [3H]thymidine for ∼48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and irradiated with 10 J/m2 UV using a germicidal lamp calibrated to deliver a dose of 1 J/m2/sec. The cells were lysed either immediately at 37 °C or after incubation in nonradioactive growth medium for various times following UV exposure. The lysis solution contained 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.1 mg/ml RNase. Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, and the concentrations and specific radioactivity were determined. The genomic DNA was denatured and equal amounts from each sample in TE: 20× SSPE (1:1) were fixed onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in triplicate using a slot-blot apparatus (100 ng of DNA for the detection of CPDs and 1 µg of DNA for the detection of 6-4 photoproducts). Genomic DNA from unirradiated cells was also loaded as a control. The membranes were blocked in 5% Blotto-TBS-Tween and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for either CPDs (1:1000) or 6-4PPs (1:500) (obtained from Toshio Mori) (38Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibodies (1:3000 in phosphate-buffered saline), Supersignal chemiluminescence (Pierce) and phosphorimager detection (Bio-Rad) and analysis (Multi-analyst, Bio-Rad) were employed to detect and quantitate the UV-induced lesions. Data from triplicate DNA samples from three different biological experiments were averaged. To determine the rate of removal of CPDs from the transcribed or nontranscribed strand of a specific gene fragment, strand-specific RNA probes were used to evaluate repair in a 20-kilobase pair KpnI restriction fragment spanning the central region of the DHFRgene (39Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Methods. 1995; 7: 147-161Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine and UV-irradiated with 10 J/m2 (the dose required to introduce an average of one CPD per restriction fragment). The cells were lysed immediately after UV or incubated in nonradioactive growth medium containing 10−5m5-bromodeoxyuridine and 10−6mfluorodeoxyuridine to density label the newly replicated DNA for various times and then lysed. Radioactive and density labeling permitted the isolation of unreplicated DNA by cesium chloride isopycnic density gradient sedimentation. Purified DNA was digested with KpnI. The KpnI-digested samples were treated or mock-treated with T4 bacteriophage endonuclease V (generously supplied by R. Stephen Lloyd, University of Texas-Galveston), which specifically recognizes CPDs. The T4 endonuclease V-digested DNA was electrophoresed in parallel under denaturing conditions, Southern transferred to a membrane, and hybridized with 30 × 106 cpm 32P-labeled strand-specific RNA probes generated by in vitro transcription of the plasmid pGEM0.69EH (39Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Methods. 1995; 7: 147-161Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The frequency of CPDs was calculated using the ratio of full-length restriction fragments in the T4 endonuclease V-treated and untreated samples and Poisson's distribution. Exponentially growing cells were plated at very low cell densities (250–10,000 cells/100-mm dish) and exposed to UV irradiation at doses ranging from 0 to 20 J/m2. After culturing for 10–14 days, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed and stained by a 30-min incubation in 1% methylene blue in 50% ethanol/50% water. Colonies with greater than 50 cells were scored, and the plating efficiency and percentage of survival for each dose was calculated. Data from two different biological experiments were averaged. Initial studies on the effect of heterozygous and homozygous disruption of the p21 gene on GGR and TCR were performed in normal human fibroblasts. Knockouts of the p21 gene were generated by Brown et al. (32Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) by sequential gene targeting, first using a construct containing the neomycin-resistance gene, followed by a construct containing the hygromycin-resistance gene. The levels of p21 and p53 were assayed in the various cell lines following 15 J/m2 of UV irradiation. In the LF1 primary human fibroblasts wild type for p53, p21+/+ cells showed the expected UV-dependent induction of p21 levels, reaching a maximum at 48 h following UV (Fig.1 A). The p21 levels in the heterozygote p21+/– line were also induced by 16 h, peaking at 48 h. The p21−/− line had no immunodetectable levels of p21 protein, as expected. Up-regulation of the p53 protein was observed in all three cell lines (Fig. 1 A). To evaluate the role of p21 in GGR, an immunoslotblot assay with monoclonal antibodies to CPDs and 6-4PPs was used to measure the removal of UV-induced lesions from total genomic DNA. In LF1, nearly 100% of 6-4PPs were removed by 4 h following UV irradiation, and ∼40–50% of CPDs were removed by 24 h (Fig. 1 B). This repair was similar in efficiency and kinetics to a number of other wild type primary human fibroblast cell lines previously examined (2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar,4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Because LF1 fibroblasts with somatic disruptions of the p21 gene were available, we were further able to assess the effects of loss of one or both wild type p21 alleles on GGR and compare it to repair in wild type primary parental fibroblasts. In fact, both p21+/– and p21−/− fibroblasts exhibited identical GGR of both CPDs and 6-4PPs compared with the p21 +/+ LF1 cells (Fig. 1 B). We have previously shown that p53 has no significant effect on TCR in a variety of cell lines (2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, we wished to examine the potential effects of the p53-regulated p21 gene product on TCR to determine whether p21 played a role in TCR in a p53-independent manner. Using Southern hybridization and strand-specific RNA probes, we found that the repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand of LF1 p21+/– and p21−/− fibroblasts was similar to each other and to the repair observed in the transcribed strands of other primary fibroblast cell lines assayed previously (2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) (∼75% by 24 h) (Fig.1 C). The nontranscribed strands in both the heterozygote and homozygote p21 knockouts were repaired to ∼55–60%, which is the maximum repair observed for CPDs in repair proficient human cell lines. The results from the LF1 fibroblast lines indicate that functional p21 is not required for normal levels of GGR or TCR after UV irradiation in human fibroblasts. Up-regulation of p53 following DNA-damage is intact in all three lines, suggesting a direct regulation of NER by p53, independent of p21. We next examined HCT116 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines with somatic double knockouts of either the p53 or p21 gene, which in turn enabled us to assess the role of p21 in NER in a transformed phenotype. In the HCT116 p53+/+ line, immunoblot analysis demonstrated a UV-dependent up-regulation of the p53 protein starting at 2 h following UV irradiation, reaching peak levels at 8 h (Fig.2 A). Induction of the p21 protein was noted in the p53+/+ lines, whereas no such increase in p21 levels was observed in the p53−/− line. p21 expression was completely abolished in the HCT116 p21−/− line, although we detected normal UV irradiation-dependent induction of the p53 protein. Thus, the Western analyses confirmed that p21 expression is inducible in a UV and p53-dependent manner, when p21 is under the control of its p53-responsive endogenous promoter. GGR activity was measured in the HCT116 colon cancer cell lines, wild type for p53, and sublines containing either disruption of the p21 or the p53 gene. Similar to the LF1 fibroblast lines, these p53 wild type tumor cells exhibited efficient GGR of both 6-4PPs (∼100% by 4 h) and CPDs (∼60% repair by 24 h) (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, homozygous loss of p53 resulted in a decrease in GGR of CPDs (∼30% repair by 24 h), as expected from our previous observations (2Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28073-28080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). However, the HCT116 p21−/− cells showed no loss of GGR activity for either UV-induced CPDs or 6-4PPs, in accordance with results obtained with"

Reversible dissociation of the V1 and V0 domains has been observed in both yeast and insects and has been suggested to represent a general regulatory mechanism for controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo. In yeast, dissociation of the V-ATPase is triggered by glucose depletion, but the signaling pathways that connect V-ATPase dissociation and glucose metabolism have not been identified. We have found that nocodazole, an agent that disrupts microtubules, partially blocked dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion in yeast. By contrast, latrunculin, an agent that disrupts actin filaments, had no effect on glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase complex. Neither nocodazole nor latrunculin blocked reassembly of the V-ATPase upon re-addition of glucose to the medium. The effect of nocodazole appears to be specifically through disruption of microtubules since glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase was not blocked by nocodazole in yeast strains bearing a mutation in tubulin that renders it resistant to nocodazole. Because nocodazole has been shown to arrest cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, it was of interest to determine whether nocodazole exerted its effect on dissociation of the V-ATPase through cell cycle arrest. Glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase was examined in four yeast strains bearing temperature-sensitive mutations that arrest cells in different stages of the cell cycle. Because dissociation of the V-ATPase occurred normally at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures in these mutants, the results suggest thatin vivo dissociation is not dependent upon cell cycle phase.

They function to couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the active transport of protons from the cytoplasm of the cell to either the lumen of intracellular organelles or the extracellular environment.

The peripheral V1 domain contains eight subunits (subunits A–H) with molecular mass of 70–14 kDa and is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The integral V0 domain is composed of five subunits (subunits a, c, c′, c“, and d) with molecular mass of 100–17 kDa and is responsible for translocation of protons across the membrane. The V-ATPases thus resemble the F-ATPases (or ATP synthases), which function in ATP synthesis (12Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Unlike the F1 and F0 domains, however, the separate V1 and V0 domains are not capable of ATP hydrolysis or passive proton translocation under normal physiological conditions (18Forgac M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because of the variety of functions served by V-ATPases in the cell, it is likely that the activity of V-ATPases is tightly controlled. Several mechanisms have been proposed for controlling V-ATPase activityin vivo, including reversible disulfide bond formation between conserved cysteine residues at the catalytic site (19Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19769-19772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13224-13230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), changes in the tightness of coupling between proton transport and ATP hydrolysis (21Nelson N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Arai H. Pink S. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3075-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and changes in the density of V-ATPases through selective targeting (10Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gluck S.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 21: 351-360Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among the regulatory mechanisms for which there is the most compelling evidence is reversible dissociation of the V-ATPase complex. Kane (24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that in yeast, the V-ATPase undergoes dissociation into its component V1 and V0 domains in response to removal of glucose from the medium. This dissociation occurs rapidly, does not require new protein synthesis, and is rapidly reversed upon re-addition of glucose to the medium (24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the V-ATPase has also been shown to occur in insects during molting (25Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to occur in mammalian cells based upon the existence of pools of free V1 and V0 domains (26Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation may thus represent a general mechanism for regulating V-ATPase activity. Several recent studies have suggested an important link between V-ATPases and the cytoskeleton. A temperature-sensitive mutation inVMA4 was reported to cause a defect in actin distribution and bud morphology (28Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18470-18480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In renal cells, the V-ATPase has been shown to interact with the PDZ protein NHE-RF, which in turn is able to bind actin-associated proteins such as ezrin (29Bretton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Finally, direct binding of V-ATPase to actin filaments has been demonstrated in osteoclasts (30Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings have led us to investigate the possible role of interaction between the V-ATPase and cytoskeletal elements in glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase in yeast.

Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of nocodazole for 2.5 h with shaking at 30 °C. Latrunculin was added from a 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of latrunculin for 15 min with shaking at 30 °C. Control cells were treated with an equal amount of Me2SO. Dissociation and reassembly of the yeast V-ATPase were induced by glucose depletion or re-addition to the medium (24Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, yeast cells were grown overnight to mid-log phase, and then cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with zymolyase (24Kane P.M. J. Biol.

For measurement of the effects of inhibitors on dissociation, spheroplasts were incubated in the absence or presence of inhibitors as described above and then resuspended in YEPD or YEP (yeast extract/peptone) medium containing 1.2 m sorbitol and the same concentration of inhibitors, followed by incubation for 40 min at 30 °C. For measurement of the effects of inhibitors on reassembly, spheroplasts were first incubated in YEP medium containing sorbitol for 40 min at 30 °C to induce dissociation, then incubated in the absence or presence of inhibitors as described above, and finally resuspended in YEPD or YEP medium containing sorbitol and the indicated inhibitors for 40 min at 30 °C.

The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting was performed using both anti-subunit A antibody 8B1-F3 and monoclonal antibody 10D7 directed against the 100-kDa subunit a of the V0 domain (35Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were developed using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). For temperature-sensitivecdc mutants, yeast strains were grown overnight to mid-log phase at 25 °C and converted to spheroplasts as described above. Spheroplasts were then incubated at 25 or 37 °C for 4 h. Dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion was measured at both 25 and 37 °C as described above. Actin filaments were visualized in fixed cells using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin as previously described (36Alison E.M. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed for 1 h in 3.7% formaldehyde, and the fixed cells were washed and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 6 μmrhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 1 h in the dark. Cells were then washed extensively and resuspended in mounting solution (90% glycerol and 0.1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine). Microtubules were visualized by immunofluorescence as previously described (37Solomon F.L. Connell D. Kirkpatrick V. Praitis V. Weinstein B. Carraway K. Carraway C. The Cytoskelton. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 197-222Google Scholar). Cells were fixed by incubation in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed, and permeabilized by incubation with zymolyase and Glusulase. The permeabilized cells were attached to polylysine-coated slides, and the microtubules were visualized by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin followed by a Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Axiovert 10 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a rhodamine filter for actin staining and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter for microtubule staining. In both cases, a 40× objective was used, and the images were recorded using a CCD camera. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as previously described (38Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay, and proton transport was measured using ATP-dependent quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy-acridine fluorescence quenching, both as previously described (39Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activities were measured in both the absence and presence of the specific V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A (1 μm). Recent studies have suggested that there may exist interactions between the V-ATPase and cytoskeletal elements (28Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

Because dissociation of the V-ATPase has been proposed to represent an important mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo(24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Dissociation of the V-ATPase in yeast was induced by incubation of spheroplasts in glucose-free medium (24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was detected by solubilization of the V-ATPase with detergent and immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against subunit A of the V1domain (34Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was then performed using antibodies against both subunit A and the 100-kDa subunit a of the V0domain (35Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation appeared as a reduction in the amount of the 100-kDa subunit a immunoprecipitated with the antibody directed against subunit A, as previously described (33Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22075-22081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, preincubation of spheroplasts with the actin filament-disrupting agent latrunculin (40Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) had no effect on dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion. By contrast, preincubation with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole (41Hasek J. Svobodova J. Streiblova E. Eur. J.

To determine the effects of these agents on in vivo reassembly of the V-ATPase, spheroplasts were first incubated in glucose-free medium to induce dissociation; incubation was continued in the absence or presence of the inhibitors; and finally, glucose was added back to the medium to induce reassociation of V1 and V0domains. The assembly status of the V-ATPase was assessed as described above. As can be seen from the data in Fig.2, neither latrunculin nor nocodazole blocked reassembly of the V-ATPase upon re-addition of glucose. These results suggest that in vivo dissociation, but not reassembly, of the V-ATPase is dependent upon the presence of intact microtubules, but that neither process requires intact actin filaments.Figure 2Effect of nocodazole and latrunculin on glucose-dependent reassembly of the yeast V-ATPase.Wild-type cells (YPH499) were grown to mid-log phase and converted to spheroplasts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spheroplasts were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in YEP medium without glucose to induce dissociation of the V-ATPase. Spheroplasts were then incubated in the absence or presence of 40 μmnocodazole for 2.5 h or of 0.2 mm latrunculin for 15 min at 30 °C, followed by incubation for 40 min at 30 °C in YEP medium with or without glucose and in the continued presence or absence of the corresponding inhibitor. Spheroplasts were solubilized with detergent; the V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated with the anti-subunit A antibody; and Western blotting was performed using antibodies against both subunits A and a as described in the legend to Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the effects of latrunculin and nocodazole on the cytoskeleton in yeast, cells were treated with either latrunculin or nocodazole, and the actin and microtubular networks were visualized using staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin or a polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, although latrunculin completely disrupted the actin cytoskeleton in yeast, nocodazole had almost no effect on actin. By contrast, treatment with nocodazole completely disrupted the microtubular network, whereas latrunculin had relatively little effect on microtubules (Fig. 4). These results suggest that nocodazole is affecting dissociation of the V-ATPase through disruption of microtubules, rather than through a more general disruption of the cytoskeleton.Figure 4Effect of nocodazole and latrunculin treatment on microtubule staining in yeast. Wild-type yeast cells (YPH499) were grown to mid-log phase and then incubated with 2% Me2SO for 2.5 h (control), 0.2 mm latrunculin for 15 min, or 40 μmnocodazole for 2.5 h. After incubation, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde and permeabilized by treatment with zymolyase, and the microtubules were visualized using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-tubulin followed by a Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test whether the inhibitory effect of nocodazole is due to disruption of microtubules, glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase was measured in two yeast strains bearing mutations in tubulin that result in resistance to nocodazole. DBY7051 and DBY8154 were selected for resistance to the structurally related compound benomyl (31Richards K.L. Anders K.R. Nogales E. Schwartz K. Downing K.H. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1887-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but the mutation in the TUB2 gene present in these strains also results in resistance of growth to nocodazole (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase was unaffected by nocodazole in both the DBY7051 and DBY8154 strains. These results suggest that nocodazole exerts its effect on dissociation of the V-ATPase through disruption of microtubules, rather than through some nonspecific target. Nocodazole inhibits mitosis and arrests yeast cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle through disruption of microtubules involved in formation of the spindle body (42Guthrie B.A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that nocodazole inhibited dissociation of the V-ATPase indirectly by blocking progression of cells through the cell cycle. To test this possibility, glucose-dependent dissociation was examined in yeast strains bearing temperature-sensitive mutations in CDC genes that result in arrest of cells in different stages of the cell cycle. Mutations in theCDC2, CDC8, CDC15, andCDC28 genes result in arrest of yeast cells at the nonpermissive temperature in the G2, S, M, and G1 phases of the cell cycle, respectively (32Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1993; 134: 63-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase, incubated at either the permissive (25 °C) or nonpermissive (37 °C) temperature for 4 h, converted to spheroplasts, and then incubated in either the absence or presence of glucose at the same temperature as the original incubation for an additional 40 min. The V-ATPase was solubilized and immunoprecipitated, and assembly was assessed as described above. As shown in Fig. 6, glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase was nearly identical at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures in all four yeast strains, although somewhat reduced immunoprecipitation of subunit A was observed in the strain bearing a mutation in CDC8incubated in the absence of glucose at both temperatures. These results suggest that nocodazole does not inhibit dissociation of the V-ATPase in yeast by blocking progression of cells through the cell cycle. The results also indicate that glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase can occur at any stage of the cell cycle. Disruption of microtubules has been shown to lead to fragmentation of the central vacuole in yeast (42Guthrie B.A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas glucose depletion leads to coalescence of vacuolar membrane vesicles into a single large vacuole (38Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This suggests that the assembly status of the V-ATPase may be sensitive to vacuolar morphology and that nocodazole inhibits dissociation by preventing formation of a single vacuole on glucose depletion. To test this idea, assembly of the V-ATPase was measured in response to exposure of cells to two other stress conditions shown to lead to formation of a single large vacuole, namely ethanol shock and nitrogen starvation (43Meaden P.G. Arneborg N. Guldfeldt L.U. Siegumfeldt H. Jakobsen M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Teichert U. Mechler B. Muller H. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16037-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7, neither of these conditions led to dissociation of the V-ATPase complex. Incubation of spheroplasts in medium lacking nitrogen for up to 3 h also induces no V-ATPase dissociation (data not shown). These results indicate that although formation of a single large vacuole in yeast may be a necessary condition for dissociation of the V-ATPase to occur, it is not a sufficient condition. Because mutations that lead to inhibition of V-ATPase activity have been shown to inhibit dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Merdek K. Vogel P.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32869-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it was possible that nocodazole might inhibit dissociation through some direct effect on the activity of the V-ATPase. To test this, concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport were examined in vacuoles isolated from spheroplasts incubated in the absence or presence of nocodazole. As shown in Table II, no differences in either ATP hydrolysis or proton transport were observed following treatment with nocodazole, suggesting that nocodazole does not block dissociation by irreversibly inhibiting V-ATPase activity.Table IIEffect of nocodazole on ATPase activity and proton transport by the yeast V-ATPase in isolated vacuolesRelative ATPase activityRelative proton transport−concanamycin+concanamycin−concanamycin+concanamycinControl10010 ± 11003 ± 1Nocodazole-treated98 ± 412 ± 296 ± 54 ± 1Wild-type yeast cells (YPH499) were grown to mid-log phase and converted to spheroplasts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Spheroplasts were then incubated in YPD medium in the absence or presence of 40 μm nocodazole for 2.5 h, followed by lysis and isolation of vacuoles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport were measured for isolated vacuoles in the absence and presence of 1 μm concanamycin A using a coupled spectrophotometric assay and uptake of acridine orange, respectively. Values are expressed relative to activities measured for control vacuoles in the absence of both nocodazole treatment and concanamycin A. The specific activity of the ATPase in control vacuoles in the absence of concanamycin A was 1.2 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein.

The specific activity of the ATPase in control vacuoles in the absence of concanamycin A was 1.2 μmol of ATP/min/mg of protein. To test whether the dependence of in vivo dissociation on microtubules resulted from some direct interaction of the V-ATPase with tubulin, spheroplasts were incubated in the absence or presence of glucose and the absence or presence of nocodazole; the V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated using the antibody against subunit A; and Western blotting was performed using both antibodies against subunit A and β-tubulin. As can be seen from the data in Fig.8 (lanes 2–5), no association of β-tubulin with the V-ATPase was detectable under any of the conditions tested. Because both the intact V-ATPase and the V1 domain would be immunoprecipitated using the antibody against subunit A, this result also indicates that β-tubulin does not directly bind to the V1 domain. In addition, no β-tubulin was detectable in vacuoles isolated from spheroplasts incubated in the absence or presence of nocodazole (Fig. 8, lanes 6 and7). These results suggest either that the V-ATPase does not directly associate with microtubules or, if it does, that this association does not persist following cell disruption or vacuole isolation. Although dissociation of the V-ATPase complex has been shown to represent an important mechanism of regulating activity in both yeast (24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insects (25Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which dissociation is controlled remains unknown. In yeast, dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion has been shown to require catalytic activity of the enzyme (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46MacLeod K.J. Vasilyeva E. Merdek K. Vogel P.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32869-32874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many of the signaling pathways that are activated upon removal of glucose from the medium are not involved in dissociation of the V-ATPase. These include the Ras-cAMP pathway, the Snf1p kinase-regulated pathway, the protein kinase C-dependent pathway, and the protein phosphatase 2A-dependent stress response pathway (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the assembly status of the V-ATPase does not appear to be controlled by the level of glucose 6-phosphate in the cell, the earliest intracellular metabolite of glucose, as is the case for at least some of the other processes controlled by glucose in yeast (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, V-ATPase assembly is dependent upon the presence and further metabolism of rapidly fermentable carbon sources, including glucose, fructose, and mannose (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion has been suggested to represent a mechanism of conserving cellular stores of ATP (24Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, there appears to exist a considerable surplus of V-ATPase activity in the cell that is not essential to maintain a wild-type growth phenotype (i.e. growth at pH 7.5) since mutants possessing as little as 20% of wild-type V-ATPase activity still show normal growth at pH 7.5 (47Liu J. Kane P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10938-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 48Liu Q. Kane P.M. Newman P.R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2018-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, cells may retain sufficient capacity to acidify their intracellular compartments even upon glucose depletion. A transient decrease in cellular ATP levels has been measured in yeast upon glucose depletion and has been suggested to serve as a possible trigger in the dissociation process (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, V-ATPase assembly cannot be directly tracking ATP levels in the cells since ATP concentrations are restored within 20 min of glucose removal, whereas the V-ATPase remains dissociated (45Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this study that dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion is dependent upon intact microtubules, but not on actin filaments. This result was somewhat unexpected given previous reports of V-ATPase association with actin (30Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and actin-associated proteins such as the ezrin-binding protein NHE-RF (29Bretton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The latter protein has been shown to bind to the B1isoform of the V-ATPase in renal B-type intercalated cells, and this interaction has been suggested to be involved in the selective targeting of V-ATPases to the apical or basolateral membrane in these cells. Moreover, direct interaction between the V-ATPase and actin has been demonstrated in osteoclasts (30Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), cells that have the capacity to target V-ATPases to the plasma membrane (11Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Fuchs R. Baron R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6257-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, actin/V-ATPase interactions may be important only in cells that target V-ATPases to the cell surface. Since V-ATPases are restricted to intracellular compartments in yeast, interactions between V-ATPases and actin filaments may not exist or may be less important than in mammalian cells. It is interesting that although dissociation of the V-ATPase in yeast requires intact microtubules, reassembly of the V-ATPase upon re-addition of glucose does not require microtubules. This suggests that dissociation and reassembly of the V-ATPase may represent independently controlled processes. It is possible that microtubules may be involved in movement of dissociated V1 domains away from the vacuole or in movement of as yet unidentified signaling molecules to the vacuole. In fact, many signaling processes are dependent upon an intact microtubular network (49Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Polarized delivery of intact V- ATPases in renal intercalated cells has also been shown to depend upon an intact microtubular network (50Brown D. Sabolic I. Gluck S. Kid. Int. Suppl. 1991; 33: S79-S83PubMed Google Scholar), but this result most likely represents the dependence of vesicular movement on microtubules. In contrast to the reported association of the V-ATPase with actin in osteoclasts (30Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), no direct association of tubulin with the V-ATPase could be detected in yeast (Fig. 8). Because disruption of microtubules leads to fragmentation of the central vacuole (42Guthrie B.A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas glucose depletion leads to formation of a single large vacuole (38Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), it is possible that nocodazole inhibits dissociation by preventing vacuolar coalescence. However, dissociation cannot be occurring as a direct result of vacuolar coalescence since other stress conditions that lead to formation of a single large vacuole (i.e. ethanol shock and nitrogen depletion (43Meaden P.G. Arneborg N. Guldfeldt L.U. Siegumfeldt H. Jakobsen M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Teichert U. Mechler B. Muller H. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16037-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) do not cause dissociation of the V-ATPase complex. Thus, formation of a single large vacuole in yeast may be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for dissociation of the V-ATPase to occur. We have also found that dissociation of the V-ATPase is not dependent upon a particular stage of the cell cycle. Thus, nocodazole treatment does not affect V-ATPase dissociation through disruption of the cell cycle. This suggests that the signaling pathways involved in activating dissociation are not specific to a particular stage of the cell cycle. Further work will be required to identify these signaling pathways and to determine whether an intact microtubular network is required for dissociation of the V-ATPase in other systems.

Despite the importance of lipid droplets in normal lipid metabolism and disease, relatively little is known about the structure, lipid, and protein composition or factors that regulate these parameters in lipid droplets. It is generally assumed that the lipid components of lipid droplets are assembled as a core of neutral lipid (triacylglycerol and/or cholesterol ester) surrounded by a surface monolayer composed of polar lipids (cholesterol, phospholipids, and fatty acids) (reviewed in Refs.3Brasaemle D.L.

In contrast, lipid droplets from adipocytes, rich in triacylglycerides, are either secreted into milk or retained within the cell to provide a source of fatty acids for signaling/gene regulation (1Clarke S.D.

In contrast, neither the properties nor regulation of lipid droplets in other cell types have been reported. Increasingly it is recognized that a unique group of lipid droplet-specific proteins are localized as a protein “capsule” localized at the surface monolayer of the lipid droplet (reviewed in Ref. 5Londos C.

However, it is only recently that the function of proteins associated with the lipid droplet surface capsule have begun to be resolved. Upon lipolytic stimulation, the intracellular hormone-sensitive lipase is phosphorylated and translocated to the lipid droplet surface where it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the release of fatty acids from interior core triacylglycerides and cholesteryl esters (25Brasaemle D.L.

However, accessibility of the triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters for lipolysis by hormone-sensitive lipase/cholesteryl esterase is closely correlated with decreased association of perilipin (26Servetnick D.A.

Although these data suggest an intricate balance of protein association with the lipid droplet, relatively little is known regarding either the lipid composition of lipid droplets (7Chanderbhan R.

The nature of lipid droplets from cell types other than adipocytes and steroidogenic cells is essentially unknown. The purpose of the present investigation was 2-fold as follows: first, to examine the protein and lipid structure of such lipid droplets; second, to determine the effect of SCP-2 expression on modulating the lipid and protein components of the lipid droplets. l cells provided a useful model for these purposes based on the following data. (i) l cells have substantial lipid droplets (21Atshaves B.P. Starodub O. McIntosh A.L. Roths J.B. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol.

(ii) SCP-2 expression, transport of cholesterol from lipid droplets (for efflux to cell surface bound HDL), and cellular levels of a lipid droplet-specific protein (adipose differentiation related protein, ADRP) are interrelated in l cells (21Atshaves B.P.

(iii) l cells express low levels of SCP-2 (0.008 ± 0.001% of total protein) (39Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A. Starodub O. Roths J. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J.

Transfection of l cells with a plasmid construct containing the cDNA encoding 15-kDa pro-SCP-2 (the normal SCP-2 gene translation product is the 15-kDa pro-SCP-2 precursor protein) resulted in overexpression and complete posttranslational processing to the 13-kDa SCP-2.

In summary, these data suggested thatl cells provide a useful model to study the protein and lipid components of lipid droplets as well as the effect of increased SCP-2 expression thereon in intact cells. In the present work, cellular subfractionation together with confocal and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy as well as environmental scanning electron microscopy showed the following. 1) The lipid droplets from l cells exhibited properties intermediate to those of lipid droplets from adipose and steroidogenic cells. 2) SCP-2 was not tightly associated with lipid droplets. 3) The expression of SCP-2 significantly altered the lipid and fatty acyl composition of purified lipid droplets, the association of several proteins (important to lipid droplet metabolism) with purified lipid droplets in vitro as well as in intact cells, the targeting of fatty acids and cholesterol to lipid droplets, and/or the association of these lipids with ADRP in intact cells. The results presented herein provide new insights into the structure and regulation of lipid storage droplet lipids on a molecular and functional level.

Data obtained on the environmental scanning electron microscope was obtained with the technical support of Dr. Helga Sittertz-Bhatkar (Electron Microscopy Center, Texas A & M University, TX). Visualization of protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel was accomplished using the Silver Stain Plus kit from Bio-Rad. All reagents and solvents used were of the highest grade available and were cell culture tested as necessary. Cells were grown to confluency in Higuchi medium (48Higuchi K. J. Cell.

As expected, Western blotting showed that the 15-kDa pro-SCP-2 was completely and posttranslationally processed to the mature 13.2-kDa SCP-2 protein. SCP-2 composed 0.036 ± 0.002% of the total proteins in stably overexpressing cells (34Schroeder F. Frolov A. Schoer J. Gallegos A. Atshaves B.P. Stolowich N.J. Scott A.I. Kier A.B. Chang T.Y.

The two systems are functionally linked because uPAR and PAI-1 bind to the ECM component vitronectin (VN). Because integrin signaling alters gene expression patterns, we investigated whether the expression levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 are affected by ECM/integrin interactions. Expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was significantly enhanced when human ovarian cancer cells (OV-MZ-6) were cultivated on fibronectin or collagen type IV. In contrast, VN induced down-regulation of uPA and uPAR while increasing PAI-1 by up to 4-fold. VN-dependent decrease of uPA protein was paralleled by a significant reduction of uPA promoter activity that was even more pronounced upon αvβ3overexpression and depended on the presence of intact Rel protein-binding sites. The activity of Rel transcription factors was also significantly reduced upon αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion to VN. The activity of the Rel-unresponsive PAI-1 promoter was up to 5-fold induced as a function of αvβ3/VN interaction.

Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins composed of noncovalently associated α and β chains that recognize peptide motifs, such as RGD, within adhesive ECM proteins (2Hynes R.O. Lander A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 303-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Following ligand interaction, integrins generate intracellular signals that are propagated via their cytoplasmic domains, connecting the extracellular space with the cytoskeleton. Expression of ECM components and integrins is frequently modulated in response to changes within the tumor cell vicinity paralleling tumor cell progression. Certain integrins recognize multiple ECM ligands; precise biological responses, however, are achieved via differential integrin ligation with different ECM proteins (3Giancotti F.G. Rouslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Ovarian cancer cells bind to various ECM constituents, thereby facilitating invasion to the peritoneal epithelial layer. In ovarian cancer cell lines, the integrin repertoire very often encompasses β1 integrins in complex with the integrin subunits α1, α2, α3, α5, and α6, in addition to the integrin αvβ3, which associates with the ECM component vitronectin (VN) (4Carreiras F. Cruet S. Staedel C. Sichel F. Gaudochon P. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 72: 312-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In fact, alteration of αvβ3 and VN expression influences tumor cell growth and survival necessary for cancer progression. The cellular mechanisms promoted via αvβ3 are still rather inconclusive (4Carreiras F. Cruet S. Staedel C. Sichel F. Gaudochon P. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 72: 312-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was noted that αvβ3 expression occurs at a significantly higher rate in advanced ovarian tumors than in ovarian tumors of low malignant potential (5Liapis H. Adler L. Wick M.R. Rader J.S. Human Pathol. 1996; 28: 443-449Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Compared with well differentiated ovarian cancers, in poorly differentiated ones, the β3 subunit is often absent, whereas the expression of αv is maintained. VN as a major ECM ligand of αvβ3 not only represents a primary adhesion substrate for established ovarian cancer cell lines but is also detectable in normal ovarian epithelium as well as in differentiated ovarian tumors (4Carreiras F. Cruet S. Staedel C. Sichel F. Gaudochon P. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 72: 312-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Carreiras F. Denoux Y. Staedel C. Lehmann M. Gaudochon P. Gynecol. Oncol. 1996; 62: 260-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For invasive tumor cells a marked ability to degrade ECM molecules is well documented. There is a large body of experimental and clinical evidence for a key function of the serine protease uPA in pericellular proteolysis. By virtue of its ability to generate plasmin from plasminogen it promotes pro-invasive matrix degradation within the tumor vicinity (1Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar). On tumor cell surfaces, uPA interacts with a specific high affinity receptor, uPAR (CD87). Upon binding to uPAR, uPA enhances its catalytic activity (7Vassalli J.D. Baccino D. Belin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 8Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 269-279PubMed Google Scholar), which is under the control of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (9Blasi F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 415-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because many tumor cells synthesize uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1, the underlying regulatory mechanisms have been studied at the protein and the transcriptional levels. As such, the promoters of uPA and PAI-1 have been characterized in detail (10Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 215-237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar); the human uPA promoter contains, besides binding sites for other transcription factors (11Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P.

Two Rel-like binding sites are located in tandem repeat at nucleotide positions −1865 and −1835, respectively (11Riccio A. Grimaldi G. Verde P. Sebastio G. Boast S. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2759-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,17Novak U. Cocks B.G. Hamilton J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); another has been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the uPA gene between nucleotide positions −1592 and −1572 and was termed Rel-related binding element (18Hansen S.K. Nerlov C. Zabel U. Verde M. Johnson M. Baeuerle P.A. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 205-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In fact, Rel proteins are involved in the development and progression of cancer by altering the adhesive and proteolytic properties of tumor cells (19Higgins K.A. Perez J.R. Coleman T.A. Dorshkind K. McComas W.A. Sarmiento U.M. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9901-9905Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 20Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Blood. 1993; 82: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Rel transcription factor family, such as RelA (p65) and NFKB1 (p50), as heterodimers rapidly transmit signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after dissociation from their cytoplasmic inhibitor IκB, resulting in immediate changes in gene transcription (21Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In earlier studies we have demonstrated that Rel proteins substantially contribute to elevated uPA gene expression in human ovarian cancer cells, thereby promoting the multiple functions of uPA during tumor growth and metastasis (22Reuning U. Wilhelm O. Nishiguchi T. Blasi F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3889-3893Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Reuning U. Guerrini L. Nishiguchi T. Page S. Seibold H. Magdolen V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The human PAI-1 promoter contains recognition sites for transcription factors including PEA3, AP1, AP2, and Sp1, whereas perfect consensus motifs for the binding of Rel proteins are lacking (24Irigoyen J.P.

Physical association of uPAR with β integrins modulates their interaction with certain ECM proteins (26Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R.

Both uPAR and PAI-1 compete mutually and with integrins for VN binding (32Deng G. Royle G. Wang S. Crain K. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

PAI-1 bound to VN exerts its full inhibitory activity toward uPA; however, the resulting uPA·PAI-1 complex displays a markedly diminished affinity for VN (40Deng G. Royle D. Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); uPA binding to uPAR enhances the interaction of uPAR with VN. The strength of the association of PAI-1 and uPAR with VN and their level of expression in concert with uPA and integrins influence the balance between tumor cell adhesion and detachment (30Wei Y.

Because integrins are known to affect gene expression via intracellular signaling (3Giancotti F.G. Rouslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar), we asked whether cross-talk occurs between both systems by investigating the impact of ECM/integrin interaction on expression levels of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1. The focus is on the effects of αvβ3-mediated adhesion of human ovarian cancer cells to the ECM protein VN as the shared ligand between αvβ3, uPAR, and PAI-1. Cell culture media, supplements, Lipofectin®, VN, and laminin (LN) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc./Becton Dickinson. [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and ECL Western blot kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fibronectin (FN) was purchased from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed to RelA (sc-109-X) were bought from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed to αvβ3 (clone LM609) or αvβ5 (mAb 2019Z) were purchased from Chemicon (Hofheim, Germany). The polyclonal antibody directed to αv was obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts (Heidelberg, Germany); the mAb directed to β3 (clone PM6/13) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Alexa-488-labeled goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The cyclic peptides cRGDfV and cRADfV were synthesized at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (Technische Universität München, Garching, Germany) according to previous publications (41Aumailley M.

Poly-l-lysin (PL), collagen type I (Col-I), collagen type IV (Col-IV), andp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide were purchased from Sigma. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay kit, the firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmids pGL2-Basic, and theRenilla luciferase reporter gene vector pRL-SV40 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/myc-His and mAb directed to c-Myc (R950–25) were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) were synthesized at Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). The origin and cultivation of the human ovarian cancer cell line OV-MZ-6 (44Möbus V. Gerharz C.D. Press U. Moll R.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 antigen concentrations in cell lysates and cell culture supernatants were determined as described (22Reuning U. Wilhelm O. Nishiguchi T. Blasi F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3889-3893Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using ELISA kits IMUBIND uPA 894, IMUBIND uPAR 893, and IMUBIND PAI-1 821 from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). The adhesive capacity of OV-MZ-6 cells was assessed by a modification of the assay described by Landegren (45Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar); 96-well cell culture plates were coated overnight at 4 °C or alternatively for 2 h at room temperature with FN, VN, Col-I, Col-IV, LN (10 µg/ml each), and PL (0.01% w/v), respectively. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cell culture plates were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and washed twice prior to cell plating. Then OV-MZ-6 cells in 50 µl of cell culture medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum were added. At different time points, cells were washed again in PBS, and then 50 µl of substrate (15 mm p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0) were added to determineN-acetyl-β-d-hexoaminidase activity. At distinct time intervals, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of 0.2 m NaOH, 5 mm EDTA, and the changes in optical density were recorded at 405 nm as a measure of number of adherent cells. Linearity of the absorption range to the number of adherent cells has been proven by establishing standard curves with increasing cell numbers. The involvement of αvβ3 in OV-MZ-6 cell adhesion was investigated by applying the αvβ3-directed synthetic cyclic peptide cRGDfV as a competitor (41Aumailley M. Gurrath M. Müller G. Calvete J.

Dose-response curves using the peptide in a concentration range between 10 and 500 µg/ml were established and revealed that cRGDfV was most efficient at a concentration of 250 µg/ml without compromising cell viability, which is in accordance with previously published results by others (46Nowlin D.M.

Nishiguchi T. Page S. Seibold H. Magdolen V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The human PAI-1 promoter (−798 to +142) (25Riccio A. Lund L.R. Sartorio R. Lania A. Andreasen P.A. Danφ K. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2805-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA of OV-MZ-6 cells as a template and applying the primers 5′-AAA AAC CCG GGA AGC TTA CCA TGG TAA CCC CTG G-3′ and 5′-AAA AAG GTA CCC TGA AGT TCT CAG AGG TGC CTT GC-3′. The amplicon was subcloned into the SmaI andKpnI sites of the plasmid pGl2-Basic, and the amplified insert was sequenced. Full-length cDNAs for integrin subunits αv and β3, kindly provided by J. Loftus (Mayo Clinic, Scotsdale, AZ), were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/myc-His. The plasmid containing three κB consensus sequence-binding elements for Rel proteins following the sequence of the thymidine kinase promoter in front of the reporter gene luciferase was a generous gift of K. Brand (Department of Clinical Chemistry, Munich, Germany) (50Haas M. Page S. Page M. Neumann F.-J. Marx N. Adam M. Löms Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of OV-MZ-6 cells with the reporter gene constructs and the different expression vectors were conducted using Lipofectin® (23Reuning U. Guerrini L. Nishiguchi T. Page S. Seibold H. Magdolen V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Stable OV-MZ-6 cell transfectants overexpressing the integrin αvβ3 were generated and isolated upon neomycin selection (G418, 1 mg/ml) (51Fischer K. Lutz V. Wilhelm O. Schmitt M. Graeff H. Heiss P. Nishiguchi T. Harbeck N. Kessler H. Luther T. Magdolen V. Reuning U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stable OV-MZ-6 cell transfectants carrying the empty plasmid served as controls. From each transfection, several OV-MZ-6 cell clones were isolated after immunocytochemical verification of αvβ3 overexpression by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) using the mAb LM609 directed to αvβ3. Promoter activity measurements were performed with the dual firefly Renillaluciferase reporter gene assay kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Transient transfections were performed in the presence of 1 µg of the uPA and PAI-1 promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs, respectively. To normalize for varying transfection efficiency, OV-MZ-6 cells were cotransfected with 30 ng of theRenilla luciferase reporter gene vector pRL-SV40. Relative uPA promoter activity was calculated upon normalizing the results from firefly luciferase activity measurements to the values obtained forRenilla luciferase activity (23Reuning U. Guerrini L. Nishiguchi T. Page S. Seibold H. Magdolen V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PAI-1 promoter activity was measured by the same procedure. Rel DNA binding activity was determined by utilizing a luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing three tandem κB repeats upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (50Haas M. Page S. Page M.

For transient overexpression of αv and/or β3, OV-MZ-6 cells were cotransfected with the expression plasmids pcDNA3.1/myc-His encoding either αv or β3 using concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3 µg/well. These dose-response curves revealed that cotransfections using the expression plasmids at a concentration of 1 µg/well was most efficient, so that for all further experiments these plasmid concentrations were applied in all reporter gene assays. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts of OV-MZ-6 cells were prepared, and gel retardation analysis was performed as described (52Guerrini L. Blasi F. Denis-Donini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9077-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The double-stranded ODN 5′-CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGA-3′ encompassing the Rel consensus motif was radiolabeled by using the Klenow fragment. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses for the determination of uPA mRNA concentrations in OV-MZ-6 cells as a function of αvβ3 overexpression was performed as described (22Reuning U. Wilhelm O. Nishiguchi T. Blasi F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3889-3893Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PAI-1 transcript concentrations were also evaluated by reverse transcriptase-PCR applying the ODN 5′-GGC GCA GGC CTC CAA GGA CCG-3′ and 5′-GGT CCA CGG TCC TTT CCC AAG C-3′. As control for equal RNA loading and for normalization of reverse transcription efficiency, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (amplicon size, 194 base pairs) was amplified in the same PCR reaction. Expression of αv and β3 by OV-MZ-6 cells was evaluated by flow cytofluorometry using the FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson). Viable cells were blocked in PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA with polyclonal antibody directed to αv (20 µg/ml) or mAb directed to β3 (1 µg/ml). The cells were again washed in PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG. Fluorescent signals in the presence of the secondary Ab alone as well as in the presence of control IgG of rabbit or mouse origin instead of the primary Ab served as controls (53Chucholowski N.

OV-MZ-6 cells were grown on microchamber slides, fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and blocked for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA. The mAb LM609 directed to αvβ3 (1 µg/ml) was incubated with the cells in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of the specific antigens was conducted by applying secondary Alexa-488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (45 min at room temperature). After three washes in PBS, the slides were mounted and the fluorescence intensity was evaluated by CLSM. Staining in the absence of antibody (as a measure of OV-MZ-6 cell autofluorescence), in the presence of Alexa-488-labeled IgG alone, or in the presence of irrelevant control IgG served as background controls. Cells lysis was performed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm"

The molecular basis of the influence of this TGFβ signaling on the IL-6 receptor triggered cascade is unknown. We studied IL-6-induced secretion of the acute phase protein haptoglobin by hepatoma cells. Overexpression of the C/EBPβ gene, a downstream effector in the IL-6 pathway, activated transcription from the haptoglobin promoter. This was abolished by either a constitutively active form of activin A type IB receptor (CAactRIB) or by a combination of Smad3 and Smad4. Similarly, Smads abolished transcriptional activation by co-stimulation with IL-6 and STAT3. The transcription co-activator p300 partially overcame the suppressive effect of Smads. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that C/EBPβ binding to haptoglobin promoter DNA was reduced by over-expression of CAactRIB and Smad4. We thus show that Smad proteins operate as transcription inhibitors on target genes of the IL-6 induced pathway. The effect of Smads is exerted on components of the transcription activation complex and may also involve interference with DNA binding. This study thus depicts molecular sites of interaction between the TGFβ superfamily and the IL-6 signaling cascades.

This is followed by recruitment into the complex and phosphorylation of activin receptor type IB (actRIB), which is responsible for downstream signal transduction.

Following activation, they undergo homodimerization and then heterodimerize with Smad4 (Co-Smad) that lacks the C-terminal phosphorylation motif and is therefore not activated by type I receptors (6Zhang Y.

Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and associate with the closely related transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP. The latter interact with a variety of transcription factors and thereby link these factors to the basal transcription machinery (18Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol.

A hallmark in Smad signaling is therefore their interaction with other transcription regulators. Engagement of the activin A receptors is further followed by increased expression of inhibitory Smad7, which binds to type I receptors and antagonizes further signal transduction (21Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone M.A.J. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

One major question raised therefore is how does activin A elicit, in different cells, distinct biological responses. The ActR-triggered signaling cascade was found to interact with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (24Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar), and such cross-talk among cascades may contribute to the diversity of responses. We have shown that activin A kills tumor plasmacytomas and hybridomas (25Zipori D. Tamir M. Toledo J. Oren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Brosh N. Malik Z. Burstein Y. Zipori D. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), by competitively overcoming the survival and proliferation-promoting effects of IL-6 (27Brosh N. Sternberg D.

This competition did not occur on the level of interactions of IL-6 with its receptor complex (27Brosh N. Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Lee B.C. Shav Tal Y. Tzehoval E. Shulman L.M. Toledo J.

In this hybridoma model, cell functions, survival and proliferation, all depends on IL-6. On the other hand, we found that activin A slows down HepG2 hepatoma cell growth through hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma, without causing cell death (28Zauberman A. Oren M. Zipori D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1705-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It further blocked, in these hepatoma cells, the IL-6-induced expression of the acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp) (27Brosh N. Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Lee B.C. Shav Tal Y. Tzehoval E.

In the present study, we show that this happens because of suppression of transcriptional activation of the Hp promoter by Smad proteins. The human hepatoma HepG2 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Beth Hemeek, Israel), 20 mml-glutamine, 60 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 mg/liter kanamycin.

Recombinant activin A was obtained from the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, National Hormone and Pituitary Program and was used at 300 units/ml unless indicated otherwise. The acute phase protein haptoglobin was monitored in conditioned medium under nonreducing conditions (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Extracts were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with specific monoclonal antibodies (HG-36, Sigma). Chemiluminescent signals were generated by incubation with the ECL reagent. The gels were exposed to x-ray film. prHp (190)-CT plasmid, containing a 190-bp fragment from the Hp promoter, was a gift from Dr. Heintz Baumann (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY) (30Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 190-bp fragment was subcloned upstream of a luciferase gene into pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA of C/EBPβ was subcloned from pBlue610, a gift from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan) into pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). STAT3 was expressed in pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). Drs. Y. Zhang and R. Derynck (University of California, San Francisco) provided the plasmids harboring Flagged Smad3, Flagged Smad4, and Flagged Smad2 (8Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The Smad genes were subcloned into pcDNA3. The PAI-1 promoter-reporter construct was a gift of Dr. D. J. Loskutoff (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Dr. Peter ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) provided Flagged Smad7 and CAactRIB (ALK4-QD) constructs. pVP22 constructs, full-length Flagged Smad genes, were constructed in-frame, into pVP22/myc-His Vector (Invitrogen) resulting in fusion proteins. The CMVβp300HA construct was provided by Dr. Steven Grossman (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Transient transfections with the appropriate vectors were carried out using the calcium phosphate method. Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase orRenilla activities by cotransfection of 0.5 μg of CMV β-galactosidase or 2 ng of pRL-CMV expression vectors, respectively. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (Falcon) and transfected with 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid and different DNA constructs in a final volume of 1.5 ml. The total amount of DNA was normalized using empty vector. Six h after transfection, cells underwent glycerol shock and 24 h later were-serum starved and incubated in the presence or absence of IL-6 as indicated. Cells were then harvested, and the luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined according to standard procedure with the aid of a Turner Designs luminometer. Cells were plated in 10-cm plates and transfected with the indicated vectors using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclear cell extracts were prepared as described previously (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar), mixed with 1–3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 110 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 4% glycerol, 0.05 mmZnCl2, and 0.25% bromphenol blue. The mixture was kept on ice for 10 min, and then the end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was added, and incubation was continued for 20 min longer on ice. The reaction product was loaded on a 5% neutral polyacrylamide gel and run in a Tris-glycine running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, and 10 mm EDTA). For supershift analysis, rabbit polyclonal anti-C/EBPβ antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After proteins were allowed to bind the probe, samples were incubated with the antibodies for another 15 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide probe used was a double-stranded DNA element from the haptoglobin promoter containing the C/EBPβ site (top strand) as follows: CCGACATTGTGCAAACACAGAAATGGAAG. The oligonucleotide for competition was a double-stranded non-relevant DNA element from the haptoglobin promoter (top strand) as follows: TTTGTGGTTACTGGAACAGTCACTGACCT. Activin A is a competitive antagonist of IL-6-induced functions (27Brosh N. Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Lee B.C. Shav Tal Y. Tzehoval E. Shulman L.M. Toledo J. Hacham Y. Carmi P. Jiang w. Sasse J. Horn F. Burstein Y. Zipori D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29594-29600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken with the aim of elucidating the molecular basis for the ability of activin A to block IL-6 signaling using the HepG2 hepatoma cell model. These cells have a low basal level of secretion of APPs that is induced by IL-6. Activin A interfered with IL-6-induced secretion of the acute phase protein, Hp, by the HepG2 hepatoma cell line (Fig.1 A). Hp is known to be expressed in several isotypes, which accounts for the different bands observed. Similar results were obtained when we examined the secretion of an additional acute phase protein, α-acid glycoprotein (27Brosh N. Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Lee B.C. Shav Tal Y. Tzehoval E. Shulman L.M. Toledo J. Hacham Y. Carmi P. Jiang w. Sasse J. Horn F. Burstein Y. Zipori D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29594-29600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effect of activin A was dependent on the time of its application relative to induction with IL-6. Thus, when added prior to IL-6, it caused a more pronounced reduction in Hp production than observed when activin A was added concomitantly with IL-6. By contrast, activin A had virtually no effect when added 17 h post-IL-6 induction (Fig. 1 B). The effect of activin is thus to block Hp production rather than to increase its degradation. To test the possibility that the effect of activin A is mediated by interference with IL-6-induced transcription activation of the Hp gene, we transfected HepG2 cells with a 190-bp fragment of the haptoglobin promoter (30Baumann H. Morella K.K. Campos S.P. Cao Z. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19744-19751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) upstream of a luciferase reporter and measured the response to activin A following activation with IL-6. As shown in Fig.2 A, IL-6 triggered transcription from the 190-bp Hp promoter fragment, whereas addition of activin A markedly reduced this activation.Figure 2Activin A and CAactRIB (CAactR) both suppress transcription activation of the Hp promoter mediated by either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in combination with IL-6. A luciferase reporter plasmid driven by 190 bp of the Hp promoter, pHp(190)-luc, was transfected into HepG2 cells together with CAactRIB or alone. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of pcDNA3. 24 h after transfection, activin A was added as indicated, and after 16 h luciferase activity was measured. A, activin A inhibited IL-6-induced transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. B, similar inhibition was observed when HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmids containing cDNA encoding CAactR and were treated with IL-6. C, Hp promoter activity induced by C/EBPβ or STAT3 in combination with IL-6 was also reduced by CAactR.D, a control experiment for the activity of the CAactR in which the activin A-inducible PAI promoter was used. In all of the luciferase assays, the transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Results of one experiment of three performed are shown. Here and in the following figures, thebars indicate the average luciferase activity ± standard deviation of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Constitutively active actRIB mimics activin A in inhibiting IL-6-induced transcription and suppresses C/EBPβ- and STAT3-induced transcriptional activation of the Hp promoter. The addition of exogenous activin A to the cells could be replaced by transfection with a constitutively active mutant form of actRIB (CAactRIB), which almost completely abolished IL-6-induced transcription from the haptoglobin promoter (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, and as expected, CAactRIB caused marked transcriptional activation of the control luciferase reporter construct that contain the PAI promoter, which has a binding site for Smads (Fig.2 D). These experiments show that the signaling part of the activin receptor complex is sufficient to execute the biological function. Hp promoter contains DNA binding sites to several IL-6-inducible transcription factors. It has been shown that a variety of IL-6 activities are mediated by C/EBPβ and STAT proteins (32Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 33Akira S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 34Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 35Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas C/EBPβ can be tested by direct overexpression in HepG2 cells, STAT3 must first be activated by IL-6 to enable its translocation into the nucleus. CAactRIB reduced C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation of Hp promoter and completely abolished STAT3-induced activation (Fig.2 C) indicating that activin A signaling affects IL-6-induced transcription either on the level of these transcription factors or downstream in the IL-6 signaling cascade. Further experiments were aimed at identifying the molecules within the activin A signaling pathway that mediates its effect on IL-6 signal transduction. This information could then lead to identification of the target molecule for activin A interference within the IL-6 pathway. Signaling by actRIB recruits the cytoplasmic Smad proteins that upon activation and phosphorylation migrate to the nucleus and attach to specific sites in activin A-inducible promoters. Smad7 interacts with activin A type I receptors and blocks further downstream activation of receptor activated Smads. It follows that if activin A operates in the suppression of IL-6 functions through Smad proteins, then Smad7 should override the effects of activin A or of CAactRIB. We found that Smad7 reverted the CAactRIB inhibition of IL-6-induced Hp promoter transcription (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained following independent activation by C/EBPβ or by IL-6-dependent STAT3-induced activation of this promoter (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). However, the IL-6-dependent STAT3-induced transcription was completely restored (Fig. 3 C), whereas that induced with IL-6 itself or with C/EBPβ did not return to control values. Fig. 3 Dshows that PAI promoter activation by CAactRIB is completely abolished by Smad7, verifying the ability of this protein to negatively regulate activin A signaling. We thus showed that Hp promoter activation, which is mediated by C/EBPβ or STAT3, is suppressed by activin A or by a constitutively active form of its signaling receptor. Furthermore, the transcription activation is restored by Smad7, suggesting the involvement of Smad proteins in the suppression of IL-6-induced transcription. To directly examine the role of Smad proteins in activin A-mediated suppression of IL-6-induced transcription, we transfected HepG2 cells with Smad3, Smad4, or both. Co-transfection with Smad3 and Smad4 resulted in the most pronounced suppression of IL-6-induced Hp promoter activity (Fig.4 A). Similar experiments performed with a combination of Smad2 and Smad4 yielded essentially identical results (not shown). It is noteworthy that Smad3 alone also caused significant reduction in the promoter activity, whereas Smad4 alone was inactive. These results are strongly supported by additional experiments in which Hp promoter activation was mediated by either C/EBPβ (Fig. 4 B) or STAT3 (Fig. 4 C). The lack of effect of Smad4 when transfected on its own could be because of its inability to enter the nucleus. To allow for borderline activation of the activin A pathway, we transfected the cells with CAactRIB at a concentration that does not inhibit C/EBPβ-medicated transcription (25–100 ng as compared with 1.5 μg required for complete suppression). Under these conditions Smad4 was sufficient to cause significant suppression of C/EBPβ-induced transcription from the Hp promoter (Fig. 4 D). It is noteworthy that the relationship between the effects of Smad3 alone, as compared with Smad3 and Smad4 together, were maintained when studied on the PAI promoter, although in the case of this activin A-inducible gene, Smads caused augmentation of transcription (Fig. 4 E). We performed further experiments with promoters from several other genes, which were either constitutively active (CMV , GLN-LTR) or specifically activated (IRF, α2M activated by C/EBPβ or STAT3 and IL-6). None of these promoters was suppressed in a manner comparable with APP promoters (data not shown). Taken together these results indicate that activin A operates by activating Smad proteins that in turn suppress IL-6-mediated transcriptional activation of specific promoters. Smad proteins also suppressed transcriptional activation by the IL-6 downstream transcription activators, C/EBPβ and STAT3. This phenomenon was not restricted to the Hp gene because experiments conducted with an IL-6 response element of the β-fibrinogen promoter, which was reported to respond to C/EBPβ and STAT3 (36Baumann H. Jahreis G.P. Morella K.K. Won K.A. Pruitt S.C. Jones V.E. Prowse K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20390-20399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Dalmon J. Laurent M. Courtois G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielded similar results. As shown in Fig.5, A and B, C/EBPβ- or STAT3-induced transcription from the β-fibrinogen IL-6 response element was suppressed by a combination of Smad3 and Smad4, whereas only Smad3 on its own had a partial suppressive effect. Thus, response elements in two independent APP gene promoters are negatively regulated in a similar manner by Smad proteins.Figure 5Smad proteins suppress transcription activation of IL-6 response elements from the β-fibrinogen promoter. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a 5XIL-6RE from the β-fibrinogen promoter and with Smads expression vectors as indicated, along with C/EBPβ (A) and STAT3 (B). Details are the same as in the Fig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the effect of Smad proteins on the endogenous Hpgene in HepG2 hepatoma cells, we used the pVP22 vector system. The VP22 protein has the ability to translocate between cells. After translation in the cytoplasm, the expressed VP22 protein is exported from transfected cells and translocates into the nucleus of adjacent non transfected cells; this subsequently leads to the nuclear expression of the transfected plasmids in a large proportion of the cells. Full-length Flagged Smad genes were constructed in-frame into pVP22 vector as an N-terminal fusion to VP22. The cells were transfected with these constructs and were treated with IL-6 48 h after transfection for a period of 24 h. The end point of these experiments was secretion of the haptoglobin protein following induction with IL-6. Fig. 6 shows that Smad3 together with Smad4 reduced the accumulation of haptoglobin protein in the cultures. p300 has a histone acetyltransferase domain. By acetylation of core histones, p300 loosens the nucleosomal structure and allows access of transcription factors to the general transcription machinery. The study of interactions between Smads and partner proteins that form transcription complexes revealed the functional significance of p300 as a bridge-former that allows the execution of Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Smad3 interacts with p300 with high affinity (18Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). p300 also binds to various transcription factors including STAT3 and C/EBPβ through different segments thereby linking them to the basal transcription machinery (38Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A.L. Levy D.E. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Indeed, we find that p300 by itself increased the transactivation capacity of C/EBPβ and STAT3 (Fig. 7, A andB, respectively). The formation of functional transcription activation complexes depends upon the correct stoichiometric concentrations of the various components. We reasoned that if Smad competes with STAT3 and C/EBPβ on binding to p300, then an excess amount of the latter would prevent the effect of Smad. We therefore co-transfected HepG2 cells with plasmids expressing the transcription factors and CAactRIB along with p300. It was found that p300 reduces, in a dose-dependent manner, the ability of CAactRIB to interfere with IL-6 induction of transcription through either C/EBPβ or STAT3 (Fig. 7, A and B, respectively). In addition, transfection of cDNA encoding E1A, which is known to bind p300, reduced completely the transactivation of the haptoglobin promoter by STAT3 and C/EBPβ (data not shown) indicating that Smads compete with the transcription factors for binding to p300. One possible interpretation of the suppressive effect of Smad proteins on activation of the Hp promoter is that Smads interfere, directly or indirectly, with the binding of the relevant transcription factors to DNA. To test this possibility, we performed EMSA assays by using nuclear extracts obtained from cells transfected with expression vectors. Differences between signals obtained in such EMSA assays may result from the loading of variable amount of protein. To exclude this possibility we verified by Western blotting that equal amounts of C/EBPβ were loaded per lane. Fig. 8details the factors that were examined for their corresponding ability to affect the binding of C/EBPβ to a 20-bp DNA oligonucleotide probe from the Hp promoter. C/EBPβ bound effectively to this fragment as revealed by gel shift and supershift examination (Fig.8 A). This binding was highly specific because it was competed out by an excess of cold promoter fragment, whereas an irrelevant control fragment had no effect. This DNA binding was abolished by overexpression of CAactRIB (Fig. 8 B) presumably through activation of Smads. To further examine this point, we transfected cells with lower amount of the constitutively active receptor to minimize the suppressive effect. Under these conditions transfection with Smad4 leads to further inhibition of DNA binding (Fig. 8 C). Cytokine members of the TGFβ superfamily are pleiotropic molecules exhibiting a variety of biological functions (2Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The present study was focused on the mechanism by which activin A blocks the secretion of the IL-6-induced APP, Hp. Our previous studies have implied that activin A interferes with the signaling cascade induced by IL-6 downstream to the receptor (27Brosh N. Sternberg D. Honigwachs sha'anani J. Lee B.C. Shav Tal Y. Tzehoval E. Shulman L.M. Toledo J. Hacham Y. Carmi P. Jiang w. Sasse J. Horn F. Burstein Y. Zipori D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29594-29600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore focused on the possible interactions of these intracellular transduction pathways. It is shown here that Smad proteins are sufficient by themselves to mediate an activin A-like suppressive effect on Hp promoter activation. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of Smads was reproduced when the Hp promoter was activated by overexpression with the IL-6 pathway transcription factor, C/EBPβ, alone. Smads operate therefore on the level of C/EBPβ and/or downstream in the cascade. A constitutively active form of activin A receptor was effective in suppressing Hp expression by the HepG2 hepatoma cell line. Whereas activin A only partially suppressed Hp promoter activation, CAactRIB almost abolished transcription, possibly because of the sustained signal that a high number of constitutively active receptor molecules per cell elicits, followed by maximal activation of downstream targets. CAactRIB blocked transcriptional activation by C/EBPβ without IL-6 stimulation, indicating that any effect of activin on IL-6 signaling could not occur upstream to C/EBPβ. We could not perform similar experiments with STAT3 protein overexpression because this protein acts synergistically with IL-6 to activate transcription and is insufficient by itself. The 190-bp promoter region used in our experiments was activated by C/EBPβ and STAT3 proteins, which were very effectively blocked by the constitutively active form of the activin type I receptor. It therefore appears that a significant portion of the effect of activin A is due to suppression of C/EBPβ and STAT3 transcription activation. The inhibitory Smad7 abolished the effect of CAactRIB on IL-6 or on the transcription activators C/EBPβ or STAT3. Because Smad7 has been shown to be an inhibitor of receptor-activated Smad2 and Smad3, the results implied the involvement of these intracellular mediators. Direct examination by overexpression of these proteins indicated that Smad3 on its own, and more effectively, a combination of Smad3 and Smad4, suppressed transcriptional activation of the Hp promoter fragment. Overexpression of Smad3 alone was sufficient to cause partial suppression of Hp promoter, probably because of complexing with endogenous Smad4. The use of the pVP22 vector allowed us to examine the endogenous Hp gene. In this study a combination of Smad3 and Smad4 transfection was needed to obtain an effect on Hp secretion. This may be because the endogenous promoter contains sites for binding factors that are additional to those attaching to the 190-bp fragment, and effective suppression of these requires both Smads. The suppressive effect of CAactRIB on C/EBPβ- and STAT3-induced transcription activation was reduced by overexpression of p300. In other experimental systems relating to TGFβ-induced functions, p300 has been shown to physically bind Smad proteins and serve as a co-activator of transcription (18Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 19Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). p300 might be expected to potentiate the Smad effect rather than reduce it. However, p300 participates in transcription activation complex formation by many other factors including C/EBPβ (38Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and STAT3 (39Paulson M. Pisharody S. Pan L. Guadagno S. Mui A.L. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25343-25349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Therefore, under conditions of limiting the amount of p300, the recruitment of this protein by Smad3 would lead to inhibition of C/EBPβ- or STAT3-dependent transcription. By analogy to the effect of Ski oncoprotein in attenuation of TGFβ signaling, wherein this protein reduces the recruitment of p300 into DNA binding complexes and thus suppresses transcription, it is possible that Smad causes dissociation of p300 from C/EBPβ and STAT3 transcription activator complexes. These data are consistent with a model in which Smad proteins sequester p300, inhibiting C/EBPβ and STAT3 functions. Activation of β-fibrinogen by IL-6 or by C/EBPβ can be similarly suppressed by p53 (41Wang L. Rayanade R.J. Garcia D. Patel K. Pan H. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23159-23165Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which physically binds to p300 (42Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), providing further support for the above interpretation of our data. It is well established that Smad proteins are transcription activators for genes inducible by TGFβ superfamily members (3Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 43Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, Smad proteins are also involved in the suppression of transcription in specific circumstances. TGIF (TG-interacting factor) and c-Ski repress TGFβ-mediated transcription by recruiting histone deacetylase and by directly binding to Smad proteins and reducing the recruitment of the co-activator p300 into the DNA binding complex (44Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 45Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I.

Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, in the context of TGFβ-inducible genes, Smad proteins are transcription activators but may also suppress transcription. It has not been shown, to the best of our knowledge, that Smad proteins mediate inhibition of transcription of promoters unrelated to the TGFβ-regulated genes. We show in this study that transcriptional activation of response elements in the APP genes, Hp and β-fibrinogen, which is mediated by IL-6, is inhibited by Smads. These results thus point to a novel cross-talk channel that links the TGFβ serine/threonine receptor-initiated pathway with the IL-6 family tyrosine kinase receptor pathway. Several other studies have implied that TGFβ controls C/EBPβ- or STAT3-mediated pathways. In intestinal rat epithelial cells, TGFβ caused attenuation of a glucocorticoid-dependent increase in expression of C/EBPβ, as well as reduced binding of this transcription factor to specific sites in the haptoglobin promoter (49Yu S.J. Boudreau F. Desilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and to α-acid glycoprotein promoter sites (50Boudreau F., Yu, S.J. Asselin C. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In human T cells, TGFβ antagonizes IL-12-induced activation. Whether the effect of TGFβ in this system is mediated by blocking the phosphorylation, and hence activation of Jak or STAT proteins, remains uncertain (51Bright J.J. Sriram S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1772-1777PubMed Google Scholar, 52Sudarshan C. Galon J. Zhou Y. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2974-2981PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA experiments using cellular proteins showed that overexpression of Smad4 interferes with the binding of C/EBPβ to DNA. It is noteworthy that Smad4 did not by itself interfere with transcriptional activation of the Hp promoter (Fig. 4, A–C) unless the cells were co-transfected with CAactRIB at a concentration that does not suppress transcription (Fig. 4 D). The EMSA experiments were performed under these latter conditions. We predicted that this would assure that the signaling machinery in the cells would be triggered and would permit efficient translocation of Smad4 into the nucleus. This may not occur in the transcription activation experiments in which Smad4 is transfected into the cells on its own without the support of CAactRIB. Thus, the particular conditions used for the DNA binding experiment allowed us to observe a possible new function of Smad4,i.e. a negative effect on C/EBPβ binding to DNA.

First, we demonstrated that both protein splicing and cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction were inhibited in the presence of zinc ion. The trans-splicing reaction was partially blocked at a concentration of 1–10 μm Zn2+ and completely inhibited at 100 μm Zn2+; the inhibition by zinc was reversed in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. We propose that inactivation of Cys160 at the C-terminal splice junction by the chelation of zinc affects both the N-S acyl rearrangement and the transesterification steps in the splicing pathway. Furthermore,in vivo and in vitro assays were established for the determination of intein residues and regions required for splicing or association between the N- and C-terminal intein halves. N-terminal truncation of the intein C-terminal segment inhibited both splicing and association activities, suggesting this region is crucial for the formation of an interface between the two intein halves.

The N-terminal region possesses ∼120–150 amino acid residues including highly conserved blocks A and B, whereas the C-terminal region is composed of ∼35–50 residues containing conserved blocks F and G. Between the two terminal regions is an optional endonuclease domain, which has been found in a majority of inteins (3Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E.

In the case of protein trans-splicing, however, a functional intein is reconstituted from two non-covalently linked N- and C-terminal segments that are separately translated (5Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q.

The intein structure contains an unusual β-fold with the splice junctions at the ends of two adjacent antiparallel β-strands, forming a catalytic pocket. The catalytic residues implicated in the splicing mechanism have been found in the conserved blocks, A and G, present at the two splice junctions (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B.

Other residues and regions that may be involved in assisting these catalytic reactions have yet to be identified, although a highly conserved histidine residue in block B has been found to be necessary for protein splicing (18Kawasaki M. Nogami S. Satow Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15668-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein splicing requires the precise alignment of the two splice junctions to form the active site. Examination of the interaction between the N- and C-terminal intein halves would offer important insight into the tertiary folding that brings all the reacting groups in close proximity.Recently, the crystal structure of a precursor protein containing the Sce VMA intein with the flanking native extein residues was solved (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a zinc atom was found at the catalytic center of this splicing-deficient precursor protein. The residues contributing to the zinc coordination include a cysteine following the C-terminal splice site, which presumably receives the N-extein domain by transesterification, a critical step in the complex splicing pathway. Thus, it is of particular interest to investigate the possibility that zinc may play a modulatory role during the process of protein splicing. However, the rapid processing of intein precursors presents a major obstacle to the conduction of such an investigation (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol.

Similar to the Sce VMA intein, the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residues presumably function as nucleophiles at both the N- and C-terminal splice junctions of the DnaE intein (Fig. 1). In this study, we took advantage of the unique property of thetrans-splicing Ssp DnaE intein to explore the effect of zinc on splicing activity. This trans-splicing system also allowed us to investigate the intein elements responsible for the interaction between the N- and C-terminal halves of a protein splicing element, independent of its catalytic activity. We demonstrated the correlation between the splicing or association functions of the DnaE intein and the reconstitution of Escherichia coliacetolactate synthase isoform II (ALS). Co-expression of the two DnaE intein fragments fused to two halves of ALS rescued E. coliER2744, which lacks an active ALS, from growth inhibition by valine (22LaRossa R.A. Schloss J.V. J. Biol.

The effect of amino acid substitutions or deletions on the splicing and association activities of the two intein halves were further characterized by an in vitro assay system.DISCUSSIONThe work presented demonstrates that zinc inhibitstrans-splicing and trans-cleavage activities of a split intein encoded by the dnaE gene ofSynechocystis sp. PCC6803, possibly by binding to Cys160, an essential catalytic residue at the C-terminal splice junction, and therefore may be a modulatory factor for protein splicing in vivo. Furthermore, the biochemical and molecular genetics experiments led to the identification of novel regions and structural determinants required for association andtrans-splicing of the Ssp DnaE intein.Inhibition of Protein trans-Splicing by Zinc IonSince the discovery of protein splicing a decade ago (29Hirata R. Ohsumi Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), no external energy source, such as ATP or a trans-acting factor, has been found to affect the process. Poland et al. (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported the discovery of a zinc atom at the catalytic center of the Sce VMA intein precursor, which possesses mutations to block its splicing activity. In this context, Cys455, His453, and Glu80, along with a water molecule were found to chelate a zinc atom with the coordinating angles and bond distances exhibiting characteristics of a structural zinc. The first amino acid of the C-extein, Cys455, participates in catalyzing splicing by transesterification (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that mutation of Cys455 inhibits splicing of the Sce VMA intein, whether in the native host protein or in a foreign protein (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Cooper A.A. Chen Y.-J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Hirata R. Anraku Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The identification of a single zinc atom per crystallized protein precursor molecule suggested that zinc binding by the intein is specific (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the chelation of a zinc atom would neutralize the nucleophile present at the C-terminal splice junction for its nucleophilic attack at the thioester bond formed at the N-terminal splice junction. The data presented here show thattrans-splicing activity of the Ssp DnaE intein can be inhibited in vitro in the presence of 1–100 μm zinc ion, which is ∼2–200-fold in excess of protein concentration (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the presence of EDTA, a divalent metal chelating agent, reversed the effect of zinc inhibition. The inhibition appears to be highly specific since other divalent metal ions, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, showed no significant effect on splicing. It is possible that only the splicing-deficient Sce VMA intein precursor could trap and co-crystallize with zinc, since the wild-type precursor molecules fold and undergo processing rapidly (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 11Cooper A.A. Chen Y.-J.

Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Ssp DnaE intein possesses neither a His residue at the penultimate position nor a Glu residue at the equivalent position (Glu80) in block B, which are involved in the coordination of zinc in the x-ray structure of the Sce VMA intein (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is likely that residues at different positions are involved in the coordination of a zinc atom in the Ssp DnaE intein, as proposed by Mills and Paulus (30Mills K.V. Paulus H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10832-10838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further understanding of the mode of zinc binding relies on a precise crystal structure of the Ssp DnaE intein.Inhibition of N-terminal Cleavage by Zinc IonThe work presented also demonstrates that the presence of zinc ion blocks cleavage of the peptide bond at the N-terminal splice site (Fig.2 A). It is possible that chelation of a zinc atom by Cys160 may exclude the binding of DTT, thereby inhibiting its nucleophilic attack on the thioester bond. On the other hand, inactivation of Cys160 by zinc chelation could affect the acyl rearrangement involving Cys1, thereby shifting the equilibrium of amide and thioester to favor amide conformation (Fig.1). This scenario is supported by the observation that cleavage at the N-terminal splice junction can be inhibited by zinc in the mutant carrying the N159A substitution, which blocked splicing but permitted N-terminal cleavage, presumably by hydrolysis of the thioester bond (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, substitution of Cys160with an Ala residue resulted in no N-terminal cleavage, with or without DTT (Fig. 2 D). It has been observed previously that the Cys residue at the C-terminal splice junction of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein has a low apparent pKa, which would facilitate the occurrence of transesterification by attacking the thioester bond involving Cys1 (32Shingledecker K. Jiang S. Paulus H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, Cys160 appears to play an important role in driving the first splicing step and shifting the equilibrium of amide and thioester.Mapping the Regions Required for Intein AssociationProtein splicing is presumably facilitated by inter- or intramolecular recognition between the N- and C-terminal regions of an intein, which may be separated by an endonuclease domain of more than 300 amino acid residues. For cis-splicing inteins, the tertiary folding occurs via intramolecular interactions of the intein sequence elements. The presence of a distinct endonuclease domain or a flexible linker may facilitate the formation of substructures and the folding process. The reconstitution of the split Ssp DnaE intein, however, requires a high affinity intermolecular interaction (33Martin D.D. Xu M.-Q. Evans T.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The work presented here shows that the association function of the two intein segments is separable from its catalytic activity. trans-Splicing activity, however, appears to correlate with the interaction between the two intein halves, signifying that the interaction of the two fragments is necessary for the formation of the correct tertiary structure required for splicing. The data suggest that the N-terminal region of IC, adjacent to the conserved block F and part of β10, is essential for intein association. Intein C-terminal fragments carrying 6–12-amino acid deletions are not capable of complementing the growth defect of ER2744 host cells or splicing in vivo or in vitro (Table I and Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). The substantially lower affinity of IC possessing a deletion, for the wild-type IN could be due to the disruption of the three-stranded β-sheets (β10:β5:β6). The C-terminal 23 residues of IN appear not to be required for either association or splicing, probably because they constitute a flexible linker region (Fig. 3 A). For the Mxe GyrA intein, the linker region forms a disordered loop and two α-helices extended from the β-core and does not appear to interact with the active site (9Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has yet to be determined whether the DnaE intein possesses a linker region with substructures corresponding to the α-helices of the GyrA intein (9Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the DnaE intein sequence upstream of this region appears to align with the amino acid residues of the GyrA intein that participate in formation of the β9 strand, which appears to interact with the intein C-terminal segment, and therefore may be important for the formation and stabilization of the active site. Indeed, in the ALS fusion constructs further truncations of this region, as shown in the INΔ45 mutant, abolished splicing and failed to produce active ALS. The reduced interaction in vitro between INΔ45 and wild-type IC suggests that the region involved in formation of the β7 and β8 strands is important for both splicing and intein association (Fig. 6 C). The 29-residue deletion, presumably disrupting only part of β9 strand, inhibited splicing but had little effect on association in vitro; however, partial growth was observed in the plate assay. The intein splicing and association activities could be affected by the extein context, which may result in the discrepancy between thein vivo and the in vitro data. These ALS intein fusion proteins could have suboptimal interactions, whereas MBP and GST, are effective at promoting the solubility of proteins to which they fused and probably interact proficiently (34Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar).Effect of Mutations in Blocks B and F on Splicing and Association ActivitiesThe data from the in vivo functional screen and in vitro analysis indicate that the conserved residues in blocks B and F are crucial for splicing but not for association of the two intein fragments. Substitution of Thr69 or His72 in block B with an alanine residue inhibited splicing but still permitted interaction between the two intein segments. These mutants failed to generate the spliced ALS proteins (Fig.5 D) but were capable of complementing the valine-sensitive growth defect of ER2744 strain (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that active ALS can be reconstituted by the association of the two intein halves. The conserved Thr69 and His72 in block B are implicated to participate in the acyl rearrangement, based on their positions in the active site of the Mxe GyrA intein or the Sce VMA intein (9Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this study acyl rearrangement, however, does not appear to absolutely depend on Thr69 or His72, since the T69A and H72A mutant proteins exhibited DTT-induced cleavage activity (Fig. 6). It has been shown previously that mutation of the conserved His in block B of the Sce VMA intein abolished splicing activity in E. coli, but the single mutant was still capable of producing an active VMA protein in yeast (18Kawasaki M. Nogami S. Satow Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15668-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, single amino acid substitutions may not completely block splicing as interactions from other intein residues may be sufficient to catalyze the reaction.Our study provides the first experimental evidence that block F region is essential for splicing, but not association (Table I and Figs. 5 and6). Crystallographic study of the Sce VMA intein reveals that several residues, including Ile434 and Phe444 in block F, participate in the formation of a hydrophobic surface at the back of the intein C-terminal asparagine residue. Alanine replacement of DnaE intein Phe139 and Phe149, corresponding to Ile434 and Phe444 of the Sce VMA intein (Fig.3) inhibited splicing, supporting the hypothesis that they may participate in the cyclization of asparagine (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ser179of the Mxe GyrA intein and Thr435 of the Sce VMA intein, at the equivalent position of the DnaE intein residue Asp140, have been implicated in assisting the cyclization of intein C-terminal asparagine (9Klabunde T. Sharma S. Telenti A. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although DnaE intein residue His147 is highly conserved among inteins (20 out of 24 eubacterial inteins), its role has not been elucidated. However, the presence of a His, at the equivalent position, in the vicinity of the active pocket of the Sce VMA intein suggests that it may play an important role in splicing (19Poland B.W. Xu M.Q. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16408-16413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have characterized several important aspects of protein splicing. Zinc inhibition, together with the reversibility of EDTA, could provide a novel approach to modulate protein splicing and peptide bond cleavage. The in vivo functional screen along with an in vitro assay helped to dissect the regions of the intein essential for splicing and interaction between the two intein halves. Furthermore, a functional enzyme can be produced either by protein trans-splicing or by the association of two intein fragments (23Sun L. Ghosh I. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Chen L. Pradhan S. Evans T.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 2001; 263: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, the methods demonstrated here should open up new avenues in the application of self-splicing inteins to express and modify proteins. Protein splicing is a post-translational processing event, which involves the self-catalyzed excision of an internal protein segment, or intein, from a protein precursor with the concomitant joining of the flanking polypeptide sequences, the exteins (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 2Perler F.B. Davis E.O. Dean G.E. Gimble F.S. Jack W.E. Neff N. Noren C.J. Thorner J. Belfort M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1125-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment reveals that an intein can be divided into three segments. The N-terminal region possesses ∼120–150 amino acid residues including highly conserved blocks A and B, whereas the C-terminal region is composed of ∼35–50 residues containing conserved blocks F and G. Between the two terminal regions is an optional endonuclease domain, which has been found in a majority of inteins (3Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of protein trans-splicing, however, a functional intein is reconstituted from two non-covalently linked N- and C-terminal segments that are separately translated (5Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6Gorbalenya A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of inteins from a vacuolar ATPase subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PI-SceI or Sce VMA intein),1 Mycobacterium xenopi GyrA (Mxe GyrA intein), and Pyrococcus furiosusribonucleotide reductase (PI-PfuI) revealed that the N- and C-terminal regions form a horseshoe-shaped Hint (hedgehog and intein) domain (7Duan X.

Biol. 1998; 5: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The intein structure contains an unusual β-fold with the splice junctions at the ends of two adjacent antiparallel β-strands, forming a catalytic pocket. The catalytic residues implicated in the splicing mechanism have been found in the conserved blocks, A and G, present at the two splice junctions (10Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Presumably, these residues directly participate in protein splicing by three concerted nucleophilic replacements (1Paulus H. Annu. Rev.

Other residues and regions that may be involved in assisting these catalytic reactions have yet to be identified, although a highly conserved histidine residue in block B has been found to be necessary for protein splicing (18Kawasaki M.

https://openalex.org/W1996260808,"Although agonist binding in adrenergic receptors is fairly well understood and involves residues located in transmembrane domains 3 through 6, there are few residues reported that are involved in antagonist binding. In fact, a major docking site for antagonists has never been reported in any G-protein coupled receptor. It has been speculated that antagonist binding is quite diverse depending upon the chemical structure of the antagonist, which can be quite different from agonists. We now report the identification of two phenylalanine residues in transmembrane domain 7 of the α1a-adrenergic receptor (Phe-312 and Phe-308) that are a major site of antagonist affinity. Mutation of either Phe-308 or Phe-312 resulted in significant losses of affinity (4–1200-fold) for the antagonists prazosin, WB4101, BMY7378, (+) niguldipine, and 5-methylurapidil, with no changes in affinity for phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine, methoxamine, or phenylephrine. Interestingly, both residues are involved in the binding of all imidazoline-type agonists such as oxymetazoline, cirazoline, and clonidine, confirming previous evidence that this class of ligand binds differently than phenethylamine-type agonists and may be more antagonist-like, which may explain their partial agonist properties. In modeling these interactions with previous mutagenesis studies and using the current backbone structure of rhodopsin, we conclude that antagonist binding is docked higher in the pocket closer to the extracellular surface than agonist binding and appears skewed toward transmembrane domain 7.

Similar to rhodopsin, these proteins are proposed to traverse the plasma membrane in a series of seven transmembrane-spanning α-helical domains linked by three intracellular and three extracellular loops (1Guarino R.D. Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In accordance with the observation that the greatest structural conservation is localized to the transmembrane helical domains of the receptor, the catecholamine binding pocket is also localized to these regions. Mutagenesis studies in our laboratory and others have identified that the endogenous agonist in biogenic amine receptors is stabilized in the binding pocket by ionic, hydrogen bond, and aromatic/hydrophobic interactions involving residues on TM3, TM5, and TM6, although there are various modulations of these interactions between the families (2Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Dixon R.A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4383-4388Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 3Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that α1-ARs and perhaps some other biogenic amine receptors have additional aromatic/hydrophobic interactions with the endogenous agonist to residues in TM4 and TM5 (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of how antagonists bind to the adrenergic receptor family is limited. Mutagenesis studies in our laboratory have identified that the subtype selectivity of two α1a-AR antagonists, phentolamine and WB4101, is conferred by interactions with three consecutive residues of the second extracellular loop (7Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained in the 5-HT1Dreceptor (8Wurch T. Colpaert F.C. Pauwels P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the opioid receptor (9Li X. Varga E.V. Stropova D. Zalewska T. Malatynska E. Knapp R.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: R1-R2Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that in contrast to agonist binding, which is localized to the interior core of the receptor, antagonists interact with residues closer to the extracellular surface of adrenergic receptors, above the plane of the agonist binding pocket. Further point contacts between α1-antagonists and extracellular residues of this receptor could not be identified using a series of α1a-/β2-AR chimeras. Therefore, the high-affinity binding of these drugs to the receptor must involve additional interactions with residues within the transmembrane domains of the receptor (10Zhao M.-M. Gaivin R.J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Other previous mutagenesis studies have indicated the importance of phenylalanine residues located close to the extracellular surface of the receptor in antagonist binding at adrenergic receptors. A single phenylalanine residue about two turns into the TM7 domain of the α2-AR (Phe-412) was shown to promote high-affinity binding of yohimbine (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of a phenylalanine residue (Phe-86) at the surface of TM2 in the α1a-AR accounts for the α1aversus α1d selectivity of dihydropyridine antagonists such as niguldipine (12Hamaguchi N. True T.A. Saussy Jr., D.L. Jeffs P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14312-14317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a phenylalanine residue (Phe-310 of the α1b-AR) in TM6 has been identified as being important not only for agonist binding but also for the binding of certain α1-antagonists (13Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In light of these studies and given that the α1-antagonists contain high aromatic/hydrophobic character, we continued our investigation into the role of aromaticity/hydrophobicity in antagonist binding at α1-ARs. We now report the importance of two conserved phenylalanine residues near the extracellular surface of TM7 involved in nonselective binding for several α1-antagonists. Our studies suggest that α1-antagonists bind the receptor in an elevated pocket from agonist binding that is also skewed toward TM7.

Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar) was performed using polymerase chain reaction technology and commercially synthesized oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) specifically designed to code for the desired mutation. A fragment of cDNA encoding either the F312A or F312N mutation of the rat α1a-AR was generated using sense primers containing the unique EcoRI cloning site before the start site of translation and an antisense primer targeted to the unique AhaIII site of the rat α1a-AR that also encoded the mutation. The F308A or F308L mutations were generated using a sense primer containing the mutation targeted to the endogenous MseI restriction site and an antisense primer containing the NotI restriction site after the stop codon. Using the Expand High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), these specific fragments of the rat α1a-AR were generated using 1 μg of pMT2′ rat α1a-AR plasmid, 300 nm sense and antisense primers, 200 nm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 2.6 units of Taq and Pwo DNA polymerase in a 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, and a final MgCl2 concentration of 1.5 mm. All polymerase chain reactions were conducted in 10% (v/v) glycerol. The amplification reactions, which were repeated for 40 cycles, consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and an annealing and elongation phase at 72 °C for an additional 3 min. The polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments resulting from each of the reactions were isolated and purified, followed by eitherEcoRI/AhaIII (Phe-312 mutations) orMaeI/NotI (Phe-308 mutations) restriction enzyme digestion. The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated with their respective WT fragment and subcloned into the pMT2′ expression vector to yield the full-length rat α1a-AR construct containing single mutations. Mutations were confirmed by full-length sequence analysis of the construct by the dideoxy method (Cleveland Clinic Sequencing Core Facility). COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were maintained and passaged upon reaching confluence by standard cell culture techniques. Experiments were conducted on cells between passages 10 and 25. Cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or mutated α1a-AR subcloned into eukaryotic expression plasmid pMT2′ using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (15Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as described previously (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-1 cells were scraped 72 h after transfection, collected, washed in Hank's balanced salt solution, and then pelleted under low-speed centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in a 0.25 m sucrose solution and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in water containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and frozen at −70 °C for 30 min. Pellets were dounced from a B glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclear debris was removed by a low-speed centrifugation step. Membranes in the supernatant were washed with HEM buffer and pelleted by high-speed centrifugation. The membrane pellet was washed twice in HEM buffer, and the final pellet was reconstituted in HEM buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −70 °C until use. The protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay, using bovine serum albumin as the known standard. Saturation binding experiments to measure the affinity of 125I-HEAT at α1a-ARs were performed as described previously (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of various adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists were determined in a series of competition binding experiments performed as described previously (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All binding assays were performed in duplicate in HEM buffer, in a total assay volume of 250 μl. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of radioactivity that remained bound to the filters in the presence of 10−4m phentolamine. Competition binding data were analyzed using the nonlinear regression functions of the noniterative curve fitting program GraphPad Prism. Binding affinities (K i ) were determined by transformation of the program-calculated IC50value using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. The binding data for each ligand were modeled to one- or two-site binding. The most suitable model was determined by performing an F test comparison of the least sum of squares fit of the data to these equations. Statistically significant differences in the affinities of agonists and antagonists were determined by t test analysis. Models depicting the binding interactions of antagonists to the α1a-AR were generated as described previously using Insight II molecular modeling software from Biosym Technologies (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinates of the α-carbon positions were determined by an overlay of the α1a-AR residues with the TM coordinates of rhodopsin (16Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5050) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the comparison of residues located in TM7 for the α1-ARs as well as all other adrenergic receptors. The biogenic amine family has a consensus domain of WXGXNSXXNPXXY that is thought to be involved in signal transduction and sequestration but not directly involved in binding per se. (17Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused our attention on aromatic residues located closer to the extracellular border. TM7 has two aromatic residues; both are absolutely conserved in both the α1- and α2-AR subtypes, but not in the β-AR subtypes. These two residues, Phe-308 and Phe-312 in the α1a-AR subtype, are predicted to be near the extracellular surface of the receptor (Fig.2), with Phe-308 located in the first helical turn, and Phe-312 located in the second turn on TM7. The analogous residue to Phe-312 in the α2-AR is also thought to confer α2-AR versus β-AR selectivity for yohimbine (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the importance of these residues in α1-AR binding, we mutated Phe-308 to either Ala or Leu (to examine hydrophobicity versus aromaticity, respectively), and we mutated Phe-312 to either Asn or Ala (to examine α-AR to β-AR selectivity and α1-AR hydrophobicity, respectively).Figure 2Secondary structure model of the TM7 domain of the rat α1a-AR. Mutated residues (Phe-308 and Phe-312) are shown in gray. Phe-308 is predicted to be in the first helical turn of TM7, whereas Phe-312 is in the second helical turn. Amino acids are represented by the one-letter code.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding results for a series of α1-AR, α2-AR, and β-AR antagonists are presented in Table I. All binding curves resulted in one-site fits. In saturation binding studies, the radiolabeled antagonist 125I-HEAT bound to each of the mutated receptors with comparable affinity and density as determined for the wild type α1a-AR. To determine changes in α1-antagonist affinity, a number of ligands were tested at the Phe-308 mutants. There were no changes in affinity at either mutant for phentolamine, prazosin, or 5-methylurapidil. However, WB4101 (10–25-fold), BMY7378 (3–4-fold), and (+) niguldipine (8–30-fold) had lower affinity at either substitution. We then tested both α2-AR and β-AR antagonists to address cross-family selectivity issues. All ligands tested but alprenolol showed no changes from WT α1a-AR affinity; alprenolol had a 36-fold increased affinity, but only at the F308L mutation.Table IAntagonist affinities at wild type and TM7 phenylalanine mutations of the α1a -ARWTF312NF312AF308AF308Lα1-AR antagonistsPhentolamine8.1 ± 0.28.1 ± 0.38.0 ± 0.38.6 ± 0.38.3 ± 0.1Prazosin9.5 ± 0.29.9 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.2 (85) 1-ap < 0.01.9.5 ± 0.29.3 ± 0.35-Methylurapidil9.0 ± 0.18.9 ± 0.37.7 ± 0.1 (21) 1-bp < 0.001.9.7 ± 0.58.8 ± 0.2WB410110.2 ± 0.19.8 ± 0.29.5 ± 0.2 (5) 1-cp < 0.05.9.2 ± 0.1 (10) 1-bp < 0.001.8.8 ± 0.2 (25) 1-bp < 0.001.BMY73786.8 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.47.0 ± 0.26.2 ± 0.1 (4) 1-ap < 0.01.6.4 ± 0.1 (3) 1-ap < 0.01.(+) Niguldipine9.3 ± 0.46.2 ± 0.4 (1200) 1-ap < 0.01.6.3 ± 0.1 (1000) 1-bp < 0.001.7.8 ± 0.5 (30) 1-ap < 0.01.8.3 ± 0.5 (8) 1-ap < 0.01.125I-HEAT1-dpK D from saturation studies as described under “Experimental Procedures.”9.7 ± 0.19.9 ± 0.29.6 ± 0.29.7 ± 0.29.7 ± 0.1B max(pmol/mg)0.250.150.170.270.21α2-AR antagonistYohimbine5.3 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.055.2 ± 0.15.4 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.1β-AR antagonistsAlprenolol5.1 ± 0.035.1 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.34.9 ± 0.36.6 ± 0.2 (36) 1-bp < 0.001.Propranolol5.1 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.15.25 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.2pK i values for drugs were determined in competition binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All competition binding isotherms were best fit to a single-site model.

However, imidazoline-type agonists such as oxymetazoline and clonidine displayed a 13-fold and a 4-fold decrease in affinity from the WT, respectively.Table IIPhenethylamine versus imidazoline agonist bindingWTF312NF312AF308AF308LPhenylethylaminesEpinephrine5.8 ± 0.26.2 ± 0.45.8 ± 0.56.3 ± 0.86.4 ± 0.7Phenylephrine5.0 ± 0.025.8 ± 0.35.0 ± 0.35.3 ± 0.15.3 ± 0.8Methoxamine4.2 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.43.7 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.1ImidazolinesOxymetazoline8.0 ± 0.27.8 ± 0.65.8 ± 0.2 (150) 2-ap < 0.001.7.5 ± 0.036.9 ± 0.01 (13) 2-bp < 0.05.Cirazoline6.0 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.35.1 ± 0.2 (8) 2-bp < 0.05.6.1 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.1Clonidine6.1 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.4 (25) 2-cp < 0.01.4.7 ± 0.1 (25) 2-cp < 0.01.5.8 ± 0.35.5 ± 0.04 (4) 2-bp < 0.05.pK i values for drugs were determined in competition binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All competition binding isotherms were best fit to a single-site model.

Data are reported as the mean ± S.E.M. of three to five experiments. Binding results for a series of α1-AR, α2-AR, and β-AR antagonists are presented in Table I. In saturation binding studies, results of Phe-312 mutations were similar to those of the Phe-308 mutations. The radiolabeled antagonist 125I-HEAT bound to each of the mutated receptors with wild type α1a-AR affinity. Receptor density of the Phe-312 substitutions was also similar to that of the WT and the Phe-308 mutations. α1-Antagonist affinities were decreased for prazosin (85-fold), 5-methylurapidil (21-fold), WB4101 (5-fold), and (+) niguldipine (1000-fold). These changes were all at the F312A mutation, with only niguldipine showing additional changes at the F312N mutation. Affinities for the α2-AR and β-AR antagonists were also unchanged from the WT, as seen for the Phe-308 mutations. In agonist binding at the Phe-312 mutations (Table II), the results were similar to those of the Phe-308 mutations in that phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine, phenylephrine, and methoxamine were unchanged from WT. Again, imidazoline-type agonists showed decreased affinity with oxymetazoline (150-fold), cirazoline (8-fold), and clonidine (25-fold). Aromaticity/hydrophobicity has been shown to be important in the binding of agonists and antagonists to the various subtypes of adrenergic receptors. Recently, we have identified two novel aromatic interactions promoting agonist binding that involve two phenylalanine residues located at the extracellular surface of TM4 and TM5 of the α1a-AR (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These residues were modeled to form contacts from above the plane of the agonist pocket. Until recently, determination of residues involved in antagonist binding at α1-ARs was limited to two domains. One is located on the second extracellular loop of the receptor. These consecutive residues (Gln-177, Ile-178, and Asn-179) are involved only in α1a-AR versus α1b-AR selectivity issues and then for only three ligands, phentolamine, WB4101, and partial effects on 5-methylurapidil (7Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Another group has shown that mutagenesis of a phenylalanine residue (F86M) at the surface of TM2 in the α1a-AR accounts for the α1aversus α1d selectivity of dihydropyridine antagonists such as niguldipine (12Hamaguchi N. True T.A. Saussy Jr., D.L. Jeffs P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14312-14317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This aromatic residue is also modeled to be in the first helical turn of TM2. Nevertheless, both these previous interactions involve selectivity issues and separate domains of the receptor and involved only certain antagonists. A major antagonist docking site has never been reported in any adrenergic receptor family member, let alone any G protein-coupled receptor; thus, it has been thought that these ligands are very diverse in their binding parameters because of the diversity of their chemical structures. Aromaticity/hydrophobicity should be more important in antagonist binding than in agonist binding, given the higher degree of these contacts contained in adrenergic antagonists and their decreased aqueous solubility. Agonists typically have one aromatic ring and hydrophilic substitutents, whereas α1-AR antagonists are larger molecules with multiple aromatic/hydrophobic ring components. However, little is known of specific residues involved in antagonist binding, even among other adrenergic receptor family members. Chimeras between the β1- and β2-AR failed to reveal discrete residues (18Dixon R.A. Hill W.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Proteins. 1989; 6: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Marullo S. Emorine L.J. Strosberg A.D. Delavier-Klutchko C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, a single residue in TM7 (either Phe-412 in the α2 or Asn-385 in the 5-HT1a) seemed responsible for certain β-AR antagonist selectivity (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Guan X.-M. Peroutka S.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 695-698PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to explore additional residues involved in antagonist binding, we postulated that in addition to the antagonist pocket being closer to the extracellular surface than agonists, the pocket must also be skewed but sufficient in overlap to maintain competitive interactions. Because we and others have found agonist interactions in TM3 through TM6 for the α1-AR (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Porter J. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23189-23195Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and an antagonist-binding residue in TM7 in α2-/β2-ARs (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in TM6 for a few α1-antagonists (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the antagonist pocket must also be skewed toward TM6 and TM7. We therefore focused our attention on TM7 of the α1-AR for mutagenesis studies. As shown in the sequence alignment (Fig. 1), the phenylalanine residue at position 308 of the α1a-AR is conserved across all the cloned adrenergic receptor subtypes except the β2-AR, where the aromaticity is conserved as a tyrosine residue. Two mutations of this residue were made: (a) a F308A mutation in which the side chain packing and the potential for Van Der Waal's interactions were minimized, and (b) a F308L mutation in which the aromaticity of the side chain was removed, but hydrophobicity was maintained. The phenylalanine at position 312 was mutated in expectation of cross-family selectivity issues such as those found in the α2-AR, β2-AR, and 5-HT1areceptors (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Guan X.-M. Peroutka S.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 695-698PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to reproduce this same system, we mutated Phe-312 to Asn, the same corresponding residue found in the β-ARs and the 5-HT1A. This mutation would also test hydrophobicity. We also made the F312A substitution to explore potential packing interactions. Mutation of either Phe-308 or Phe-312 did not change the affinity of125I-HEAT, the radiolabeled antagonist (Table I). This supports the position that the overall global conformation of the receptor was maintained, and the changes in affinity we do see with other ligands are specific. Likewise, there are no significant differences in receptor expression as measured by changes inB max. Interestingly, there are no published reports of any residue that specifically changes the affinity of125I-HEAT, which leads to speculation regarding how this antagonist actually binds in the pocket to accommodate this larger iodinated species. Inclusive of this report, all α1-antagonists except for 125I-HEAT had at least one point binding contact identified in the receptor. Nevertheless, because mutation of either 308 or 312 does produce specific affinity changes, but only in antagonists and imidazolines, it is reasonable that the mutations are involved in direct contacts and not in global or nonspecific changes in receptor structure. II). In α1-antagonist binding, either Phe-308 or Phe-312 substitutions or sometimes both residues displayed lower binding affinities for all α1-AR antagonists tested; the only exception was phentolamine (Table I). The degree of change varied (3–1200-fold), but this is likely due to the variances in structure. Both prazosin (85-fold) and niguldipine (1200-fold) had the greatest decrease in affinity, which coincidently correlates to these ligands having the highest binding affinities for α1-ARs (subnanomolar). It is likely that Phe-308 is involved in mostly aromatic binding because both the Ala and Leu substitutions resulted in roughly equal losses in affinity. In contrast, it appears that Phe-312 is most likely involved in packing interactions because most of the changes in affinity were at the Ala substitution and not at the Asn substitution. In modeling these interactions and using the current coordinates of rhodopsin (16Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5050) Google Scholar), the binding orientation of WB4101 is illustrated in Fig. 3A. This model incorporates the residues involved in subtype-selective affinity changes in WB4101 (30-fold) that we described previously that are located in the second extracellular loop (7Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). According to the structure of rhodopsin, the second extracellular loop folds down into the binding pocket of retinal and likewise in our model folds down sufficiently to allow interactions with WB4101. The portion of the loop near TM5 was previously found to contain charged interactions with WB4101, and thus these moities are orientated toward the charged portions of the antagonist. The extracellular loop interactions still allow aromatic interactions with Phe-308 and Phe-312 that are likely due to the phenyl ring. This docking of WB4101 is consistent with its placement above the plane of the agonist pocket (note the orientation of Ser-188 and Ser-192, which are involved in phenethylamine agonist binding, (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Interaction of Asp-106 and the amine group of the antagonist is still possible but would be a weak interaction due to a greater separation than agonist binding. However, this result is consistent with previous mutagenesis of Asp-125 in the α1b-AR, in which antagonist binding was not affected as greatly as agonist binding (5Porter J. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Modeling of the other antagonists produced similar results, with one end of the molecule interacting with Phe-308 and Phe-312, whereas the other end was orientated more toward TM6 than TM4–5. The model is also consistent with the reason why phentolamine did not change affinity with either TM7 mutation. All of the ligands that changed affinity in this report have long and extended structures, whereas phentolamine is more compact and is likely confined to TM5–6 and the loop regions and not extended to TM7. Consistent with this interpretation, phentolamine displayed an 8-fold loss of affinity at the second extracellular loop mutations (7Zhao M.-M. Hwa J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar) and a 10-fold loss at the Phe-310 mutation in TM6 (13Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but did not do so with either TM7 mutation. Interestingly, we found that all imidazoline-type agonists also decreased affinity with Phe-308 and Phe-312 substitutions. The affinity of oxymetazoline, a weak partial agonist, was decreased at F308L (13-fold) and F312A (150-fold). Decreases in affinity were also found for other imidazolines such as cirazoline (8-fold) and clonidine (25-fold). Imidazolines have been proposed to bind differently in the agonist pocket than phenethylamine agonists such as epinephrine because many mutants that affect phenylethylamine binding do not change imidazoline binding (6Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.-M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, in earlier studies, the Eason-Stedman hypothesis predicted that imidazolines bind differently than phenethylamines (23Ruffolo R.R. Turowski B.S. Patil P.N. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1977; 6: 378-380Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This is also supported by signaling studies in which imidazolines lack cross-desensitization with phenethylamine agonists, suggesting different activation and signaling parameters (24Ruffolo R.R. Rice P.J. Patil P.N. Hamada A. Miller D.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 86: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the imidazoline ring has protonated nitrogens that are involved in binding to Asp-106 in TM3 and is required for agonism (5Porter J. Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28318-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), modeling of this ligand (Fig. 3B) requires that the imidazoline ring must be pointed toward TM3, but the second aromatic ring analogous to epinephrine must then orient toward TM7. This is in sharp contrast to epinephrine binding, in which the aromatic ring is orientated toward TM5 (4Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of imidazolines is also skewed toward TM7 and located higher in the pocket, much like antagonist binding. Mutation of Phe-412 to Asn (analogous to Phe-312 in the α1a-AR) in TM7 of the α2-AR also resulted in lower binding affinity for p-aminoclonidine, another imidazoline agonist (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting perhaps a conserved binding paradigm for imidazolines in both α1- and α2-ARs. However, our current results suggest that they also have some antagonist-like binding character due to their involvement of TM7, which may orient imidazolines differently than phenethylamines and account for their generally poor agonism at α1-ARs (25Minneman K.P. Theroux T.L. Hollinger S. Han C. Esbenshade T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 929-936PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of Phe-312 to Asn in the α1a-AR in mimicry of the α2-/β2-AR or 5-HT1a studies (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Guan X.-M. Peroutka S.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 695-698PubMed Google Scholar) did not display any changes in affinity for β-AR antagonists (alprenolol and propranolol) or the α2-AR antagonist (yohimbine) (Table I). Although Asn is believed to be involved in a high-affinity point contact for propranolol and alprenolol and other aryloxyalkylamine β-AR antagonists (20Guan X.-M. Peroutka S.J. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 695-698PubMed Google Scholar) and is possibly discriminatory between α2- and β-AR antagonists (11Suryanarayana S. Daunt D.A. Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15488-15492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to losses in yohimbine binding, it does not appear that the corresponding residue (Phe-312) in the α1-AR is involved in analogous paradigms. However, F308L in the α1a-AR displayed altered non-α1-AR binding only for alprenolol (36-fold higher affinity) and could not reproduce it with propranolol. It is possible for the propyl group of alprenolol to pack with Phe-308, and perhaps the extended structure of the leucine substitution enhances this interaction. Although it may be argued that propranolol contains an extra aromatic ring and may pack differently in the pocket with Phe-308, these results utilizing β- and α2-antagonists merely emphasize that there are significant differences in the binding pockets among adrenergic family members, although they may conserve key residues. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that two Phe residues in TM7 are involved in high-affinity binding for a large number of α1-antagonists. These interactions are not involved in subtype selectivity differences because both Phe residues are strictly conserved among all three α1-AR subtypes but represent a major docking site for α1-AR antagonists. Imidazoline agonists, which were recognized previously to bind differently than epinephrine-like agonists, also bind to these two Phe residues in TM7, suggesting that imidazolines bind with some antagonist characteristics. This antagonist-like binding may explain their generally poorer agonism at α1-ARs. A consensus of the results of numerous mutagenesis studies suggests that the agonist pocket lies deeper in the hydrophobic core of the receptor and involves TMs 3 through 6, whereas antagonist binding is located above the plane of agonist binding but is skewed toward TM7. This study represents the first report of a major docking site for α1-AR antagonists and for a G protein-coupled receptor in general. These studies suggest that whereas antagonists generally have diverse structures, there are conserved pharmacophores that recognize a common site on the receptor. These studies may be helpful in the synthesis of selective ligands for these receptors and may represent conserved paradigms for antagonist binding in other adrenergic receptors or other nonpeptide G protein-coupled receptors."

However, tumors that are refractory to the antiestrogenic effects of selective ER modulators often reemerge, and the prognosis for these patients is poor because of the lack of additional effective therapy. Accordingly, deciphering the cellular events associated with estrogen-dependent growth and the subsequent outgrowth of tumors with an estrogen-independent phenotype is of considerable interest. Here we show that the expression of PP5, an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr phosphatase that functions as an inhibitor of glucocorticoid- and p53-induced signaling cascades leading to growth suppression, is responsive to 17β-estradiol (E2) in ER-positive human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7). Northern analysis revealed that E2-induced PP5 expression is blocked by treatment with tamoxifen, and a consensus ER recognition element was identified in the PP5 promoter. The PP5-ER recognition element associates with human ERs and confers E2-induced transcriptional activation to reporter plasmids. The specific inhibition of PP5 expression ablates E2-mediated proliferation in MCF-7 cells without having an apparent effect on E2-induced expression ofc-myc or cyclin D1. Thus, although critical for cell growth, PP5 likely acts either downstream or independently of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. To further characterize the role of PP5 in E2-regulated growth control, we constructed stable MCF-7 cell lines in which the expression of PP5 was placed under the control of tetracycline-regulated transactivator and operator plasmids. Studies with these cells revealed that the constitutive overexpression of PP5 affords E2-dependent MCF-7 cells with the ability to proliferate in E2-depleted media. Together, these studies indicate that E2-induced PP5 expression functions to enhance E2-initiated signaling cascades leading to cell division and that aberrant PP5 expression may contribute to the development of MCF-7 cells with an estrogen-independent phenotype.

Approximately 50% of all breast cancer cells express receptors that recognize estrogen, and in these estrogen receptor (ER1)-positive cells 17β-estradiol (E2) has a potent mitogenic effect (2Scott J.A. McGuire W.L. Voight K.D. Knabbe C. Endocrine-dependent Tumors. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 179-196Google Scholar). The growth-promoting effects of E2 influence both the initiation and progression of cell growth, stimulating resting noncycling (G0 phase) cells to enter the cell cycle and accelerating G1-S phase progression (3Lippman M. Bolan G. Huff K. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4595-4601PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sutherland R.L. Reddel R.R. Green M.D. Eur. J. Cancer Clin.

Rogan E.M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Proliferation is initiated by the activation of ERs, which act as hormone-regulated transcription factors that control the expression of estrogen-responsive genes (7Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 8Ptashne M. Science. 1989; 254: 371-378Google Scholar). Several ER-responsive genes (e.g. c-myc and cyclin D1) have been linked to the propagation of a proliferative response, and agents that bind ERs and modify estrogen actions (such as SERMs) effectively inhibit E2-induced gene expression in many ER-positive tumors. Accordingly, SERMs have emerged as important drugs for the clinical management of hormone-responsive breast cancer (9Osborne C.K. Elledge R.M. Fuqua S.A.W. Sci. Med. 1996; 3: 32-42Google Scholar). Nonetheless, eventually most breast tumors that initially respond to SERM therapy develop resistant metastases, and the prognosis for these patients is poor because of a lack of additional effective therapy (10Katzenellenbogen B.S. Montano M.M. Ekena M.E. Mclnerney E.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1977; 44: 23-38Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) underlying acquired SERM resistance is poorly understood, controversial, and likely multifactorial. Modification of ER structure/function (11Nicholson S. Sainsbury J.R. Halcrow P.

In addition, hormone-independent mechanisms can activate ERs. Ligand-independent ER activation has been observed after treatment with dopamine, polypeptide growth factors that activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and okadaic acid, a potent semi-selective Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitor (17Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that the regulation of ER function is controlled by both ligands and “cross-talk” from signaling cascades initiated by the activation of growth factor receptors. Because reversible phosphorylation has been implicated in the regulation of both ligand-dependent and -independent ER-mediated growth control (17Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), it seems likely that both protein kinases and protein phosphatases influence the growth of hormone-responsive tumors. To characterize the roles of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, inhibitors such as okadaic acid, cantharidin, and fostriecin have emerged as powerful tools. These compounds have potent inhibitory activity against the type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) family of phosphatases, and studies with okadaic acid indicate that sensitive PPases influence both receptor activation and cross-talk with cascades induced by the activation of growth factor receptors (17Power R.F.

A. 1988; 85: 4252-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), and three structurally related phosphatases (PP4 (24Huang X. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. Genomics. 1997; 44: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), PP5 (25Becker W. Kentrup H. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22586-22592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PP6 (26Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) that are all sensitive to okadaic acid, cantharidin, and fostriecin. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the actions of individual PPases using the currently available inhibitors. Studying the cellular roles of PP5 has proven particularly difficult, in part because no physiological substrates for PP5 have been identified. In addition, in crude cell homogenates PP5 resides predominately in an inactive state (27Sinclair C. Borchers C. Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23666-23672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which represents <1% of the measurable PPase activity. This makes changes in the activity of PP5 impossible to detect in the high background of PP1/PP2A/PP4. To illuminate the cellular roles of human PP5, we have developed chimeric antisense 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphothioate oligonucleotides that are capable of specifically inhibiting the expression of PP5 via RNase H-mediated degradation of PP5 mRNA (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The lead compound targeting PP5, ISIS 15534, inhibits the expression of human PP5 at nanomolar concentrations (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). More importantly, ISIS 15534 has no apparent effect on the structurally related PPases (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which allows the use of ISIS 15534 to study how the specific suppression of PP5 expression influences the biological activity of cultured human cells. Previous studies have shown that ISIS 15534 produces a growth-inhibitory effect in some but not all human tumor cells (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More recent studies have revealed that the suppression of PP5 expression results in enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, the hyperphosphorylation of p53, and a marked increase in the expression of the p21-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein (29Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This suggests that PP5 acts as suppressor of GR- and p53-induced growth-suppressing signaling cascades. Here we show that the expression of PP5 is responsive to estrogen in human ER-positive human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7). The suppression of PP5 expression inhibits cell growth without having an apparent effect on the expression of c-myc or cyclin D1. In contrast, the constitutive overexpression of PP5 converts estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells into an estrogen-independent phenotype. Together, these studies suggest that PP5 acts to link ER- and GR-dependent growth control signaling networks, with estrogen-induced PP5 expression acting to aid the growth-promoting effects of estrogen by suppressing GR-induced signaling cascades, leading to growth arrest. 17 β-estradiol, tamoxifen, propidium iodine, tetracycline, and G418 were purchased from Sigma. The Trizol reagent was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.1 µg/ml streptomycin, and 25 units/ml penicillin. Unless indicated otherwise, all cell lines were passaged when 90–95% confluent. In estrogen depletion studies, the cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% serum obtained from gelded horses (GHS). Clinical chemical analysis revealed that the GHS used in these studies contained 9.6 pg/ml 17 β-estradiol. Cell numbers were determined with a cell counter (Coulter Counter ZM) after detachment from the dish by a brief treatment with trypsin. For cellular staining with propidium iodine, cell cultures were detached gently with trypsin, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 50 µg/ml propidium iodine and 0.5 ml of Vindelovs reagent (0.01 m Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 75 µmpropidium iodine, 1 ml/liter Igepal and 700 units/liter RNase adjusted to pH 8). The propidium iodine-stained cells were kept in the dark at 4 °C for 30–60 min and then analyzed with a FACS Vantage SE flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) using pulse processing (FL2 width and FL2 area) to gate out cell doublets and ModFitLT cell cycle analysis software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Propidium iodine fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (Spectra Physics, Sunnyvale, CA), and fluorescence emission was collected with a 582/42 BP filter in front to the FL2 detector. Multivariate data acquisition and analysis were performed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides and 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethylphosphothioate deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described previously (30Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P.

Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of PP5 expression and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E.

Briefly, cells that reached ∼60–70% confluency in 60-mm dishes were washed once with DMEM and then treated with a solution (1 ml) of DMEM containing oligonucleotides at the indicated concentrations and 15 µg/ml N-(1-(2, 3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride/dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Lipofectin®, Life Technologies, Inc.). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing DMEM supplemented with either 10% FCS or GHS. After 18 h, the cells were scraped in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the total RNA was isolated. For Northern blot analysis, 15 µg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Duralon-UV (Stratagene) membrane. Hybridization was conducted in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were generated by random labeling with Klenow enzyme (Decaprime kit, Ambion). The membranes were subjected to two low stringency washes with 2× SSC at room temperature after two high stringency washes with 0.1× SSC at 55 °C. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. For quantification of hybridization signals, autoradiograms were scanned, and the scanned signals were integrated using Scion Image software (3b beta release, Scion Corporation). The signals were normalized to GAPDH to account for any inconsistencies in loading. 5′ RACE was performed using the Advantage 2 Taq PCR system (CLONTECH) with 4% dimethyl sulphoxide added to the reaction mixtures. The first round of PCR was conducted using the AP1 primer supplied in the kit and RH261 (5′-GCTCAGCACACTCAGTCCTCTCGCCCTCCGC-3), a PP5-specific reverse primer present in exon 1 of human PP5. For the first round of PCR, 0.5 ng of cDNA was used as a template, and the PCR reaction was conducted as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 3 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 20 s and 70 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 2 min 30 s; and 68 °C for 2 min. Five µl of a 1:50 dilution from the primary PCR was then used as template for the second round nested PCR-RACE. The reaction conditions were the same as described for the first round except the final cycling set, in which only 25 cycles were performed. For the second round of PCR, the AP2 primer supplied in the kit was used in combination with RH252 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCAAAGCGACCCCTACCCTGGCAACGGC-3′), a PP5-specific reverse primer starting four base pairs upstream of the human PP5 coding region and containing a 5′-HindIII site to facilitate cloning. The resulting products from the second round were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Duralon UV membrane for Southern analysis. A 560-base pair region upstream (−640 to −81) of the PP5 coding region was used as a probe. A strongly hybridizing band was identified, and the corresponding band (visualized by ethidium bromide staining) was isolated and purified from the gel. The ∼750-base pair band was then digested with NotI (contained in the AP2 primer) and HindIII (contained in the RH252 primer) and cloned into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). The sequencing analysis was performed using T3 and T7 primers. To obtain the 5′-flanking region of human PP5, sense oligonucleotides corresponding to the indicated 5′-flanking regions of human PP5 (Fig.2; −758, −643, −184, and −110) were employed in combination with an antisense oligonucleotide (RH252, described above) in PCR of human genomic DNA. The sense primers employed were as follows: RH250 (−110) 5′-CGGGATCCAGCGCTTTACGACACTTGTGCGGCAG-3′; RH254 (−184) 5′-CGGGATCCTGGTCACCTTGTCCTCCGCGCGCTCTGTG-3′; RH253 (−643) 5′-TGGGATCCGAAAGGAGATGGTGCAACACACTTCTAAGC-3′. To facilitate cloning, BamHI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites were engineered at the 5′ ends. The PCR products were then subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector, pLucLinkV.2 (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Day, University of Virginia). The fidelity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of ∼105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish and incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS as described above. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with estrogen-depleted medium (see above), in which the cells were maintained for 48–60 h as indicated. On the third day, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (29Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The transfection mixture was removed 4 h later, and the cells were returned to estrogen-free medium overnight. The next morning, 17β-estradiol (10 nm) was then added to the experimental plates, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. Two assay systems were employed to confirm the results, and the amount of DNA transfected depended on the assay system used. In the first system, the enhanced luciferase assay kit (PharMingen) was used; 1.5 µg of each vector was employed and the luciferase activity was measured with a Monolight 2010 Luminometer. The ratio of activity to total protein (as measured with a Bio-Rad DC assay) was then calculated. The second system employed a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). In these studies, 1.5 µg of the experimental vector and 0.5 µg of pRL-cytomegalovirus Renilla (Promega) were co-transfected into the cells. Luciferase and Renillaactivity were then measured in a Turner Designs luminometer. The ratio of luciferase to Renilla activity was calculated and plotted. All statistical calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. Two oligonucleotides encoding the sense and antisense regions of the human PP5 promoter that contains a consensus ERE (−191 to −157) were synthesized. The sequences of the sense and antisense strands employed were 5′-GAACCTCTGGTCACCTTGTCCTCCGCGCGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGCGCGCGGAGGACAAGGTGAC-3′, respectively. The ERE is underlined. The oligonucleotides were annealed and32P-labeled by extension of the antisense strand using [α-32P]dATP (ICN) and a Klenow DECAprimeII labeling kit (Ambion). Binding reactions were performed in a 20-µl final volume and consisted of 1 µl of double-stranded [32P] probe (∼100,000 cpm/µl), 1.4 µg of estrogen receptor-α (Panvera), 1 µl of 0.2 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1 µl of 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, and 20% glycerol. For competition studies, cold double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either a consensus ERE or an ERE in which two bases in the consensus region were mutated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added as indicated. The binding reactions were conducted at room temperature for 25 min, and the association of probe with the ER was then detected by autoradiography after separation on a 4–15% Tris-HCl Criterion gel (Bio-Rad) using Tris-glycine running buffer. Western analysis was performed as described previously (28Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Double-stable cell lines overexpressing PP5 were developed by the stable transfection of MCF-7 Tet-off cells (CLONTECH) with a pBI-epidermal growth factor-derived plasmid (CLONTECH) encoding the full-length human PP5. Clones were grown in the presence of 2 µg/ml tetracycline (to suppress PP5 expression) and selected for by resistance to G418. Surviving cell lines were then screened by both Northern and Western analysis to assess tetracycline-responsive PP5 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. Several clones from different plates were obtained. Three cell lines (MCF-7-PP5 h1, MCF-7PP5k1, and MCF-7-PP5l1), in which the level of PP5 mRNA expressed upon the removal of tetracycline was similar to that produced by the addition of 1–10 nm 17 β-estradiol in the parental MCF-7 cells, were chosen for further study. MCF-7 cell growth depends on estrogen, and when placed in serum-free medium or medium supplemented with serum depleted of estrogen by charcoal stripping, the growth rate of MCF-7 cells is greatly suppressed. Charcoal stripping, however, depletes factors in addition to estrogen that may influence proliferation (3Lippman M. Bolan G. Huff K. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4595-4601PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to study the molecular events associated with estrogen-dependent growth while avoiding potential complications arising from charcoal stripping or the use of serum-free medium, we used tissue culture medium lacking phenol red (32Bindal R.D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) 2The pH indicator, phenol red, is structurally reminiscent to estrogens and often contains estrogenic contaminants (32Bindal R.D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). and supplemented with GHS, which contains low levels of E2(33Amara J.F. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Scammell J.G. Burrage T.G. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 317β-estradiol levels were measured by clinical chemical analysis (33Amara J.F. Dannies P.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In these studies, the culture medium supplemented with 10% GHS contains a final estrogen concentration of <1.0 pg/ml. As observed in serum-free or charcoal-stripped medium, when placed in GHS-supplemented medium the growth of ER-positive MCF-7 cell cultures is markedly suppressed, with the cells accumulating in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1, A andB). The growth of MCF-7 cells cultured in GHS-supplemented medium is restored by the addition of E2. Furthermore, a comparison of the rate at which MCF-7 cells grow (determined by plotting cell numbers over a period of 7 days and comparing the slopes of the growth curves generated) revealed that growth rates of cultures placed in medium supplemented with 10% FCS are similar to those of cultures in medium supplemented with 10% GHS and 10 nmE2. Northern analysis of PP5 mRNA levels indicates that the expression of PP5 is influenced by estrogen. When MCF-7 cells are placed in estrogen-rich medium, the cells remain in log-phase growth, and the expression of PP5 is high. Replacement of the estrogen-rich medium with estrogen-depleted medium results in growth suppression and a concomitant decrease in PP5 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C). When MCF-7 cell cultures are maintained in estrogen-depleted medium for 3 days and then treated with 10 nm E2, there is an increase in PP5 expression, and the cells proliferate. Treatment with tamoxifen attenuates the E2-induced increase in PP5 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the expression of PP5 may depend on estrogen receptor activation. However, although estrogen withdrawal suppresses PP5 expression, it does not abolish the expression of PP5. Thus, although E2 treatment is associated with an increase in PP5 mRNA, the basal expression of PP5 may not depend on estrogen. Sequence analysis of a 1.9-megabase region of human chromosome 19q31.2 revealed an ∼43.5-kilobase region containing all 13 exons that encode PP5 and an ∼92-kilobase region 5′ of exon 1 (BAC 82621, GenBankTM accession number AC007193). 5′-RACE analysis of human cDNA"
https://openalex.org/W2048258098,"The Gs-coupled rat A2B adenosine receptor (A2B-AR) was epitope-tagged at the NH2 terminus with hemagglutinin (HA) and subjected to progressive deletions or point mutations of the COOH terminus in order to determine regions of the receptor that contribute to agonist-induced desensitization and internalization. When expressed stably in Chinese hamster ovary cells, a mutant receptor in which the final 2 amino acids were deleted, the Leu330-stop mutant, underwent rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization as did the wild type (WT) receptor. However, the Phe328 and the Gln325-stop mutants were resistant to rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization. Co-expression of arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein (arrestin-2-GFP) with WT receptor or Leu330-stop mutant resulted in rapid translocation of arrestin-2-GFP from cytosol to membrane upon agonist addition. On the other hand, agonist activation of the Phe328-stop or Gln325-stop mutant did not result in translocation of arrestin-2-GFP from cytosol. A COOH terminus point mutant, S329G, was also unable to undergo rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization, indicating that Ser329 is a critical residue for these processes. A further deletion mutant (Ser326-stop) unexpectedly underwent rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization. However, activation of this mutant did not promote translocation of arrestin-2-GFP from cytosol to membrane. In addition, whereas WT receptor internalization was markedly inhibited by co-expression of dominant negative mutants of arrestin-2 (arrestin-2-(319–418)), dynamin (dynamin K44A), or Eps-15 (EΔ95–295), Ser326-stop receptor internalization was only inhibited by dominant negative mutant dynamin. Taken together these results indicate that Ser329, close to the COOH terminus of the rat A2B-AR, is critical for the rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization of the receptor. However, deletion of the COOH terminus also uncovers a motif that is able to redirect internalization of the receptor to an arrestin- and clathrin-independent pathway.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase Chinese hamster ovary cells hemagglutinin 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl) imidazolidin-2-one wild type arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein A2B-adenosine receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin sodium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Prolonged or repeated exposure of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 to agonist usually results in a decrease in subsequent receptor responsiveness, a process termed desensitization (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying rapid desensitization often involve GPCR phosphorylation by a family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs; Ref. 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation by GRKs promotes binding of arrestins (3Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which triggers desensitization by uncoupling the receptor from G-protein (4Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Following desensitization, many GPCRs appear to internalize by an arrestin-dependent process via clathrin-coated pits (5Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). In most cases this leads to the eventual intracellular dephosphorylation of the receptor, and its reinsertion into the cell membrane in a resensitized state (6Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, in some cases GPCR internalization appears to contribute to desensitization (7Beaumont V. Hepworth M.B. Luty J.S. Kelly E. Henderson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33174-33183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More prolonged agonist activation generally leads to the redirection of internalized receptor to a lysosomal compartment with subsequent down-regulation (8Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), although some GPCRs appear to be targetted for down-regulation after relatively short agonist treatment times (9Kojro E. Fahrenholz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6476-6481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus although a general picture is emerging of how GPCR responsiveness is regulated in the presence of prolonged agonist treatment (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the molecular signals that determine the pathways of desensitization, internalization, resensitization, or down-regulation remain to be clarified. The endogenous nucleoside adenosine is now known to regulate cellular function via activation of four adenosine GPCRs, the A1, A2A, A2B, and A3-ARs (10Olah M.E. Stiles G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 581-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the A2A- and A2B-adenosine receptors are Gs coupled and stimulate cAMP formation, and the A2B-AR subtype is thought to regulate such diverse processes as vascular tone, neurosecretion, and mast cell activation (11Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 381-402PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist-induced desensitization of A2B-ARs has been reported in a number of cell types (12Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Mundell S.J. Kelly E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Peters D.M.

Using a combination of molecular biological techniques we have shown that the mechanism of A2B-AR desensitization likely involves GRK2 and non-visual arrestins. Thus, expression of a dominant negative mutant GRK2 construct in NG108-15 cells (12Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or the antisense-induced reduction of non-visual arrestin levels in HEK293 cells (15Mundell S.J. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8723-8732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reduced the rate of agonist-induced desensitization of endogenous A2B-AR responsiveness. Very recently, we have shown that agonist activation of A2B-ARs transiently expressed in HEK293 cells promotes arrestin-2-GFP translocation from cytosol to cell membrane (18Mundell S.J. Matharu A.-L. Kelly E. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the A2B-ARs subsequently undergo internalization to compartments which co-localize with the endosomal markers transferrin and rab-5 (18Mundell S.J. Matharu A.-L. Kelly E. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as well as with arrestin-2-GFP itself. Another recent study (19Claing A. Perry S.J. Achiriloaie M. Walker J.K.L. Albanesi J.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 97: 1119-1124Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) indicates that the A2B-AR internalizes in an arrestin- and dynamin-sensitive fashion. Together, these results indicate that A2B-AR undergoes desensitization and internalization in a GRK- and arrestin-dependent manner. For other GPCRs, the COOH terminus of the receptor is often implicated as a site for GRK-mediated phosphorylation and arrestin interaction (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). For example, mutation of a threonine residue in the COOH terminus of the canine A2A-AR inhibited the agonist-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of this receptor (20Palmer T.M. Stiles G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At present nothing is known of the molecular determinants of the desensitization and internalization of the A2B-AR. In the present study we investigated the role of the COOH terminus of this receptor in these processes using a series of COOH terminus deletion and point mutants. The results indicate that a serine residue close to the end of the COOH terminus of A2B-AR is critical for rapid agonist-induced desensitization and internalization of the receptor. Furthermore, we find that altering the COOH terminus can alter the arrestin dependence of agonist-induced receptor internalization. The pcDNA3 and pEGFPN1 vectors were obtained from Invitrogen and CLONTECH, respectively. The construct EGFP-C2-Eps15 (EΔ95–295) was a kind gift from Dr. A. Benmerah. Fugene-6 and restriction enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, ligase from New England Biolabs, and DNA preparation kits from Qiagen. DMEM and DMEM/F-12 (50:50) were from Life Technologies, fetal calf serum from Harlan Sera Labs, and geneticin (G418 sulfate) from Calbiochem. The anti-HA monoclonal HA.11 antibody was from BabCO, the goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase from Sigma, the rhodamine-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody from Molecular Probes, as was the Slow-Fade Mounting Medium. Colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate was from Bio-Rad. [3H]cAMP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Int. All other biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. The rat A2B-AR was cloned from rat brain by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, using the sense primer 5′-GACTCTAGAATGCAGCTAGAGACGCAGG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GACTCTAGATCACAAGCTCAGACTGAAAGT-3′, which include a site for the restriction enzyme XbaI (underlined). The cDNA obtained was subcloned into the XbaI site of HA-pcDNA3. The expression vector HA-pcDNA3 was derived from pcDNA3 and pJ3H (21Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, a HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment from pJ3H containing the sequence for the HA epitope tag and part of the vector Multiple Cloning Site was subcloned into the uniqueXbaI site of pcDNA3. COOH-terminal truncated A2B-AR cDNA clones were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification, using WT A2B-AR cDNA as template, and sense and antisense primers containing a site for the restriction enzyme XbaI, for subsequent subcloning in HA-pcDNA3. Point mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification as for deletion mutants, with an antisense primer containing the desired mutation and a site for the restriction enzymeEcoRI at the 5′ end, to facilitate subsequent cloning in HA-pcDNA3. The sequence of all constructs was checked by automated DNA sequencing. The WT A2B-AR was GFP-tagged at the COOH terminus by subcloning the coding sequence of the rat A2B-AR into the vector pEGFPN1. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (50:50) medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml−1streptomycin. Stably transfected CHO cells were cultured in the above medium supplemented with 600 µg ml−1 geneticin. For stable transfections, 60–80% confluent CHO cells in 2 ml of medium in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 1 µg of DNA linearized with BglII, using 3 µl of Fugene-6, according to the manufacturers instructions. After 24 h, cells were split (1:20) into medium containing 600 µg ml−1 geneticin. Individual cell clones were allowed to develop for 1–2 weeks and transferred to 24-well dishes using a pipette tip. Clones functionally expressing receptor constructs were identified by measuring 10 µmNECA-stimulated cAMP accumulation, as described below. For transient transfections with EGFPN1-A2B-AR, pcDNA3-arrestin-2-GFP, pcDNA3-arrestin-3-GFP, pcDNA3-arrestin-2-(319–418), pcDNA3-dynamin-K44A, EGFP-C2-Eps15 (EΔ95–295), and CHO cells were grown in 60-mm dishes to 60–80% confluency and transfected with 0.25–2.0 µg of DNA in 2 ml of medium using Fugene-6 following the manufacturers instructions. Cells were incubated with a DNA/Fugene mixture for 24 h, the media was replaced, and the cells analyzed 24–48 h after transfection. CHO cells were seeded into 24-well multitray culture plates and grown at 37 °C under 6% CO2 and humidified conditions. In pretreatment experiments, medium was replaced by 0.5 ml of prewarmed medium containing NECA (10 µm) or water (control). At various time points after this, the medium was removed and wells washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. Following this, 0.5 ml of prewarmed fresh medium (without fetal calf serum) containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-imidazolidin-2-one (Ro 201724, 250 µm) was added to each well, followed immediately with either NECA (10 µm) or water (control). This was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 µl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (100%). In non-pretreatment experiments, 0.5 ml of prewarmed fresh medium (without fetal calf serum) containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 201724 (250 µm) was added to each well, followed 15 min later with either NECA (10 µm) or water (control). This was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 µl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (100%). Fifty µl of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube containing 50 µl of NaOH (1 m) and 200 µl of Tris (50 mm, pH 7.4) and EDTA (4 mm) (TE buffer). A further 100 µl of this mixture was transferred to a fresh tube containing 50 µl of TE buffer, 100 µl of [3H]cyclic AMP in TE buffer (about 20,000 counts/min), and 100 µl of cyclic AMP-binding protein (to give a final concentration of ∼750 µg of protein/ml, prepared from bovine adrenal cortex). Tubes containing 50 µl of cyclic AMP (0.125–40 pmol) were used to construct a standard curve. After 90 min incubation at 4 °C, 200 µl of TE buffer containing charcoal (Norit GSX: 50 mg/ml final concentration) and bovine serum albumin (2 mg ml−1 final concentration) was added to each tube. After 15 min bound and non-bound [3H]cAMP were separated by centrifugation at 2,900 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was transferred into vials for liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Standard curve data were fitted to a logistic expression (GraphPAD Prism) and the unknowns read off. Protein content of the cell monolayers was determined (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) and cAMP accumulation expressed as picomole of cAMP mg−1 protein, or expressed as a percent of the respective control NECA-stimulated cAMP accumulation. A2B-AR cell surface loss was assessed by ELISA as described previously (23Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish were split after 24 h transfection if required (see below) into 24-well tissue culture dishes coated with 0.1 mg ml−1poly-l-lysine. 24 h later, cells were incubated with DMEM containing the A2B-AR agonist NECA (0.1 µm to 1 mm) for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by removing the media and fixing the cells with 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with TBS, incubated for 45 min with TBS containing 1% BSA (TBS/BSA), then incubated with a primary antibody (anti-HA monoclonal HA.11 antibody, 1:1000 dilution in TBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with TBS, reblocked with TBS/BSA for 15 min at room temperature, and incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase; 1:1000 dilution in TBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with TBS and a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate added. When adequate color change was achieved, 100 µl of sample were added to 100 µl of 0.4 m NaOH to terminate the reaction, and the samples were read at 405 nm using a microplate reader. In order to estimate relative cell surface expression of the different constructs, color development was carried out as above followed by protein assay of cells in each well and results expressed as arbitrary absorbance units mg−1 protein, with the value for empty pcDNA3-transfected cells (background reading) being subtracted from each of the values obtained for construct-transfected cells. To assess the cellular distribution of WT and mutant A2B-AR, CHO cells stably transfected with these constructs were grown in 6-well plates on coverslips. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody (anti-HA monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37 °C ± NECA (10 µm; 30 min) in DMEM with 0.5% BSA. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with blotto (0.05% Triton X-100/PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 30 min at 37 °C. Goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody was then added at a dilution of 1:150 in blotto for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed six times with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS and the last wash left for 37 °C for 30 min. Finally the cells were fixed again with 3.7% formaldehyde as described. Coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium and examined by microscopy on an upright Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope attached to a Leica DM IRBE epifluorescence microscope with phase-contrast and a Plan-Apo 40 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. In experiments assessing WT, Gln325-stop, and A2B-AR-GFP receptor redistribution, CHO cells stably expressing WT or Gln325-stop receptor were transfected as described above with 5 µg of EGFPN1-A2B-AR. Cells were then split onto coverslips in 6-well plates and 24 h later receptor redistribution assessed as described above. In experiments assessing arrestin-2-GFP redistribution, CHO cells stably expressing WT or mutant A2B-AR were transfected as described above with 0.5 µg of arrestin-2-GFP and grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. To assess WT or mutant A2B-AR distribution, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rhodamine-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS prior to imaging and coverslips mounted on a heated imaging chamber through which media and drugs could be added. Cells were examined by microscopy on an inverted Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope attached to a Leica DM IRBE epifluorescence microscope with phase-contrast and a Plan-Apo 40 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective. All images were collected on Leica TCS-NT software for two- and three-dimensional image analysis and processed on Adobe Photoshop 5.5. Log concentration-effect curves, time-dependent desensitization, and standard curves for cAMP and protein assays were analyzed by the iterative fitting program GraphPAD Prism (GraphPAD Software). Log concentration-effect curves, and standard curve data for cAMP and protein assays were fitted to a logistic expression for single-site analysis. Values oft 0.5 for agonist-induced desensitization were obtained by fitting data to a single exponential curve. The wild type (WT) rat A2B-AR and various COOH terminus deletion mutants (Fig. 1) were constructed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and epitope tagged at the NH2 terminus with a HA sequence, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These constructs were then stably transfected into CHO cells, however, we were unable to obtain CHO cells stably expressing a functional Tyr299-stop receptor mutant. The ability of the adenosine receptor agonist NECA to stimulate cAMP formation in the cells was then determined (Fig. 2 A). In CHO cells stably expressing WT receptor as well as those expressing COOH terminus deletions, NECA stimulated cAMP formation with an EC50 of between 0.25 and 0.64 µm, although there was variation in the maximum response observed. CHO cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid vector alone did not respond to NECA (Fig. 2 A). Initial experiments to label A2B-AR with the A2-AR radioligand [3H]ZM 241385 (24Ji X.-D. Jacobson K.A. Drug Des. Discov. 1999; 16: 217-226PubMed Google Scholar) failed to detect specific binding in membranes prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with WT A2B-AR, under conditions where specific binding to membranes prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with WT A2A-AR was readily observed (data not shown). Therefore, in the absence of a suitable A2B-AR radioligand, an estimation of the relative expression level of WT and deletion mutant A2B-AR was obtained using an ELISA assay (23Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), taking advantage of the HA-epitope tag contained in the NH2terminus of the receptor constructs. This analysis indicated that in the absence of agonist stimulation there was little difference in cell surface expression of these constructs (arbitrary absorbance units mg−1 cell protein: WT 1.37 ± 0.19; Leu330-stop 1.12 ± 0.15; Phe328-stop 1.19 ± 0.14; Ser326-stop 1.32 ± 0.12; Gln325-stop 1.07 ± 0.17; n = three separate experiments in each case).Figure 2Agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and desensitization of CHO cells stably transfected with the rat A2B-AR ( WT ) or truncated mutants Gln325-stop, Ser326-stop, Phe328-stop, and Leu330-stop. A, log concentration-effect curves for stimulation of cAMP accumulation by NECA (20 min). The EC50 values are 0.44 µm (WT), 0.64 µm (Gln325-stop), 0.25 µm(Ser326-stop), 0.44 µm(Phe328-stop), and 0.52 µm(Leu330-stop). B, agonist-induced desensitization of A2B-AR stimulated cAMP accumulation. Cells were pretreated with water (control) or 10 µm NECA for 1 h, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and stimulated with 10 µm NECA for 20 min. C, time course of desensitization of A2B-AR stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Cells were pretreated with 10 µm NECA for the indicated times, washed, and stimulated with 10 µmNECA for 20 min. Data was fitted to a one-site exponential decay equation. Half-time values are 12.0 min (WT), 22.0 min (Ser326-stop), and 7.5 min (Leu330-stop). Values in A-C are mean ± S.E. from three to five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of the A2B-AR constructs to undergo agonist-induced desensitization was then investigated. Cells were pretreated with 10 µm NECA for 1 h, washed, and subsequently incubated with 10 µm NECA for 20 min, after which cAMP accumulation was determined. In CHO cells expressing WT receptor, NECA pretreatment for 1 h produced an ∼50% desensitization in subsequent NECA responsiveness, as compared with cells not preincubated with NECA (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, in cells expressing the Leu330-stop receptor mutant, there was marked desensitization of the NECA response. On the other hand, cells expressing the Gln325-stop or Phe328-stop receptor mutants did not display any desensitization subsequent to the 1-h NECA pretreatment. In order to confirm that the differences in desensitization were not due to variations in receptor expression levels, CHO cells were transiently transfected with WT or Gln325-stop A2B-AR constructs. In this case, agonist-stimulated cAMP formation in non-pretreated cells in response to NECA was greater in WT than Gln325-stop cells, but there was still no desensitization in the latter (NECA-stimulated cAMP formation in non-pretreated WT cells was 185 ± 36 and in pretreated cells 62 ± 10 pmol of cyclic AMP mg−1protein; NECA-stimulated cAMP formation in non-pretreated Gln325-stop cells was 86 ± 23 and in pretreated cells 85 ± 29 pmol of cyclic AMP mg−1 protein). Taken together these results indicate that the Ser329-Leu330 motif close to the COOH terminus of the rat A2B-AR is critical for rapid agonist-induced desensitization. However, the Ser326-stop receptor mutant was also subjected to agonist-induced desensitization, which was unexpected since this mutant does not contain the Ser329-Leu330 motif. We next compared the rates of agonist-induced desensitization for the WT, Leu330-stop and Ser326-stop receptors (Fig. 2 C). This indicated that the WT receptor desensitizes with at 0.5 of 12.0 min, with the Leu330-stop receptor desensitizing faster (t 0.5 of 7.5 min) and the Ser326-stop receptor slower (t 0.5 of 22.0 min). The ability of the WT and deletion mutant A2B-AR constructs to undergo agonist-induced internalization was next investigated by ELISA (23Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In CHO cells expressing WT receptor, addition of 10 µm NECA induced a time-dependent loss of cell surface receptor, reaching about 50% loss after 1 h (Fig.3 A). Similarly, in cells expressing the Leu330-stop receptor mutant, there was marked agonist-induced loss of cell surface receptor, which appeared to be somewhat more rapid than WT. However, in cells expressing the Gln325-stop or Phe328-stop receptor mutants there was very little agonist-induced loss of cell surface receptor over a 1-h period. On the other hand the Ser326-stop receptor mutant did show agonist-induced loss of cell surface receptor, with around 35% loss after 1 h of agonist treatment. We next determined whether the poor internalization of the Gln325-stop receptor mutant could be rescued by overexpression of non-visual arrestins (Fig. 3 B). Transient overexpression of arrestin-2-GFP or arrestin-3-GFP in WT receptor cells produced a modest increase in agonist-induced receptor loss at 15 min, but did not affect the overall extent of receptor loss. However, overexpression of non-visual arrestins did not appear to affect the rate or extent of agonist-induced loss of cell surface Gln325-stop receptor mutant. To confirm our findings in the ELISA assays, imaging of the receptors by confocal microscopy was undertaken using an anti-HA primary antibody and rhodamine-linked secondary antibody (Fig.4). Under basal conditions, the WT and mutant receptors all localized to the plasma membrane of CHO"

Gln3p was recently found to be hyperphosphorylated in a TOR-dependent manner and resides in the cytoplasm in high quality nitrogen. In contrast, during nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment, Gln3p becomes rapidly dephosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus, thereby activating nitrogen catabolite repression genes. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding is lacking for the regulation of Gln3p nucleocytoplasmic distribution. In this study, we applied a functional genomics approach to identify the nuclear transport factors for Gln3p. We found that yeast karyopherin α/Srp1p and Crm1p are required for the nuclear import and export of Gln3p, respectively. Similarly, the Ran GTPase pathway is also involved in the nuclear translocation of Gln3p. Finally, we show that Srp1p preferentially interacts with the hypophosphorylated versusthe hyperphosphorylated Gln3p. These findings define a possible mechanism for regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport of Gln3p by phosphorylation in vivo.

In the presence of rich nitrogen sources, the expression of genes necessary for utilization and transport of poor nitrogen sources is repressed. These genes become derepressed in a poor nitrogen source such as glutamate. This phenomenon is called nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Magasanik B. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 283-318Google Scholar). Genetic analysis in budding yeast led to the identification of regulatory pathways that detect the quality of nutrients and regulate gene expression. A number of GATA-type transcription factors have now been identified, including Gln3p, Nil1p/Gat1p, and Nil2p/Gzf3p (2Courchesne W.E. Magasanik B. J.

It is a transcriptional activator of NCR genes when only poor nitrogen sources are available or during nitrogen starvation. Ure2p is a yeast pre-prion protein genetically antagonistic to Gln3p (5Coschigano P.W. Magasanik B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,6Wickner R.B.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In addition to the classic NCR transcription factors, TOR also mediates nitrogen signaling to regulate Rtg1/3p, transcription factors involved in regulation of several genes of the trichloroacetic acid cycle (25Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although hyperphosphorylation of Gln3p correlates well with its cytoplasmic retention and dephosphorylation is consistent with its nuclear accumulation, it remains to be determined whether and how phosphorylation directly influences the nuclear accumulation of Gln3p. Recent progress has defined the basic mechanism of nuclear transport (26Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Nakielny S.

Nuclear import and export factors interact with distinct targeting signals and share common functional and structural domains. These are collectively called karyopherins (also importins/exportins, transportins). Analysis of the Saccharomyces data base revealed a total of 14 proteins belonging to the karyopherin β family, defined partly by a ∼150-amino acid region required for binding to the small GTPase Ran (29Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Some of these karyopherin family members have been shown to serve as receptors for the import and/or export of diverse cargo molecules such as proteins and tRNA (reviewed in Ref. 31Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Each karyopherin is likely specific for a distinct targeting signal. The classical nuclear targeting signal is typified by the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is rich in basic amino acids (32Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 33Lanford R.E. Butel J.S. Virology. 1985; 147: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The import factor recognizing this NLS is a heterodimer of karyopherin α and karyopherin β (also termed importins) (extensively reviewed in Refs.26Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, and 34Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, karyopherin α serves as an adaptor to directly bind the NLS, whereas karyopherin β binds to karyopherin α. The complex then docks at the nuclear pore, translocates across the pore, and is disassembled in the nucleus. In contrast to the NLS, a major nuclear export signal is characterized by a small leucine-rich sequence that is bound by the export factor Crm1/Xpo1 (also called exportin) and Ran-GTP in the nucleus (35Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 36Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This complex translocates across the nuclear pore and is disassembled in the cytoplasm. The small GTPase Ran is thought to impose directionality to transport processes because its regulators are specifically compartmentalized within the cell (reviewed in Refs. 26Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and 34Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Ran-GTP concentration is presumably high in the nucleus, whereas Ran-GDP predominates in the cytoplasm. Ran-GTP binds to the karyopherin β family members to facilitate release of import factors from their cargo in the nucleus (41Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 42Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Visser G.D. Adam S.A. J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) or to mediate the formation of export complexes consisting of the export receptor, cargo, and Ran-GTP (recently reviewed in Ref. 31Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). Cells can respond to extracellular signals by modulating gene expression, which requires the transfer of information from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. Protein kinase cascades are commonly involved in transducing these signals, and they typically culminate in the phosphorylation of transcription factors. Phosphorylation of both transcription factors and kinases results in regulation of their nuclear localization, suggesting that control of the subcellular localization of these proteins is important for the response to extracellular signals (reviewed in Refs. 44Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 45Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can directly regulate the recognition of targeting signals by soluble karyopherins and effectively modulates nucleocytoplasmic translocation (reviewed in Refs. 44Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 45Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of the phosphate-regulated transcription factor Pho4p at Ser-152 disrupts its association with the karyopherin β Pse1p and inhibits its nuclear import (46Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 47Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that at least two nuclear transport factors, karyopherin α/Srp1p and Crm1p/Xpo1p, are required for the import and export of Gln3p, respectively. Mutation in Srp1p blocked the nuclear import of Gln3p and the expression of the Gln3p-dependent gene GAP1 by rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation. In contrast, shifting to the nonpermissive growth temperature in thecrm1-1ts mutant was sufficient to cause nuclear accumulation of Gln3p and expression of GAP1 in high quality nitrogen and in the absence of rapamycin. Furthermore, bacterially produced karyopherin α/Srp1p binds preferentially to the hypophosphorylated form of Gln3p. Our results indicate that Gln3p is dynamically shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. TOR-dependent phosphorylation appears to inhibit the ability of Gln3p to enter into the nucleus by reducing its affinity for the karyopherin α/Srp1p. All of the yeast strains are shown in Table I. The deletion and temperature-sensitive mutants for karyopherins have been described previously (40Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

The fragment was inserted into BamHI-digested pGEX-3x, such that the coding sequence for GST was in frame with the second codon of SRP1. To generate pRS315-GLN3-MYC9 and pRS416-GLN3-MYC9, the chromosomal gene GLN3-MYC9 and its natural promoter were generated by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA prepared from the GLN3-MYC9 strain (17Bertram P.G.

The resultant plasmids were transformed into yeast and shown to express Gln3p-MYC9 at a level comparable with that of the chromosomal GLN3-MYC9. pRS315-GLN3-MYC9 and pRS416-GLN3-MYC9 were transformed into wild type and mutant strains and used for both phosphorylation and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) studies. Exponential wild type and mutant yeast cultures were treated with 200 nm rapamycin. Aliquots of yeast cultures were withdrawn at different times. Total yeast RNAs were prepared using the phenol freezing extraction method (55Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). 20-μg total yeast RNA samples were separated on denaturing agarose gels, transferred onto nylon filters, hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes, and detected by phosphorus imaging. For the temperature- and cold-sensitive mutants, yeast were first grown to the early log phase, shifted to nonpermissive temperatures for 2–3 h, and then treated with 200 nm rapamycin. Log phase yeast cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads in disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by vortexing. 1 mg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 for MYC. For Western blotting analysis, 20-μg protein samples were used for gel electrophoresis and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with mAb 9E10. For the phosphatase treatment, cell extracts containing Gln3p-MYC9were incubated with CIP buffer alone, 20 units of CIP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 20 units CIP plus phosphatase inhibitor 10 mm Na4P2O7 for 10 min at 30 °C. The wild type and mutant yeast strains expressing the Gln3p-MYC9 fusions were used for indirect IF studies. For the cold- and temperature-sensitive mutants, the yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase at their permissive temperatures (30 °C for srp1 cs; 23 °C for all other mutants) and then shifted to the nonpermissive temperatures for 2–3 h (20 °C for srp1 cs, 35 °C for crm1-1 ts, and 37 °C for all other temperature-sensitive mutants). 200 nm rapamycin was then added for the duration indicated in each experiment. The IF studies were carried out as described previously (17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol.

Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 250 ml of liquid broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density of 0.4 and were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The culture was chilled on ice for 10 min, and the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The suspension was subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles, and the cells were finally disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose. The in vitro binding assays for the recombinant proteins were carried out as described previously (17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J.

Rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation leads to nuclear accumulation of Gln3p and activation of Gln3p-dependent genes such as GAP1 (general aminoacid permease 1) (17Bertram P.G. Choi J.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). We reasoned that mutations in the Gln3p import factor would prevent Gln3p from accumulating in the nucleus in the presence of rapamycin. Under such conditions, there would be no expression of GAP1. In contrast, dysfunction of the export pathway would cause constitutive nuclear accumulation of Gln3p and a high level of GAP1expression in the absence of rapamycin. Therefore, GAP1 can be conveniently used as a reporter to monitor the import/export of Gln3p by examining the effect of their mutations on GAP1expression (Fig. 1a). There are a total of 14 karyopherin βs and one karyopherin α in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae genome as revealed by genomic sequence analysis (30Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 56Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, we devised a functional genomics approach to identify the factors that affect Gln3p nuclear transport by monitoring the expression of GAP1 in individual karyopherin mutants in the presence or the absence of rapamycin. We have screened all the yeast karyopherin mutants using Northern blot analysis for GAP1. As expected, GAP1 expression patterns in a majority of the karyopherin mutants were similar to the wild type strain; GAP1 expression was essentially undetectable in the absence of rapamycin but increased significantly in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 1b). However,GAP1 expression remained very low or undetectable both in the presence and in the absence of rapamycin in two mutant strains,srp1 cs and cse1-1 cs (Fig.1b). Both srp1 cs andcse1-1 cs are cold-sensitive mutants. The induction of GAP1 by rapamycin was normal at the permissive temperature (30 °C) (data not shown) but not at the nonpermissive temperature (20 °C) (Fig. 1b). Cse1p is a karyopherin required for the export of Srp1p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (57Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Gorlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,58Hood J.K. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35142-35146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cse1-1 cs mutation may affectGAP1 expression indirectly by preventing the return of Srp1p to the cytoplasm. Kap95p is a co-factor for karyopherin-α/Srp1p. Therefore, a loss-of-function mutation in KAP95 was also expected to inhibit GAP1 expression in the presence of rapamycin. Unfortunately, the two kap95 mutants we analyzed grew extremely poorly, which precluded us from obtaining good quality RNA from these strains to address this point. Taken together, thesrp1 and cse1 phenotypes suggest that Srp1p mediates Gln3p import. In contrast, crm1-1 ts, a temperature-sensitive mutation of CRM1, a known exporting factor, led to a high level of GAP1 expression even in the absence of rapamycin in high quality nitrogen at the restrictive temperature (35 °C) (Fig. 1b) but not at the permissive temperature (25 °C) (data not shown). Thus, Crm1p appears to be the karyopherin responsible for Gln3p nuclear export. To confirm the above findings, we directly examined the effects ofsrp1cs and crm1-1 tsmutations on the localization of Gln3p by indirect immunofluorescence. In agreement, we found that Gln3p remained in the cytoplasm in the absence and the presence of rapamycin in thesrp1cs mutant at the nonpermissive temperature (20 °C) in high quality nitrogen (Fig.2a). In contrast, Gln3p localization was normal at the permissive temperature (30 °C) (Fig.2a). We also showed that Gln3p was exclusively localized to the nucleus both in the absence and the presence of rapamycin in thecrm1-1 ts mutant at 35 °C (Fig.2b). Taken together, our data indicate that Srp1p and Crm1p are the karyopherins that mediate Gln3p nuclear entry and exit. Under physiological conditions, nitrogen sources and levels control Gln3p localization. To further establish the role of Srp1p in nitrogen signal transduction, we examined Gln3p localization in thesrp1cs mutant strain under different nitrogen conditions (Fig. 3). We found that Gln3p was primarily located in the cytoplasm in rich nitrogen but rapidly accumulated in the nucleus during nitrogen starvation in the wild type strain at both 30 °C and 20 °C and in thesrp1cs mutant strain at 30 °C (permissive temperature). In contrast, Gln3p remained in the cytoplasm under nitrogen starvation in the srp1cs mutant strain at the nonpermissive temperature (20 °C). Therefore, Srp1p is required for the regulated Gln3p localization by nitrogen conditions.Figure 3Nuclear accumulation of Gln3p during nitrogen starvation requires a functional karyopherin α/Srp1p.Exponentially growing wild type (WT) andsrp1 cs mutant cells expressing Gln3p-MYC9 were shifted to nonpermissive temperature (20 °C) for 2 h and then switched to synthetic complete (+N) medium or synthetic complete medium without nitrogen sources (−N) for 30 min. The localization of Gln3p-MYC9 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining with mAb 9E10. Yeast nuclei were stained with DAPI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The small GTPase Ran/Gsp1p plays an essential role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (56Gorlich D. Dabrowski M.

Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The RanGTP gradient is maintained by two proteins: RanGAP/Rna1p, which is located in the cytoplasm (60Bischoff F.

Cell. 1993; 4: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and RanGEF/Prp20p, which is exclusively found in the nucleus (65Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Disruption of this gradient results in failure of nucleocytoplasmic transport. To determine whether Gln3p transport involves the RanGTP gradient, we investigated the effect of a temperature-sensitive mutation in RanGAP (rna1-1 ts) on the expression of GAP1 and the localization of Gln3p in the absence and the presence of rapamycin. We found that this mutation completely abolished the expression of GAP1 (Fig.4a) and the nuclear import of Gln3p in the presence of rapamycin at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) (Fig. 4b). Therefore, the RanGTP gradient is critical for Gln3p import. This is consistent with the requirement for Srp1, an adaptor that binds to a Ran-GTP binding karyopherin-β (Kap95). Karyopherin βs are known to directly bind either to their cargo proteins or to an adaptor. To establish that Srp1p is an adaptor for Gln3p import and to understand the mechanism of regulated nuclear import of Gln3p, we investigated possible protein-protein interactions between Srp1p and Gln3p. We prepared extracts from log phase yeast cells in high quality nitrogen-containing medium. Under such yeast growth condition, Gln3p was present predominantly as hyperphosphorylated forms (Fig.5a, lane 1,arrow, and Ref. 17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, there was still a residual amount of Gln3p in the dephosphorylated form (Fig. 5a,lane 1, double arrow, and Ref. 17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that a small amount of Gln3p is present in the nucleus even when yeast are grown in the nutrient-rich medium, presumably because of the need of limited Gln3p molecules for the basal expression of Gln3p-dependent genes (17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We incubated the yeast extracts with bacterially produced, affinity-purified GST on glutathione-Sepharose beads or GST-Srp1p on glutathione-Sepharose beads. We found that Gln3p specifically bound to GST-Srp1p but not to GST alone (Fig. 5a). More interestingly, GST-Srp1p only bound to the dephosphorylated but not the hyperphosphorylated Gln3p (Fig. 5a). In this experiment, the same amount of GST-Srp1p was used in each sample as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.5b). To directly demonstrate that phosphorylation regulates the interaction between Gln3p and Srp1p, we treated the cell extracts with CIP. CIP resulted in dephosphorylation of Gln3p as indicated by the increase of its gel mobility (Fig. 6a,lane 2, and Ref. 17Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This dephosphorylation was completely blocked by Na4P2O7, a potent phosphatase inhibitor. We found that GST-Srp1p indeed preferentially bound to the dephosphorylated Gln3p (Fig. 6a, lanes 4–6). The small amounts of hypophosphorylated and dephosphorylated Gln3p in the CIP-untreated or CIP/Na4P2O7 sample were barely detectable (because of the short exposure of the Western blot). The same amount of GST-Srp1p was used for each different sample as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these results show that Gln3p binds to karyopherin α/Srp1p and that phosphorylation of Gln3p inhibits this interaction. Cellular responses to nitrogen availability and the quality of nitrogen nutrients require regulated nuclear transport of the GATA-type transcription factor Gln3p. Gln3p is phosphorylated in a TOR-dependent manner and localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm when yeast are grown in high quality nitrogen-containing medium. In contrast, Gln3 becomes dephosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus when yeast are grown in poor nitrogen, grown under nitrogen starvation conditions, or treated with rapamycin (17Bertram P.G.

Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to understand how phosphorylation of Gln3p regulates its nucleocytoplasmic transport and the nuclear transport machinery that moves Gln3p into and out of the nucleus. We found that thesrp1cs mutation specifically blocked the nuclear import of Gln3p at nonpermissive temperatures in the presence of rapamycin. In addition, Gln3p binds specifically to bacterially expressed GST-Srp1p in vitro. Taken together, these results indicate that Srp1p is the nuclear import factor for Gln3p. Crm1p is required for the nuclear export of many proteins, including Hog1p (51Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), the HIV1 Rev protein (38Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr.

Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We found that the crm1-1ts mutation caused constitutive nuclear retention of Gln3p at the restrictive temperature in high quality nitrogen in the absence of rapamycin (Fig.2b). Consequently, there was a high expression level ofGAP1 under such conditions (Fig. 1). Many Crm1p substrates contain a leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (l-X2–3-(F/I/L/V/M)-X2–3-L-X-(L/I)) (36Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gln3p also contains a motif (335LHGTMRPLSL) characteristic of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal. Deletion of this leucine-rich sequence causes nuclear accumulation of Gln3p in nitrogen-rich medium and constitutive expression ofGAP1. 2J. Carvalho and X. F. S. Zheng, unpublished data. Taken together, our results indicate that Crm1p is the nuclear export factor for Gln3p. A defect in nuclear export as a result of thecrm1-1ts mutation is sufficient to cause nuclear accumulation of Gln3p in nitrogen-rich medium, suggesting that a small amount of Gln3p shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus when yeast are grown in nitrogen-rich medium. This observation is also consistent with the presence of a small amount of dephosphorylated Gln3p in the same conditions (Fig. 5a). Phosphorylation is broadly involved in the regulated transport of many important proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus (reviewed in Refs.44Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 45Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation within or adjacent to the NLS sequence can dramatically affect recognition of cargo proteins by the karyopherins. One such example is Pho4p, a phosphate-regulated transcription factor. Pho4p is phosphorylated and localized in the cytoplasm when yeast is grown in phosphate-rich medium, whereas in low phosphate medium, Pho4p is dephosphorylated and localized to the nucleus. Pho4p nuclear translocation requires the karyopherin Pse1. Phosphorylation decreases the affinity of Pho4p for Pse1p and results in the cytoplasmic retention of Pho4p (46Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 47Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A similar scenario may also be true for Gln3p and possibly other NCR-sensitive transcription activators and repressors (a model is shown in Fig. 7). During nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment, TOR-dependent phosphorylation decreases, which is possibly accompanied by an increase in the phosphatase activity toward Gln3p (17Bertram P.G.

As a result, the dephosphorylated form of Gln3p predominates and is imported into the nucleus as a result of its interaction with Srp1p. Our results provide further support for a common mechanism by which nutrient-sensing transcription factors are controlled by phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the nuclear transport machinery. We are grateful to A. Hopper, A. Tartakoff, K. Weis, L. Davis, M. Fitzgerald-Hayes, M. Johnston, and P. Silver for strains, K. Mishra for construction of pSW347, and D.

https://openalex.org/W2091841909,"Phototransduction is a canonical G protein-mediated cascade of retinal photoreceptor cells that transforms photons into neural responses. Phosducin (Pd) is a Gbetagamma-binding protein that is highly expressed in photoreceptors. Pd is phosphorylated in dark-adapted retina and is dephosphorylated in response to light. Dephosphorylated Pd binds Gbetagamma with high affinity and inhibits the interaction of Gbetagamma with Galpha or other effectors, whereas phosphorylated Pd does not. These results have led to the hypothesis that Pd down-regulates the light response. Consequently, it is important to understand the mechanisms of regulation of Pd phosphorylation. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of Pd by cAMP-dependent protein kinase moderately inhibits its association with Gbetagamma. In this study, we report that Pd was rapidly phosphorylated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, resulting in 100-fold greater inhibition of Gbetagamma binding than cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, Pd phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II at Ser-54 and Ser-73 led to binding of the phosphoserine-binding protein 14-3-3. Importantly, in vivo decreases in Ca(2+) concentration blocked the interaction of Pd with 14-3-3, indicating that Ca(2+) controls the phosphorylation state of Ser-54 and Ser-73 in vivo. These results are consistent with a role for Pd in Ca(2+)-dependent light adaptation processes in photoreceptor cells and also suggest other possible physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2091715859,"d-Aspartate in mammalian neuronal and neuroendocrine cells is suggested to play a regulatory role(s) in the neuroendocrine function. Althoughd-aspartate is known to be released from neuroendocrine cells, the mechanism underlying the release is less understood. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells contain an appreciable amount ofd-aspartate (257 ± 31 pmol/107 cells). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with specific antibodies againstd-aspartate indicated that the amino acid is present within a particulate structure, which is co-localized with dopamine and chromogranin A, markers for secretory granules, but not with synaptophysin, a marker for synaptic-like microvesicles. After sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the postnuclear particulate fraction, about 80% of the d-aspartate was recovered in the secretory granule fraction. Upon the addition of KCl, an appreciable amount of d-aspartate (about 40 pmol/107 cells at 10 min) was released from cultured cells on incubation in the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. The addition of A23187 also triggered d-aspartate release. Botulinum neurotoxin type E inhibited about 40% of KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release followed by specific cleavage of 25-kDa synaptosomal-associated protein. α-Latrotoxin increased the intracellular [Ca2+] and caused the Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release. Bafilomycin A1 dissipated the intracellular acidic regions and inhibited 40% of the Ca2+-dependentd-aspartate release. These properties are similar to those of the exocytosis of dopamine. Furthermore, digitonin-permeabilized cells took up radiolabeled d-aspartate depending on MgATP, which is sensitive to bafilomycin A1 or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene-malononitrile. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that d-aspartate is stored in secretory granules and then secreted through a Ca2+-dependent exocytotic mechanism. Exocytosis of d-aspartate further supports the role(s) ofd-aspartate as a chemical transmitter in neuroendocrine cells. d-Aspartate in mammalian neuronal and neuroendocrine cells is suggested to play a regulatory role(s) in the neuroendocrine function.

Among these d- amino acids, d-serine andd-aspartate are of special interest because neuronal and endocrine cells contain high levels of these amino acids (1Dunlop D.S. Neidle A. McHale D. Dunlop D.M.

Neurobiol. 1997; 52: 325-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). d-Serine was found to potentiate theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor through binding to the glycine site on the receptor, suggesting that d-serine might be a modulator of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (5Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Consistently, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with specific antibodies against d-serine demonstrated the localization of d-serine in astrocytes (6Schell M.J. Brady R.O. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific antibodies against d-aspartate revealed the localization ofd-aspartate in a subset of stellate and basket cells of the cerebellum, adrenal chromaffin cells, pituitaries, and pinealocytes (7Schell M.J. Cooper O.B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the pineal gland, it has been shown thatd-aspartate is present in pinealocytes, endocrine cells for melatonin (8Imai K. Fukushima T. Hagiwara K. Santa T. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1995; 9: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of pinealocytes with exogenousd-aspartate, melatonin synthesis is strongly inhibited through the inhibition of N-acetyltransferase activity (9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,10Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Yamamoto A. Hayashi M. Nishi T. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, d-aspartate seems to be a modulator of melatonin synthesis. Furthermore, exogenous d-aspartate stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone and growth hormone in the anterior pituitary (11D'Aniello A. Di Fiore M.M. Fisher G.H. Milone A. Seleni A. D'Antonio S. Perna A.F. Ingrosso D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 699-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As chemical transmitters, d-serine andd-aspartate should be secreted from neuroendocrine cells. However, the mechanism by which these amino acids are secreted from neuroendocrine cells is less understood. d-Serine is released from astrocytes upon stimulation by glutamate (5Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Becaused-serine is present in the cytoplasm, reversedd-serine transport through a Na+-dependent serine transporter at the plasma membrane was proposed (5Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Similarly, d-aspartate is present in the cytoplasm of pinealocytes and is released from the cells (8Imai K. Fukushima T. Hagiwara K. Santa T. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1995; 9: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Pinealocytes express the Na+-dependent glutamate transporter, which recognizes d-aspartate as a substrate, and its inhibition by various antagonists decreases release of d-aspartate (9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Yamada H. Yatsushiro S. Yamamoto A. Hayashi M. Nishi T. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Na+-dependent glutamate transporter is involved in the release of d-aspartate in pinealocytes. Here we present another type of mechanism of secretion ofd-aspartate in neuroendocrine cells. A subset of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells contains an appreciable amount ofd-aspartate (12Moriyama Y. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Oda T. Yamaguchi A. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have extensively investigated the localization and release of d-aspartate in PC12 cells and found that PC12 cells store d-aspartate in secretory granules and secrete it through a Ca2+-dependent exocytotic mechanism. PC12 cells were cultured in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 55 µg/ml sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 0.1 mg/liter streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.25 mg/liter Fungizone and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 (13Liu Y. Schweitzer E.S. Nirenberg M.J. Pickerl V.M. Evans C.J. Edward R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When necessary, 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor was included in the medium. The dispersed cells were washed three times with the above medium, placed in a 100-mm culture dish coated with poly(l-lysine) to give 1 × 107 cells/dish, and cultured in the above medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2. These cells were maintained for 5 days, washed with culture medium, cultured further for 1 h, and then used for experiments. Subcellular fractionation of PC12 cells was performed according to a published procedure (14Bauerfeind R. Regnier-Vigouroux A. Flatmark T. Huttner W.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 105-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, cultured PC12 cells (1.0 × 108 cells) were extensively washed with PBS1 containing 5 µg/ml leupeptin and 5 µg/ml pepstatin A and homogenized by passage through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min, and the pellets (P1) and the supernatant (S1) were obtained. Then the S1 was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant (S2) and the pellet (P2) were obtained. The P2 was suspended in 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH. 7.0) containing 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin A (SME buffer), applied to a continuous sucrose gradient (0.6–1.6 m), and then centrifuged at 78,000 × g for 3.5 h. Then samples were collected in nine tubes. Cultured cells (1 × 107 cells/dish) were washed three times with a +Ca2+-Ringer's solution comprising 128 mmNaCl, 1.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 26 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) (standard assay solution) or a −Ca2+-Ringer's solution comprising 128 mmNaCl, 1.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 3.8 mm MgSO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After cells had been incubated in 5 ml of the above medium at 37 °C, the release of d-aspartate was stimulated by the addition of 50 mm KCl (15Yamada H. Ogura A. Koizumi S. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4946-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as specified. When necessary, various compounds were added to the incubation medium. Aliquots (10 µl) were taken at time intervals, and the amount of d-aspartate was determined by HPLC according to published procedures (16Kera Y. Aoyama H. Watanabe N. Yamada R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1996; 115: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Hashimoto A. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 582: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, their dopamine contents were measured by HPLC combined with amperometric detection as described previously (18Felice L.J. Felice J.D. Kissinger P.T. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The intoxication of PC12 cells with BoNT/E was performed using a procedure similar to that previously described (15Yamada H. Ogura A. Koizumi S. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4946-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cultured cells (1 × 107cells/dish) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a low ionic strength buffer consisting of 5 mm NaCl, 4.8 mmKCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 10 mmglucose, 220 mm sucrose, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 10 or 50 nm BoNT/E. Then the cells were washed with fresh culture medium and incubated for an additional 12 h at 37 °C. Finally, the KCl-evoked release ofd-aspartate and dopamine was measured in +Ca2+-Ringer's solution as described above. For the determination of intracellular [Ca2+], an Argus 20/CA ratio imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics Co., Hamamatsu, Japan) was used. Cells were cultured for 3 days on a thin glass coverslip precoated with (poly)l-lysine (0.12 mm thick and 40 mm in diameter; 2.5 × 104 cells/coverslip). After exchange with fresh culture medium, the cells were treated with 10 µm Fura-2/AM (Dojindo Co., Kumamoto, Japan) plus 0.1% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with the same medium. The cells were perfused with the warmed +Ca2+-Ringer's solution or −Ca2+-Ringer's solution. Images were continuously taken at 37 °C with a silicon-intensified camera (C2741–08; Hamamatsu Photonics Co.). The velocity of data acquisition forF 334 by F 380 images was 4 s at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels/image. A personal computer with appropriate software (U4469; Hamamatsu Photonics Co.) was used to control the optical equipment, recording, and data analysis. The software enabled subtraction of background fluorescence, pixel-to-pixel division of F 334 byF 380 images, fitting of theF 334/F 380 ratios to a [Ca2+] calibration curve prepared separately, and digital averaging of the Ca2+ concentration in multiple cells (15Yamada H. Ogura A. Koizumi S. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4946-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against d-aspartate were prepared according to Schellet al. (7Schell M.J. Cooper O.B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and Lee et al. (19Lee J.-A. Homma H. Sakai K. Fukushima T. Santa T. Tashiro K. Iwatsubo T. Yoshikawa M. Imai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The antisera were further purified by affinity chromatography with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B conjugated with d-aspartate. The purified antibodies against d-aspartate were divided into small portions and frozen at −85 °C until use. These antibodies are active for at least 1 year after preparation. The specificity of the purified antibodies was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as follows. Various amino acids and peptides (10 µmol each) were coupled to a SUMILON MS-3696F microplate with glutaraldehyde. After blocking with PBS containing 10% goat serum, the plates were incubated with the purified antibodies (10 to 1250 dilutions) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Then the immunoreactivities were visualized with peroxidase secondary antibodies and quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Model 550). The antibodies gave immunoreactivities of less than 1.0% (taking those ofd-aspartate to be 100%) to the following compounds:l-aspartate, l-glutamate,d-glutamate, l-asparagine,d-asparagine, l-serine, d-serine, glycine, β-alanine, taurine, carnosine, Asp-Ala, Asp-Asp, Asp-Glu, serine-O-sulfate, Glu-Asp, and Gly-Asp. Furthermore, the purified antibodies stained some chromaffin cells in the section of rat adrenal glands and almost all pinealocytes in the primary culture, which is consistent with previous reports (7Schell M.J. Cooper O.B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y.

Commun. 1997; 231: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A membrane fraction of PC12 cells was denatured with SDS sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 10% β-mercaptoethanol and then electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS (20Moriyama Y. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electrotransfer at 0.3 A for 2 h, the nitrocellulose filters were blocked in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mmEDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h and then probed with 50 µg of antibodies in the above buffer. The filters were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, decorated with either peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:2000 for 30 min, washed further with the same buffer, and then subjected to ECL amplification according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The published procedure was used (21Hayashi M. Yamamoto A. Yatsushiro S. Yamada H. Futai M. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cells on (poly)l-lysine-coated glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 80 mm PIPES-KOH buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 µg/ml digitonin, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mmMgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. Then the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing with PBS again, the cells were further permeabilized with 50 µg/ml digitonin in PBS for 5 min. Then ammonium chloride at 50 mmwas added to the solution followed by incubation for 10 min after which the cells were washed with 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 5 min. Finally, the fixed cells were incubated for 1 h with antibodies at 10 µg/ml diluted in PBS containing 0.1% gelatin. The samples were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% gelatin and then incubated with the secondary antibodies conjugated with either fluorescein or Texas Red. After washing the cells with PBS containing 0.1% gelatin, immunoreactivity was observed under an Olympus confocal laser microscope (FLUOVIEW). PC12 cells were rinsed with 1 ml of buffer composed of 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 4 mm KCl. The cells were then permeabilized for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of the buffer containing 10 µm digitonin (22Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The medium was then replaced with fresh buffer containing Tris-ATP at 2 mm in the absence of digitonin. After incubation for 10 min, uptake ofd-aspartate was immediately started by the addition of radioactive d-aspartate (2.5 µCi, 0.1 mm) at 37 °C. Uptake was terminated by washing the cells twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0) containing 0.3m sucrose. Then the cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1% SDS, and the radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Vital staining with acridine orange was performed as described previously (24Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BoNT/E was purified as described previously (25Kamata Y. Kimura Y. Hiroi T. Sakaguchi G. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1156: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against chromogranin A were raised by injecting chromogranin A electrophoretically purified from bovine chromaffin granules. The following antibodies were obtained commercially: monoclonal antibodies against SNAP25 (mAbBR05) (Wako Chemical Co.), monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin (SY38) and chromogranin A (Progen), monoclonal antibodies against dopamine from Biogenesis.d-[2,3-3H]Aspartate (18 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). α-Latrotoxin was purchased from Alomone Labs, Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. PC12 cells contain an appreciable amount of d-aspartate (257 ± 31 pmol/107 cells). To reveal the subcellular localization of d-aspartate in PC12 cells, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with specific antibodies against d-aspartate. Fig.1 A shows that the antibodies stained vesicular structures. The d-aspartate immunoreactivity was co-localized with dopamine (Fig. 1,A–C) and chromogranin A (Fig. 1, D–F), markers for secretory granules, but was not co-localized with synaptophysin, a marker for synaptic-like microvesicles (Fig. 1, G–I). The pre-adsorbed antibodies with d-aspartate-glutaraldehyde conjugate as well as preimmune serum did not stain the cells (Fig. 1,J and K). These results suggest the localization of d-aspartate in secretory granules.d-Aspartate immunoreactivity is not present in all PC12 cells: about 10% of cells exhibited d-aspartate immunoreactivity among the more than 104 cells examined, although more than 95% of the cells exhibited synaptophysin and chromogranin immunoreactivities. The percentage ofd-aspartate-positive cells did not change during culture in the presence or absence of nerve growth factor (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation was conducted to confirm the localization ofd-aspartate in secretory granules. After homogenization of PC12 cells (1 × 108 cells), 74 ± 5% of d-aspartate and 62 ± 4% of dopamine were recovered in the P2 fraction that contains secretory granules (TableI). Then secretory granules were separated from the P2 fraction by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, secretory granules were recovered in fractions 1–7 (peak fraction, 2), whereas synaptic-like microvesicles were recovered in fractions 2–9(peak fractions, 6–8) as revealed by the distribution of marker proteins. Consistent with the distribution of marker proteins, about 80% of each of d-aspartate and dopamine in the P2 fraction was recovered in the secretory granule fraction (Fig.2 B). Together with the immunohistochemical localization of d-aspartate shown above, it is concluded that d-aspartate is present in secretory granules.Table IContent of d-aspartate and dopamine in whole cells and the subcellular fractions of PC12 cellsFractiond-AspartateDopamineWhole cells100 ± 12100 ± 19P116 ± 413 ± 3P274 ± 562 ± 4S215 ± 119 ± 2P1, P2, and S2 fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results were expressed as percentage of d-aspartate and dopamine found in whole cells, which corresponded to 250 ± 31 pmol ofd-aspartate/107 cells and 32.75 ± 6.10 nmol of dopamine/107 cells. In a separate experiment, PC12 cells were incubated with 10 µm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein acetoxymethylester (BCECF-AM) for 30 min and washed with PBS. Then the cells trapped with BCECF (a cytosolic marker) were fractionated as described above. Major BCECF fluorescence (93%) was recovered in the S2 fraction, whereas only 5% was found in the P2 fraction, indicating that contamination of cytoplasm into the P2 fraction is scarce. Open table in a new tab P1, P2, and S2 fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results were expressed as percentage of d-aspartate and dopamine found in whole cells, which corresponded to 250 ± 31 pmol ofd-aspartate/107 cells and 32.75 ± 6.10 nmol of dopamine/107 cells.

The localization of d-aspartate in secretory granules suggests secretion of d-aspartate through regulated exocytosis. In fact, when PC12 cells were cultured under the standard culture conditions, an appreciable amount ofd-aspartate appeared in the medium, suggesting the presence of a d-aspartate-releasing system(s) (12Moriyama Y. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Oda T. Yamaguchi A. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To obtain evidence of d-aspartate exocytosis, we measured thed-aspartate concentration in the medium upon stimulation of the PC12 cells with KCl, which is known to trigger exocytosis of secretory granules following depolarization of plasma membrane. An appreciable amount of d-aspartate (40.0 ± 7.1 pmol/107 cells, which corresponds to 16% of the totald-aspartate; four determinations) was released by 10 min upon the addition of KCl in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.3 A). Essentially nol-aspartate (≪0.1 pmol/107 cells) was released under these conditions. The amount of releasedd-aspartate depended on time (Fig. 3 A) and the concentration of KCl (Fig. 3 B): the d-aspartate concentration was saturated at 10 min and increased at least by 50 mm KCl. In the absence of CaCl2, KCl-evokedd-aspartate release was significantly reduced (Fig. 3,A and B). A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, caused rapid release of d-aspartate by the cells only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, upon treatment with EGTA-AM to remove intracellular free Ca2+, the cells lost the ability of KCl-evoked release ofd-aspartate (Fig. 3 D). Likewise dopamine was released from PC12 cells with similar kinetics and Ca2+dependence (Fig. 3, E–H). These results indicate thatd-aspartate is released from PC12 cells depending on Ca2+ and suggested that the entry of extracellular Ca2+ following depolarization is necessary for thed-aspartate release as in the case of dopamine. To support the importance of the entry of extracellular Ca2+ ind-aspartate release, we measured the intracellular [Ca2+] of Fura-2-loaded PC12 cells. The intracellular [Ca2+] level in PC12 cells at the resting state is 101 ± 1 nm (n = 74) in +Ca2+-Ringer's solution or −Ca2+-Ringer's solution. Treatment with KCl at 50 mm increased it to 375 ± 14 nm (n = 33) in the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. The KCl-evoked increase of the intracellular [Ca2+] was not observed when the cells were incubated in −Ca2+-Ringer's solution or when cells were treated with EGTA-AM. Furthermore, the cadmium ion, a nonspecific inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (26Tsien R.W. Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Bley K.R. Fox A.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), at 10 µm inhibited 60% of the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release and blocked 75% of the KCl-evoked increase in intracellular [Ca2+]. These results suggested that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, at least in part, are involved in the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release by PC12 cells. We further characterized the K+- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release by PC12 cells by examining the effect of temperature. The KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release was affected by the temperature: it was not observed at 4 °C but appeared gradually with increasing temperature and reached the maximum at 37 °C. Furthermore, once d-aspartate had been secreted the successive stimulation by KCl within 1 h was not effective. The KCl-evoked release of d-aspartate was gradually restored upon incubation and had recovered completely by incubation for 12 h, suggesting that charged and discharged processes are involved in the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release. These properties are similar to those of the exocytosis of dopamine, supporting that d-aspartate is secreted through exocytosis. The sensitivity to BoNT/E constitutes evidence of Ca2+-dependent regulated exocytosis because this neurotoxin splits SNAP25 and inhibits the late postdocking steps, resulting in inhibition of the exocytosis of secretory granules in PC12 cells (27Washbourne P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, BoNT/E cleaved SNAP25, yielding a low molecular weight fragment (Fig. 4 A,asterisk) and inhibited the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent release ofd-aspartate (Fig. 4 B) and dopamine (Fig.4 C). The inhibitory potency of BoNT/E was essentially the same as that in the exocytosis of dopamine. Under the same assay conditions, the addition of K+ increased intracellular [Ca2+] in BoNT/E-treated cells to an extent similar to that in control cells (data not shown). These results indicated that SNAP25 is involved in the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release. α-Latrotoxin, a component of black widow spider venom, triggers Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from neurons and neuroendocrine cells (30Rosenthal L. Meldolesi J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The neurotoxin, therefore, stimulates dopamine exocytosis in PC12 cells (31Sugita S. Ichtchenko K. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32715-32724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, α-latrotoxin at 1 nm increased intracellular [Ca2+] to 405 ± 13 nm (n = 54) in the presence of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+ increase of intracellular [Ca2+] was not observed. Under these conditions, α-latrotoxin caused the release ofd-aspartate and dopamine to a similar extent in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5, B and C). In the absence of Ca2+, however, neitherd-aspartate nor dopamine was released on the addition of α-latrotoxin (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicated that the α-latrotoxin-evoked stimulation of the release ofd-aspartate is Ca2+-dependent as in the case of dopamine. It is known that bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (32Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), effectively inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters (33Cousin M.A. Nicholls D.G. Pocock J.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Araque A. Li N. Doyle R.T. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 20: 666-673Crossref Google Scholar) because the compound dissipates the electrochemical proton gradient necessary for neurotransmitter uptake into vesicles. As expected, bafilomycin A1 at 1 µmdissipated the transmembrane pH gradient of acidic organelles in the cells as revealed on acridine orange vital staining (Fig.6, A and B). Under similar assay conditions, bafilomycin A1 inhibited 40% of the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release (Fig. 6 C) and 55% of the dopamine release (Fig.6 D). The results suggest that an electrochemical proton gradient is necessary at least in part for the KCl- and Ca2+-dependent d-aspartate release by PC12 cells as in the case of dopamine. Sensitivities to bafilomycin A1 suggest the presence of systems for the accumulation of d-aspartate in secretory granules. In the final part of the study, we investigated whether or not such a transport system is present in the cells. As shown in Fig. 7, radiolabeled d-aspartate was taken up by the digitonin-permeabilized cells depending on ATP. The omission of Mg2+ reduced the ATP-dependentd-aspartate uptake to the control level. Consistent with the Ca2+-dependent release of d-aspartate, bafilomycin A1 at 1 µm inhibited the ATP-dependent d-aspartate uptake. SF6847 (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene-malononitrile), a proton conductor that dissipates an electrochemical proton gradient, also inhibited the ATP-dependent d-aspartate uptake. These results suggest that the d-aspartate transporter energetically coupled with vacuolar H+-ATPase is responsible for the storage and release of d-aspartate in PC12 cells. PC12 cells develop two different kinds of secretory machinery: one is secretory granules, which are responsible for the secretion of monoamines such as dopamine, and the other is synaptic-like microvesicles, counterparts of neuronal synaptic vesicles that contain acetylcholine (14Bauerfeind R. Regnier-Vigouroux A. Flatmark T. Huttner W.B. Neuron. 1993; 11: 105-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here we showed that d-aspartate is stored in secretory granules but not in synaptic-like microvesicles. Furthermore, d-aspartate is secreted through a Ca2+-dependent exocytotic mechanism in a parallel fashion to dopamine secretion. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies revealed the localization of d-aspartate in secretory granules. The storage of d-aspartate seems to be stereospecific because essentially no accumulation of thel-form was observed in secretory granules on indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, 2M. Hayashi and Y. Moriyama, unpublished observation. and the release of the l-form from cells was under the detection limit as revealed on HPLC analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the accumulation of transmitters in secretory granules is generally mediated through an active transport mechanism by secondary transporters energized with vacuolar H+-ATPase, our results suggest the presence of a d-aspartate transporter(s) in secretory granules in PC12 cells (Fig. 7). The involvement of the brain-specific Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter (BNPI), recently identified as a vesicular glutamate transporter in neuronal cells (23Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 35Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), in the accumulation of d-aspartate is unlikely because a vesicular glutamate transporter does not recognize d-aspartate as a substrate (36Naito S. Ueda T. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 37Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22314-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is not expressed in PC12 cells (35Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The absence of BNPI in PC12 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting using the site-specific polyclonal antibodies against BNPI (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that a novel vesiculard-aspartate transporter functions in the secretory granules in a subset of PC12 cells. Identification and characterization of the putative d-aspartate transporter is now in progress in our laboratory. The presence of d-aspartate in secretory granules raises an important issue of the origin of d-aspartate in PC12 cells. The d-aspartate content in the culture medium was below the detection limit (≪1 fmol). The d-aspartate content in the cells did not change with the duration of culture or during 5–10 passages (12Moriyama Y. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Oda T. Yamaguchi A. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 248: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PC12 cells do not express a plasma membrane-type Na+-dependent glutamate transporter that recognizes d-aspartate as a substrate. Thus, it is likely that d-aspartate is not of exogenous origin but is de novo synthesized byd-aspartate synthase in the cells. In this respect, it is noteworthy that d-aspartate racemase-like activity was detected in rat pinealocytes (9Ishio S. Yamada H. Hayashi M. Yatsushiro S. Noumi T. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 249: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and adrenal glands (38Wolsker H. D'Aniello A. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Several criteria are known for regulated exocytosis. We found that the properties of the release of d-aspartate in PC12 cells satisfied the criteria. At first, PC12 cells secrete the amino acid depending on Ca2+. The sensitivity to Cd2+suggests the involvement of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the process. Our preliminary experiments indicated that antagonists for voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels such as nifedipine inhibited the Ca2+-dependentd-aspartate release and blocked the KCl-evoked increase in intracellular [Ca2+], but antagonists for N-type or P/O-type channels did not have such effects. These results suggest that L-type Ca2+ channels are responsible for the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space into PC12 cells. Consistently, the presence of L-type Ca2+ channels in PC12 cells has been demonstrated (39Schindelholtz B. Reber B.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 12: 194-204Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Lee I.S. Park T.J. Suh B.C. Kim Y.S. Rhee I.J. Kim K.T. Biochem.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26786-26791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second line of evidence is the temperature sensitivity and the requirement of an appropriate duration of the response for a second stimulation. These properties may reflect complex membrane dynamics including the charging and discharging of neurotransmitters. Similar phenomena were observed for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis found in various endocrine cells and neuronal cells (15Yamada H. Ogura A. Koizumi S. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4946-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,42Yamada H. Yamamoto A. Yodozawa S. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Michibata H. Morita M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Moriyama Y. J. Pineal Res. 1996; 21: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 44Heiderberger R. Heinemann C. Nehr E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The relatively slow rate of d-aspartate release (minute order as shown in Fig. 3 A) is also similar to that of the release of dopamine by PC12 cells and glutamate by rat pinealocytes (15Yamada H. Ogura A. Koizumi S. Yamaguchi A. Moriyama Y. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4946-4952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third line of evidence is the sensitivity to α-latrotoxin, BoNT/E, and bafilomycin A1. The sensitivity to these compounds strongly suggests the involvement of the α-latrotoxin receptor, SNAP receptor complex, and vacuolar H+-ATPase, which are important components of Ca2+-dependent regulated exocytosis, in the secretion of d-aspartate. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis is a novel mechanism for the release of d-aspartate from neuroendocrine cells. Although it is unknown whether or not Ca2+-dependent exocytosis ofd-aspartate occurs under physiological conditions, Snyder and his colleagues (7Schell M.J. Cooper O.B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) observed that the injection of potassium ion into the cerebral cortex of mice caused a pronounced increase ind-aspartate staining in the choroid plexus. This suggests that depolarization elicited by potassium ion injection releasesd-aspartate and that the exocytotic mechanism ford-aspartate secretion operates in the choroid plexus. Very recently it was reported that depolarization by the addition of K+ or acetylcholine released d-aspartate from sliced adrenal gland (38Wolsker H. D'Aniello A. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Upon exocytosis, d-aspartate may interact with target cells, which is very consistent with the neuroendocrine role of d-aspartate in neuroendocrine cells as suggested by Snyder and his colleagues (7Schell M.J. Cooper O.B. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2013-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that PC12 cells accumulated-aspartate in secretory granules and secrete it through exocytosis. PC12 cells may constitute a suitable experimental system for studies on the mode of action of d-aspartate in neuroendocrine cells. Our present results may provide an insight into the mode of action of d-aspartate in neuroendocrine cells. Further studies are necessary to determine which type of cell secretesd-aspartate through the Ca2+-dependent exocytotic pathway in vivo."

Although several non-snRNP proteins function during the binding of U1 and U2 snRNPs, little is known about the subsequent binding of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP. A recent proteomic analysis of the human spliceosome identified SPF30 (Neubauer, G., King, A., Rappsilber, J., Calvio, C., Watson, M., Ajuh, P., Sleeman, J., Lamond, A., and Mann, M. (1998) Nat.

We show here that SPF30 is a nuclear protein that associates with both U4/U5/U6 and U2 snRNP components. In the absence of SPF30, the preformed tri-snRNP fails to assemble into the spliceosome. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-SPF30 fusion protein associates with complexes containing core Sm and U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP proteins when added to HeLa nuclear extract, most strongly to U4/U6–90. The data indicate that SPF30 is an essential human splicing factor that may act to dock the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP to the A complex during spliceosome assembly or, alternatively, may act as a late assembly factor in both the tri-snRNP and the A-complex.

Splicing takes place in the nucleus, in most cases directly on nascent gene transcripts. The splicing mechanism removes introns in a two-step mechanism involving sequential transesterification reactions and is catalyzed by a dedicated machinery termed the spliceosome (reviewed by Ref. 2Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The spliceosome complex is composed of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)1 subunits; specifically, the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs. The U4/U5/U6 snRNPs preassemble into a tri-snRNP subunit before joining the spliceosome. In addition to the snRNPs, a group of additional protein splicing factors is also present in spliceosomes.In vitro studies in both mammalian and yeast systems have shown that spliceosomes assemble on pre-mRNAs in a stepwise pathway involving the sequential binding of the U1, U2, and U4/U5/U6 snRNP subunits. Thus, assembly of the active spliceosome is preceded by the formation of partial complexes corresponding to assembly intermediates (3Jamison S. Crow A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 5Cheng S.C. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The U1 snRNP binds to the 5′ splice site of the nuclear pre-mRNA (6Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) assisted by non-snRNP proteins like ASF/SF2 (7Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), whereas a protein complex termed U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) associates with the 3′ splice site (8Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The two splice sites are thought to be bridged by members of the SR protein family, proteins with a sequence stretch rich in alternating serine and arginine residues (9Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 10Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). This assembly intermediate is called mammalian E complex (or yeast commitment complex), and it subsequently recruits U2 snRNP to form the A complex (3Jamison S. Crow A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12Pikielny C.W.

A number of non-snRNP protein factors are also required for formation of these intermediate complexes. For example, protein factors in the E-complex include SF1 (14Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar) and U2AF65 (15Valcárcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and in the U2 snRNP, the proteins of the SF3a and SF3b complexes are involved (16Kramer A. Utans U. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Champion-Arnaud P. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Gozani O. Feld R.

A number of snRNP proteins are required for the preassembly of the tri-snRNP. Genetic and biochemical work in yeast has shown that PRP8 (19Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), PRP4 (20Banroques J. Abelson J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3710-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and PRP6 (21Abovich N. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6417-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Galisson F. Legrain P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) gene products are essential. Additionally, a set of tri-snRNP-specific proteins is required for reconstitution of purified and disassembled human tri-snRNP, whereas purified 20 S U5 snRNP together with 10 S U4/U6 snRNP alone failed to bind (23Behrens S.E. Tyc K. Kastner B. Reichelt J. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly little is known about the binding of the tri-snRNP to the A complex. Most observed mutations in yeast that affect the assembly of the spliceosome do so by reducing the levels of snRNPs or the level of the tri-snRNP (24Blanton S. Srinivasan A. Rymond B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3939-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, antibodies against either the PRP4 or PRP8 proteins prevent spliceosome formation but apparently do not prevent assembly of the tri-snRNP (19Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Banroques J. Abelson J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3710-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive mutation PRP8–1 prevents spliceosome formation and lies in the region of the antibody epitope. But in this experiment it is not clear whether the effect is direct or due instead to destabilization of the U5 snRNP or tri-snRNP (19Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In mammalian extracts, SR domain-containing proteins have been suggested to be involved in docking the tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome (25Roscigno R.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 692-706PubMed Google Scholar), but the evidence is not conclusive (see “Discussion”). Thus, it is still an open question which proteins are directly involved in this step and whether non-snRNP proteins are required for the binding of the tri-snRNP to the A complex.The biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs is itself a complex pathway. Four of the five snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, and U5) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, then leave the nucleus to assemble with the set of seven core Sm proteins in the cytosol. After the Sm proteins bind the snRNAs are hypermethylated to form the m3G 5′ cap structure and reimported into the nucleus (26Lührmann R. Kastner B. Bach M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 265-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The fifth snRNA, U6, is an RNA polymerase III transcript that has a γ monomethyl cap structure and does not leave the nucleus before its incorporation into the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP. Newly assembled snRNPs preferentially localize in subnuclear structures called Cajal bodies (also called coiled bodies (27Gall J.G. Bellini M. Wu Z. Murphy C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4385-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), which were found to be identical with gems in most cell lines (28Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)) when they first return to the nucleus during their maturation pathway (29Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At later times they accumulate in separate nuclear structures termed speckles, together with other splicing factors. A multi-protein complex containing the proteins SMN1, SIP1, Gemin3, Gemin4, and a number of yet unidentified members has been implicated in snRNP biogenesis as well as in shuttling the snRNPs into the nucleus (30Liu Q.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that SMN1 plays a role in recycling snRNPs from spliceosomes after splicing has taken place. There is much interest in SMN1 because mutations in this gene cause spinal muscular atrophy, the most common inherited cause of childhood mortality (35Lefebvre S. Bürglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). The link between the disease and the biochemical function of the protein has not been elucidated.Recently, we reported a large scale proteomic analysis of purified human spliceosomes in which a number of novel proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and linked to splicing (1Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). One of these proteins, denoted splicing factor 30 kDa (SPF30), exhibited a sequence similarity to SMN1. Here we show that SPF30 is an essential protein-splicing factor. Nuclear extracts lacking SPF30 are not capable of in vitro splicing, and spliceosome assembly is halted at the A complex. We find that SPF30 interacts with both U2 snRNP and tri-snRNP components and propose that it may act either as a bridging factor between the A complex and the tri-snRNP during spliceosome assembly or have a chaperon-like function in the A complex and the tri-snRNP, allowing their fusion.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have analyzed the function of SPF30, a protein that was previously identified in a proteomic screen of the human spliceosome (1Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Here we report that SPF30 is an exclusively nuclear protein that colocalizes with Sm proteins in speckled structures known to contain splicing factors. We show that SPF30 is also an essential splicing factor that is required for spliceosome assembly and splicing. Specifically, depletion of SPF30 from HeLa nuclear extracts blocks spliceosome formation at the A complex before the addition of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP. However, the tri-snRNP is still formed in HeLa extracts depleted of SPF30. Both spliceosome formation and splicing are restored to depleted extracts by addition of E. coli-expressed SPF30 alone. A combination of immunodepletion and protein interaction experiments indicate that SPF30 associates with complexes containing U2 snRNP components and complexes containing U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP components. These data lead us to propose that SPF30 is an essential protein-splicing factor whose function is required for the addition of the tri-snRNP to the A complex during spliceosome assembly (Fig. 7).SPF30 is the first and so far only reported homologue of SMN1, the gene responsible for spinal muscular atrophy. Both proteins are co-linear and share a central Tudor domain. A second region of strong similarity falls onto the sequence stretch that is involved in the binding of SMN1 to Sm proteins, the core proteins of snRNPs (30Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Previous work has implicated SMN1 in the biogenesis as well as in the recycling of snRNPs (31Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 32Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).We find that SPF30 colocalizes together with SMN1 in Cajal bodies (also called coiled bodies) in HeLa nuclei. These are structures previously implicated in the biogenesis and recycling of snRNPs ( (27Gall J.G. Bellini M. Wu Z. Murphy C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4385-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 29Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Pellizzoni L.

Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, apart from their colocalization in Cajal bodies, the SPF30 and SMN proteins have distinct cellular distributions. Thus, SPF30, but not SMN, is found in nuclear speckles together with other splicing factors and spliceosome proteins, whereas SMN1 is also found in the cytoplasm. These differences in cellular localization may reflect the preferential involvement of SMN1 in snRNP biogenesis, whereas SPF30 is actively involved in the splicing reaction catalyzed by mature snRNPs. Consistent with this view, SPF30, but not SMN1, was shown to associate with purified spliceosomes in vitro (1Neubauer G. King A. Rappsilber J. Calvio C. Watson M. Ajuh P. Sleeman J. Lamond A. Mann M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We also show here that purified SMN1 cannot substitute for the function of SPF30 that is required during spliceosome assembly. Our data indicate that the SPF30 and SMN1 proteins play quite distinct roles connected with splicing. This does not exclude, however, that SMN1 has an important role in the mechanism of splicing in vivo, such as in snRNP recycling, as previously suggested (32Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).We present a variety of experimental evidence in this study that all points to the conclusion that SPF30 can interact with the spliceosomal snRNPs U2 and U4/U5/U6 as follows. (i) SPF30 is co-immunoprecipitated with anti-m3G cap antibodies; (ii) anti-SPF30 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNP; (iii) antisense oligonucleotides specific for U2, U4/U6, U5, and U6 snRNP coprecipitate SPF30; (iv) recombinant GST-SPF30 can affinity select U4, U5, and U6 snRNP as well as small amounts of U2 snRNP; and (v) SPF30 co-fractionates with U2 snRNP in glycerol gradients. In contrast, none of the experiments reveal any evidence for interaction of SPF30 with the U1 snRNP. Taken together, these data show that SPF30 either binds directly to U2, U4/U6, and U5 snRNP or else forms complexes with other nuclear factors that include these snRNPs. However, it is not likely that SPF30 is a new snRNP protein. Only a minor fraction of the total SPF30 protein in HeLa nuclear extract can be coprecipitated with snRNPs, and only a fraction co-migrates with the U2 snRNP. In addition, despite extensive analysis of the snRNPs by the laboratories of Lührmann (23Behrens S.E. Tyc K. Kastner B. Reichelt J. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 69Bach M. Lührmann R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 70Behrens S.E. Lührmann R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1439-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and others, SPF30 has not been reported so far. On the other hand, purifications of the U2 snRNP (23Behrens S.E. Tyc K. Kastner B. Reichelt J. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the U5 snRNP (69Bach M. Lührmann R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the tri-snRNP (70Behrens S.E. Lührmann R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1439-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) show a substoichiometric band of the approximate size of SPF30. This would be consistent with a loose attachment of SPF30 to these snRNPs or with SPF30 associating only with a subset of these snRNP complexes.The co-fractionation of endogenous SPF30 with the U2 snRNP and the fact that anti-SPF30 antibody precipitates U2 snRNA whereas antisense oligonucleotides specific for U2 snRNA precipitate SPF30 suggests that SPF30 binds to this complex. In addition, tri-snRNP components can be affinity-purified using recombinant GST-SPF30. Anti-SPF30 also co-immunoprecipitates the U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs that are found in the tri-snRNP, and antisense oligonucleotides specific for U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs precipitate SPF30. Taken together, these findings also suggest that SPF30 binds to the U4/U6 and U5 snRNP. Although all snRNP complexes may bind to the same site in SPF30, the homology to SMN1 predicts two putative interaction sites in SPF30. SPF30 shares a strong similarity in the C terminus with the Sm protein binding region of SMN1, and both proteins have a Tudor domain. It has been shown that SMN1 binds RNA in its N-terminal region, and the main contribution is thought to come from a predicted amphipathic α-helix (58Bertrandy S. Burlet P. Clermont O. Huber C. Fondrat C. Thierry-Mieg D. Munnich A. Lefebvre S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This α-helix is conserved in SPF30 and supports the view of direct RNA binding for this protein. Furthermore, recombinant SPF30 is able to bind RNA from total HeLa RNA preparation on its own. 2J. Rappsilber and M. Mann, unpublished data. The fact that SPF30 apparently only co-fractionationates with the U2 snRNP in glycerol gradients and not also with the tri-snRNP as could be expected from the other experiments could be explained by a detection problem. The U2 snRNP is much more abundant than the tri-snRNP components. Therefore, the presence of SPF30 in the tri-snRNP may be overlooked in this kind of experiment. A similar effect is seen in the isolation of the individual U snRNPs. Our observation that U2 snRNP is the U snRNP most strongly interacting with SPF30 may be explained by the relative higher amounts of U2 snRNP in nuclear extract compared with the amount of tri-snRNP.We have shown that SPF30 is an essential factor in splicing, as judged by the reduction in splicing activity in SPF30-depleted extracts that is then enhanced by specific addition of E. coli-expressed SPF30 protein alone. The presence of orthologs of SPF30 in model organisms like C. elegans, A. thaliana, S. pombe, and P. falciparum is consistent with its having an essential role in splicing. Although we did not detect any SPF30-like protein in budding yeast, we note that some other essential mammalian-splicing factors, including the RS domain proteins, are also not found in S. cerevisiae, nor are other Tudor domain proteins like SMN1. SPF30 and SR proteins may be involved in spliceosome assembly mechanisms that are performed differently in this organism.An analysis of the assembly of the spliceosome in ΔSPF30 extracts reveals that the A complex, which contains U2 snRNP but not the tri-snRNP, can form and accumulates in the absence of SPF30. The addition of recombinant SPF30 at both early and late incubation times restores spliceosome formation and splicing. This indicates that at least some of the A complexes formed in the absence of SPF30 can proceed in the splicing pathway once the lacking component is added. We also found that the tri-snRNP is assembled in ΔSPF30 extracts. These observations suggest that SPF30 is required for the recruitment of the tri-snRNP into the A complex to form the spliceosome. Previous work has been done both in human and S. cerevisiae-splicing systems to analyze this assembly step. In S. cerevisiae, antibodies against PRP4 (20Banroques J. Abelson J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3710-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and PRP8 (19Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) prevented the addition of the tri-snRNP into the pre-spliceosome apparently without affecting the stability of the tri-snRNP. Because both proteins are required for tri-snRNP assembly, direct study of tri-snRNP docking is difficult. None of the temperature-sensitive mutants reported so far (19Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 71Ayadi L. Miller M. Banroques J. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 197-209PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to block tri-snRNP docking; thus, it remains unclear whether inactivation of PRP4 and PRP8 blocks only tri-snRNP assembly or also docking to the pre-spliceosome. In HeLa-splicing extracts, SR proteins have been shown to be essential for the incorporation of high salt-precipitated tri-snRNPs into purified pre-spliceosome complexes (25Roscigno R.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 692-706PubMed Google Scholar). However, the salt precipitate does not contain the SR proteins, some of which are tri-snRNP-specific and required for its assembly (such as the 27-kDa tri-snRNP-specific protein) (70Behrens S.E. Lührmann R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1439-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 72Fetzer S. Lauber J. Will C.L. Lührmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 344-355PubMed Google Scholar). Since the tri-snRNP is disassembled after high salt precipitation, it is not clear if the SR proteins were necessary for the docking of the tri-snRNP rather than only for its assembly.We propose two alternative models that are difficult to distinguish. In the first model SPF30 is a bridging factor between the tri-snRNP on one side and U2 snRNP in the pre-spliceosome on the other side. Given the fact that splicing incompetent ΔSPF30 extracts can be rescued by SPF30 alone, suggesting that no rate-limiting factor is co-depleted, and due to the association of SPF30 to the U2, U4/U6, U5, and possibly U6 snRNP, we suggest that this bridging may be direct (Fig. 7). For example, SPF30 interactions may join the two large complexes to form the spliceosome. In the second model SPF30 has a more general role as an assembly factor. Among the proteins isolated using recombinant SPF30 was hSad1p, the human homolog of S. cerevisiae Sad1p, a protein found to function in U4/U6 snRNP formation (65Lygerou Z. Christophides G. Seraphin B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2008-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of SPF30 in U4/U6 snRNP formation or an involvement of this protein in later assembly steps. But SPF30 is also found associated with both the U4/U6 snRNP, potentially binding to U4/U6–90, and the U5 snRNP, which must fuse to form the tri-snRNP. Our data also indicate that SPF30 is needed for the docking of the tri-snRNP to the A complex, all supporting the notion of the second model. Furthermore, we have found a possible interaction of SPF30 with DD15, the human homolog of S. cerevisiae PRP43, a RNA helicase that has been implicated in spliceosome disassembly. Therefore, SPF30 may be involved not only in the assembly but also in the disassembly of the spliceosome, perhaps as a more general assembly/disassembly factor for higher order snRNP complexes. In this SPF30 may complement the function of SMN1, which is proposed to be involved in snRNP recycling (32Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Future studies will be directed toward testing these models and further characterizing the role of SPF30 in the splicing mechanism.Note Added in ProofWhile this manuscript was in print, another report describing SPF30 was published (73Meister G. Hannus S. Plottner O. Baars T. Hartmann E. Fakan S. Laggerbauer B. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The splicing of nuclear mRNA precursors, pre-mRNAs, is an essential step for the expression of all intron-containing eukaryotic genes. Splicing takes place in the nucleus, in most cases directly on nascent gene transcripts. The splicing mechanism removes introns in a two-step mechanism involving sequential transesterification reactions and is catalyzed by a dedicated machinery termed the spliceosome (reviewed by Ref. 2Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The spliceosome complex is composed of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)1 subunits; specifically, the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs. The U4/U5/U6 snRNPs preassemble into a tri-snRNP subunit before joining the spliceosome. In addition to the snRNPs, a group of additional protein splicing factors is also present in spliceosomes. In vitro studies in both mammalian and yeast systems have shown that spliceosomes assemble on pre-mRNAs in a stepwise pathway involving the sequential binding of the U1, U2, and U4/U5/U6 snRNP subunits. Thus, assembly of the active spliceosome is preceded by the formation of partial complexes corresponding to assembly intermediates (3Jamison S. Crow A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 5Cheng S.C. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1014-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The U1 snRNP binds to the 5′ splice site of the nuclear pre-mRNA (6Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) assisted by non-snRNP proteins like ASF/SF2 (7Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), whereas a protein complex termed U2AF (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor) associates with the 3′ splice site (8Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The two splice sites are thought to be bridged by members of the SR protein family, proteins with a sequence stretch rich in alternating serine and arginine residues (9Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 10Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). This assembly intermediate is called mammalian E complex (or yeast commitment complex), and it subsequently recruits U2 snRNP to form the A complex (3Jamison S. Crow A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell.

The occurrence of the SO3−→3Gal structure has not been fully elucidated to date because of the difficulty of structural studies for sulfated glycans. However, the sulfated structure seems to be distributed extensively because the glycoprotein-specific β-Gal-3′-sulfotransferase (Gal3ST-2) gene is expressed ubiquitously in various human tissues (17Honke K.

In relation to the biosynthesis of sulfated glycans, cDNA cloning of more than 20 sulfotransferases has been achieved to date (for review, see Ref. 18Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Among these sulfotransferases, the C-3 sulfation of galactose is catalyzed by Gal:→3-sulfotransferase. Three Gal:→3-sulfotransferases have so far been cloned. One is glycolipid-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (Gal3ST-1) (19Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which utilizes galactosylceramide (GalCer),1lactosylceramide (LacCer), and galactosyldiacylglycerol (GalDG) (20Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The second is GP3ST or Gal3ST-2, which utilizes not only Galβ1→3/4GlcNAc but also Galβ1→3GalNAc (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24388-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three enzymes share about 40% identity of the amino acid sequences, indicating the existence of a family of Gal:→3-sulfotransferases (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I.

To search for a novel member of the family, we investigated the expressed sequence tags (EST) data bases using the Gal3ST-1 amino acid sequence and found the fourth member of Gal:→3-sulfotransferase. [35S]PAPS (96.9 GBq/mmol) and UDP-[4,5-3H(N)1Gal (1,110 GBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-p-nitrophenyl (pNP), N-acetyllactosamine (type 2), Galβ1→3GalNAc, and Galβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1-O-pNP (core 2-O-pNP) were purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).

(San Mateo, CA). Psathyrella velutinalectin was prepared according to the method described by Kochibe and Matta (22Kochibe N. Matta K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the lectin was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc was isolated from human milk (23Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 262-271Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→3(6)Manβ1→4GlcNAc was obtained from the urine of GM1 gangliosidosis patients (24Yamashita K. Ohkura T. Okada S. Yabuuchi H. Kobata A. J. Biol.

Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→3(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→ 6)Manβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→4GlcNAc was prepared from egg yolk sialoglycopeptide (25Seko A. Koketsu M. Noshizono M. Enoki Y. Ibrahim H.R. Juneja L.R. Kim M. Yamamoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) by hydrazinolysis-re-N-acetylation and mild acid hydrolysis. SO3−→3Galβ1→3(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1-O-Bn was a kind gift from Dr. S. Yazawa (Japan Immunoresearch Laboratories, Takasaki) (26Okamura A. Yazawa S. Nishimura T. Tanaka S. Takai I. Kudo S. Asao T. Kuwano H. Matta K.L. Akamatsu S. Kochibe N. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sulfated oligosaccharide was digested withStreptococcus 6646K β-galactosidase (10 milliunits) and jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (3 units) in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.3) and 10 mmMnCl2. The digest was applied on a R. communisagglutinin I-agarose column (1.5 × 2.8 cm), and the pass-through fraction was further applied on a P. velutinalectin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 2.8 cm, 4.5 mg/ml gel). The pass-through, SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn, was desalted with Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and used as an authentic compound. Based on the amino acid sequence of human Gal3ST-1 (19Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we found one sequence (GenBankAW961058) with high similarity in the EST data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). We used GeneTrapper® cDNA Positive Selection System (Life Technologies, Inc.) to obtain the cDNA clone according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an oligonucleotide, 5′-GCCCTAGCGAAACATTGTCTGGTA-3′ (the nucleotide sequence corresponding to 1440–1463; see Fig. 1 A) was biotinylated and then used as a probe. SuperScriptTM human testis cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) in which testis cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-SPORT, was degraded to single-stranded cDNA by Gene II and exonuclease III digestion. The single-stranded cDNA was hybridized with the biotinylated probe, and the target cDNA was captured to streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads. The target cDNA was released, re-double-stranded, and then transformed into DH5α cells. Among 60 colonies, 1 colony contained cDNA for Gal3ST-4. The cDNA for Gal3ST-4 contained in pCMV-SPORT, named pCMV-SPORT-Gal3ST-4, was sequenced using Applied Biosystems PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The plasmid (1 µg) was transfected into COS-7 cells on 35-mm dishes using Lipofectin Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off from the dishes in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.25 m sucrose, and homogenized. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The precipitated crude membranes were suspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and kept at −80 °C until use. Twenty µl of reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.3), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1m NaF, 2 mm ATP-Na2, 6.5 µm [35S]PAPS (2.8 × 105dpm), 1 mm Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP, and the crude membrane fraction appropriately diluted, was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The 35S-labeled products were purified by paper electrophoresis (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 3:1:387, pH 5.4). The RF values of35S-sulfated Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP and PAPS are 0.69 and 1.89, respectively, when theRF value of bromphenol blue is taken as 1.0. After extraction with water, the radioactivities were counted. In the case of glycolipids used as acceptor substrates, the detection of the35S-labeled products was performed according to the methods reported by Kawano et al. (27Kawano M. Honke K. Tachi M. Gasa S. Makita A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The35S-labeled product was subjected to periodate oxidation (28Spiro R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 26-52Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The labeled oligosaccharides were dissolved in 20 µl of 75 mm sodium metaperiodate, 75 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h in the dark. Excess periodate was destroyed by adding 2 µl of 20% ethylene glycol. After 1 h at room temperature, 300 µl of 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 9.0) containing 0.1 m sodium borohydride was added, and the solutions stood for 1 h at room temperature. The solutions were acidified by adding acetic acid and passed through a column (0.5 × 3 cm) of Bio-Rad AG-50W-X8 (H+ form). The eluates were evaporated, and residual boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation with methanol. The residues were hydrolyzed in 100 µl of 0.05 n H2SO4 at 80 °C for 1 h. After being neutralized with NaOH, the mixtures underwent paper electrophoresis. The 35S-labeled compounds were extracted with water, applied on a thin layer plate (Kieselgel 60F254, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and developed with solvents, pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3) or 1-butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:1). The radioactivities were monitored by a radiochromatogram scanner. [3H]Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn as a positive control for periodate oxidation was prepared as follows. Twenty µl of solution containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm GalNAcα1-O-Bn, 2.5 µmUDP-[3H]Gal (3.3 × 106 dpm), 250 µm UDP-Gal, and crude membrane fractions from porcine colonic mucosa was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture underwent paper electrophoresis, then the neutral fraction further underwent paper chromatography, which was developed with the solvent pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3). A radioactive fraction ([3H]Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn) with anRF value of 0.72 was extracted with water. Linkage position of [3H]Gal residue was confirmed by its binding to a peanut agglutinin-agarose column because peanut agglutinin specifically recognizes the Galβ1→3GalNAc structure (29Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8518-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of 6-[35S]sulfo-GlcNAcβ1-O-Bn was performed using human GlcNAc:→6-sulfotransferase as described previously (30Seko A. Sumiya J. Yonezawa S. Nagata K. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Forty µg of asialofetuin (Sigma) was dissolved in the enzyme reaction solution described above without Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Half of the reactant was subjected to mild alkaline treatment in 50 µl of 1 m NaBH4, 0.05n NaOH at 37 °C for 24 h. After acidification by acetic acid, the solution was applied on an AG-50W-X8 column, and the eluate was evaporated as described above. The other half of the reactant was subjected to N-glycanase digestion by the Glycopeptidase F De-N-glycosylation set (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). Liberated 35S-labeled oligosaccharides were analyzed by paper electrophoresis. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot membranes (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA content in each lane of the Northern blot membrane is normalized to the mRNA expression level of β-actin. 32P-Labeled probe was prepared from the cDNA fragment (1–1,423; see Fig. 1 A) by a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) using [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were prehybridized in ExpressHyb Solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 2 h and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe in the same solution at 68 °C for 16 h. The Northern blot membranes were washed in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The radioactivity was detected with FLA-2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo). We found small sequences (GenBank AW961058) similar to the sequence of human Gal3ST-1 (19Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in the EST data bases. We prepared a sense oligonucleotide, 24 nucleotides in length, the sequence of which is present in the EST, and used it as a probe for GeneTrapper® cDNA positive selection system to screen a human testis cDNA library. One clone was obtained, and the nucleotide sequence was determined (Fig.1 A). The 2,460-bp cDNA had a 5′-untranslated region of 236 bp, a single open reading frame of 1,458 bp, and a 3′-untranslated region of 766 bp including a poly(A)+ tail. The translation initiation site conformed to Kozak's rule (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), and the upstream region contained an in-frame stop codon. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 486 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 54,173 Da with one potentialN-linked glycosylation site. Hydropathy plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment, 22 amino acid residues in length in the N-terminal region, predicting that the protein has a type II transmembrane topology (Fig. 1 B). The cDNA sequence was compared with the Human Genome Project Data Base, and the genomic organization and the chromosomal localization were revealed (Fig. 1 C). The gene comprises at least four exons and spans about 10 kilobases in human chromosome 7q22. The intron/exon junctions followed the GT/AG rule (33Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The coding region is located in three exons (exons 2, 3, and 4), and two introns were inserted between nucleotides 361 and 362 (at Arg-42) and nucleotide 665 and 666 (between Glu-143 and Val-144) of the cDNA (Fig. 1 A). The amino acid sequence of the protein (named Gal3ST-4) showed 33, 39, and 30% identity with human Gal3ST-1 (19Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), human Gal3ST-2 (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and human Gal3ST-3 (21Suzuki A. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. Angata K. Misra A.K. McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24388-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), respectively (Fig.2). The two highly conserved regions (Fig. 2, underline and double line) contain putative PAPS binding motifs (34Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which are commonly conserved in all sulfotransferases cloned so far (18Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). There exist other relatively conserved regions in the C-terminal domain (299–314 and 358–374 of Gal3ST-4, in Fig. 2). In searching other sequences homologous to the cDNA for Gal3ST-4, we found one cDNA clone (GenBank accession number AK022178), 2,176 bp in length, which includes the full-length of the open reading frame of cDNA for Gal3ST-4. The putative sulfotransferase was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the crude membrane fraction was prepared as an enzyme source. The membrane fraction from the cells transfected with pCMV-SPORT-Gal3ST-4, pCMV-SPORT vector containing the cDNA for Gal3ST-4, had a sulfotransferase activity (5.6 pmol/min/mg of protein) using Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn as acceptor. The membrane fractions derived from the transfectant with pCMV-SPORT and wild type had no sulfotransferase activity. The 35S-sulfated product, [35S]SO3−→ (Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn), purified by paper electrophoresis, was resistant to 6646K β-galactosidase digestion and passed through a R. communis agglutinin I-agarose column (data not shown). Because authentic Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn was retarded on the R. communis agglutinin I-agarose column, these results suggested that the [35S]sulfate was transferred to the galactose residue. The migrating position of the 35S-sulfated product in paper electrophoresis was close to that of authentic [35S]SO3−→6GlcNAcβ1→2Man, suggesting that the product is monosulfated disaccharide. To determine the linkage position of [35S]sulfate residue, the35S-sulfated product was subjected to periodate oxidation. [3H]Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn was also subjected to oxidation as a positive control of the reaction; when subjected to TLC developed in the solvent system, 1-butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:1), [3H]Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn and the oxidative product migrated to positions with RFvalues of 0.45 and 0.56, respectively. The latter compound is theoretically [3H]glycerol because galactose is3H-labeled on the ring proton at the C-4 and 5. The result indicates that the oxidative reaction went well. The reaction product from [35S]SO3−→ (Galβ1→ 3GalNAcα1-O-Bn) underwent paper electrophoresis (Fig.3 A). It migrated to the same position as the untreated 35S-labeled product. If [35S]sulfate is transferred to the C-2, C-4, or C-6 position of galactose residue, or N-acetylgalactosamine residue, CH2OH-CH(OSO3−)-CH2OH, CH2OH-CH(OSO3−)- CHOH-CH2OH, CH2OH-CHOH-CH2(OSO3−), or SO3−→ GalNAcα1-O-Bn should be produced by periodate oxidation, respectively. [35S]SO3−→6GlcNAcβ1-O-Bn and its periodate-oxidized and reduced product, [35S]SO3−-OCH2-CHOH-CH2OH, migrated faster in paper electrophoresis than [35S]SO3−→ (Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O -Bn) (Fig. 3 A). The result suggests that [35S]sulfate does not bind to GalNAc residue or the C-2, 4, or 6 position of Gal, but the C-3 position of Gal. Moreover, the reaction product was subjected to TLC using different solvent systems (Fig. 3, B and C). The reaction product was developed to the same position as the untreated product in both solvent systems. The structure of the reaction product was further confirmed by TLC with authentic SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn (Fig.3 D). The reaction product was developed to the same position as the authentic oligosaccharide and the oligosaccharide treated with periodate oxidation. These results suggest that [35S]sulfate binds to the C-3 position of Gal residue and that the enzyme cloned here is a Gal:→3-sulfotransferase. The optimal pH of the enzyme was 6–7, using Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP as acceptor substrate (Fig.4). In the presence of MnCl2, the activity increased about 2.2-fold (TableI). EDTA had no effect on the activity, suggesting that Gal3ST-4 does not essentially require divalent cations.N-ethylmaleimide and dithiothreitol had a weak inhibitory effect on the activity when these assays were performed in the presence of MnCl2.Table IEffect of various compounds on Gal3ST-4 activityCompoundRelative activity1-aGalβ1 → 3GalNAcα1-O-pNP was used as a substrate.

Galβ1→3GalNAc, Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP, Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn, and core 2-O-pNP oligosaccharides, all of which contain the Galβ1→3GalNAc structure, are good substrates for Gal3ST-4. In contrast, Galβ1→3GlcNAc (type 1), Galβ1→4GlcNAc (type 2), Galβ1→3GalNAcOH, and GalCer are poor substrates. The results suggest that Gal3ST-4 is highly specific for the Galβ1→3GalNAc pyranoside structure. The specificity of Gal3ST-4 is sharply different from those of Gal3ST-1, Gal3ST-2, and Gal3ST-3, which recognize GalCer, Galβ1→3/4GlcNAc, and Galβ1→4GlcNAc structure as good substrates, respectively (17Honke K.

The K m values for Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP and core 2-O-pNP, which were estimated using only the data obtained with lower concentrations of the two substrates, were 0.24 and 0.23 mm, respectively (TableIII).Table IIIKinetic properties of human Gal3ST-4SubstrateK mV maxmmpmol/min/mg proteinGalβ1 → 3GalNAcα1-O-pNP3-aThe concentration of PAPS was 4 µm.0.247.2Galβ1 → 3(GlcNAcβ1 → 6)GalNAcα1-O-pNP3-aThe concentration of PAPS was 4 µm.0.236.3PAPS3-bAcceptor substrate was 3 mm Galβ1 → 3GalNAcα1-O-pNP.0.000294.2The enzyme source was the crude membrane fraction derived from COS-7 cells transfected with pCMV-SPORT-Gal3ST-4.3-a The concentration of PAPS was 4 µm.3-b Acceptor substrate was 3 mm Galβ1 → 3GalNAcα1-O-pNP.

We investigated whether Gal3ST-4 can specifically add sulfate to Galβ1→3GalNAc in asialofetuin, which contains both bi- and tri-antennary N-glycans andO-glycans consisting of Galβ1→3GalNAc (35Edge A.S.B.

After incubating asialofetuin with Gal3ST-4, half of the35S-sulfated products were subjected to mild alkaline treatment, which specifically releases O-glycans, and the other half of the products were digested with N-glycanase. As shown in Table IV,35S-sulfated oligosaccharides were released by alkaline treatment, but not by N-glycanase digestion. These results also support that Gal3ST-4 specifically acts on Galβ1→3GalNAc residue in O-glycans.Table IVAction of Gal3ST-4 on asialofetuinTotal radioactivity4-aThe enzyme reaction was performed using 40 µg of asialofetuin as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Released35S-oligosaccharides byAlkaline treatment4-bHalf of the 35S-labeled protein was treated with 1 m NaBH4 and 0.05n NaOH at 37 °C for 24 h, and released35S-labeled oligosaccharides were detected by paper electrophoresis.N-Glycanase digestion4-cHalf of the 35S-labeled protein was digested with 1 milliunit of N-glycanase after denaturation in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 0.5% SDS, and 0.1m mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 3 min, and then 1% Nonidet P-40 was added as a stabilizer.dpmdpmdpm14,11512,28004-a The enzyme reaction was performed using 40 µg of asialofetuin as described under “Experimental Procedures.”4-b Half of the 35S-labeled protein was treated with 1 m NaBH4 and 0.05n NaOH at 37 °C for 24 h, and released35S-labeled oligosaccharides were detected by paper electrophoresis.4-c Half of the 35S-labeled protein was digested with 1 milliunit of N-glycanase after denaturation in 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 0.5% SDS, and 0.1m mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 3 min, and then 1% Nonidet P-40 was added as a stabilizer. Open table in a new tab Among various human tissues, mRNA for Gal3ST-4 with 2.5 kilobases was expressed mainly in placenta, thymus, testis, ovary, spinal cord, trachea, and adrenal gland, and moderately in brain, lung, spleen, prostate, small intestine, colon, stomach, thyroid, and lymph node (Fig.6). The present study demonstrates the isolation of a novel cDNA encoding Galβ1→3GalNAc-specific Gal:→3-sulfotransferase by searching an EST homologous to human Gal3ST-1 (19Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Gal3ST-4 reveals 33, 39, and 30%, identity with Gal3ST-1, Gal3ST-2, and Gal3ST-3, respectively. This indicates that Gal3ST-4 is the fourth member of a Gal:→3-sulfotransferase family. These enzymes are in common with transferring sulfate to nonreducing terminal Gal but selectively recognize aglycon moieties of β-galactosides. Gal3ST-1 acts on GalCer, LacCer, and GalDG, but not on lactose and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glcβ1-Cer (20Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Gal3ST-2 acts on Galβ1→3/4GlcNAcβ1→R and Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn, but not on GalCer and LacCer (17Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Nakayama J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gal3ST-3 acts on Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→R (21Suzuki A. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. Angata K. Misra A.K. McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24388-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gal3ST-4 specifically recognizes the Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→ structure, and Galβ1→3/4GlcNAc, GalCer, LacCer, and GalDG are not substrates (Table II). The results indicate that the four sulfotransferases are utilized in accordance with distinct acceptor glycoconjugates. The Gal3ST-4 gene comprises at least four exons (Fig. 1 C). The coding region is inserted with two introns at Arg-42 and between Glu-143 and Val-144. The putative transmembrane domain and two putative PAPS binding domains (5′-PSB and 3′-PB) (34Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) are localized in exons 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We investigated the intron/exon alignment of Gal3ST-2 gene using the Human Genome Project Data Base and found that the coding region for Gal3ST-2 is also inserted with two introns, at Pro-40 and between Gln-125 and Val-126. The insertion positions of the Gal3ST-2 gene are very close to those of Gal3ST-4 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the coding region for Gal3ST-1 is inserted with one intron at Thr-44 (37Tsuda M. Egashira M. Niikawa N. Wada Y. Honke K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); the position is close to Arg-42 of Gal3ST-4 and Pro-40 of Gal3ST-2. As for the 5′-untranslated region, it has been shown that there exist at least seven exons for the 5′-untranslated region of the human Gal3ST-1 gene and that these exons are alternatively utilized in a cancer-associated manner (37Tsuda M. Egashira M. Niikawa N. Wada Y. Honke K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether or not there exist alternative forms of mRNA for Gal3ST-4 remains unclear, but this is an important issue for elucidating transcriptional regulation of the Gal3ST-4 gene. Gal3ST-4 is highly specific for the Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→ structure. Galβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1-O-pNP is also a good substrate, and the K m andV max values for the core 2 oligosaccharide are similar to those for Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-pNP (TableIII), indicating that the substitution of β-GlcNAc at the C-6 of GalNAc does not affect the substrate recognition of Gal3ST-4. Kuhnset al. (38Kuhns W. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Paulsen H. Baker M.A. Geyer R. Brockhausen I. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that Galβ1→3GalNAc:β1→6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in acute myeloid leukemia cells and rat colon can act on Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn, but not on SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn and suggested that the substitution of β-GlcNAc at the C-6 of Galβ1→3GalNAc should precede sulfation at the C-3′. Our result that Gal3ST-4 can utilize core 2 oligosaccharide as a good substrate is consistent with their results with regard to biosynthesis of sulfated core 2 glycans. The enzyme activity of Gal3ST-4 is inhibited by higher concentrations of acceptor substrates (Fig. 5). Similar inhibitory effects have been reported for β1→4-galactosyltransferase I, II, and III (39Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These transferase activities are inhibited at concentrations in excess of 2–5 mm, except for β1→4-galactosyltransferase II, the activity of which is inhibited even at ∼0.6 mm GlcNAcβ1-O-Bn (39Almeida R. Amado M. David L. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Rygaard E. Hassan H. Bennett E. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31979-31991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of the two substrates for Gal3ST-4 (Fig.5) appear at similar concentrations as those for the transferases described above, although the molecular mechanism and biological significance remain unclear. The result in Fig. 6 showed a relatively extensive expression of the mRNA for Gal3ST-4. It is important whether or not the SO3−→3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→ structure is present in the tissues examined in Fig. 6. Although Chance and Mawhinney (10Chance D.L. Mawhinney T.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 295: 157-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed the occurrence of SO3−→3Galβ1→3(R→ GlcNAcβ1→ 6)GalNAcα1→ structure in tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins from a patient with cystic fibrosis, information about the existence of the sulfated glycan has so far been scarce. On the other hand, Gal:→3-sulfotransferase activities for the Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→ structure have been reported in rat colonic mucosa (38Kuhns W. Jain R.K. Matta K.L. Paulsen H. Baker M.A. Geyer R. Brockhausen I. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), human breast, colon, and several tumor tissues (41Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To assess whether or not the SO3−→ 3Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→ structure is widely distributed, a lectin or antibody that specifically recognizes the sulfated glycan needs to be explored. Chandrasekaran et al. (41Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported the occurrence of two distinct Gal:3-O-sulfotransferases (groups A and B) in human various tumors and normal tissues with a tissue-dependent distribution. Group A sulfotransferase recognizes Galβ1→ 3GalNAcα-O-allyl and 3-O-MeGalβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→ 6(Galβ1→ 3)GalNAcα-O-Bn as good acceptors, but not Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ-O-allyl and Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ-O-allyl, whereas group B sulfotransferase has rather broad substrate specificity (41Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of group A sulfotransferase is similar to that of Gal3ST-4. They also showed that group A Gal:→3-sulfotransferase is dominant in breast tumor, some ovarian tumor, and some metastatic ovary, and that the specific activities in breast tumor are higher than those in breast normal tissues (41Chandrasekaran E.V. Jain R.K. Vig R. Matta K.L. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 753-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, Brockhausen et al. (42Brockhausen I. Yang J.-M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. Taylor- Papadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) showed that a sulfotransferase activity for Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-Bn in a human mammary epithelial cell line, MTSV1-7, is higher than those in three human breast cancer cell lines. We are in the process of investigating changes in expression level of mRNA for Gal3ST-4 in these cancerous tissues."

Following cell-free activation, enzymatic activity is highly labile (Tamura, M., Takeshita, M., Curnutte, J. T., Uhlinger, D. J., and Lambeth, J. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7529–7538). To try to stabilize the activity and investigate the nature of the complex, fusion proteins between p47N-(1–286) and p67N-(1–210) were constructed. In a cell-free system, a fusion protein, p67N-p47N, had an 8-fold higher efficiency and produced a higher activity than the individual proteins, and also resulted in an 8-fold improved efficiency for Rac and a lowered K m for NADPH. O⨪2 generating activity was remarkably stabilized by using p67N-p47N. The cytosolic proteins fused in the opposite orientation, p47N-p67N, showed similar activity and stability as individual proteins, but with a 4-fold improved efficiency compared with the individual cytosolic factors. In the system efficiency for Rac and affinity for NADPH were also higher than those with the nonfused components. Interestingly, the p67N-p47N showed nearly full activation in the absence of an anionic amphifile in a cell-free system containing cytochrome b 558 relipidated with phosphatidylinositol- or phosphatidylserine-enriched phospholipid mixtures. From the results we consider multiple roles of anionic amphifiles in a cell-free activation, which could be substituted by our system. The fact that a fusion produces a more stable complex indicates that interactions among components determine the longevity of the complex.

The enzyme is dormant in resting cells and becomes active upon cell stimulation. The activation is thought to occur via assembly of cytosolic components, p47phox(p47),1 p67phox(p67), and Rac with the membrane-associated flavocytochromeb 558 (cyt. b 558), which consists of p22phox (p22) and gp91phox (gp91) although the structure of the complex has remained unclear (3Thrasher A.J.

Other two factors p40phox and rap1A are also assumed to be involved in the enzyme regulation although they are not essential for the activation. The activated NADPH oxidase is highly labile, complicating investigations of the subunit structure and preventing isolation of the active enzyme complex (7Tamura M. Tamura T. Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a previous study (8Tamura M. Takeshita M. Curnutte J.T. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7529-7538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a cell-free system consisting of cytosol and plasma membrane (PM) we showed that the stability is dramatically improved by chemical cross-linking, and suggested that the deactivation is caused by dissociation of proteins from the complex. Cross-linking was useful in stabilizing the oxidase, but it was difficult to isolate the active complex because the cross-linked complex resisted solubilization (8Tamura M. Takeshita M. Curnutte J.T. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7529-7538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also attempted cross-linking in a system comprised of recombinant cytosolic factors and purified cyt. b 558, but the effect of cross-linking was not as dramatic as in the crude system. 2M. Tamura, unpublished data. Fusion proteins between cytochrome P450s and their reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase have been genetically engineered (9Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M.

Subsequent studies revealed that fusion facilitates electron transfer from NADPH to several cytochrome P450s via flavins (FMN and FAD) (11Shet M.S. Fisher C.W. Holmans P.L. Estabrook R.W. Proc. Natl.

In addition, the use of fusion proteins can provide basic information on the structure of the complex, e.g. topology and interactions between components. Interactive domain structures such as Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and proline-rich region (PRR) were identified in p47 and p67 (13Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunoi H. Sechler M.G. Nauseef W.M.

In addition, PX domain and tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) were identified in p47 and p67, respectively (15Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).

However, neither the actual interactions nor the topology of the components in the active complex are unknown (5Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have herein genetically engineered two fusion proteins between truncated forms of p47 and p67 and have examined their properties. The truncated forms have previously been shown to be capable of reconstituting enzymatic activity (16Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

We find that both expressed fusion constructs can efficiently activate the oxidase in a cell-free reconstitution system. In addition, one of them produced an oxidase complex with higher activity and remarkably higher stability than the individual components. In this system, the activity requirement for anionic amphifiles was eliminated. Based on these results, we propose a model for the topology of these cytosolic factors in the active complex. pGEX-6P, Escherichia coli BL21, glutathione-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, and PreScission Protease were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The oligonucleotide primers for mutations were synthesized by the same manufacturer. BamHI andEcoRI were obtained from Toyobo Co. (Tokyo, Japan).l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (PC) (soybean),l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (bovine brain),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI) (bovine liver), phosphatidylserine (PS) (bovine brain), cholesterol, ω-aminooctyl-agarose, heparin-agarose, cytochrome c (horse heart), thrombin (bovine plasma), and GTPγS were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate andn-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). GTP, FAD, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), PIPES, and sphingomyelin (SM) (bovine brain) were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). All the phospholipids used were of the highest grade of the manufacturers (98–99% purity). Human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers with informed consent. The separation of neutrophils and the fractionation of PM were performed as previously described (24Ogata K. Nishimoto Y. Uhlinger D.J. Igarashi K. Takeshita M. Tamura M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were obtained from porcine blood basically according to the method of Fujii and Kakinuma (25Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with several modifications. The cells suspended in buffer A (60 mm KCl, 18 mm NaCl, 2.3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 3 μm TLCK, 1 mm ATP, and 6% (w/v) sucrose, 6 mm PIPES, pH 7.4) were subjected to nitrogen cavitation at 500 p.s.i. for 20 min at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 1 h in a sucrose gradient (50 and 30% (w/v) in buffer A). The turbid yellow band between two phases was taken up, diluted twice with buffer B (140 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmEGTA, 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 250,000 ×g for 1.5 h in a compact ultracentrifuge (Hitachi CS100GX), and resuspended in buffer B. The fraction was referred to as “plasma membrane (PM).” The purification of cyt.b 558 from PM was essentially followed by Aboet al. (26Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NaCl solution (5 m) was added to the fraction and allowed the final concentration to 1 m. After centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1 h, the pellet was suspended in 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 16% (v/v) glycerol. The suspension was solubilized by 50 mm n-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside and the mixture was immediately centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was subjected to a three-bed column (DEAE-Sepharose, ω-aminooctyl-agarose, and CM-Sepharose) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μm TLCK, 17 mm n-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside, 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5) containing 16% (v/v) glycerol. The flow-through fractions were applied to a heparin-agarose column equilibrated with buffer C containing 8% glycerol and 1 mmEGTA, and the column was eluted with NaCl gradient (0.05–1.5m) in the same buffer. After concentration with an Ultrafree Biomax 30k (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the fraction containing cyt. b 558 was immediately mixed with PL suspension (PC (31Stein J.M. Luzio J.P. Biochem.

We happened to find that this PL composition effective for the oxidase activation and designated it as “optimal composition.” In some experiments, PL composition was varied, but total lipid content in the suspension was always maintained at 1 mg/ml. The specific content of heme in purified cyt. b 558 preparation was 2.1–2.5 nmol of heme/mg of protein. Full-length p67 was overexpressed in Sf9 cells and purified with Q-Sepharose as described (27Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs for p47 (in pVL1393), p67N (residues 1–210; in pGEX-2T), and Rac (Rac1[C189S] in pGEX-2T) were generous gifts from Drs. Chang-Hoon Han and Dave Lambeth (Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine). After amplification with polymerase chain reaction using specific 5′ and 3′ primers, both attached with EcoRI restriction linker, p47 cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-6P (EcoRI fragment) and transfected intoE. coli BL21 strain by the TSS method (28Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Recombinant p47, p67N, and Rac were expressed in E. coli as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, released from glutathioneS-transferase domain by thrombin (for p67N and Rac) or PreScission Protease (for p47), and dialyzed against 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). By using this system, p47 (full-length) was obtained in a relatively good yield (2–3 mg/1 liter of medium) without any proteolytic fragmentation, 3K. Ebisu and M. Tamura, unpublished results. which has often been observed and precluded the production of full-length p47 in E. coli system. All the proteins were purified to >95% homogeneity. DNA fragment encoding p47N-(1–286) was amplified from pVL1393-p47 with polymerase chain reaction using specific 5′ and 3′ primers, both attached with EcoRI restriction linker. For p67N-p47N fusion, the p67N cDNA in pGEX-2T was mutated to remove the stop codon by converting TGA (stop codon) to TCA (Ser) using primers 5′-GGCATCTGTGGTGGATTCAGAATTCATCGTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCACGATGAATTCTGAATCCACCACAGATGCC-3′ by a site-directed mutagenesis Quick Change kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Then, p47N cDNA was ligated to pGEX-2T-p67N (EcoRI fragment). All the truncated and mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing by primer extension. For p47N-p67N fusion, p47N cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-6P (EcoRI fragment) and engineered to change theEcoRI site into the BamHI site and to eliminate the stop codon by converting TGA to TCA (Ser codon). p67N cDNA was engineered to change the BamHI site into EcoRI site and ligated to pGEX-6P-p47N (EcoRI fragment). The proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 strain as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and cleaved from glutathioneS-transferase with thrombin (for p67N-p47N) or PreScission Protease (for p47N-p67N). The resulting fusion proteins have Ser-Glu-Phe as a linker peptide between two Phox proteins. The standard mixture contained p67N and p47N (2 μm each) or a fusion between p67N and p47N (2 μm), PM (5 μg), and Rac (7 μm), which had been treated with 100 μm GTP, in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer D (4 mm MgCl2, 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) containing 10 μm GTP. The mixture was supplemented with 200 μm SDS and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Four 10-μl aliquots of each reaction mixture were transferred into microplate wells, which contained 200 μm NADPH and 80 μm cytochrome cin 240 μl of buffer D. Superoxide generation was measured by monitoring the absorbance increase at 550 nm with a microplate-reader Spectraclassic (Tecan, Grödig, Austria). NADPH oxidase activity was expressed as micromole of O⨪2 formed/min per mg of PM protein. The assays were sometimes repeated in the presence of superoxide dismutase (80 μg/ml) to verify actual O⨪2generation (7Tamura M. Tamura T. Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the reconstitution with purified cyt. b 558, the reaction mixture contained p67N and p47N (125 nm each) or a fused protein between p67N and p47N (125 nm) with GTP-treated Rac (430 nm) and cyt.b 5582 (6.3 nm) (10 μl of the suspension) in buffer D (800 μl total) containing 1 mm FAD. By this process then-heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside concentration was diluted to 0.2 mm (CMC: 30 mm). The mixture was supplemented with 100 μm SDS and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C. The mixture was transferred to the cuvette containing 80 μm cytochrome c and the reaction was started with addition of 200 μm NADPH. Absorbance change at 550 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer UV160A (Shimadzu, Kyoto). Superoxide generation was expressed as micromole of O⨪2formed/min per nmol of cyt. b 558. We designed fusion proteins using C-terminal-truncated forms of both p47 and p67. These truncations were previously shown to support a full activation in a reconstitution system (16Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Hata K. Ito T. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A illustrates the domain structures of p47 and p67 truncations and their fusion proteins. C-terminal-truncated p47 (p47N) (residues 1–286) contains the PX domain and two SH3 domains, whereas the C-terminal-truncated p67 (p67N) (residues 1–210) contains TPR and the activation domain. We produced two kinds of the fusion proteins in different order, designated p47N-p67N and p67N-p47N. In the former, PX domain is located at the N-terminal end and the activation domain is at the C terminus. In the latter, the TPR domain is located at the N terminus and the SH3 regions are located at the C terminus. Fig. 1 B shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins expressed inE. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Each protein showed a single major band at the expected size. Fig.2 A shows the superoxide generating activity of the oxidase reconstituted with truncated and fusion proteins with PM. The activity with p47N was 50% higher than that with full-length p47. p47N-p67N showed 40% higher activity than nonfused p67N and p47N, whereas p67N-p47N showed almost twice the activity of nonfused components. Fig. 2 B shows the oxidase activity with purified cyt. b 558. The activity with nonfused p47N and p67N was similar to that with full-length p47 and p67N, or full-length of both p47 and p67 (data not shown). The activity with a fusion p67N-p47N was higher than that with the nonfused components. On the other hand, the activity with p47N-p67N was similar to that with nonfused p47N and p67N. This result indicates that fusion (especially p67N-p47N) greatly improves the ability of the components to induce the oxidase activity. The efficiencies (i.e. EC50 values) of the fusion proteins in stimulating NADPH oxidase activity were compared with the nonfused components (Fig. 3). The EC50 values estimated for nonfused components, p47N-p67N, and p67N-p47N were 0.81, 0.22, and 0.10 μm, respectively, indicating that fusion (particularly the p67N-p47N construct) greatly improves the affinity of the components within the active complex. TheV max with p67N-p47N was 6.2 μmol/min/nmol of cyt. b 558, which was twice the activity seen using the nonfused components, while the V maxwith p47N-p67N was similar to that with nonfused components. This result indicates that p67N-p47N is a very efficient activator of the oxidase. Fig. 4 Ashows the concentration dependence for Rac in the cell-free system using fused or nonfused p47N and p67N. The EC50 value for Rac was 0.5 μm with individual cytosolic proteins, and this was dramatically lowered by using p67N-p47N (0.06 μm, Table I). Meanwhile, the EC50 value with p47N-p67N decreased to one-half of that of the nonfused components. The V max value was in the following rank order: p67N-p47N > p47N-p67N > nonfused components. The result shows that fusion improves the affinity of Rac for other components in the complex. Whereas Fig. 4 Bshows the concentration dependence for cyt.b 558. The concentration dependence for cyt.b 558 with nonfused components was not changed by fusions, p67N-p47N or p47N-p67N.Table IEffect of fusion on the affinity for Rac and Km for NADPH of the reconstituted oxidasep47N and p67NRacNADPHEC50V maxK mV maxμmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgNonfused0.502.92503.94p47N-p67N0.243.89234.38p67N-p47N0.065.46175.94The reconstitution system contained fused (p47N-p67N and p67N-p47N) or nonfused p47N and p67N with GTP-loaded rac and the plasma membrane.

Open table in a new tab The reconstitution system contained fused (p47N-p67N and p67N-p47N) or nonfused p47N and p67N with GTP-loaded rac and the plasma membrane. EC50, K m , and V max values were determined from the data in Figs. 4 A and 5 by nonlinear least squares fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The K m value for NADPH was determined in the assay of the oxidase reconstituted with the fused or nonfused components (Fig.5). The K m with the nonfused components was 50 μm, which was decreased to 17 and 23 μm by p67N-p47N and p47N-p67N, respectively (TableI). The V max value was increased by 51% with p67N-p47N and slightly with p47N-p67N. This result shows that fusion between p47N and p67N influences the NADPH-binding site, which is thought to be in cyt. b 558. Fig.6 A shows the stability of the oxidase activity reconstituted with PM at 25 °C. After 25 min incubation, the oxidase with p67N-p47N showed the same activity as the initial one while that with nonfused components had only 20% activity of the initial one. The half-life (t 12 ) was 16 min with nonfused p47N and p67N and was prolonged to 240 min by the fusion of p67N-p47N. While the half-life with p47N-p67N was 28 min (TableII). When purified cyt.b 558 was used in the reconstitution, the half-life with nonfused p47N and p67N was 38 min, which was expanded to 290 min (Fig. 6 B and Table II). The half-life with p67N-p47N was 22 min, similar to that with nonfused components. This result indicates that fused p47N and p67N (especially p67N-p47N) produces much more stable complex than the nonfused components. When full-length p47 and p67 (nonfused) were used, the stability was the same as that with truncated p47 and p67. Thus C-terminal regions of these components do not appear to be involved in the longevity of the complex.Table IIHalf-lives of NADPH oxidase activity reconstituted with fused or nonfused p47N and p67NSource of cyt. b 558p47N and p67Nt 12 (min)PMNonfused16 (14)p47N-p67N28 (21)p67N-p47N240 (315)Purified cytochromeb 558Nonfused38 (40)ap47N-p67N22p67N-p47N290 (360)bThe half-lives of the oxidase with nonfused components or p67N-p47N were determined by a first-order plot of the data in Fig. 6,A and B.

In some experiments full-length p47 and p67 were used as components (a) or the activation was performed in the absence of SDS (b) (lower row). Rac, a small GTPase, is thought to regulate the lifetime of the oxidase by converting its state from active to inactive upon hydrolysis of loaded GTP (3Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the stability of Rac loaded with GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, however, the stability of the oxidase was not changed (Table II, in parentheses). Thus GTP hydrolysis is not involved in the deactivation of the oxidase at least for initial 30 min in the reconstitution system. TableIII shows the activity reconstituted in the presence and absence of SDS. As reported by Hata et al.(23Hata K. Ito T. Takeshige K. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4232-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the truncated p47 and p67 produced some O⨪2 generating activity in the absence of SDS. When PM was used as a source of cyt.b 558, the activity was 0.7 μmol/min/mg, which is 22% of that with SDS. When p47N-p67N or p67N-p47N was used the activity increased, but the ratio to the activity with SDS was not much changed. On the other hand, when purified cyt.b 558 was used, a quite different result was obtained. The activity in the absence of SDS was greatly increased using p67N-p47N to 5.6 μmol/min/nmol cyt.b 558, which corresponds to 75% of the activity in the presence of SDS. This activity was very stable (t 12 = 360 min), even more stable than the activity in the presence of SDS (Table II). These results clearly show that fusion eliminates a requirement of anionic amphifiles for activation. In other words, cyt. b 558 becomes active just by mixing with p67N-p47N and GTP-Rac.Table IIISDS-independent activation of NADPH oxidase by p67N-p47N with purified cyt. b558Source of cyt. b 558p47 and p67O⨪2 generating activity (-fold)[A]/[B] × 100−SDS [A]+SDS [B]nmol/min/mg%PMNonfused690 ± 33 (1.0)3090 ± 70 (1.0)22p47N-p67N1060 ± 27 (1.5)4350 ± 131 (1.4)24p67N-p47N1810 ± 27 (2.6)5730 ± 89 (1.9)32nmol/min/nmol b558Purifiedb 558Nonfused818 ± 68 (1.0)5260 ± 481 (1.0)16p47N-p67N614 ± 149 (0.75)4800 ± 246 (0.91)13p67N-p47N5580 ± 462 (6.8)7580 ± 749 (1.4)74The reconstitution of the oxidase was carried out with p47N-p67N, p67N-p47N, or nonfused p47N and p67N (nonfu"

The IFN-β and all-trans-retinoic acid combination, but not these single agents individually, induces death in several tumor cell lines. To elucidate the molecular basis for these actions, we have employed an antisense knockout approach to identify the gene products that mediate cell death and isolated several genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality (GRIMs). One of the GRIM cDNAs, GRIM-12, was identical to human thioredoxin reductase (TR). To define the functional relevance of TR to cell death and to define its mechanism of death-modulating functions, we generated mutants of TR and studied their influence on the IFN/RA-induced death regulatory functions of caspases. Wild-type TR activates cell death that was inhibited in the presence of caspase inhibitors or catalytically inactive caspases. A mutant TR, lacking the active site cysteines, inhibits the cell death induced by caspase 8. IFN/all-trans-retinoic acid-induced cytochromec release from the mitochondrion was promoted in the presence of wild type and was inhibited in the presence of mutant TR. We find that TR modulates the activity of caspase 8 to promote death. This effect is in part caused by the stimulation of death receptor gene expression.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar), IFNs induce the expression of a number of cellular genes that mediates their diverse actions. The importance of IFNs in tumor cell growth suppression is underscored by an increased incidence of carcinogen-induced tumors in the IFN-γ receptor−/− and STAT1−/− mice and a failure to reject the STAT1 null tumors by the immune system. Consistent with their direct roles in the control of apoptosis, defects in the expression of certain members of the caspase family (2Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R.

Because STAT1 and IFN gene regulatory factors are IFN-regulated transcription factors, the IFN-induced growth-suppressive effects ultimately depends on different gene products regulated by them.

In addition to these, IFNs directly activate growth-suppressive proteins such as pRb (11Resnitzky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and down-regulate c-Myc, E2F, and cyclin D3 in certain lymphoid tumor cell lines (12Raveh T. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E.F. Sonenberg N. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25479-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffman I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite their strong therapeutic activity as single agents in a number of leukemias, IFNs are less effective in the therapy of solid tumors (14Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). To overcome such resistance, a number of combination therapies have been developed. Among these, the combination of IFNs with retinoids is highly effective against several tumors (15Moore D.M. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lippman S.M. Kavanagh J.J. Hong W.K. Borden E.C. Paredes-Espinoza M. Krakoff I.H. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for enhanced growth suppression of IFN/all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) combination is unclear. Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that bind to specific nuclear receptors and induce the expression of genes involved in differentiation, growth control, and metabolism (16Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Deprivation of vitamin A in experimental animals results in an increased incidence of various carcinomas and leukemias (17Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and an abnormal rise in myelopoiesis caused by a loss of spontaneous apoptosis (18Kuwata T. Wang I.M. Tamura T. Ponnamperuma R.M. Levine R. Holmes K.L. Morse H.C. De Luca L.M. Ozato K. Blood. 2000; 95: 3349-3356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RA, a prototypic natural metabolite of vitamin A, can either suppress or reverse these effects in vivo. RA inhibits the growth of certain neuroblastomas, promyelocytic leukemias, and teratocarcinomasin vitro (17Love J.M. Gudas L.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RA binds to specific nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which in association with a structurally similar but genetically distinct dimerizing partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and other co-activators induce gene transcription (19Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), leading to growth suppression. However, the nature of these retinoid-regulated inhibitors of cell growth is unknown. The effects of RA are thought to be mediated by a perplexing number of RAR and RXR isoforms present in mammalian cells. Several synthetic and natural retinoids that can differentially activate these receptors have been identified. Some of these suppress the cell growth of certain primary skin dysplasias and tumor cell lines (20Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The growth-suppressive effects of some synthetic retinoids are mediated in RAR-RXR-dependent and -independent manners (20Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y. Lee M.O. Wang H.G. Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 22Nagy L. Thomazy V.A. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For example, RA converts transcription factor E2F into a suppressor (23Lee H.Y. Dohi D.F. Kim Y.H. Walsh G.L. Consoli U. Andreeff M. Dawson M.I. Hong W.K. Kurie J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some synthetic retinoids can induce cell death in p53-dependent or caspase-dependent manners (24Sun S.Y. Yue P. Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Shroot B. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2357-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Sun S.Y. Yue P. Mao L. Dawson M.I. Shroot B. Lamph W.W. Heyman R.A. Chandraratna R.A. Shudo K. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1563-1573PubMed Google Scholar). The retinoid-dependent translocation of orphan nuclear receptor TR3 from nucleus to the mitochondrion and the consequent release of cytochrome c and activation of apoptosis have been shown recently (26Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Lastly, the antiapoptotic protein BAG-1 inhibits RAR-RXR-dependent transcription by directly interacting with these nuclear receptors, which has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance to retinoid-induced growth suppression (27Liu R. Takayama S. Zheng Y. Froesch B. Chen G.Q. Zhang X. Reed J.C. Zhang X.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16985-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Clinical and experimental models have shown that the IFN/RA combination is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than either agent alone (15Moore D.M. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lippman S.M. Kavanagh J.J. Hong W.K. Borden E.C. Paredes-Espinoza M. Krakoff I.H. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar,28Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 931-937PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown cross-talk between IFN- and RA-regulated growth-suppressive pathways, although these ligands exert their effects via disparate signaling mechanisms. Promyelocytic leukemia protein-RARα, a mutant retinoic acid receptor found in certain acute promyelocytic leukemias, is generated by gene translocation (29Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Cordon-Cardo C. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1998; 279: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this mutant receptor is induced by IFNs and has been reported to participate in the anticellular actions of IFN-α (30Nason-Burchenal K. Gandini D. Botto M. Allopenna J. Seale J.R. Cross N.C. Goldman J.M. Dmitrovsky E. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 3926-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chelbi-Alix M.K. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Koken M.H. de The H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFN can suppress the cell growth in RA-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemias (32Gaboli M. Gandini D. Delva L. Wang Z.G. Pandolfi P.P. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1998; 30: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The promyelocytic leukemia protein forms a nuclear body consisting of several IFN-inducible gene products (32Gaboli M. Gandini D. Delva L. Wang Z.G. Pandolfi P.P. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1998; 30: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Gongora C. David G. Pintard L. Tissot C. Hua T.D. Dejean A. Mechti N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Promyelocytic leukemia protein is induced by IFNs, and its promoter contains STAT1 binding sites (34Pelicano L. Li F. Schindler C. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We and others have reported earlier that in certain IFN-resistant cells, RA induces STAT1 levels, which leads to an enhancement of IFN responses (35Kolla V. Weihua X. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9742-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Gianni M. Terao M. Fortino I. LiCalzi M. Viggiano V. Barbui T. Rambaldi A. Garattini E. Blood. 1997; 89: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Matikainen S. Ronni T. Lehtonen A. Sareneva T. Melen K. Nordling S. Levy D.E. Julkunen I. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 687-698PubMed Google Scholar). RA has also been shown to induce some IFN-stimulated genes directly (34Pelicano L. Li F. Schindler C. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that the IFN/RA combination, but not the single agents, causes cell death in vitro and suppresses tumor growth in vivo (28Lindner D.J. Borden E.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 931-937PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, no detectable activation of IFN-stimulated protein kinase R or RNase L and no change in p53 and pRb occurred under these conditions (38Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data suggested the existence of novel IFN/RA-regulated mechanisms of cell death. To identify the genes responsible for cell death and define their mechanism of action, we employed an antisense technical knockout approach (39Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this approach, specific cell death-associated genes are identified by their ability to confer a growth advantage in the presence of death inducers when expressed in an antisense orientation. We have identified several genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality that might participate in IFN/RA activated cell death. One of the genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality was identical to human thioredoxin reductase (TR), an intracellular redox regulatory enzyme (38Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We showed that suppression of TR by its antisense mRNA inhibited IFN/RA-stimulated cell death. However, those studies have not identified the molecular targets for TR-induced cell death. Here, we show that the activation of certain members of the caspase family is regulated by IFN/RA combination through thioredoxin reductase. Using selected TR mutants we show that the wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, mutant TR enzyme promotes cell death by stimulating caspase 8 activation. Such activation seems involved an up-regulation of death receptor gene expression. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes (New England Biolabs); G418 sulfate, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and LipofectAMINE plus (Life Technologies, Inc.); nitrocellulose membranes, ECL reagents, and horseradish peroxidase coupled to anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); human IFN-βser(Berlex, Inc.), mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin and FLAG epitope (Sigma), Myc epitope (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and thioredoxin (Serotec, Inc.); Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibodies against caspase 8; caspase 9; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); and cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in these studies. Fresh stocks of all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in ethanol and added to cultures under subdued light. MCF-7 cells were cultured in phenol red-free Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 10−11m estradiol during treatment with IFN-β and RA. The cells were grown in phenol red-free medium for 24 h before treatments were initiated. The mammalian expression vector pCXN2-Myc contains a Myc epitope tag in its multiple cloning site. The chicken actin promoter and the rabbit β-globin polyadenylation sequences permit the expression of cloned insert in high levels. The presence of a neomycin-resistant marker allows the selection of transfected cells. The c-FLIP and v-FLIP expression vectors were provided by Jurge Tschopp (University of Laussane, Switzerland). Mammalian expression vectors carrying caspase 8, caspase 9, and the corresponding mutants were provided by Emad Alnemri (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) (40Alnemri E.S. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Expression vectors carrying the wild-type and cysteine mutant of thioredoxin (65Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J.

A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) were a gift from Junji Yodoi (Institute for Virus Research, Shogin, Japan). The open reading frame of human TR1 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the following primers. The 5′ primer (forward) (5′-CGGAATTC GCCACC ATGAACGGCCCTGAAGAT-3′) included an EcoRI restriction site (bold face), a Kozak consensus sequence (italics) in the context of first AUG codon, and the coding region (underlined). The 3′ primer (reverse) (5′-GGCCATGG GCAGCCAGCCAGCCTGGAGGAT-3′) consisted of a coding sequence and a KpnI site. This primer lacked the stop codon. After amplification (14 cycles) with AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the products were purified, digested withEcoRI and KpnI, and subcloned into the modified mammalian expression vector pCXN2-Myc. The Myc-epitope tag was added to the carboxyl terminus of the expressed protein. Mutants with a replacement of specific amino acids were generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method. In the case of Cys-mut, PCR-directed mutagenesis has resulted in the replacement of the Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys sequence with Gly-Ala. As a result, four amino acids were lost in this mutant. The primers used for generating the Cys-mut were primer A (5′CCGGCGCCATACCTAAAAAACTGATGC-3′) and primer B (CCGGCGCCTGTTTCCTCCGAGACCCC-3′). TheNarI restriction sites in these oligonucleotides are shown in bold face. In the first round of amplification, two PCR products were generated. In one reaction the 5′ (forward) primer and primer B were used, and in the other reaction primer A and 3′ (reverse) primer were used to generate PCR products, using the wild-type TR as a template. These PCR products were purified and digested withEcoRI + NarI and NarI +KpnI, respectively. The two digested products were ligated to EcoRI and KpnI-digested pCXN2-Myc in a three-way ligation mix. Protein domain analysis suggested the presence of potential tyrosine kinase-induced phosphorylation sites at amino acid positions 125, 129, and 150. To generate a mutant domain lacking the critical tyrosines, four mutant primers and four different PCRs were performed. Base changes in these oligonucleotides are indicated in bold face with an underline. In the first step, two separate PCR amplifications (12 cycles) were performed. In one reaction, the 5′ primer (forward) (5′-CGGAATTC GCCACC ATGAACGGCCCTGAAGAT-3′) and TK primer 2 (5′-CATAAGCATTCTCAA AGACGAC-3′) were used, and in the other reaction, the 3′reverse primer (5′-GGCCATGG GCAGCCAGCCAGCCTGGAGGAT-3′) and TK primer 1 (5′-GTCGTCTT TGAGAATGCTTATG-3′) were used for amplification with wild-type TR as the template. Products of the first PCR were purified, mixed, denatured and renatured. They were then used as a template for the second PCR reaction with the 5′ forward and 3′reverse primers. The resultant product was purified, digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and subcloned into pGEM7Zf. This step-1 mutant served as template for the second mutation with the following primers. Again two PCRs were performed with complementary oligonucleotides bearing the same mutation. In one reaction, the 5′ primer (forward) (5′CGGAATTC GCCACC ATGAACGGCCCTGAAGAT-3′) and TK primer 3 (5′CTCTGCTGAA AAAATTTTTTCTTTGCC-3′) were used, and in the other reaction 5′-GGCCATGG GCAGCCAGCCAGCCTGGAGGAT-3′ and TK primer 4 (5′-GGCAAGAAAAAATTTTT TCAGCAGAG-3′) were used to generate the PCR products. These products were purified, mixed, denatured, and amplified with the 5′ forward primer and the 3′ reverse primer. This final product lacking all the potential tyrosine kinase target residues was subcloned as an EcoRI-KpnI fragment into the pCXN2-Myc vector. This mutant has been named TK-pm. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing, and expression of the predicted protein was determined by transient transfection assays in Cos-7 cells followed by Western blotting of the extracts with Myc-epitope tag-specific antibodies prior to their use in the experiments. Cells (2000/well) were plated in 96-well plates. Various inhibitory agents were added, and growth was monitored using a colorimetric assay that quantifies cell numbers (41Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). Each group of treatments had eight replicates. The cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) at 4 °C for 1 h at the end of the experiment and stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (Sigma). The bound dye was eluted with 100 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 10.5, and the absorbance was monitored at 570 nm. One plate was fixed with trichloroacetic acid 10 h after plating the cells. Absorbance obtained with this plate was considered as 0% growth. Absorbance obtained with wells containing untreated cells was considered as 100% growth. An increase and decrease of A 570 values in the experimental wells relative to the initial value indicate cell growth and death, respectively. When plotted as a percentage of untreated control growth and death, values appear on the positive and negative scales of the y axis, respectively. Cell death was also determined using an alternate method, the annexin V binding assays. After treatment with the indicated agents, cells were stained using a commercially available kit (Trevigen, Inc.) per manufacturer recommendations. The cells were incubated with FITC-tagged annexin V and propidium iodide. Cells with double staining were considered late apoptotic. FITC-stained cells were considered as apoptotic and quantified using a Becton-Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Annexin V-positive cells (dead) were scored and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells. Cell death was also monitored in a transient transfection assay. Because the transfection efficiency is only ∼20%, it is important to score for the transfected cells. Therefore, a β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the enhancers of either the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) was cotransfected along with the effector plasmids. This plasmid permits the detection of transfected cells after staining with X-gal. Briefly, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (∼1 μg) using the LipofectAMINE plus reagent. Wherever multiple plasmids were transfected the total amount of DNA transfected was kept to a maximum of 2–4 μg. At the end of the experiment they were stained with a commercially availablein situ β-galactosidase detection kit containing X-gal (Stratagene), and the number of cells stained blue was determined microscopically. Cells with flat attached epithelial morphology were considered alive, and those with a rounded and detached appearance were considered dead. Multiple fields were scanned, and a total of 300–400 cells were counted to obtain statistically significant numbers. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared after homogenization of cells in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercially available protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) as described previously (42Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet suspended in the above buffer was considered to be the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the supernatant was collected and represented the cytosolic fraction. An aliquot from the initial lysate was saved for determining the total cytochrome ccontent. Thioredoxin reductase activity was determined as described (43Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared after IFN/RA treatment by freeze-thaw lysis. Twenty micrograms of extract was incubated with insulin, NADPH, and thioredoxin in 0.2 mHEPES, pH 7.6, for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated after the addition of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride and 0.4 mg/ml dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) prepared in 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0. Absorbance at 412 nm was measured. In each case, a corresponding control without Trx was used to determine the basal level of TR activity (caused by endogenous Trx and NADPH). Absorbance values obtained from these controls were subtracted from those obtained with the reactions that contained Trx and NADPH. A negative control reaction without cell extracts but with all the reaction components was also used. Triplicate samples were measured for enzymatic activity. Pure TR was used as a positive control. The enzymatic activity of individual caspases was determined using a commercially available kit (BIOSOURCE). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared after various treatments, and a comparable quantity of lysate (∼25 μg) from each sample was incubated with the synthetic substrates IETD-p-nitroanilide (pNA) (for caspase 8) and LEHD-pNA (for caspase 9) at 37 °C for 3 h. The release of chromophore, pNA, from these substrates was quantified by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm in a microplate reader. The assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Equal quantities of cell extracts were separated on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted onto nylon membranes. Specific first antibodies were incubated with the blots after blocking as described in our previous publication (38Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X. Hassel B.A. Jagus R. Gutierrez P.L. Kalvakolanu D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6493-6504Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These blots were washed and incubated with an appropriate second antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase. Protein bands were visualized using a commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the expression of death-associated gene expression, cells were treated with various agents for 3 days, and total RNA was extracted. An equal amount of RNA (100 μg) from each sample was hybridized to 32P-labeled multiple apoptosis-associated gene probes using a commercially available ribonuclease protection assay kit (PharMingen). The protected RNAs were separated on a polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed to detect specific bands. A control hybridization reaction with yeast tRNA did not protect these bands (data not shown). We have shown earlier that down-regulation of cellular TR gene expression by its antisense mRNA inhibits IFN-β/RA-induced cell death (38Hofmann E.R. Boyanapalli M. Lindner D.J. Weihua X.

https://openalex.org/W2088823031,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) efficiently mediates the binding of lipoprotein particles to lipoprotein receptors and to proteoglycans at cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. It has been proposed that LPL increases the retention of atherogenic lipoproteins in the vessel wall and mediates the uptake of lipoproteins in cells, thereby promoting lipid accumulation and plaque formation. We investigated the interaction between LPL and low density lipoproteins (LDLs) with special reference to the protein-protein interaction between LPL and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Chemical modification of lysines and arginines in apoB or mutation of its main proteoglycan binding site did not abolish the interaction of LDL with LPL as shown by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and by experiments with THP-I macrophages. Recombinant LDL with either apoB100 or apoB48 bound with similar affinity. In contrast, partial delipidation of LDL markedly decreased binding to LPL. In cell culture experiments, phosphatidylcholine-containing liposomes competed efficiently with LDL for binding to LPL. Each LDL particle bound several (up to 15) LPL dimers as determined by SPR and by experiments with THP-I macrophages. A recombinant NH2-terminal fragment of apoB (apoB17) bound with low affinity to LPL as shown by SPR, but this interaction was completely abolished by partial delipidation of apoB17. We conclude that the LPL-apoB interaction is not significant in bridging LDL to cell surfaces and matrix components; the main interaction is between LPL and the LDL lipids.

It is expressed in several tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, adipose tissue, and mammary gland, and its role is to deliver fatty acids to adjacent tissues by hydrolyzing triacylglycerol in circulating triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein particles. The functional location of LPL is at the vascular side of endothelial cells where it is anchored through electrostatic interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. LPL activity is regulated according to the nutritional state, in a tissue-specific manner, based on the needs of the tissue for fatty acids. In addition to its lipolytic activity, LPL acts as a potent bridge between lipoproteins and cell-surface proteoglycans and lipoprotein receptors or components of the extracellular matrix (1Goldberg I.J.

The presence of LPL increases by severalfold the binding of lipoproteins to cells in culture, to perfused livers, and to matrix components deposited on culture dishes by fibroblasts. This bridging ability of LPL is independent of its catalytic activity (7Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). LPL is produced by macrophages and smooth muscle cells and has been found in the arterial wall in connection with atherosclerotic lesions (8Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Goldberg I.J.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1141-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been suggested that LPL contributes to the retention of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the vessel wall by bridging LDLs to either macrophages or the extracellular matrix (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Betteridge D.J. Illingworth D.R. Shepherd J. Lipoproteins in Health and Disease.

Specific biological responses to the retained lipoproteins lead to biochemical and cellular events that promote atherogenesis (13Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Williams K.J. Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In vitro, LDL and other lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo)B bind weakly to heparin and other proteoglycans (15Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 205-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that molecules such as LPL, which enhances the interaction of LDL with proteoglycans, could play an important role in atherogenesis in vivo. Goldberg et al. proposed that protein-protein interaction between LPL and apoB, the sole protein moiety of LDL, is more important than the interaction between LPL and LDL lipids (16Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol.

However, LPL interacts efficiently with liposomes and lipid emulsions that do not contain any apolipoprotein (19Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase. Evener Publishers, Chicago1987: 15-58Google Scholar, 20MacPhee C. Chan R. Sawyer W. Stafford W. Howlett G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 8: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the interaction between LPL and LDL is mediated primarily by the LDL protein (apoB) or by LDL lipids. For these studies, we produced modified and recombinant LDL and a recombinant fragment of apoB (apoB17) for experiments with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (21Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G.

LPL was isolated from bovine milk as previously described (24Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). THP-I monocytes were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). An amino-coupling kit containingN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-[(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, 1 m ethanolamine, and CM5 sensor chips was obtained from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin was purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium with GlutaMAX II, TC-100 medium, SF-900 serum-free medium, and Eagle's minimum essential medium without methionine were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Biochrom KG (Berlin, Germany). Garamycin was from Schering (Kenilworth, NJ). Methionine, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, sodium pyruvate, disodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, acetic anhydride, cyclohexanedione, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, butylated hydroxytoluene, benzamidine,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were from Sigma. Heparin was from Leo Pharma AB (Malmö, Sweden). Rabbit immunoglobulin and polyclonal antibodies to human apoB were from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Trasylol (aprotinin) was from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany).N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Carrier-free Na125I was from Nordion (Kanata, Ontario, Canada). l-α-Phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (type XI-E) and l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (Type I) were from Sigma. THP-I monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with GlutaMAX II (RPMI 1640) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 50 µg/ml Garamycin. To induce macrophage differentiation, cells were suspended in 1.6 × 10−7mphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in growth medium (25Auwerx J.H. Deeb S. Brunzell J.D. Peng R. Chait A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2651-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/22-mm well in 12-well Falcon multidishes. THP-I monocyte-derived macrophages were used in experiments 36–48 h after addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with oleic acid as described previously (26Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated with a P1 bacteriophage clone (27Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that spanned the human apoB gene in which mutations had been introduced by RecA-assisted restriction endonuclease cleavage (28Borén J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility operating on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed rodent chow containing 4.5% fat. Blood from mice fasted for 4 h or from humans fasted overnight was collected into tubes containing EDTA (final concentration, 1 mg/ml), and the plasma was mixed with butylated hydroxytoluene (final concentration, 25 µm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 1 mm), and aprotinin (final concentration, 10 units/ml). LDLs (d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Ti 90 rotor) and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4. The mouse apoE- and apoB-containing lipoproteins were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (29Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To selectively modify arginines or lysines in apoB100, recombinant LDLs were incubated with acetic anhydride or cyclohexanedione, respectively, as described by Innerarity et al. (30Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LDLs were iodinated by the iodine monochloride method as modified by Helmkamp et al. (31Helmkamp R.W. Conteras M.A. Izzo M.J. Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1967; 18: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Iodinated LDLs were dialyzed at 4 °C against Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% (w/v) EDTA and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 and filtered through 0.22-µm Millipore filters (MILLEX-GS). Aliquots of LDL were delipidated with 20 volumes of methanol:diethyl ether (1:1, v/v), and the radioactivity in lipid and protein moieties was determined (22Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More than 98% of125I radioactivity in the LDL preparations was in the protein moiety. Iodination did not change the electrophoretic mobility of LDL compared with unlabeled LDL. 125I-LDL was used for the experiments within a few days after preparation. Human LDLs (d = 1.020–1.063 g/ml) were partially delipidated with diisopropyl ether:butanol essentially as described by Innerarity and Mahley (32Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To 10 mg of LDL in 1.5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, 10 ml of 1-butanol:diisopropyl ether (15:85, v/v) was added. After gentle mixing for 10 min at room temperature, the organic phase was removed, and the aqueous phase was washed twice with 3-ml aliquots of diisopropyl ether. The partially delipidated LDLs were dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 4 °C. Liposomes composed of free cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine (FC/PC), PC only, or lyso-PC/PC were prepared by probe sonication. Chloroform solutions of FC and PC and a solution of lyso-PC (10 mg/ml) in chloroform:methanol (1:1) were mixed in 1:1 molar ratios and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. After addition of 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.4, the mixture was sonicated for repetitive cycles of 15 s with a 15-s break for 30 min at 4 °C with an MSE Soniprep 150 equipped with a 10-mm probe. After equilibration at 37 °C for 2 h, the liposomes were separated from undispersed lipid and multilamellar vesicles by low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm, 10 min). The liposomes were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer used for the dispersion and were used immediately. Cholesterol was determined with a CHOD-PAP kit (Axiom, Bürstadt, Germany), and phospholipids were determined with a phospholipids B kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Recombinant baculovirus encoding human apoB17 (a kind gift from Dr. Alan Attie, University of Wisconsin) was produced as described by Gretch et al. (33Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). ApoB17 was purified from the culture medium by adsorption to an immunosorbent column prepared with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human apoB (DAKO) coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ApoB17 was eluted with 50 mm diethylamine, pH 12.0, neutralized with 1 m NaH2PO4, dialyzed extensively for 4 h against 0.01 mDulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and concentrated by centrifugation through Microsep 30K (Kendro Laboratory Products, Newtown, CT). For delipidation, immunoaffinity-purified apoB17 (2 ml) was mixed with 4 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% sodium deoxycholate) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin (final concentration, 100 kallikrein inhibitor units/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). After sonication with six 10-s pulses and one 15-s pulse, 3.0 ml of the solution was overlaid onto a 15–55% sucrose gradient in each of six SW40 ultracentrifuge tubes and spun at 35,000 rpm for 65 h at 10 °C. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were unloaded from the gradient and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecylsulfate gel. Fractions containing apoB17 were pooled and used in binding experiments after dialysis. The delipidated apoB17 still contained some polar lipids, but the amount was reduced by ∼50% as qualitatively analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. After complete delipidation with methanol:diethyl ether (1:1), apoB17 was not soluble in the buffers used for the experiments and could therefore not be studied. For the LDL binding studies, cells were cooled at 4 °C for 30 min, washed twice with ice-cold medium (RPMI 1640) containing 0.2% BSA (RPMI-0.2% BSA), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 5 µg/ml 125I-LDL, 10 µg/ml bovine LPL, and 4% BSA. Control wells did not contain macrophages. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold RPMI-0.2% BSA and incubated with 100 IU of heparin/ml of RPMI-0.2% BSA for 30 min at 4 °C. Heparin-releasable radioactivity was considered to represent LDL bound to the cell surface. The macrophages were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in 0.2 m NaOH for measurement of the125I-LDL remaining associated with cells (heparin-resistant LDL) and cellular protein content (22Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in control wells was subtracted from the radioactivity of the cell-containing wells. For studies of LDL uptake, THP-I macrophages were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the same amount of 125I-LDL and LPL as in the binding studies. The cells were not cooled before the experiment, and all washings were performed with warm solutions. The binding studies were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Biotinylation and analysis of kinetics were performed as described previously (21Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Østergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, avidin was covalently coupled to the dextran matrix of CM5 sensor chips. Biotinylated heparin or biotinylated LPL was bound to the avidin. LDL samples were injected into the sensor chips, and binding of LDL was recorded by monitoring changes in the refractive index close to the dextran layer. These changes are expressed in arbitrary response units (RU). The binding experiments were carried out in 10 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Human LDLs (d = 1.03–1.04 g/ml) were radiolabeled with 125I by using IODO-GEN (Pierce). More than 90% of the radioactivity was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The iodinated LDLs were kept at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks. LPL was radiolabeled by the lactoperoxidase method and then repurified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (35Wallinder L. Peterson J. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of LDL and LPL were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA, Pierce). The specific radioactivity of both preparations was about 500 cpm/ng. The molar concentration of LDL was calculated assuming a protein content of 21% and an average molecular mass of 2.3 × 106 kDa. For the LPL dimer, a molecular mass of 110 kDa was used. Iodinated LDL and LPL were immobilized on the dextran matrix of sensor chips with theN-ethyl-N′-[(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide method (36Johnson B. Löfas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Differences in pre- and postimmobilization response levels and the bound radioactivity were measured, and bound radioactivity on the chip was measured in a γ counter. The mass of bound LPL and LDL was calculated from their respective specific radioactivities. To investigate, in real time, how LPL interacts with LDL we used SPR. The use of this method to study interactions of LPL and heparan/heparan sulfate proteoglycans with lipoproteins was described previously in detail (21Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). LDLs were injected into sensor chip flowcells coated with heparin, LPL, or LPL-heparin. The response values (RU), corresponding to the amount of bound LDL, were then registered at steady state and used to calculate the relative affinities (21Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To assess the role of basic residues of apoB100 in the LPL-LDL interaction, we analyzed three groups of LDL by SPR. The first group consisted of human LDL in which arginines were selectively modified with acetic anhydride (Ac-LDL) and lysines with cyclohexanedione (CHD-LDL). The second group consisted of a recombinant human LDL (isolated from transgenic mice) in which arginines and lysines in the principal proteoglycan binding site (residues 3359–3369) of apoB100 were mutated to serines and alanines, respectively (Mut-LDL) (29Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), to abolish the interaction between LDL and the arterial proteoglycans versican and biglycan (37Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T. Innerarity T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The third group consisted of human plasma LDL and recombinant wild-type LDL (controls). Ac-LDL, CHD-LDL, and Mut-LDL did not interact with heparin alone at measurable affinity under the conditions of the experiments (TableI). Wild-type recombinant LDL bound with somewhat lower affinity than LDL purified from human plasma, consistent with earlier studies of the interaction between LDL and arterial proteoglycans (37Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T. Innerarity T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Table IBinding of normal and modified LDL to heparin, LPL, or LPL-heparin coated on sensor chipsLDL variantBinding of LDL to sensor chipHeparinLPLLPL-heparin% of native LDLLDL100100100Ac-LDL06445CHD-LDL015674Mut-LDL06268RecomLDL10078—66RecomLDL48120—72Delipidated LDL220016—The relative affinities are expressed as percentages of the binding of native LDL isolated from human plasma (LDL).

RecomLDL100, recombinant LDL containing apoB100; RecomLDL48, recombinant LDL containing apoB48. The presence of LPL on heparin or proteoglycans markedly increases the affinity of LDL (6Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1155-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the affinities of the LDL variants for LPL and LPL-heparin. LPL increased the binding of all LDL variants to heparin, regardless of their own affinities for heparin (Table I). We then studied the importance of the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 in the LPL-LDL interaction. Human recombinant apoB100-containing LDL and apoB48-containing LDL had similar binding affinities for LPL (Table I). These results show that the interaction between LPL and LDL was not dependent on basic residues in apoB100 or on any specific binding site in the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100. Next we studied the effects of partial delipidation of LDL on the LPL-LDL interaction. Significant amounts of lipid were removed from human LDL with diisopropyl ether:butanol (48% of total cholesterol and 51% of triglycerides). LDLs remain soluble after removal of even more lipids without altering the LDL receptor binding activity of apoB100 (30Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 542-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography analysis of the partially delipidated LDL showed that the delipidation did not result in any oligomer formation (data not shown). The partial delipidation of LDL greatly increased their affinity for heparin but significantly lowered their affinity for LPL (Table I). To investigate the interaction of LDL with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LPL in a more physiological setting, we performed experiments with modified and recombinant LDL in cultures of THP-I macrophages (TableII). With all types of LDL, both binding (heparin-releasable radioactivity at 4 °C) and uptake (heparin-resistant association with the cells at 37 °C) were low in the absence of added LPL. In this system, modified LDL bound with somewhat higher affinity than native LDL probably because of the presence of scavenger receptors (39Podrez E.A. Hoppe G. O'Neil J. Sayre L.M. Sheibani N. Hoff H.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the difference was not statistically significant. However, addition of LPL (10 µg/ml) dramatically increased both the binding and uptake of native LDL as expected from previous studies (22Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 40Hendriks W.L. van der Boom H. van Vark L.C. Havekes L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding of modified LDL also increased manyfold, indicating that LPL was the main determinant for their interaction with the cells under the conditions used. In experiments performed at 37 °C, most of the LDL-derived radioactivity associated with cells was heparin-resistant and probably corresponded to LDL that had been taken up by the cells. In agreement with the results of SPR studies, recombinant LDL with apoB48 and recombinant LDL with apoB100 bound to cells with similar affinity (Table III).

Isoform-selective NOS inhibitors are highly desirable to regulate the NO production of one isoform beneficial to normal physiological functions from the uncontrolled NO production of another isoform that accompanies certain pathological states. Crystal structures of the heme domain of the three NOS isoforms have revealed a very high degree of similarity in the immediate vicinity of the heme active site illustrating the challenge of isoform-selective inhibitor design. Isothioureas are potent NOS inhibitors, and the structures of the endothelial NOS heme domain complexed with isothioureas bearing small S-alkyl substituents have been determined (Li, H., Raman, C.S., Martásek, P., Král, V., Masters, B.S.S., and Poulos, T.L.

First, l-Arg is converted to NG-hydroxy-l-arginine, and then in a second step NG-hydroxy-l-arginine is oxidized tol-citrulline and NO (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three NOS isoforms (nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS) identified in mammals share more than 50% sequence identity and have identical overall architecture. Each has a heme- and H4B-containing N-terminal oxygenase domain, a FAD/FMN-containing C-terminal reductase domain, and a CaM-binding motif linking the two functional domains (2Masters B.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The heme domain provides the site for l-Arg oxidation, while the FAD and FMN of the reductase domain shuttle electrons from NADPH to the heme (3Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The cofactor, H4B, is necessary for NO production and apparently plays an active redox role during the catalytic cycle (4Bec N.

NO contributes to a broad range of physiological functions in neurotransmission, control of platelet adhesion, vascular homeostasis, and cytotoxicity in the immune response (7Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the different NOS isoforms are expressed in different tissues and are highly regulated transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally. nNOS and eNOS are expressed constitutively in neurons and endothelial cells among other cell types, but NO production is completely dependent on Ca2+/CaM binding (8Knowles R.G.

Commun. 1989; 164: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, iNOS activity is controlled at the transcriptional level and, once expressed, that isoform will produce NO at a high rate. In addition, iNOS is not regulated by CaM, but instead CaM is bound with high affinity and functions as a permanent subunit (10Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Unregulated NO production is associated with various pathological conditions (11Kerwin Jr., J.F. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Feldman P.L. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4343-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), e.g.ischemia-reperfusion injury in stroke, septic shock, and inflammatory disorder including arthritis. Pathology is due to nNOS and/or iNOS. Under such conditions, it is essential to block nNOS and/or iNOS but not eNOS because this last isoform is critical for maintaining proper vascular tone. Because of the double-edged nature of NO in both basic physiological functions and various pathological conditions, the development of isoform-selective NOS inhibitors is a highly desirable goal. Considerable effort has been directed toward developing NOS inhibitors (12Southan G.J. Szabo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 13Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and a vast majority of the existing NOS inhibitors were developed before any of the NOS crystal structures were available. Most of these inhibitors are l-arginine analogues and compounds bearing amidino or ureido functional groups that can simulate the guanidino group of l-Arg. Some of these inhibitors, indeed, show significant isoform selectivity (14Mayer B. Andrew P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmakol. 1998; 358: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The development of NOS inhibitors has entered a new era now that crystal structures of the catalytic heme domain of three NOS isoforms (5Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S.

These structures reveal a striking similarity in dimeric quaternary structure as well as in the heme and pterin binding sites. Given such close similarity, structure-based isoform-selective inhibitor design presents an especially challenging problem. A first step toward this goal requires a correlation between what is known about the inhibition of NOS by various inhibitors and the structure of these inhibitors complexed with the various NOS isoforms. We anticipate that a large number of such structures will be required to provide the structural data base required for isoform-selective inhibitor design. We previously reported the structures of the eNOS heme domain complexed with isothioureas containing small alkyl side chains, and those studies provided a structural rationale for inhibition by this class of compounds (5Raman C.S.

In this communication we report the structures of much larger bisisothioureas bound to the eNOS heme domain. 1,3-PBITU, 1,4-PBITU and SENPITU were purchased from Alexis. 1,14-BITU was synthesized by reaction of 1,14-diaminotetradecane with thiophosgene followed by anhydrous ammonia. The resulting bis-thiourea was then reacted with methyl iodide to give 1,14-BITU. 3B. R. Babu and O. W. Griffith, manuscript in preparation. The bovine endothelial NOS heme domain protein sample was generated by trypsinolysis from the holo-eNOS expressed in Escherichia coli (5Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S.

The eNOS-inhibitor complex crystals were grown at 280 K using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method developed for the substrate complex so that the only difference here is to replacel-Arg with mm amounts of isothiourea ligands in the crystallization mixture (5Raman C.S.

The x-ray diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory BL7–1 at 100 K where a MarResearch Mar345 imaging plate was equipped. The raw data frames were integrated and scaled with HKL Suite (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). To locate the bound ligands, difference Fourier electron density maps were calculated with CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J.

Once the model of ligands were built into the structures using TOM/FRODO (22Jones T.A.

Open table in a new tab Crystal structures of the eNOS heme domain complexed with S-alkyl-isothioureas bearing a simple alkyl group (5Raman C.S. Li H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L.

The high potency of this class of isothiourea inhibitors is primarily attributed to the extensive nonpolar contacts between the small S-alkyl group and an apolar protein pocket adjacent to the substrate binding site (Fig. 2) (18Li H. Raman C.S. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a comprehensive structure-activity-relationship (SAR) study on isothiourea inhibitors, Garvey et al. (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measured competitive binding against substrate using a class of bulky bisisothioureas. Among them 1,3-PBITU and 1,4-PBITU (Fig.3) showed good potency comparable with the small S-alkyl-isothioureas. To understand how these larger inhibitors bind, we determined crystal structures of endothelial NOS heme domain complexed with 1,3-PBITU and 1,4-PBITU, respectively.Figure 3The chemical structures and the abbreviations of compounds discussed in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initial difference electron density maps of both structures revealed the binding of inhibitor at the distal side of the heme plane. However, compared with 1,4-PBITU, the electron density of 1,3-PBITU is weaker indicating lower occupancy or higher thermal motion (Fig. 1). Given that similar concentration of inhibitors were used for crystallization setups of both complexes, the lower occupancy of 1,3-PBITU observed in the structure is consistent with its weaker binding affinity (K i = 9 µm) to eNOS than 1,4-PBITU (360 nm) (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the weaker electron density also could be attributed to higher thermal motion. As expected from the known binding mode of a single isothiourea, the first ureido group of both bisisothioureas still fits into the guanidino site, donating hydrogen bonds to both the Glu-363 carboxylate side chain and the Trp-358 carbonyl oxygen (Fig.4). However, the remainder of the bisisothiourea molecule does not adopt a favored extended conformation but instead makes an unexpected twist into an “S” shape. The energetic incentive for adopting the twisted conformation appears to be the positioning of the second ureido group close to the heme propionate of pyrrole ring D for H-bonding interactions (Fig. 4). A comparison of both structures reveals differences in inhibitor conformation as well as inhibitor-protein contacts that provide a structural basis for understanding why 1,4-PBITU exhibits a 20-fold higher inhibition for all three NOS isoforms compared with 1,3-PBITU (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in 1,4-PBITU the alkyl group of the second ureido group is able to adopt a more extended conformation than in 1,3-PBITU enabling the ureido group to form an H-bond with the heme propionate. The alkyl group in 1,3-PBITU must kink to H-bond with the heme propionate. The second ureido plane is, therefore, flipped almost 180° from 1,4-PBITU to 1,3-PBITU (Fig. 4). The phenyl rings in each inhibitor also are oriented slightly differently. The phenyl ring in 1,4-PBITU complex is approximately perpendicular to the plane of the first ureido group, whereas that in 1,3-PBITU is tilted. The angles between the phenyl ring and first ureido plane in 1,3-PBITU are 64° and 48° for two subunits compared with 77° and 89° in 1,4-PBITU. As a consequence, all six carbon atoms of the phenyl moiety in the 1,4-PBITU complex make good van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Val-338, but in 1,3-PBITU only C-1 and C-2 of the phenyl moiety are close enough to contact Val-338 (Fig. 4). The observed binding mode of the PBITU inhibitors provides an excellent structural basis for interpreting the SAR studies with other bisisothiourea analogues (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A good bisisothiourea inhibitor requires that charge-charge interactions be satisfied for both ureido groups as well as concomitant, optimal nonpolar contacts between the bridging functional group of bisisothiourea and Val-338. Therefore, either shorter or longer methylene chains inserted between the ureido and phenyl groups will weaken interactions between the second ureido group and heme propionate. These changes will also shift the phenyl ring away from the proximity of Val-338. The even poorer binding with substituents at the 1,2-positions (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would result from the crowding of two neighboring substituents and disposition of the phenyl ring relative to Val-338. Although small S-alkyl-isothioureas are potent NOS inhibitors, they exhibit poor isoform selectivity (23Garvey E.P. Oplinger J.A. Tanoury G.J. Sherman P.A. Fowler M. Marshall S. Harmon M.F. Paith J.E. Furfine E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26669-26676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To improve isoform selectivity, Shearer et al. (24Shearer B.G. Lee S. Oplinger J.A. Frick L.W. Garvey E.P. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) addedN-substituents to S-ethyl-isothiourea, and SENPITU was found to have submicromolar binding affinity for all three isoforms, a good scaffold for SAR studies. To provide a structural basis for potential isoform-selective inhibitors built upon this scaffold, we determined the crystal structure at 1.93 Å of eNOS heme domain with SENPITU bound. SENPITU, as with S-ethyl-isothiourea, binds at the active site using both the phenyl-substituted nitrogen and the unsubstituted nitrogen of its thioureido function to H-bond with Glu-363 while making nonpolar contacts to the protein surroundings with itsS-ethyl and N-phenyl groups (Fig. 2). Methylation of either of the two ureido nitrogen atoms abolishes the NOS inhibition (24Shearer B.G. Lee S. Oplinger J.A. Frick L.W. Garvey E.P. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that the H-bond-donating ability of the ureido group is important for binding. The crystal structure reveals that the pocket bordered by the carboxylate of Glu-363 and the carbonyl of Trp-358 is too narrow to accommodate even a monomethyl substitution on the ureido nitrogens if the bifurcate hydrogen bonds between enzyme and ligand are kept in place. This is consistent with the observations based on binding affinity assays of a series of l-Arg analogues. (25Babu B.R. Frey C. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25218-25226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) In those cases, the tightly bound l-Arg analogues always place an unsubstituted –NH2 or =NH2+ in the distal guanidinium nitrogen pocket. This pocket favors the H-bond donating nitrogen over =S or =O group and exhibits very little affinity for –CH3. The N-phenyl group of SENPITU in the active site is oriented such that the aromatic ring adopts an angle of 153° relative the ureido plane (Fig. 2). Similar to the situation observed in the PBITU structures, this phenyl ring makes close van der Waals contacts (3.4 Å) with the Val-338 side chain. These nonpolar interactions are quite important since replacing the phenyl ring by a pyridyl group resulted in much poorer binding (24Shearer B.G. Lee S. Oplinger J.A. Frick L.W. Garvey E.P. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, to avoid steric clashing with the N-phenyl ring, the S-ethyl group in SENPITU complex adopts a different conformation from that observed in the S-ethyl-isothiourea complex structure. In the SENPITU complex the bridging carbon in the ethyl group makes a tight contact (3.1 Å) with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-336, whereas inS-ethyl-isothiourea it is the terminal carbon of the ethyl group that is in the proximity of Pro-336 (Fig. 2). With reasonably tight binding to all three isoforms of NOS, SENPTIU becomes a useful scaffold to further explore isoform selectivity because substituents can be readily added to various positions on the phenyl ring. Although compounds with substituents on all three positions (2-, 3-, and 4-) of the phenyl ring showed similar binding affinity, the 4-position substituents have a much greater effect on isoform selectivity (24Shearer B.G. Lee S. Oplinger J.A. Frick L.W. Garvey E.P. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1901-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among a few dozen compounds, which have been characterized, medium-sized apolar substituents at the 4-position of the phenyl ring significantly elevate the K i value toward iNOS by one order of magnitude while leavingK i to eNOS unchanged. The derivative with a 4-trifluoromethyl (4-CF3) substituent exhibits a 115-fold selectivity for nNOS over iNOS. By examining the structure of the respective NOS active sites, it is clear that the 4-position substituent would make direct contact with the heme propionates. Support for this view stems from the much poorer inhibitory potency observed when the 4-position has a carboxylate substituent creating a repulsive clash with the heme propionates. However, exactly how these contacts with heme propionates lead to isoform selectivity will remain difficult to envision until the structures of the selective inhibitor bound to different NOS isoforms become available. Not surprisingly, the amidino analogue ofN-phenyl-isothiourea, N-phenyl-acetamidine (Fig.3), also proved to be a good scaffold for SAR studies (26Collins J.L. Shearer B.G. Oplinger J.A. Lee S. Garvey E.P. Salter M. Duffy C. Burnette T.C. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is slightly different from the N-phenyl-isothiourea in that substituents on the 3-(meta-), rather than 4-(para-), position of the phenyl ring of acetamidine showed better selectivity toward nNOS. Among the functional groups tested, 3-aminomethyl was the best choice because it presumably hydrogen bonds to a heme propionate. Once again, when the amidino methyl group is replaced with a slightly bulkier nonpolar moiety, such as 2-furanyl or 2-thienyl, the potency of the inhibitor improved dramatically (26Collins J.L. Shearer B.G. Oplinger J.A. Lee S. Garvey E.P. Salter M. Duffy C. Burnette T.C. Furfine E.S. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is because the amidino methyl group does not make any direct contact with the protein whereas 2-furanyl or 2-thienyl can most likely protrude into the hydrophobic pocket defined by Pro-336, Val-338, and Phe-355 (Fig. 2) (18Li H.

However, the 2-pyridyl group causes a decrease in binding affinity indicating the incompatibility of a more polar group in this hydrophobic protein environment lining one side of the active site.

In a substrate-bound form, the amino acid moiety of l-Arg is confined within a pocket, which is not part of the substrate access channel but specifically recognizes the l-enantiomer of Arg. As we have seen in the present work, any non-amino acid-based inhibitor that does not have a functional group capable of binding in the chirality-specific pocket must extend out into the space leading toward the open channel. To test if bulky ligands can still bind to the active site by taking advantage of the wide open channel, we collected data with crystals grown in the presence of a bisisothiourea with a long 14 carbon chain bridging between N-positions of two ureido groups (1,14-BITU, Fig. 3). Unfortunately, although the structure has been refined to 2.0 Å, the electron density for the ligand is only well defined for the anchoring the thioureido group along with four carbon atoms of the linking alkyl chain (Fig. 1) while the rest of the molecule is disordered. Even though the long alkyl chain is not visible, this experiment shows that a bulky ligand with a chain as long as 14 carbons can still reach the active site. As long as the ligand does have a NOS active site anchoring group such as guanidino, amidino, or ureido functionality, it will be able to bind in the active site with the open channel of NOS accommodating the rest of the inhibitor. This information provides insights into possible ways for designing additional classes of isoform-selective inhibitors. The long chain bisisothioureas with a chain length of 12–14 carbons showed higher inhibitory potency compared with the ones with shorter chain length. 4B. R. Babu and O. W. Griffith, unpublished observations. This implies that 1,14-BITU or 1,12-BITU may have additional favorable contacts with the protein. Using the first ureido group as a structure-known anchor point, 1,14-BITU with both ureido groups and its 14-methylene spacer were modeled into the access channel. The second ureido at the end of alkyl chain extends out along the long access channel. The model indicates that residues Glu-271 and Asp-480 provide a potential site of interaction for the ureido group of long chain bisisothioureas (Fig.5). Interestingly these residues are on the surface of the eNOS heme domain structure and at the periphery of the entrance to the substrate access channel. Both residues are also in the vicinity of Trp-482, the last residue in the heme domain prior to the calmodulin binding motif. If, in holo-NOS, either calmodulin or a portion of the reductase domain is positioned close to the mouth of the substrate access channel, the long chain bisisothioureas might possibly reach out to interact with new partners. The unique feature of dual ureido groups makes this class of inhibitors competitive not only with the substrate binding but also potentially with the enzyme's electron transfer partner or allosteric effector. In fact, 1,14-BITU, unlike simpler S-alkyl isothioureas, was observed to inhibit electron transfer reactions of the reductase domain (27Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. Moncada S. Gustafsson L.E. Wiklund N.P.

The structures we have described here and elsewhere 5C. S. Raman, H. Li, P. Martásek, B. S. S. Masters, and T. L. Poulos, manuscript in preparation. provide some modest insights into the possibility of achieving isoform selectivity by exploiting differences along the substrate access channel. Shown in Table II are amino acid variations that are potentially useful for the inhibitor design. For instance, Ser-248 in eNOS (Ser-477 in nNOS) is replaced by Ala-262 in iNOS. A functional group from the ligand, e.g. amino or carboxylate, that is capable of making a hydrogen bond with the Ser side chain may exhibit better selectivity toward eNOS (or nNOS). Similarly, the substitution of Leu-107 in eNOS (Leu-337 in nNOS) by Thr-121 in iNOS could be utilized in designing an iNOS-specific inhibitor by introducing a hydrogen bonding partner from the ligand to Thr-121.Table IIAmino acid substitutions among NOS isoforms along the substrate access channelBovine endothelial NOSVal-106Leu-107Arg-109Gln-112Ser-248His-373Asp-480Rat neuronal NOSMet-336Leu-337Ser-339Thr-342Ser-477Ser-602Asp-709Human inducible NOSMet-120Thr-121Lys-123Thr-126Ala-262Gln-387Glu-494Distance from Cα of the residue to heme iron (Å)2-aDistances are measured from the human iNOS heme domain structure (PDB code 1NSI).15.816.120.417.214.221.819.82-a Distances are measured from the human iNOS heme domain structure (PDB code 1NSI). Open table in a new tab A high degree of primary sequence variation exists also in the region between the conserved Ser residue (334 in rat nNOS, 104 in bovine eNOS, and 119 in human iNOS), which makes a hydrogen bond with H4B, and the first α-helix (α1) in NOS. Unfortunately, this region constitutes a surface loop that is disordered in both the eNOS and nNOS crystal structures. In the human iNOS structure this loop is ordered and lies along the substrate access channel (17Li H. Raman C.S. Glaser C.B. Blasko E. Young T.A. Parkinson J.F. Whitlow M. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21276-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions on this loop can, therefore, be utilized in isoform-selective inhibitor design. Lys-123 in iNOS protrudes into the substrate access channel. This residue is replaced by Arg-109 in eNOS and Ser-339 in nNOS and should be reachable by the ligand, assuming the loop in eNOS or nNOS adopts a conformation similar to that observed in iNOS. The available data indicate that exploiting amino acid differences along the access channel may provide a useful approach. BN 80933, a bulky nNOS selective inhibitor described by Chabrier et al. (28Chabrier P.E. Auguet M. Spinnewyn B. Auvin S. Cornet S. Demerle-Pallardy C. Guilmard-Favre C. Marin J.G. Pignol B. Gillard-Roubert V. Roussillot-Charnet C. Schulz J. Viossat I. Bigg D. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10824-10829Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), possesses an N-phenyl-thiopheneamidine scaffold (Fig. 3) that anchors at the substrate guanidino binding site. An antioxidant moiety, vitamin E or Trolox, is linked to the scaffold by a piperidine molecule. The bulky antioxidant moiety must be accommodated by the open channel. An attempt to model the molecule in the eNOS heme domain structure reveals a few potential contacts that may explain its isoform selectivity. The carbonyl group between the piperidine and vitamin E moiety could be in the vicinity of Ser-248, the vitamin E ring system being in contact with Leu-107 while the hydroxyl group from vitamin E can reach as far as Asp-480. These three contact points are exactly where the amino acid substitutions occur from the constitutive NOS (eNOS and nNOS) to iNOS (Table II), which could be the reason for the selection against iNOS. Selectivity for nNOS over eNOS presumably dependents on other, unfavorable interactions with eNOS not present in nNOS. Another similar example is the nNOS-specific inhibitor, ARL17477 (Fig.3) (29Zhang Z.G. Reif D. Macdonald J. Tang W.X. Kamp D.K. Gentile R.J. Shakespeare W.C. Murray R.J. Chopp M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and its analogues (30Reif D.W. McCarthy D.J. Cregan E. Macdonald J.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1470-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which have an identical NOS active site binding scaffold as that in BN 80933 but with a chlorophenyl group attached to it through a small NH-containing alkyl chain. Again, the bulky functional group could provide isoform selection by interacting with amino acids along the substrate access channel. Similarly, a series of Nω-nitroarginine-containing dipeptide amide compounds developed in Silverman's laboratory showed impressive isoform selectivity (31Huang H. Martásek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Silverman R.B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3147-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Considering the length of the dipeptides, the second residue should be able to extend into the substrate access channel. The nitroarginine moiety provides good binding affinity to the NOS active site while the second residue imposes the selectivity. The high degree of structural similarity in the active sites among the three NOS isoforms provides the rationale for the lack of isoform selectivity among simple amino acid-based or other small isothiourea- or amidine-based inhibitors. However, bulky inhibitors often do exhibit better selectivity. Based on our current state of structural information, we can conclude that a good isoform-selective inhibitor consists of three components. The first is a structural scaffold that provides a guanidino, amidino, or ureido group that donates hydrogen bonds to the glutamate located in the NOS active site. A small hydrophobic group such as alkyl or thienyl is often part of the scaffold to provide additional non-polar interaction with the protein surroundings opposite to the location of the glutamate residue involved in H-bonds to guanidino of thioureido nitrogen atoms. The second is an isoform-selectivity conferring functional group bearing hydrogen bonding capability that can reach into the substrate access channel remote from the active site. The functional group imposes isoform selection by taking advantage of amino acid substitutions along the channel. The third is a linker serving as a spacer between the scaffold and the functional group. The linker should have the appropriate length and flexibility to allow the functional group to reach hot spots along the channel for isoform-specific interactions."

Here, we show that the first hNET intron enhances both the homologous hNET and the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter activities in an orientation- and position-dependent manner. The first hNET intron exhibited a similar promoter-enhancing effect in both SK-N-BE(2)C (NET-positive) and HeLa (NET-negative) cell lines, showing that its function is not cell-specific. Transient transfection assays of a series of deletional constructs show that the first hNET intron contains subdomains with either positive or negative regulatory functions. Furthermore, DNase I footprinting analysis demonstrated that the 5′ side of the intron, encompassing the splice donor site, is prominently protected by nuclear proteins isolated from both SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cells. The protected nucleotide sequence contains a consensus E-box motif, known to regulate diverse eukaryotic genes, which overlaps with the splice donor site of the first intron. We demonstrate that two basic helix-loop-helix proteins, upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2, are major proteins interacting at this site and that the E-box is at least in part responsible for the promoter-enhancing activity of the first intron. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the splice donor site of the first intron affects both correct splicing and transcriptional activity.

NE neurotransmission is terminated by the norepinephrine transporter (NET), located on NE nerve terminals, which is responsible for the rapid reuptake of NE into the presynaptic neurons (1Axelrod J. Kopin I.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1969; 31: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The clinical importance of noradrenergic transmission is suggested by the therapeutic usefulness of tricyclic antidepressant drugs, which enhance the synaptic availability of NE through the inhibition of NE transport into presynaptic terminals. These findings provided support for the catecholamine hypothesis that depression is associated with a decrease in the levels of catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine (2Schildkraut J.J. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1965; 122: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Consistent with this catecholamine hypothesis, a recent analysis showed that the levels of norepinephrine and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde and monohydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde are significantly reduced in the internal jugular venous plasma of depression patients (3Lambert G. Johansson M. Agren H. Friberg P. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2000; 57: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a missense mutation (G to C) in exon 9 of NET gene has recently been identified and found to cause a 98% loss of function (4Shannon J.R. Flattem N.L. Jordan J. Jacob G. Black B.K. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Robertson D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). It is of great interest that this mutation is associated with hyperadrenergic states, leading to orthostatic intolerance (4Shannon J.R. Flattem N.L. Jordan J. Jacob G. Black B.K. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Robertson D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Collectively, regulation of NET expression may significantly affect NE neurotransmission, and its abnormal expression may play a role in the pathophysiology of major depression and cardiovascular disorder (4Shannon J.R.

NET gene expression is controlled by various physiological and pharmacological signals in noradrenergic neurons and neurosecretory cells. Levels of NET mRNA in the locus coeruleus and the adrenal medulla were decreased by the treatment with reserpine or glucocorticoid but were increased by nerve growth factor (6Cubells J.F. Kim K.S.

(Lond.). 1996; 494: 67-75Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that both short and long term function of NET may be modulated by metabolic hormones, such as insulin and thyroid hormone (8Figlewicz D.P. Epilepsy Res. 1999; 37: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Tejani-Butt S.M. Yang J. Neuroendocrinology. 1994; 59: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Yang S.P.

In addition, angiotensin II has been shown to play an important role in the stimulation of NET gene transcription mediated by Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PKC pathways in neuronal cultures (11Lu D., Yu, K. Paddy M.R. Rowland N.E. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Yang H. Raizada M.K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the superior cervical ganglia, leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor suppressed the level of NET mRNA, whereas retinoic acid increased NET mRNA expression (13Matsuoka I. Kumagai M. Kurihara K. Brain. Res. 1997; 776: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The NET mRNA is transiently elevated in locus coeruleus neurons following either kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (14Bengzon J. Hansson S.R. Hoffman B.J. Lindvall O. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or penytylenetetrazol-induced seizures (15Szot P. White S.S. Veith R.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At present, the molecular mechanisms of NET gene regulation by these physiological and pharmacological stimuli are poorly understood. The human NET (hNET) gene is a highly dispersed locus with ∼2 kb of coding exons spread across 45 kb of genomic DNA and located at chromosome 16q12.2 (16Porzgen P. Bonisch H. Bruss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized the structural organization of the 5′ upstream promoter region of the hNET gene (17Kim C.H. Kim H.S. Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6507-6518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A new intron of 476 bp was shown to reside in the middle of the 5′-untranslated leader sequence, and two major transcription initiation sites were determined. Whereas the 5′ upstream 9.0-kb sequence contains important regulatory information for the cell-specific expression of the hNET gene, the first intron increases the transcriptional activity by ∼10–40-fold, depending on the cell lines tested. These observations suggest that the first hNET intron may play an important role as a typical enhancer in NET gene regulation. To further elucidate its regulatory mechanisms, we initiated a systematic functional analysis of the first hNET intron. In addition to showing that the first hNET intron enhances the promoter activity in an orientation- and position-dependent manner, this study identifies a cis-regulatory element, an E-box motif residing in the junction of the first exon and intron, that is critical for basal transcriptional activation of NET mRNA via interaction with transcription factors USF1 and USF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same cis-element directly regulates correct splicing of hNET mRNA because it coincides with the splice donor site of the first intron. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cell lines were used as the NET-positive and NET-negative cell lines respectively. Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin in a CO2 incubator. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation as previously described (18Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

Plasmids for transfection were prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Co., Santa Clarita, CA). For the SK-N-BE(2)C cell line, each 60-mm dish was transfected with an equimolar amount (0.5 pmol) of each reporter construct, 1 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase, and pUC19 plasmid to a total of 5 μg of DNA. For the HeLa cell line, twice as much DNA was used in transfection. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, lysed by freeze-thaw cycles, and assayed for CAT activities. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies among different DNA precipitates, CAT activity was normalized to that of β-galactosidase. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as previously described (18Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Kim K.S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constructions of pNET1400CAT and pNET1400(i)CAT were described previously (17Kim C.H. Kim H.S. Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

In order to investigate whether the first intron functions in conjunction with a heterologous promoter, the 540-bp BamHI fragment containing the first intron was also cloned into the BglII site of pBLCAT2 (20Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter to form TK(i)CAT. The same BamHI fragment was made blunt with Klenow fragment and subcloned into either upstream NET promoter or downstream CAT encoding sequence to generate pNET(i)1400CAT and pNET1400CAT(i), respectively. Similarly, the blunt-ended fragment was cloned into either upstream TK promoter or downstream CAT encoding sequences to generate (i)TKCAT and TKCAT(i), respectively. The plasmid pNET1400(i-rev)CAT was constructed by subcloning the SmaI-SmaI fragment covering positions +230 ∼ +586 within the first intron in the reverse orientation. The orientation of the first intron was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequence analysis. For the internal deletion constructs, intronic sequence was amplified by PCR using sense primer (5′-CCGGACACGTGAGTGCGCACTAGTCCTGAGCGCGGGACAGGGCTAGGT-3′) containing restriction enzyme SpeI and antisense primer (catoligo2; 5′-CATTTTAGCTTCCTTAGC-3′), digested with PmlI andXhoI, and subcloned into pNET1400(i)CAT that had been digested with PmlI and XhoI to yield pNET1400(i-spe)CAT. The 120-bp fragment including the intact splicing acceptor site was also amplified by PCR using sense primer (5′-GGATAACTAGTTTATCCAAGCAGAGCCTCGGCGTG-3′) and catoligo2 primer, cut with SpeI and XhoI, and subcloned into pNET1400- (i-spe)CAT, which was digested with SpeI andXhoI to generate pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT. In order to subclone the PCR fragments into the pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT, the 5′ primers were designed to contain a SpeI site, and the 3′ primers were designed to contain a XbaI site. PCR products that were digested by SpeI and XbaI were then subcloned into the SpeI site of the pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT. Nucleotide sequences of primers used in PCR were 5′-TGCCCACTAGTTCGGTGAGTTCAATCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TGCTTTCTAGAAGGGAAAAGAGGTGGTTACC-3′ for pNET1400(iΔ381–645)CAT, 5′-CCGGACACGTGAGTGCGCACTAGTCCTGAGCGCGGGACAGGGCTAGGT-3′ and 5′-TGCCCTCTAGAGCTGGGATTGAACTCACCGA-3′ for pNET1400(iΔ190–362)CAT, 5′-CCGGACACGTGAGTGCGCACTAGTCCTGAGCGCGGGACAGGGCTAGGT-3′ and 5′-TTGAGACTAGTCGTGCCCCAACCTCTGTTTC-3′ for pNET1400(iΔ190–482)CAT, and 5′-CCGGACACGTGAGTGCGCACTAGTCCTGAGCGCGGGACAGGGCTAGGT-3′ and 5′-GGAAATCTAGAGAAACAGAGGTTGGGGCACG-3′ for pNET1400(iΔ190–362/ 501–645)CAT. The PCR-derived fragments were sequenced to ensure that no errors had been introduced. Base substitutions in E-box and splicing donor site were generated in the context of the 1400 bp upstream plus intron sequence using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The following oligonucleotides were used in the mutagenesis procedure: 5′-GATCCCCTCGCCGCCGGAaAgGTGAGTGCGCCCTGAGCG-3′ for E-box mutation unaffecting the splice donor site and 5′-GATCCCCTCGCCGCCGGACACGacAGTGCGCCCTGAGCG-3′ for E-box mutation affecting the splice donor site (lowercase letters indicate the substitutions in nucleotides). The mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared from SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cells according to the procedure described by Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and dialyzed against the same buffer. The extracts were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored in aliquots at −70 °C, and used within 3 months of extraction. Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 112: 195-203Google Scholar). The first intron fragment was prepared by PCR and used as a probe in the DNase I footprinting experiment. For the coding strand probe, a primer (5′-AGCTCTTCCCCGGCCCCGCCCGAACGCCACACGGCGGA-3′) representing the coding nucleotide sequence from +47 to +84 bp of the hNET gene was labeled by polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. This was used in PCR, together with an unlabeled nucleotide, 5′-CCCTACTTGCAACTCCCAAGACCACCCGGGAGCGCCTTAG-3′, representing the noncoding nucleotide sequence from +574 to +613 of the hNET gene. PCR was performed with the denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis at 95 °C (40 s), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min), respectively, for a total of 30 cycles using the plasmid pNET1400(i)CAT as a template,. The end-labeled probe was isolated from a 7% polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (23Kim K.S. Febraio M. Han T.H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. A Practical Approach: Gene Probes 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1995: 151-182Google Scholar). After incubating 30,000 cpm of labeled probe with 10–20 μl of nuclear extracts in 40 μl of binding buffer for 25 min at room temperature, DNase I digestion was carried out using freshly diluted DNase I in 1× binding buffer, which contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) was included in the reaction as a nonspecific competitor. The amount of DNase I was empirically adjusted for each extract to produce an even pattern of partially cleaved products. The DNase I reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K, and 100 mm NaCl). Samples were then extracted twice with phenol-chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. The DNA pellet was dried and resuspended in sequencing stop buffer (0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10 mm Na2 EDTA, and 90% deionized formamide) and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. An aliquot of sample was then loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide-8 m urea sequencing gel. The same probe was subjected to parallel digestion without prior incubation with nuclear extracts, typically using 5–10% of the DNase I used in the presence of nuclear extracts. Location of cleaved products was determined by comparison with sequencing ladders run in adjacent lanes on the gel. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences protected by DNase I were synthesized (Gene Link, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with the following nucleotide sequences: 5′-GCCGCCGGACACGTGAGTGCGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGCGCACTCACGTGTCCGGCGG-3′ for NI, 5′-GCACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTACACC-3′ and 5′-GGGTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGGTG-3′ for the consensus binding site for USF1 (UI). Nucleotide sequences for mutant oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCGCCGGAAAGGTGAGTGCGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGGGCGCACTCACCTTTCCGGCGG-3′ for NIm. The consensus AP2 and Sp1 oligonucleotides were previously described (24Seo H. Yang C. Kim H.S. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kim H.S. Seo H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed, gel-purified, and32P-labeled by T4 DNA kinase and used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and antibody coincubation experiments were performed using 30,000–50,000 cpm of labeled probe (∼0.05–0.1 ng) and nuclear extracts (10–30 μg) in a final volume of 20 μl of 12.5% glycerol, and 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as described (26Yang C. Kim H.S. Seo H. Kim C.H. Brunet J.F. Kim K.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1813-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed by adding nonradioactive competitor oligonucleotides in a molar excess before adding32P-labeled oligonucleotides. For the supershift assay, antibodies were coincubated with the nuclear extract mix for 30 min at room temperature before adding the radiolabeled probe. Antibodies against USF1, USF2, c-Myc, Sp1, and AP2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SK-N-BE(2)C cells were transiently transfected with different CAT reporter gene constructs. Poly(A+) RNA was prepared by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity column chromatography as previously described (23Kim K.S. Febraio M. Han T.H. Wessel T.C. Park D.H. Joh T.H. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. A Practical Approach: Gene Probes 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1995: 151-182Google Scholar). The poly(A+)RNA was reverse-transcribed with SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) by priming with the catoligo2 primer. The products were subjected to the PCR using sense primer 5′-AGCTCTTCCCCGGCCCCGCCCGAACGCCACACGGCGGA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCGCGGATCCGAATTCTGGCGAGAGGAACTTTACCGG-3′. The PCR product was analyzed on 7% polyacrylamide gel. RT-PCR was also performed using primers for β-actin gene messages as a control. Primers for the β-actin gene were 5′-GGTCAGAAGGACTCCTATGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTAGCCACGCTCGGTCAGG-3′ (antisense). In the native position (pNET1400(i)CAT construct), the first intron increased the reporter expression driven by the 1.4 kb NET upstream promoter by 12–15-fold in SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cell lines (Fig.1 A). However, the first hNET intron was unable to activate promoter activity when placed either in the 5′ upstream position (pNET(i)1400CAT) or in a position 3′ to the reporter gene (pNET1400CAT(i)). Thus, the promoter-enhancing function of the first hNET intron appeared to be dependent on its original position in the context of the homologous promoter. Notably, the first hNET intron by itself did not have any promoter activity, as the reporter gene expression driven by the first intron alone was no higher than that obtained with promoterless construct (data not shown). When placed downstream of the heterologous TK promoter (TK(i)CAT in Fig.1 B), which is analogous to the native position, the first hNET intron increased the transcriptional activity by 5- and 8-fold in SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cells, respectively. However, when placed either in the upstream position ((i)TKCAT) or in a position 3′ to the reporter gene (TKCAT(i)), the first hNET intron again failed to show enhancing activity (Fig. 1 B). In order to investigate whether orientation of the first hNET intron affects its function, we generated a reporter construct containing an internally inverted intron. To avoid the possibility that reporter gene expression is affected by an improper splicing of mRNA, the original donor and acceptor sites for splicing were kept intact. The inverted sequence somewhat stimulated promoter activity, but less effectively than that in the correct orientation (4.5-foldversus 11-fold; Fig.2 A). To confirm that the difference in reporter gene expression could be attributed to transcriptional regulation but not to a defective splicing mechanism, RT-PCR was performed. When the mRNAs isolated from SK-N-BE(2)C cells transfected with the forward or reverse intron-containing constructs were examined by RT-PCR, we detected only a mRNA species with a size expected from a proper splicing event (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, our results suggested that the first hNET intron robustly enhances the promoter activity, and its full activity requires the original position and orientation. Therefore, it appears that the regulatory elements within the first hNET intron fail to meet the criteria for a “classical enhancer” but require the native orientation and position for promoter-enhancing activity. To locate the regulatory domains within the first hNET intron, we next performed deletional analyses. To distinguish transcriptional regulation from improper splicing mechanisms, deletional constructs were generated such that the original splicing donor and acceptor sites were kept intact (Fig.3). Reporter gene activity of each construct was examined by transient transfection assays using SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cell lines. Deletion of a 5′-side domain between +190 and +362 bp (pNET1400(iΔ190–362)CAT) decreased the CAT expression by ∼40%, suggesting that this subdomain contains positive regulatory sequences. Interestingly, CAT expression driven by pNET1400(iΔ190–482)CAT, in which the first hNET intron was further deleted to +482 bp, was even higher than that by the wild type plasmid pNET1400(i)CAT, suggesting the possibility that an internal subdomain between +362 and +482 bp encompasses negative regulatory sequences. Deletion of a 3′-side domain between +381 and +645 bp (pNET1400(iΔ381–645)CAT) diminished CAT expression by about half, suggesting that a 3′ side subdomain between +483 and +645 bp contains positive regulatory sequences. The internal deletion of most nucleotides of the first intron (pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT) shows a reduction of approximately 50% of CAT activity. Finally, consistent with the concept that sequences between +362 and +501 contain negative regulatory sequences, insertion of this subdomain to pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT further decreased the CAT expression (construct pNET1400(iΔ190–362/501–645)CAT). The first hNET intron therefore appears to contain several regulatory subdomains with either positive or negative regulatory function, which collectively enhance the promoter activity. It is noteworthy that pNET1400(iΔ190–645)CAT, in which only 10 bases of each splicing junction area are retained, still can enhance the promoter activity 4–5-fold, which is approximately half the activity of the full first intron sequence. This indicates that a cis-element important for the enhancing activity may reside in or overlap with the splicing donor or acceptor site (see below). To identify specific transcription factor(s) responsible for the promoter enhancing activity of the first hNET intron, we investigated DNA-protein interactions by DNase I footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts isolated from SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cells. A prominent DNA-protein interaction was mapped at +173 to +190, using both the coding and noncoding strands (Fig. 4 and data not shown). This precisely overlaps with the splicing donor site, suggesting that this site may be important for basal transcriptional activation as well as correct splicing of NET mRNA. Nuclear proteins from both SK-N-BE(2)C and HeLa cells footprinted the same area. In contrast, no clear DNA-protein interaction was detected along the whole internal sequence of the intron (data not shown), suggesting that transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulatory function of the first hNET intron may have weak DNA binding affinity and/or exist in a very low concentration. The protected area at +173 to +190 contains a consensus E-box (CACGTG), which is known to be a binding site for basic helix-loop-helix class transcription factors, such as c-Myc and the upstream stimulatory factors USF1 and USF2 (27Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 28Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). When an oligonucleotide NI encompassing the protected nucleotides was used as the probe, a specific DNA-protein complex (C1) was prominently formed using nuclear extracts from SK-N-BE(2)C cell line (Fig.5 B). A similar DNA-protein complex was formed with an identical mobility when an oligonucleotide UI containing the consensus USF1 binding site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a probe (Fig. 5 B). The formation of the C1 complex was completely abolished when the oligonucleotide NIm with two mutated bases within the core E-box motif was used as the probe. When the nuclear extracts from HeLa cell line were used, a similar pattern was observed except that another band with a faster mobility was also formed. Because this band was robustly formed even when the mutated NIm oligonucleotide was used as the probe, it may represent a nonspecific complex. In a competition assay, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled NI or UI oligonucleotide almost completely abolished formation of C1 (Fig. 5 C). However, its mutant form (NIm), the Sp1 oligonucleotide, or the AP1 oligonucleotide failed to compete for complex formation. In addition, formation of the second complex with HeLa nuclear extracts was not efficiently competed by the specific NI and UI oligonucleotides, supporting the notion that it is a nonspecific complex. These observations suggest that (i) C1 represents sequence-specific DNA-protein complex, (ii) the E-box motif is essential for formation of C1 complex, and (iii) the C1 complex may involve the USF1 or related factors. To identify protein factor(s) involved in formation of the C1 complex with the E-box motif, we performed antibody coincubation experiments using the oligonucleotide NI as the probe. When nuclear extracts from SK-N-BE(2)C or HeLa cells were coincubated with an antibody against c-Myc, formation of C1 was not affected, and no supershifted band was observed. In contrast, coincubation of nuclear extracts with an antibody against USF1 diminished formation of C1 and produced supershi"
https://openalex.org/W2135106240,"Triiodothyronine (T3) stimulates a robust increase (>40-fold) in transcription of the malic enzyme gene in chick embryo hepatocytes. Previous work has shown that optimal T3 regulation of malic enzyme transcription is dependent on the presence of an accessory element (designated as region E) that immediately flanks a cluster of five T3 response elements in the malic enzyme gene. Here, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins to region E and investigated the mechanism by which region E enhances T3 responsiveness. In nuclear extracts from hepatocytes, region E binds heterodimeric complexes consisting of the homeodomain proteins PBX and MEIS1. Region E contains four consecutive PBX/MEIS1 half-sites. PBX-MEIS1 heterodimers bind the first and second half-sites, the third and fourth half-sites, and the first and fourth half-sites. The configuration conferring the greatest increase in T3 responsiveness consists of the first and fourth half-sites that are separated by 7 nucleotides. Stimulation of T3 response element functions by region E does not require the presence of additional malic enzyme sequences. In pull-down experiments, PBX1a and PBX1b specifically bind the nuclear T3 receptor-α, and this interaction is enhanced by the presence of T3. A T3 receptor-α region containing the DNA binding domain plus flanking sequences (amino acids 21–157) is necessary and sufficient for binding to PBX1a and PBX1b. These results indicate that PBX-MEIS1 complexes interact with nuclear T3 receptors to enhance T3 regulation of malic enzyme transcription in hepatocytes.

This reaction is the primary source of reducing equivalents for de novo synthesis of long chain fatty acids in avian liver (1Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Regulation of malic enzyme activity is typical of that of other lipogenic enzymes. Malic enzyme activity increases by 70-fold when previously starved chicks are fed a high carbohydrate, low fat diet and dramatically decreases when animals are starved (2Goodridge A.G. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nutritional regulation of malic enzyme activity is quantitatively mimicked in primary cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes by manipulating the concentrations of hormones and metabolic fuels in the culture medium. Insulin, glucose, and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3),1 humoral factors that are elevated during consumption of a high carbohydrate, low fat diet, increase malic enzyme activity in chick embryo hepatocytes (3Goodridge A.G. Adelman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3027-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E493-E501PubMed Google Scholar). T3 alone stimulates malic enzyme activity; insulin and glucose amplify the action of T3 but have little effect when added by themselves. Glucagon and fatty acids, humoral factors that are elevated during starvation, inhibit the stimulation of malic enzyme activity caused by T3 (3Goodridge A.G. Adelman T.G. J. Biol.

Alterations in malic enzyme activity caused by nutritional manipulationin vivo and nutrients and hormones in culture are mediated primarily by changes in the rate of transcription of the malic enzyme gene (4Hillgartner F.B.

Stapleton S.R. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulation by nutrients and hormones, malic enzyme transcription is controlled in a tissue-specific or cell type-specific manner. In chicks fed a high carbohydrate, low fat diet, malic enzyme transcription is high in liver and low in heart, kidney, and brain (6Ma X.-J. Salati L.M. Ash S.E. Mitchell D.A. Klautky S.A. Fantozzi D.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18435-18441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nutritional manipulation has no effect on malic enzyme transcription in heart, kidney, and brain. Cell type-dependent differences in the regulation of malic enzyme are also observed in cells in culture. T3 stimulates a 40-fold or greater increase in malic enzyme transcription in chick embryo hepatocytes, whereas in chick embryo fibroblasts and quail QT6 cells, T3 has little or no effect on malic enzyme transcription (8Hillgartner F.B. Chen W. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12299-12306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The robust effects of T3 on malic enzyme transcription in chick embryo hepatocytes makes this an excellent system to study the molecular mechanisms by which T3 regulates transcription. T3 activates gene transcription by interacting with nuclear T3 receptors (TR) (9Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). TRs bind T3 response elements (T3RE) of target genes as homodimers or heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). T3REs consist of multiple copies of a hexameric sequence related to a consensus RGGWMA arranged as inverted repeats, everted repeats, direct repeats, or as extended single copies of the hexamer (11Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The T3-induced increase in malic enzyme transcription in chick embryo hepatocytes is mediated by at least six T3REs (12Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T.

Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One strongly active and four weakly active T3REs are clustered in a 109-bp region located at −3878/−3769 bp relative to the transcription start site. This cluster of T3REs is referred to as a T3 response unit (T3RU). Another weakly active T3RE is located about 700 bp downstream of the T3RU. All of the malic enzyme T3REs consist of directly repeated hexameric half-sites separated by a 4-bp spacer and bind TR-RXR heterodimers in hepatic nuclear extracts. In addition to T3REs, accessory elements that bind nonreceptor proteins play an important role in mediating the effects of T3 on malic enzyme transcription. We have identified four accessory elements in the malic enzyme gene that confer differences in T3 regulation of malic enzyme transcription between chick embryo hepatocytes and chick embryo fibroblasts (15Fang X. Hillgartner F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Each element enhances T3 responsiveness of the malic enzyme promoter in chick embryo hepatocytes but has no effect on T3 responsiveness in chick embryo fibroblasts. Three of the accessory elements immediately flank the T3RU and are designated regions A, E, and F. The T3RU and accessory elements A, E, and F overlap with a hepatocyte-specific and T3-inducible region of DNase I hypersensitivity in chromatin. Region F (−3703/−3686 bp) binds the liver-enriched factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα). The identities of the proteins that bind region A (−3895/−3890 bp) and region E (−3761/−3744 bp) have not yet been determined. The nature of the proteins that bind region E is of particular interest because mutation of this element causes the largest decrease in T3-induced malic enzyme transcription of the four accessory elements identified. PBX proteins are members of the 3-amino acid loop extension superclass of homeodomain proteins (16Burglin T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The pbx1 gene was first identified as a site of t(1,19) chromosomal translocation leading to the production of an E2a-PBX1 fusion protein in a subset of pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias in humans (17Kamps M.P.

Cell. 1990; 60: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Highly conserved homologs of PBX have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster (19Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (16Burglin T.R.

Cell. 2000; 6: 255-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that PBX proteins regulate developmental pathways by serving as cofactors for other homeodomain transcription factors. For example, PBX potentiates the effects of HOX proteins on segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis (21Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by heterodimeric interactions between PBX and HOX. PBX-HOX complexes bind DNA with enhanced specificity and affinity compared with complexes containing PBX or HOX alone (22Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 23van Dijk M.A. Murre C. Cell. 1994; 78: 617-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Lu Q. Knoepfler P.

Recent studies have shown that PBX, MEIS1, and PREP1 also function in maintaining cellular differentiation in adult tissues. For example, PBX-PREP1 heterodimers mediate the pancreatic-specific transcription of the genes for somatostatin and glucagon (32Goudet G. Delhalle S. Biemar F. Martial J.A. Peers B. J. Biol.

In the case of the somatostatin gene, PBX-PREP1 stimulates transcription in pancreatic cells by potentiating the transcriptional activity of the pancreatic-specific homeodomain factor, PDX1 (32Goudet G.

In the case of the glucagon gene, PBX-PREP1 binds to a cis-acting element that represses glucagon transcription in non-pancreatic cells without affecting glucagon transcription in pancreatic cells (33Herzig S.

Still other studies have shown that PBX-PREP1 heterodimers interact with a cis-acting element that confers cell type-specific transcription of the human α2(V) collagen gene (35Penkov D. Tanaka S.

In addition to the pancreas and tissues that express α2(V) collagen, PBX and MEIS1/PREP1 proteins are expressed at significant levels in other adult tissues, including liver (36Monica K. Galili N.

The physiological role of these proteins in liver has not been established. In the present study, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins to malic enzyme region E in hepatocytes. We show that this TR accessory element binds PBX-MEIS1 heterodimers in multiple configurations. In addition, we have developed data suggesting that the stimulation of T3-induced malic enzyme transcription by region E is mediated by direct interactions between PBX and TR. The DNA fragments used to construct reporter plasmids were named by designating the 5′ and 3′ ends of each fragment relative to the start site of transcription of the malic enzyme gene. p[ME−3921/−3631]ME−147/+31CAT has been described previously (15Fang X. Hillgartner F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This reporter plasmid contains the malic enzyme T3RU and flanking sequences (−3921 to −3631 bp) linked to the minimal promoter of the malic enzyme gene (−147 to +31 bp). Site-directed mutations were introduced into p[ME−3921/−3631]ME−147/+31CAT using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy (41Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). p[T3RE-2]ME−147/+31CAT was made by subcloning the major malic enzyme T3RE between −3883 and −3858 bp into the BamHI/SacI site upstream of the minimal promoter in ME−147/+31CAT. p[T3RE-2+Region E]ME−147/+31CAT was constructed by inserting region E (ME−3767/−3742) into theSpeI/SmaI site immediately downstream of the of T3RE-2 in p[T3RE-2]ME−147/+31CAT. Dr. M. Kamps (University of California, San Diego) provided the cDNAs for human PBX1a and PBX1b. The cDNA for mouse MEIS1 was obtained by Dr. N. Copeland (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center). Drs. H. Chen and S. Antonarakis (University of Geneva) supplied the cDNA for human PREP1. cDNAs for full-length PBX1a (PBX1a-(1–430)), PBX1b (PBX1b-(1–347)), MEIS1 (MEIS1-(1–390)), and PREP1 (PREP1-(1–436)) and human RXRα (RXRα-(1–462)) were subcloned into pSV-SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression plasmids containing N-terminal truncations of PBX1a (PBX1a-(80–430) and PBX1a-(119–430)) were provided by Dr. C. Murre (University of California, San Diego). The full-length cDNA of chicken TRα corresponding to amino acids 1–408 (TRα-(1–408)) was subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(−) (Promega). N-terminal and C-terminal deletion derivatives of chicken TRα were generated by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction products encoding TRα polypeptides containing amino acids 1–118, 1–157, 21–408, 51–408, and 120–408 were subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(−). To generate plasmids that express fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) linked to PBX1a, PBX1b, or TRα, cDNAs containing the full-length coding region of PBX1a, PBX1b, or TRα were subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Structures of reporter plasmids and expression plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequence analyses. Primary cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (42Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1924-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in serum-free Waymouth medium MD705/1 containing 50 nm insulin (gift from Lilly) and corticosterone (1 μm). Hepatocytes were incubated at 40 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were transfected using a modification of the method of Baillie et al. (43Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, chick embryo hepatocytes were isolated as described above and plated on 35-mm dishes. At 18 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with one containing 20 μg of LipofectACE (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3.0 μg of p[ME−3921/−3631]ME−147/+31CAT, or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid and 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. At 42 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without T3 (1.5 μm). At 90 h of incubation, chick embryo hepatocytes were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared for CAT (44Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) measurements. CAT activity was expressed relative to β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between samples. All DNAs used in transfection experiments were purified using the Qiagen endotoxin-free kit. Nuclear extracts were prepared from chick embryo hepatocytes incubated with or without T3 for 24 h. Nuclei and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar) except that the protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.25 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 mm), and PMSF (0.5 mm) were added to the extraction and dialysis buffers at the indicated concentrations. PBX1a, PBX1b, MEIS1, PREP1, RXRα, and TRα were translated in vitro using the TNT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Incorporation of [35S]methionine into PBX1a, PBX1b, MEIS1, PREP1, RXRα, and TRα was measured in parallel reactions in order to assess the relative efficiency of synthesis of the different transcription factors. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNA in a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA followed by heating to 95 °C for 2 min and then cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in overhanging 5′ ends using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl containing 18 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 90 mm KCl, 0.18 mm EDTA, 0.45 mm dithiothreitol, 18% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). A typical reaction contained 20,000 cpm of labeled DNA and 10 μg of nuclear extract or 2 μg of in vitrotranslated proteins. The reaction was carried out on ice for 60 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subject to storage phosphor autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with radiolabeled oligomer prior to addition of nuclear extract. For gel supershift experiments, nuclear extracts or in vitro translated proteins were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 0 °C prior to addition of the oligonucleotide probe. An antiserum that reacts with all isoforms of PBX (PBX1, -2, and -3) (47Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2521-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Dr. M. Kamps (University of California, San Diego). A polyclonal antibody that reacts with MEIS1 and PREP1 (sc-6245) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Synthetic oligonucleotides that were used as probes or competitors in gel mobility shift assays are listed in Fig. 3. GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21, pLysS) and purified using standard techniques (48Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were transformed with pGEX-2T or recombinant pGEX-2T plasmids expressing GST fusion proteins. Overnight bacterial cultures in ampicillin (250 μg/ml) were diluted 1:100 into 250 ml of Luria broth and grown at 37 °C to anA600 = 1.0 before induction with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside for 60 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 6% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100). Cells were lysed on ice by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator with 0.5–1 ml of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that were preswollen in buffer A. After absorption, beads were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A. Fusion proteins coupled to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were stored at 4 °C as 50% (v/v) slurry in buffer A. The concentrations and sizes of GST and GST fusion proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE, using a known quantity of molecular weight standards. l-[35S]Cysteine- orl-[35S]methionine-labeled proteins were prepared by using TNT reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Approximately 2.5 × 104 to 5 × 104 cpm of35S-labeled protein were incubated with 100 ng of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 300 μl of buffer A for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-gel loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by storage phosphor autoradiography. Where indicated 1 μm T3 or 9-cis-retinoic acid was included in the binding reaction mixture. 35S-Labeled proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and storage phosphor autoradiography to ensure that similar levels of input radioactivity of the labeled protein were used in the GST binding assays.

PBX, MEIS1, and PREP1 interact with 4-bp sequence elements referred to as half-sites. Selection studies with degenerate oligonucleotides have shown that PBX-MEIS1 and PBX-PREP1 heterodimers bind two contiguous half-sites with the consensus sequence, 5′-TGAT-TGAC-3′, in which PBX contacts the upstream half-site and MEIS1/PREP1 contacts the downstream half-site (Fig.1 A) (27Chang C.P. Jacobs Y. Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5679-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 47Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2521-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This sequence is referred to as the PBX-cooperativity element (PCE). Analysis of the sequence in region E indicated the presence of four tetrameric sequence elements that are identical or strongly resemble binding sites for PBX, MEIS1, and PREP1. These half-sites are designated 1, 2, 3, and 4. To investigate whether PBX heterodimers interacted with region E, gel mobility shift experiments were performed using antibodies against PBX and MEIS1/PREP1. Incubation of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing region E with nuclear extract from chick embryo hepatocytes resulted in the formation of two protein-DNA complexes that were designated a and b in the order of increasing mobility (Fig. 1 B). The pattern of protein binding to region E was similar in hepatocytes incubated in the absence and presence of T3 (data not shown) (15Fang X. Hillgartner F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Incubation of hepatocyte nuclear extracts with antiserum against all isoforms of PBX completely disrupted the formation of complex a and b, indicating that these complexes contained PBX or a highly related factor. Incubation of nuclear extracts with an antibody that reacts with MEIS1 and PREP1 also completely disrupted the formation of complex a and complex b. These data indicate that complex a and complex b contain PBX-MEIS1 and/or PBX-PREP1 heterodimers. Further evidence that PBX-MEIS1 and/or PBX-PREP1 bound region E in hepatocytes was obtained from competition experiments. An unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the PCE was as effective as an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing region E in competing for the binding of complex a and complex b (Fig. 3 B). The ability of region E to bind heterodimers containing PBX-MEIS1 and PBX-PREP1 was confirmed by gel mobility shift experiments employingin vitro synthesized transcription factors. At least 5 isoforms of PBX have been identified that are derived from three different genes (17Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X.H. Baltimore D.

https://openalex.org/W2091350638,"Alternative splicing of the 12-base exon 2 of the adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD) gene is subject to regulation by both cis- and trans-regulatory signals. The extent of exon 2 inclusion is stage- and cell type-specific and is subject to the physiological state of the cell. In adult skeletal muscle, a cell type that regulates the activity of this allosteric enzyme at several levels, the exon 2-plus form of AMPD, predominates. We have performed a systematic analysis of the cis-acting regulatory sequences that reside in the intron immediately downstream of this mini-exon. A complex element comprising sequences that enhance exon 2 inclusion and sequences that counteract this effect resides in the middle of this intron. We demonstrate that the enhancing component is bipartite, with more than a kilobase of sequence separating the two functional sites. The presence of even minimal levels the mini-exon in the fully processed AMPD mRNA requires both of these sites, neither of which appears in any other published splicing enhancer. An RNA binding activity derived from a muscle cell line requires both of the enhancing sites. Mutations in either of the sites that eliminate exon 2 inclusion abrogate this binding activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072807569,"The fate of the catalytic subunit of the Escherichia coli heat labile toxin (LTA(1)) was studied after expression in mammalian cells to assess the requirement for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) binding to localization and toxicity and ability to compete with endogenous ARF effectors. A progression in LTA(1) localization from cytosol to binding Golgi stacks to condensation of Golgi membranes was found to correlate with the time and level of LTA(1) expression. At the highest levels of LTA(1) expression the staining of LTA and both extrinsic and lumenal Golgi markers all became diffuse, in a fashion reminiscent of the actions of brefeldin A. Thus, LTA(1) binds to the Golgi and can alter its morphology in two distinct ways. However, point mutants of LTA(1) that are defective in the ability to bind activated ARF were also unable to bind Golgi membranes or modify Golgi morphology. Co-expression of mutants of ARF3 that regained binding to these same mutant LTA(1) proteins restored the localization and activities of the toxin. Thus, binding to ARF is required both for the localization of the toxin to the Golgi and for effects on Golgi membranes. A correlation was also seen between the ability of LTA mutants to bind ARF and the increase in cellular cAMP levels. These results demonstrate the importance of ARF binding to the toxicity and cellular effects of the ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxin and reveal that mutants defective in binding ARF retain basal ADP-ribosylation activity but are the least toxic LTA(1) mutants yet described, making them the best candidates for development as mucosal adjuvants."

The current model of the subunit arrangement in the F0 complex emerges from the results of electron and atomic force microscopy (18Birkenhaeger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F.

The polar loop is known to interact with the γ and ε subunits of F1 in the native enzyme (26Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

The number of c subunits in the complex is presently the subject of controversy, with numbers in the range of 10–14 being proposed for different species (25Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

The multiple copies of subunit c are proposed to be arranged in a cylinder such that the TMHs1 form two concentric rings with the N- and C-terminal helices positioned in the inner and outer circle of the ring, respectively. Subunits aand b are located outside the ring perimeter, subunita being in contact with TMH-2 of the subunit c(22Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subunit b is present in two copies and probably serves as the stalk of the stator holding the α3β3subunits of F1 in a fixed position relative to the transmembrane regions of subunits a and b(31Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Capaldi R.A. Schulenberg B. Murray J. Aggeler R. J. Exp.

The path of H+ transport through F0 and the mechanism of coupling H+ translocation to rotation remain largely unknown. In the course of H+ transport, the proton is assumed to bind transiently to the carboxyl group of the essential Asp61 residue, located about halfway across the hydrophobic slab of the lipid bilayer. An interaction between the a andc subunits, probably involvingaArg210 and cAsp61, is thought to promote deprotonation of Asp61 at the exit side of the membrane (11Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 34Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

In models of the c oligomer (23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), the Asp61 carboxyl group appears to be buried at the interface of two neighboring c subunits, so a significant conformational change in the c subunit will be required to allow direct contact between cAsp61and aArg210. Ionization of Asp61 is known to result in global structural changes in the monomeric protein (37Assadi-Porter F.M. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16186-16193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The recently published solution structure of subunit cat pH 8 (24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), where Asp61 is ionized, shows TMH-2 turned by about 140° compared with its orientation in the protonated subunit; major structural changes in the loop region were also observed. The turning of TMH-2 in one or two c subunits of native F0 would provide a more complete explanation of previous cross-linking experiments in which a-c (22Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) andc-c (21Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17175-17178Google Scholar) dimers were observed. Some of these dimers cannot be accounted for by the simplest oligomeric model utilizing the pH 5 structure only (23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Hence, in native F0 the deprotonation of Asp61 was suggested to be linked with the turning of thecTMH-2 at the subunit a interface, and this turning, or its reversal following reprotonation of Asp61, was proposed to be coupled to the stepwise circular movement of thec-oligomeric ring (24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 38Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such conformational movements, occurring within units of a closely packed oligomer, must involve rather complex concerted movements of both helices. The present work bears on the possible role of an essential transmembrane proline residue in such movements. One prominent feature of the subunit c structure at pH 5 is a bend in TMH-2 associated with Pro64 (16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Substitution of Pro64 with Leu renders the ATP synthase inactive, as evidenced by inability of cells to grow on succinate by oxidative phosphorylation (39Fimmel A.L. Jans D.A. Langman L. James L.B. Ash G.R. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, function in the cP64L mutant can be partially restored by a second site A20P mutation (39Fimmel A.L. Jans D.A. Langman L. James L.B. Ash G.R. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and further improved when position 64 is occupied by alanine (40Fraga D. Subunit c of the Escherichia coli Proton Translocating ATP Synthase: New Insights into Residue Function by Mutant Analysis.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI1990Google Scholar). In the hairpin structure of monomeric subunit c, residues 20 of TMH-1 and 64 of TMH-2 lie proximally to each other. Comparison of sequence alignment of the c subunits from other species confirms that a prolinyl residue placed in close proximity to the equivalent of Asp61 is a common feature of subunitc structure (41Groth G. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of mutant analysis in E. coli, the proline residue is located in helix 1 in some species and in helix 2 in others. This raises the question of the effect of the prolinyl location on the architecture of the monomeric protein in solution and the related question of the role of the prolinyl residue in the native enzyme. We report here on the structure of A20P/P64A substituted subunit c. The A20P/P64A subunitc was prepared from strain JH613, which contains copies of the mutant subunit c gene on the chromosome and on a pBR322-derived plasmid and is genetically equivalent to strain MEG119 used for the purification of the wild type protein (42Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Uniform labeling with 15N was achieved by growing cells on a minimal medium containing 15 mm[15N]NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source. Subunitc was purified as described previously (42Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Samples for NMR contained 0.6 ml of 2.2 mm subunit c in either CDCl3/CD3OH/H2O (4:4:1) or CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O (4:4:1), both solvents containing 50 mm NaCl. The pH of the samples was adjusted to 5.0 without correction for the isotope effect. NMR data were collected on a Brüker DMX600 spectrometer with triple axis pulsed field gradient capability at 300 K. Two-dimensional proton experiments were done essentially as described previously (17Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The HSQC, three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC, and NOESY-HSQC experiments used gradient sensitivity-enhanced schemes (43Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 6: 845-858Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 44Warren W.S. Richter W. Andreotti A.H. Farmer B.T. Science. 1993; 262: 2005-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Chemical shift assignments for the wild type protein were used as a basis for assigning resonances in the DQF-COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, and three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC spectra of the cA20P/P64A protein. The sequential assignments were checked and completed using the three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiment. Distance constraints were derived from two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC experiments. Scalar coupling constants were calculated from three-dimensional HNHA spectrum (45Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Exchange rates for amide protons were measured by diluting a sample in CDCl3/CD3OH/H2O with two volumes of fully deuterated solvent and then recording a series of HSQC spectra at intervals between 1 and 36 h. Spectral data were processed using Felix 95.0 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., Palo Alto, CA). A total of 645 NOEs were assigned in the spectra, 493 of which provided meaningful distance constraints. The structure was calculated from these constraints, 41 hydrogen bond constraints and 42 HNHα coupling constants (see TableI). Two hundred initial structures were calculated using simulated annealing as implemented in DYANA (46Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The 10 lowest energy structures were additionally minimized using the AMBER force field as implemented in “Discover” (Molecular Simulations Inc., Palo Alto CA). The quality of the structures was checked using PROCHECK (47Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured at room temperature with membranes diluted to 15 µg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP by liberation of inorganic phosphate (49LeBel D. Poirier G.G. Beaudoin A.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). ATPase-coupled proton translocation was monitored by the quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence in HMK assay buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl) as described previously (34Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test for inhibition by DCCD, membranes were incubated on ice at 3 mg/ml in TMDG buffer with 50 µm DCCD for 30 min. Protein was determined by a modified Lowry assay in the presence of SDS (50Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E. colistrain OM470 carrying the A20P/P64A subunit c grew as well as wild type on a succinate carbon source, which indicates that thecA20P/P64A mutant F0F1 functions well as an ATP synthase during oxidative phosphorylation. The total ATPase activity of membranes prepared from the wild type and OM470 cells was 0.24 ± 0.03 µmol min−1 mg of protein−1 and 0.28 ± 0.04 µmol min−1 mg of protein−1respectively. DCCD inhibited the ATPase of wild type andcA20P/P20A membranes by 65 and 75%, respectively. The ATPase-coupled H+ transport activity of wild type and mutant membrane vesicles was equivalent, although the activity of the mutant was somewhat more sensitive to inhibition by DCCD (Fig.1). These results demonstrate that thecA20P/P64A mutation does not significantly affect the function of the ATP synthase. The structure of A20P/P64A substituted subunit c was solved in the chloroform/methanol/water mixture that had been used previously for solving the structure of wild type subunit c (16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal fragment of the subunit b (17Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To facilitate the use of chemical shift assignments available for the wild type protein and to make the structural comparison meaningful, the spectra were recorded under conditions identical to those used for wild type protein (16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). An overlay of the two-dimensional 15N,1H chemical shift correlation spectra of the wild type and A20P/P64A proteins is shown in Fig. 2. The chemical shifts of the backbone amide groups are very similar for residues 1–14, 28–55, and 70–79. The largest difference in chemical shifts is found for residues located around the sites of mutation at residues 20 and 64 (Fig. 3). The similarity of the chemical shifts and the unimpaired function of the ATP synthase were taken to be a strong indication that overall architecture of the mutant protein was similar to wild type. This justified use of the wild type structure as a reference in resolving ambiguous NOE assignments that resulted from the high degree of chemical shift degeneracy observed for this protein. The final family of 10 structures had r.m.s. deviations of 0.75 ± 0.20 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.27 ± 0.22 Å for all heavy atoms of residues 3–77. The conformation of the two individual helical domains is defined somewhat better. When residues 4–39 and 46–77 were aligned separately, the r.m.s. deviations for the backbone atoms were 0.61 ± 0.15 and 0.54 ± 0.20 Å, respectively. There were no distance constraint violations exceeding 0.3 Å (Table I). In the 10 best structures, 90.6% of residues were found in the most favored regions of Ramachandran plot, with 8.6% in the additionally allowed, 0.6% in the generously allowed, and 0.2% in disallowed regions. For the well defined region of the structure, comprising residues 3–77, 92.8% of residues were in the most favored region with no residues in disallowed regions.Figure 3Summary of NMR data for the A20P/P64A mutant of subunit c.

Indeed, as for the wild type protein, the structure of A20P/P64A subunitc is best described as a hairpin of two α-helices extending from residues 4 to 39 and 46 to 77 (Fig. 3). The packing of the two helices in the structure (Fig.4 A) is determined by long range distance constraints derived from 44 NOEs. The distribution of NOEs along the amino acid sequence is shown in Fig.5 A. A comparison of long range NOEs observed in the wild type and A20P/P64A proteins reveals a similar pattern of interactions between the helices (Fig. 5 B), but the pairs of interacting residues are different in many cases. Consequently, the relative orientation, bending, and crossing angles of the helices in the mutant protein are somewhat different from the wild type protein (Fig. 6, A andB). The longer N-terminal helix of A20P/P64A subunitc is bent around Pro20 at an angle of about 20° and wraps around the nearly straight C-terminal helix. The helices cross at angles of about 20° for the segments comprising residues 22–40 and 46–62 and about 35° for the segments comprising residues 4–18 and 64–77. The bend in the N-terminal helix is associated with the absence of a backbone hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala21 and amide proton of Ala25. Similarly, in the wild type subunit cstructure at pH 5 (1A91; Ref. 16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), where a comparable bend is observed in the C-terminal helix, the Met65/Gly69hydrogen bond would have quite unfavorable geometry. In the structure of wild type subunit c at pH 8 (24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), where the C-terminal helix is more strongly bent around Pro64 (Fig.6 C), the Met65/Gly69 backbone hydrogen bond is absent. The changes in orientation and crossing angle of the helices in the mutant versus wild type proteins result in associated changes in the structure of the connecting polar loop, most notably of residues 42–45 (Fig. 4 B).Figure 5NOE distributions in the sequence of A20P/P64A subunit c.

Since the prolinyl residue and bend occur in different TMHs in the wild type and mutant proteins, the packing of TMHs varies somewhat in the structures of the two monomeric subunits. On the other hand, the function of the cA20P/P64A mutant ATP synthase appears nearly indistinguishable from wild type, which strongly suggests that the structure of both proteins should be very similar within the oligomeric c-ring. Intersubunit packing interactions that lead to c-ring formation may force an adjustment (straightening) in either structure, as is already indicated by molecular modeling studies done with the wild type protein (23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As discussed previously (23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the solution structure was expected to change in at least minor ways as additional protein-protein surface interactions were considered. In the case of A20P/P64A subunitc, a straightening of helix 1 and concomitant reorientation of the two helical segments in the course of oligomer formation may allow the subunit to pack in a ring that is very similar to wild type. The structure presented here does indicate that the forces leading to the kink in TMH-2 of wild type subunit c result from local constraints introduced by the prolinyl residue rather than global interactions reflecting the packing of the entire protein. In contrast to globular proteins, there are relatively few surface-surface interactions between the TMHs of the highly elongated subunit c monomer. The relative orientation and bend of helices should therefore be expected to change significantly upon packing of the individual c subunits into the ring structure of F0 due to the contribution of the numerous additional interactions (23Dmitriev O.Y.

Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Indeed, a modeling of the wild type coligomer, which was based upon an extensive set of distance constraints from intersubunit cross-linking in the native F0 and the NMR model, indicated that the C-terminal helix straightened with the bend angle around Pro64 being reduced from 27° in the NMR structure (1A91; Fig. 6B) to 16 ± 3° in the oligomer ring (Ref.23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Fig. 6D). Further, a more recent calculation of the wild type subunit c structure at pH 5 (1C0V; Ref. 24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) showed a less pronounced bend around Pro64 of about 11°. Given that the two pH 5 structures do differ significantly and that the calculations were based upon the same extensive set of NOEs (16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), the experimentally derived constraints clearly permit significant variation in the overall bend of the molecule. The comparison of the structures of A20P/P64A and wild type subunitc raises an obvious question about the functional role of the bend in the proline-containing helix. The recently reported structure of deprotonated subunit c (Fig. 6 C) suggests that ionization of Asp61 results in a major reorientation in the packing of helices, TMH-2 being turned by about 140° relative to its orientation in the protonated state (24Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The occurrence of such helical turning, within the confines of the multiple intersubunit surface contacts of the oligomer, would require rather complex concerted movements of both transmembrane helices and would probably also involve the neighboring c subunits. The movement appears to involve changes in the bend angle of both helices. Indeed, in the pH 8 structure of the wild type monomeric subunit, very significant bends are observed in both TMH-2 and TMH-1, i.e.bend angles of about 60 and 30°, respectively. In the model of the subunit c oligomer (23Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the side chain of Asp61is located at the interface of two neighboring c subunits. An interaction of the Asp61 side chain withaArg210 is proposed to be a key step in transmembrane H+ transport (11Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 34Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 35Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar, 36Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and a concerted bending and swiveling of helices may be critical in promoting this interaction. The fact that the proline can be located on either of the two helices without a noticeable effect on function supports the notion that both helices are involved. The role of prolinyl residue would then be to introduce a “weak spot” in the helical hairpin by breaking the regular pattern of hydrogen bonds stabilizing one of the TMHs. The role of prolinyl residues in TMHs of transport proteins has been a subject of interest and hypotheses for some time (51Brandl C.J. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 93: 917-921Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 52Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons indicate that proline residues are much more common in the membrane-spanning domains of transport proteins versus other membrane proteins (51Brandl C.J. Deber C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 93: 917-921Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This observation, taken together with the helix-breaking propensity of proline residue, suggests a possible general role for proline in facilitating functionally important movements of transmembrane helical segments. Molecular dynamics simulations with model peptides (53Yun R.H. Anderson A. Hermans J. Proteins. 1991; 10: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), alamethicin (54Biggin P.C. Breed J. Son H.S. Sansom M.S.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 627-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and individual helices of bacteriorhodopsin (55Sankararamakrishnan R. Vishveshwara S. Proteins. 1993; 15: 26-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 56Woolf T.B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2376-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) demonstrate that prolinyl-containing α-helices will adopt a variety of kinked conformations on a fast time scale, differing in kink angle and hydrogen bonding pattern around the prolinyl residue. The possible variations in hydrogen bonding pattern could allow the polypeptide chain to adopt different metastable conformations during the course of a transport cycle. The suggested importance of the subunit c transmembrane prolinyl residue in F0F1 function is generally supported by sequence alignment of subunit c from other species (41Groth G. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Assuming the same hairpin-like structure, a prolinyl residue would be located close to the essential Asp or Glu residue in 28 of the 37 species compared (41Groth G. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In these cases, the proline is found in the position equivalent to 64 in E. coli TMH-2 (12 examples) or at the position equivalent to residue 24 in E. coli TMH-1 (16 examples). Nine of the 37 cases do not have a proline in either TMH, but, with one exception, Ser or Thr residues are found in these regions on one or both helices. Hydrogen bond formation between a Ser or Thr side chain and the backbone atom of another residue provides an alternative mechanism of breaking the hydrogen bond pattern of an α-helix and introducing a potential site for the swiveling and bending of the helix. We conclude that the bends observed in the TMHs of wild type and A20P/P64A subunit c in solution very likely reflect a need for a concerted structural rearrangement of helices around the region of the essential proline during the H+ transport cycle.
