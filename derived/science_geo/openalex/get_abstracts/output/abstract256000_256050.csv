https://openalex.org/W2104726963,"Cell signaling mechanisms often transmit information via posttranslational protein modifications, most importantly reversible protein phosphorylation. Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2007497503,"Ustilago maydis is an important fungal pathogen of maize, causing corn smut. It is well adapted to its host and proliferates in living plant tissue without inducing a defence response. The genome sequence of U. maydis has now been determined, the first for a biotrophic plant parasite. Several gene clusters that encode secreted proteins of unknown function were identified: genome-wide expression analysis shows that the clustered genes are upregulated during disease. Mutations in these gene clusters frequently affect virulence, ranging from complete loss of pathogenicity to hypervirulence. Ustilago maydis is a ubiquitous pathogen of maize and a well-established model organism for the study of plant–microbe interactions1. This basidiomycete fungus does not use aggressive virulence strategies to kill its host. U. maydis belongs to the group of biotrophic parasites (the smuts) that depend on living tissue for proliferation and development2. Here we report the genome sequence for a member of this economically important group of biotrophic fungi. The 20.5-million-base U. maydis genome assembly contains 6,902 predicted protein-encoding genes and lacks pathogenicity signatures found in the genomes of aggressive pathogenic fungi, for example a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. However, we detected unexpected genomic features responsible for the pathogenicity of this organism. Specifically, we found 12 clusters of genes encoding small secreted proteins with unknown function. A significant fraction of these genes exists in small gene families. Expression analysis showed that most of the genes contained in these clusters are regulated together and induced in infected tissue. Deletion of individual clusters altered the virulence of U. maydis in five cases, ranging from a complete lack of symptoms to hypervirulence. Despite years of research into the mechanism of pathogenicity in U. maydis, no ‘true’ virulence factors3 had been previously identified. Thus, the discovery of the secreted protein gene clusters and the functional demonstration of their decisive role in the infection process illuminate previously unknown mechanisms of pathogenicity operating in biotrophic fungi. Genomic analysis is, similarly, likely to open up new avenues for the discovery of virulence determinants in other pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1980091129,"Recent experimental progress in table-top experiments or gravitational-wave interferometers has enlightened the unique displacement sensitivity offered by optical interferometry. As the mirrors move in response to radiation pressure, higher power operation, though crucial for further sensitivity enhancement, will however increase quantum effects of radiation pressure, or even jeopardize the stable operation of the detuned cavities proposed for next-generation interferometers. The appearance of such optomechanical instabilities is the result of the nonlinear interplay between the motion of the mirrors and the optical field dynamics. In a detuned cavity indeed, the displacements of the mirror are coupled to intensity fluctuations, which modifies the effective dynamics of the mirror. Such ""optical spring"" effects have already been demonstrated on the mechanical damping of an electromagnetic waveguide with a moving wall, on the resonance frequency of a specially designed flexure oscillator, and through the optomechanical instability of a silica micro-toroidal resonator. We present here an experiment where a micro-mechanical resonator is used as a mirror in a very high-finesse optical cavity and its displacements monitored with an unprecedented sensitivity. By detuning the cavity, we have observed a drastic cooling of the micro-resonator by intracavity radiation pressure, down to an effective temperature of 10 K. We have also obtained an efficient heating for an opposite detuning, up to the observation of a radiation-pressure induced instability of the resonator. Further experimental progress and cryogenic operation may lead to the experimental observation of the quantum ground state of a mechanical resonator, either by passive or active cooling techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2142115235,"Cooling of mechanical resonators is the focus of much research effort because of possible applications in ultra-high precision measurements such as gravitational wave detection. It is also of fundamental interest as using this technique it may be possible to observe a transition between classical and quantum behaviour of a mechanical system. Three groups report advances in this area. Gigan et al. and Arcizet et al. used radiation pressure to freeze out thermal vibrations of tiny mechanical microresonators, or micromirrors. In the right conditions, the mirrors cool from room temperature to about 10 K without outside influence. Once the technique is refined it should be possible to achieve further cooling and to observe the quantum ground state of a micromirror experimentally. In the third paper, Dustin Kleckner and Dirk Bouwmeester use optical feedback to cool a micromirror to sub-kelvin temperatures. Experiments where a tiny mirror, a mechanical microresonator, within an optical cavity undergoes 'self-cooling' is detailed. Under the right, finely tuned conditions, the thermal vibration of the mirror freezes out without outside influence. It cools down by a factor of 30, from room temperature to about 10 kelvin. Cooling of mechanical resonators is currently a popular topic in many fields of physics including ultra-high precision measurements1, detection of gravitational waves2,3 and the study of the transition between classical and quantum behaviour of a mechanical system4,5,6. Here we report the observation of self-cooling of a micromirror by radiation pressure inside a high-finesse optical cavity. In essence, changes in intensity in a detuned cavity, as caused by the thermal vibration of the mirror, provide the mechanism for entropy flow from the mirror’s oscillatory motion to the low-entropy cavity field2. The crucial coupling between radiation and mechanical motion was made possible by producing free-standing micromirrors of low mass (m ≈ 400 ng), high reflectance (more than 99.6%) and high mechanical quality (Q ≈ 10,000). We observe cooling of the mechanical oscillator by a factor of more than 30; that is, from room temperature to below 10 K. In addition to purely photothermal effects7 we identify radiation pressure as a relevant mechanism responsible for the cooling. In contrast with earlier experiments, our technique does not need any active feedback8,9,10. We expect that improvements of our method will permit cooling ratios beyond 1,000 and will thus possibly enable cooling all the way down to the quantum mechanical ground state of the micromirror."

https://openalex.org/W2040712240,"In Arabidopsis, microRNA-directed cleavage can define one end of RNAs that then generate phased siRNAs. However, most miRNA-targeted RNAs do not spawn siRNAs, suggesting the existence of additional determinants within those that do. We find that in moss, phased siRNAs arise from regions flanked by dual miR390 cleavage sites. AtTAS3, an siRNA locus important for development and conserved among higher plants, also has dual miR390 complementary sites. Both sites bind miR390 in vitro and are functionally required in Arabidopsis, but cleavage is undetectable at the 5' site--demonstrating that noncleavable sites can be functional in plants. Phased siRNAs also emanate from the bounded regions of every Arabidopsis gene with two known microRNA/siRNA complementary sites, but only rarely from genes with single sites. Therefore, two ""hits,""--often, but not always, two cleavage events--constitute a conserved trigger for siRNA biogenesis, a finding with implications for recognition and silencing of aberrant RNA."

Glucose is one of the most ancient and central signaling molecules in a broad range of organisms from E. coli and yeast to humans and plants. The diverse molecular mechanisms of glucose sensing and signaling, as well as glucose-mediated transcription repression and activation, have been intensively studied in unicellular microbes (Stulke and Hillen, 1999Stulke J.

Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The yeast Hxk2 has been known to play a role in glucose-mediated catabolite repression for more than two decades (Entian, 1980Entian K.D. Genetic and biochemical evidence for hexokinase PII as a key enzyme involved in carbon catabolite repression in yeast.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide new evidence for the nuclear localization of Hxk2 through direct interaction with a DNA binding transcription repressor Mig1, which is regulated through phosphorylation by Snf1 protein kinase and dephosphorylation by Glc7-Reg1 protein phosphatase complex in response to glucose levels. The actions of Hxk2/Mig1/Snf1 appear to be yeast specific, and the precise molecular mechanisms in glucose sensing and signaling remain to be resolved (Ahuatzi et al., 2004Ahuatzi D.

In mammals, novel functions of liver glucokinase (GK/HXKIV) have recently been uncovered, including GK interaction with proapoptotic Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) at mitochondria to control apoptosis (Danial et al., 2003Danial N.N.

Pégorier J.P. Benhamed F. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Fauveau V. Magnuson M.A. Girard J. Postic C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20314-20326Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although glucose metabolism via GK was suggested to be important for transcription regulation (Dentin et al., 2004Dentin R. Pégorier J.P. Benhamed F. Foufelle F. Ferré P. Fauveau V. Magnuson M.A. Girard J. Postic C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20314-20326Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the ability of human GK to complement glucose-signaling defects of the yeast hxk2 mutant indicates a potential signaling function of mammalian GKs (Mayordomo and Sanz, 2001Mayordomo I. Sanz P. Human pancreatic glucokinase (GlkB) complements the glucose signalling defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae hxk2 mutants.Yeast. 2001; 18: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, liver and brain GK and HXKIII in many tissues are detected in the nucleus and may serve currently undefined functions (Alvarez et al., 2002Alvarez E. Roncero I. Chowen J.A. Vazquez P.

Studies of sugar responses in diverse plant species and sugar insensitive or oversensitive mutants in Arabidopsis have revealed the pivotal roles of sugars in the regulation of gene expression; cell proliferation and death; seedling, root, stem, and inflorescence growth; leaf expansion and senescence; and seed development (Koch, 1996Koch K.E.

Genetic, phenotypic, and biochemical analyses of the Arabidopsis HXK1 mutants, gin2, have provided compelling evidence for uncoupling glucose-signaling functions from metabolic activities. It has been shown that diverse glucose responses can be mediated by the HXK1 mutations with little or no catalytic activity (Harrington and Bush, 2003Harrington G.N. Bush D.R.

Role of the Arabidopsis glucose sensor HXK1 in nutrient, light, and hormonal signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, it poses a major challenge to understand how HXK1 executes its glucose sensing and signaling functions. Although nuclear localization of HXKs has been observed in mammalian and plant cells (Alvarez et al., 2002Alvarez E. Roncero I. Chowen J.A. Vazquez P. Blazquez E.

Differential regulation of EIN3 stability by glucose and ethylene signalling in plants.Nature. 2003; 425: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), their well-defined enzymatic roles in the first step of glycolysis (Kim and Dang, 2005Kim J.W. Dang C.V. Multifaceted roles of glycolytic enzymes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 142-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) may have obscured or prevented investigation seeking unconventional/nonglycolytic functions of HXK in the past. We have previously shown that Arabidopsis HXK1 can be expressed and detected in the nucleus of maize mesophyll protoplasts (Yanagisawa et al., 2003Yanagisawa S. Yoo S.D. Sheen J. Differential regulation of EIN3 stability by glucose and ethylene signalling in plants.Nature. 2003; 425: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that endogenous HXK1 resides in the nucleus of intact Arabidopsis plants, albeit at minute amount. We hypothesized that HXK1 might mediate glucose sensing and signaling in different cellular compartments with shared or distinct partners. To explore novel mechanisms underlying the nuclear HXK1 actions in diverse glucose responses, we designed sequential screens based on proteomics and the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay to search for the proteins that directly interact with HXK1 in the nucleus. We identified two HXK1 novel partners, VHA-B1 and RPT5B, that have never been previously suspected to play a role in glucose signaling. Similar to HXK1, both VHA-B1 and RPT5B have other well-established functions, for which they work with different partners in the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase/VHA) and proteasome complexes, respectively (Sze et al., 2002Sze H. Schumacher K. Muller M.L. Padmanaban S. Taiz L.

Only in the nucleus, these three proteins interact and act synergistically to mediate glucose sensing and signaling. Genetic, transgenic, biochemical, and molecular evidence supports an essential role of the novel HXK1 nuclear complex in controlling diverse glucose responses in whole plants. To assess the possibility that endogenous glucose sensor HXK1 could be detected in the nucleus of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants, we treated ground leaves with the detergent Triton X-100 to solubilize most proteins in the organelles but kept the nuclei intact with Mg2+ (Sheen, 1993Sheen J. Protein phosphatase activity is required for light-inducible gene expression in maize.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3497-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Yanagisawa et al., 2003Yanagisawa S. Yoo S.D. Sheen J. Differential regulation of EIN3 stability by glucose and ethylene signalling in plants.Nature. 2003; 425: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). As expected, the majority of HXK proteins were detected in the detergent-solubilized fraction using the specific antibody for HXK, which was not detected in the gin2 mutant (Figure 1A) (Jang et al., 1997Jang J.C. Leon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Hexokinase as a sugar sensor in higher plants.Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19PubMed Google Scholar, Moore et al., 2003Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Role of the Arabidopsis glucose sensor HXK1 in nutrient, light, and hormonal signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, relatively small but reproducible amount of HXK was detected together with the major nuclear protein histones in the nuclear fraction (Figure 1A) (Sheen, 1993Sheen J. Protein phosphatase activity is required for light-inducible gene expression in maize.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3497-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Yanagisawa et al., 2003Yanagisawa S. Yoo S.D. Sheen J. Differential regulation of EIN3 stability by glucose and ethylene signalling in plants.Nature. 2003; 425: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Protein blot analysis using other specific antibodies against abundant proteins in each fraction confirmed that there was little cross contamination. For example, ribulose 1,6-bisphosphate carboxylase (RBC) was exclusively found in the soluble fraction, whereas histone was present only in the nuclear fraction (Figure 1A). Using a transgenic gin2 mutant line complemented by the epitope-tagged HXK1-FLAG (Moore et al., 2003Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Role of the Arabidopsis glucose sensor HXK1 in nutrient, light, and hormonal signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), we could also clearly identify HXK1-FLAG in the nuclear fraction using a specific FLAG antibody (Figure 1A). To initiate an investigation of nuclear HXK1 functions, we designed a six-step procedure to identify proteins that directly interact with HXK1 in the nucleus (Figure 1B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures) and may play important roles in the HXK1-mediated glucose signaling (Jang et al., 1997Jang J.C.

To isolate in vivo protein complexes, the gin2 transgenic line fully complemented by HXK1-FLAG (Moore et al., 2003Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Role of the Arabidopsis glucose sensor HXK1 in nutrient, light, and hormonal signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) was used to take advantage of the robust immuno-affinity purification system based on FLAG epitope tag (Ho et al., 2002Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. et al.Systematic identification of protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by mass spectrometry.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). The first enrichment step by nuclear fractionation was very critical, because the presence of abundant HXK1 proteins outside the nucleus for glucose metabolism and other functions could impede our experimental purpose focused on nuclear glucose signaling (Moore et al., 2003Moore B. Zhou L. Rolland F. Hall Q. Cheng W.H. Liu Y.X. Hwang I. Jones T. Sheen J. Role of the Arabidopsis glucose sensor HXK1 in nutrient, light, and hormonal signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The specificity of the proteins purified by the FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose was confirmed by the negative control experiments using WT or gin2 leaves lacking HXK1-FLAG (data not shown). Around 50 visible bands were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion before multiple runs of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive bioinformatics peptide searches (Table S1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To identify the direct HXK1-interacting partners, it was essential to perform the Y2H screen with 48 candidates using HXK1 as bait (Figure 1B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The sequential proteomics and Y2H screens identified VHA-B1 and RPT5B as the only two proteins directly interacting with HXK1 (Table S1). The three-way binary interactions among HXK1, VHA-B1, and RPT5B are also demonstrated by Y2H analysis (Figure 1C). Unexpectedly, VHA-B1 is one of the three expressed isoforms for the B subunit of V1 complex in V-ATPase (Table S1) (Sze et al., 2002Sze H. Schumacher K. Muller M.L. Padmanaban S. Taiz L.

Plant V-ATPase has been shown to localize in vacuoles, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, small vesicles, and the plasma membrane. All three VHA-B isoforms (VHA-B1, VHA-B2, and VHA-B3) are detected by the proteomic analyses of vacuoles and the tonoplast (Carter et al., 2004Carter C. Pan S. Zouhar J. Avila E.L. Girke T.

The identification of RPT5B as one of the two expressed isoforms of the 19S regulatory particle triple-A ATPase (Table S1) in the conserved base complex of proteasome was also surprising (Rubin et al., 1998Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S. Finley D.

The 19S RP is a stable and evolutionarily conserved protein complex found in both cytosol and the nucleus. The six AAA-ATPases in the base serve nonredundant functions in proteasome-dependent or proteasome-independent processes (Rubin et al., 1998Rubin D.M. Glickman M.H. Larsen C.N. Dhruvakumar S.

The high resolution of MS analysis allowed the identification of a specific isoform of proteins produced from small gene families (Table S1). None of the V-ATPase components has previously been reported to be present in the nucleus or to interact with HXK (Nishi and Forgac, 2002Nishi T. Forgac M.

An additional Y2H screen with the 48 candidates using VHA-B1 as bait revealed the direct interaction of VHA-B1, but not HXK1, with two putative transcription factors (At1g50420: SCARECROW-like TF1 and At3g11280: MYB-like TF2) (Figure 1C and Table S1). The putative TFs were only localized to the nucleus visualized by their GFP fusions in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts (Figure 1D). The results further support the unconventional interactions and localization of VHA-B1, RPT5B, and HXK1 in the nucleus (Figure 1). No glycolytic enzymes were identified in the nuclear HXK1 protein complexes. In this study, we focused on the detailed analyses of VHA-B1 and RPT5B functions in glucose signaling in Arabidopsis. VHA-B1 and RPT5B are the unique isoforms of Arabidopsis VHA-B and RPT5 that reside in stable protein complexes with well-established partners. To further evaluate the specificity of their interactions with HXK1, we tested the interactions between HXK1 and VHA-B2, VHA-B3, or RPT5A, the closest homolog of VHA-B1 and RPT5B (Fu et al., 1999Fu H.Y. Doelling J.H. Rubin D.M. Viestra R.D.

As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, only the HA-tagged VHA-B1 and RPT5B, but not the HA-tagged RPT5A, VHA-B2 or VHA-B3, were specifically coimmunoprecipitated by the FLAG-tagged HXK1 when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. VHA-B1 was more efficiently pulled down by HXK1 when RPT5B was coexpressed (Figure 2A), confirming the tight interaction of the three-protein complex revealed independently by the binary Y2H analysis (Figures 1C and 1E). Based on the same coimmunoprecipitation assay, we showed that other key subunits of the V1 complex in V-ATPase, including VHA-A, VHA-C, and VHA-H encoded by unique genes in Arabidopsis (Sze et al., 2002Sze H. Schumacher K. Muller M.L. Padmanaban S. Taiz L.

The expression of RPT5A, VHA-B2, VHA-B3, VHA-A, VHA-C, and VHA-H proteins in transfected protoplasts was as abundant as VHA-B1 and RPT5B examined using the HA antibody (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C). The data provided additional evidence that the proteomic-based isolation and identification of specific components in the nuclear HXK1 complexes is reliable and consistent with extensive Y2H analyses (Figure 1 and Table S1).

The structure of the globular domain of Asf1 bound to H3/H4 determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.7 Å shows how Asf1 binds the H3/H4 heterodimer, enveloping the C terminus of histone H3 and physically blocking formation of the H3/H4 heterotetramer. Unexpectedly, the C terminus of histone H4 that forms a mini-β sheet with histone H2A in the nucleosome undergoes a major conformational change upon binding to Asf1 and adds a β strand to the Asf1 β sheet sandwich. Interactions with both H3 and H4 were required for Asf1 histone chaperone function in vivo and in vitro. The Asf1-H3/H4 structure suggests a “strand-capture” mechanism whereby the H4 tail acts as a lever to facilitate chromatin disassembly/assembly that may be used ubiquitously by histone chaperones.

The Asf1-H3/H4 structure suggests a “strand-capture” mechanism whereby the H4 tail acts as a lever to facilitate chromatin disassembly/assembly that may be used ubiquitously by histone chaperones. The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin is essential for normal growth, development, and differentiation. The repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle, which comprises 147 bp of DNA wound around a histone octamer (Luger et al., 1997Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). Chromatin is a dynamic structure that tightly regulates transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. In the context of these processes, the most severe alteration of chromatin structure is the removal of histone proteins from DNA (chromatin disassembly) or the deposition of histone proteins onto naked DNA (chromatin assembly). The ordered packaging of DNA into chromatin is thought to involve the initial deposition of a heterotetramer of histones H3/H4 followed by two heterodimers of histones H2A/H2B to form the nucleosome. This process is mediated by histone-chaperone proteins that regulate the association of the basic histone proteins with the DNA, which permits the nucleosome to form in an ordered and controlled manner (Akey and Luger, 2003Akey C.W. Luger K. Histone chaperones and nucleosome assembly.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Loyola and Almouzni, 2004Loyola A. Almouzni G. Histone chaperones, a supporting role in the limelight.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The histone-chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is the only histone chaperone that is implicated in both replication-dependent and replication-independent chromatin assembly (Nakatani et al., 2004Nakatani Y. Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Tagami H. Almouzni G. Two distinct nucleosome assembly pathways: dependent or independent of DNA synthesis promoted by histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Asf1 is also a critical factor in multiple other cellular processes. For example, Asf1 is a histone H3/H4 chaperone that assists chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) during the assembly of newly synthesized DNA into chromatin in vitro (Mello et al., 2002Mello J.A. Sillje H.H. Roche D.M. Kirschner D.B. Nigg E.A. Almouzni G.

Asf1 also mediates chromatin disassembly from promoters in budding yeast during transcriptional activation (Adkins et al., 2004Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K.

Asf1 mediates histone eviction and deposition during elongation by RNA polymerase II.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 415-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In fact, all non-DNA bound histones are bound to Asf1 (Groth et al., 2005Groth A. Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Lukas J. Bartek J. Almouzni G.

The function and structure of Asf1 are highly conserved among eukaryotes. The N-terminal 155 residues of Asf1 form a globular core that consists of an immunoglobulin-like fold (Daganzo et al., 2003Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Lam W.M. Skordalakes E. Zhang R. Franco A.A.

USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with highly conserved acidic patches that are predicted to mediate interactions with histone H3. The structures of histones H3 and H4 have also been determined as components of the nucleosome core particle and histone octamer (Arents et al., 1991Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. The nucleosomal core histone octamer at 3.1 Å resolution: a tripartite protein assembly and a left-handed superhelix.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). The yeast and Xenopus laevis nucleosome structures underscore the structural and functional conservation of this complex throughout evolution (White et al., 2001White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. Structure of the yeast nucleosome core particle reveals fundamental changes in internucleosome interactions.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, it is well known how the individual histones interact with each other and with DNA, but there is little information about the interaction of the histones with each other or with chaperones in the absence of DNA. As a result, the mechanisms by which the nucleosomes are assembled and disassembled are not well understood. Recently, we biophysically characterized the Asf1-H3/H4 complex and demonstrated that Asf1 binds to a heterodimer of histones H3 and H4 (English et al., 2005English C.M. Maluf N.K. Tripet B. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. ASF1 binds to a heterodimer of histones H3 and H4: A two-step mechanism for the assembly of the H3-H4 heterotetramer on DNA.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13673-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast two-hybrid analysis suggests that the C terminus of histone H3 interacts with Asf1 (Munakata et al., 2000Munakata T. Adachi N. Yokoyama N. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. A human homologue of yeast anti-silencing factor has histone chaperone activity.Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and NMR chemical-shift mapping revealed interactions of an H3 peptide (residues 122–135) with a highly conserved and acidic patch on the concave surface of Asf1 (Mousson et al., 2005Mousson F. Lautrette A. Thuret J.Y. Agez M. Courbeyrette R. Amigues B. Becker E. Neumann J.M. Guerois R. Mann C. Ochsenbein F. Structural basis for the interaction of Asf1 with histone H3 and its functional implications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This histone H3 peptide corresponds to helix 3, which is a crucial part of a four-helix bundle that forms the H3:H3 dimerization interface in the nucleosome (Luger et al., 1997Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a disruptive mutation in the middle of this H3-interacting region of Asf1, V94R, abolished the interaction with histone H3 (Mousson et al., 2005Mousson F. Lautrette A. Thuret J.Y. Agez M. Courbeyrette R. Amigues B. Becker E. Neumann J.M. Guerois R. Mann C. Ochsenbein F. Structural basis for the interaction of Asf1 with histone H3 and its functional implications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data raised the possibility that the region that mediates H3:H3 dimerization in the H3/H4 heterotetramer may also be the region of H3 that binds to Asf1. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of Asf1 bound to histones H3/H4, revealing how a histone chaperone binds histones and how the structures of H3 and H4 differ outside of the histone octamer. We have confirmed that Asf1 binds to a heterodimer of histones H3/H4 and that Asf1 not only interacts with histone H3 but also with the C-terminal tail of histone H4 in vivo and in vitro. Of interest, the C-terminal tail of H4 undergoes a major conformational change upon binding to Asf1, suggesting a mechanism by which the H4 tail may act as a handle for the assembly and disassembly of the H3/H4 heterotetramers by Asf1. In order to investigate how Asf1 interacts with histones H3 and H4, we determined the structure of the globular core of Asf1 bound to a histone H3/H4 heterodimer at a resolution of 1.7 Å (Figure 1). N-terminal truncation of the histones and coexpression of the three proteins were necessary to obtain the crystals, which contained the conserved region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Asf1 (yAsf1, 1–169) together with Xenopus laevis histones H3 (60–135) and H4 (20–102) (Figure 1A). A single Asf1-H3/H4 complex formed the asymmetric unit in the crystals, which belong to space group P3121 (Table S1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the structures of Asf1 and the histone H3/H4 dimer from the nucleosome (Figure 1B) (Daganzo et al., 2003Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Lam W.M. Skordalakes E. Zhang R. Franco A.A. Brill S.J. Adams P.D. Berger J.M. Kaufman P.D. Structure and function of the conserved core of histone deposition protein Asf1.Curr.

Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). The final refined model (Table S1) contains yAsf1 (1–164), Xenopus H3 (61–134), Xenopus H4 (21–101), solvent molecules, and ions. The overall structure of the Asf1-H3/H4 complex reveals an extensive interaction interface of Asf1 with both histones H3 and H4 (Figure 1B; Table S2). As previously described for the structures of free Asf1 (Daganzo et al., 2003Daganzo S.M. Erzberger J.P. Lam W.M. Skordalakes E. Zhang R. Franco A.A. Brill S.J. Adams P.D. Berger J.M. Kaufman P.D.

USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the core of Asf1 is an elongated β sandwich domain with three α helices in the loops between the β strands. This structure has a concave face comprising β strands β3, β4, and β6–9, with high sequence-conservation across species and a distinctly negative charge. In fact, this is the site of histone H3 binding (Figures 1C and 2). The contacts between H3 and Asf1 are extensive and result in a buried surface area of 909 Å2. The histones retain the configuration of the conserved histone fold (Luger, 2003Luger K. Structure and dynamic behavior of nucleosomes.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) with a few important exceptions. Much of the α-helical region (amino acids [aa] 60–85) of H4 is near, but not in direct contact with, Asf1 (Figure 1C). However, the C terminus of H4 forms a new β strand (H4 βC) with the core of Asf1, which creates a hydrogen bonding network connecting all three proteins, mediated by T147 of Asf1 (Figure 2). In addition, the H4 C terminus interacts with the core of Asf1 between β1 and β8 and β9, which greatly contributes to the total Asf1-H4 buried surface area of 506 Å2. Analysis of the Asf1-H3 interface reveals that the extensive interaction of histone H3 with Asf1 includes H3 α2 in addition to α3 (Figures 1B and 1C). The region of the Asf1-H3 interface that is mediated by the C-terminal helix of H3 (α3, residues 122–134) makes extensive contacts with each of the Asf1 β strands on the concave face of the protein (Figure 2A). Asf1 V94, which is an important residue for the interaction with histone H3, lies within this region, and it is clear why substituting this residue with an arginine would disrupt H3 binding (Mousson et al., 2005Mousson F. Lautrette A. Thuret J.Y. Agez M. Courbeyrette R. Amigues B. Becker E. Neumann J.M. Guerois R. Mann C. Ochsenbein F. Structural basis for the interaction of Asf1 with histone H3 and its functional implications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the extent of the contacts between Asf1 and H3 is not limited to α3 of histone H3, as was previously thought, because the C-terminal part of H3 α2 (106–115) and the loop connecting α2-α3 (aa 114–122) interact with residues in β7–9 of Asf1 (Figure 2B). Specifically, there are a number of inferred electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds that we would expect to play important roles in the stability of the Asf1-H3 complex, such as D54Asf1-R129H3, R145Asf1-D106H3, and T147Asf1-R131H3 (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1; Table S2). In addition, many van der Waals interactions also contribute to the stabilization of this complex (Table S2). We conclude that Asf1 and H3 form an extensive interface with a high degree of shape complementarity and specificity due to a large number of specific hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, and van der Waals interactions. It has been widely assumed that the interaction of Asf1 with histones H3 and H4 is mediated solely by the C-terminal helix of histone H3 (Mousson et al., 2005Mousson F. Lautrette A. Thuret J.Y. Agez M. Courbeyrette R. Amigues B. Becker E. Neumann J.M. Guerois R. Mann C. Ochsenbein F. Structural basis for the interaction of Asf1 with histone H3 and its functional implications.Proc. Natl.

A human homologue of yeast anti-silencing factor has histone chaperone activity.Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the Asf1-H3/H4 structure clearly shows that Asf1 also directly binds to histone H4. Figure 3A shows the electron density map of the C-terminal tail of H4, with F100 binding in the hydrophobic core of Asf1, to illustrate the quality of the data in this region. H4 interacts with two separate parts of Asf1. Residues in the histone-fold core of H4, specifically in α2 (Y72 and H75) and α3 (Y88), interact with Y162 in the C-terminal part of Asf1 (Figure 3B). However, these residues are also involved in significant crystal-packing contacts with symmetry-related H3 and H4 molecules, which may influence the details of the structure in this region. The more extensive and intriguing interaction between Asf1 and histone H4 occurs within the last 10 residues of the H4 protein. H4 residues 95–98 form an additional anti-parallel β strand (βC) with β9 of Asf1 through several main-chain hydrogen bonds (Figures 3B and 3C, Table S2). Within this β strand, T96H4 Oγ1 forms a hydrogen bond with T147Asf1 Oγ1 that in turn hydrogen bonds to the main chain of H3, linking all three proteins. In addition, the five final amino acids of H4 interact with Asf1 behind the newly formed β strand, inserting into a hydrophobic pocket created between β strands β1 and β9 (Figure 3C). An important contributor to this interaction is the F100 side chain of H4 (Figures 3A and 3C), which itself buries 172 Å2 of surface area, nearly 35% of the total surface area of the Asf1-H4 interface, through van der Waals interactions with Asf1 L6, V146, Y111, V109, and P144 (Figure 3C). Therefore, H4 significantly contributes to the binding of the H3/H4 dimer to Asf1 through several main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonds as well as burial of a key hydrophobic residue. Comparison of the Asf1-H3/H4 structure with the structures of free Asf1 reveals subtle conformational changes that occur in Asf1 upon binding to the H3/H4 dimer (Figure 4A). The overall root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of main-chain atoms of Asf1 in the Asf1-H3/H4 complex compared to the free proteins is 2.42 Å, 1.79 Å, and 1.42 Å for the yAsf1 structure at 2.95 Å resolution (PDB ID 1wg3 [Padmanabhan et al., 2005Padmanabhan B.

USA. 2005; 102: 5975-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar]), respectively. The largest differences between the structures occur in the loop regions, as expected for structures determined by different methods or crystallized in different space groups. However, the β3-β4 loop moves approximately 6 Å closer to H3 from its position in free Asf1 (PDB ID 1roc), and the strands β3 and β4 move nearly 2 Å away from H3 around residue D54 in β4, which together appear to facilitate the formation of the D54Asf1-R129H3 ion pair and surrounding contacts. The movements about this pivot point (D54) in β3 and β4 result in an overall less-twisted β sheet and a shift of up to 3.5 Å between β3 and β4 of Asf1 and in the associated loops (Figure 4A). However, this region of Asf1 (aa 35–77) is also involved in crystal-packing contacts with H3 (aa 60–72) and H4 (aa 20–31) of symmetry related molecules so that the significance of these structural differences is difficult to evaluate in the context of this crystal. The structural changes that take place in Asf1 to accommodate the binding of the H4 C terminus are minor. As seen in Figure 4B, which shows surface representations of Asf1 in the complex compared to free Asf1, very small structural changes occur for insertion of H4 F100 into the core of Asf1 (<0.9 Å), but these result in noticeably better shape complementarity in the complex. Although no significant changes in the backbone conformation in this region of Asf1 occur in the formation of the βCH4-β9Asf1 anti-parallel β-sheet extension, there are slight side chain movements that facilitate this interaction. For example, R145 rotates 180° about χ1 to create space for the H4 tail to enter the core of Asf1 (Figure 4C), and the side chain of R148 rotates about χ3 to further enclose the binding pocket around F100. Without these subtle changes, H4 F100 would clash with hydrophobic residues that line the cleft of the Asf1 core (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the minor adjustments that would be necessary in Asf1 for H4 binding are suggestive of a lock-and-key binding mechanism, which would be an energetically favorable interaction. In contrast, there is a profound structural change for histone H4 in the Asf1-H3/H4 complex when compared to the structure of H4 in the nucleosome core particle or histone octamer (Figures 4D–4F). Panel (E) in Figure 4 shows that the C-terminal tail of histone H4 in the nucleosome folds back over α3 of H4 and that residues 96–99 of H4 form a two-stranded parallel β sheet with residues 100–103 of histone H2A. However, in complex with Asf1, α3 in the H4 C terminus terminates one turn earlier than in the nucleosome and extends 180° in the opposite direction so that residues G94–L97 can form the anti-parallel β sheet and insert into the core of Asf1 (Figure 4D). In fact, the rmsd value for the backbone atoms of the H4 protein in the nucleosome (PDB ID 1k5x chain B) compared to the H4 protein in the Asf1-H3/H4 structure is 1.80 Å (Figures 4D–4F). This value is high for two identical proteins and is due solely to the drastic conformational change of the C terminus, with a small portion attributed to deviations at the N terminus. Specifically, the rmsd for the H4 C-terminal tail (aa 92–102) compared to nucleosomal H4 is 3.15 Å, and, without the C-terminal residues, the rmsd is 0.72 Å. Importantly, when superimposed onto the H4 protein in the nucleosome (1kx5), the octamer (1tzy), the nucleosome with H2AZ (1f66), or the nucleosome with macro H2A (1u35), all H4 proteins have the same C-terminal tail structure except for H4 bound to Asf1. The C terminus of histone H3 in the Asf1-H3/H4 complex has a slightly different structure in comparison to its structure in the nucleosome (Figures 4D–4F). In the nucleosome, α3 of H3 extends to the very end of the protein. However, when bound to Asf1, the last few residues of α3 of H3 unfold so that they do not clash with Asf1. In fact, the rmsd for the overall H3 protein is 0.94 Å, but for the residues in H3 α3 (121–134), the rmsd is higher (1.31 Å). There is also a change in the interhelical angle between α2 and α3, which can be described as a scissoring motion with an approximate decrease in the scissoring angle of 8° for H3 in the Asf1-H3/H4 complex compared with the nucleosome. A smaller scissoring motion is observed for histone H4 (Figure 4F). Thus, the histone fold exhibits some flexibility in α3 of both histones, regions that are important in the structure of the nucleosome. To assess the validity and contribution of the Asf1-H3/H4 interactions revealed by the structure, amino acid substitutions were made in the budding yeast Asf1 protein (Table 1). In order to weaken the interaction between Asf1 and H3, we made substitutions T147E, R145E, Y112A, and S48R in Asf1. The interaction between Asf1 and histone H4 was tested with mutants T147E, V109M, V146L, P144Y, L6M, and Y162A in the core of Asf1 and C-terminal tail (Figure 3). None of these Asf1 mutations significantly affected the expression level of Asf1 (Figure S2, data not shown).Table 1Summary of Phenotypes of Asf1, H3, and H4 Mutants in the Interaction InterfaceGrowthSilencingMMS ResistanceHU ResistanceZeocin ResistancePHO5 InductionASF1 WT+++++++++++++++asf1Δ+---+-Asf1 mutants:T147E+++++ndnd+++ndR145E++++/−ndnd+++ndL6M+++++ndnd+++ndV109M+++++++++++++++V146L++++++++++++++P144Y++++ndnd+++ndY112A+++++ndnd+++ndS48R++++++++++++++++V94R+---+++-Y162A++++ndnd+++ndT147E/R145E++/−--+++-Y112A/R145E+---+++-Y112A/P144Y+++++++++++ndY112A/T147E+---+-Y112A/V146L+++++++++++ndS48R/T147E+++++++++++ndS48R/R145E++-++++++S48R/P144Y+++++ndndndndH4 mutants:F100A+++-+++++++++R92A1++++∗++++-++H75Y2+++++∗++++++++Δ92-102-n/an/an/an/an/aY72G3+nd+++++++Y88G3++nd+++-++++H3 mutants:K122Q2+++-∗++++-++++K115A2++++∗+++-++K122A2+++-∗++++-++The indicated mutants were previously described in the following papers: 1(Hyland et al., 2005Hyland E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2023164168,"Voltage-gated calcium channels play a central role in regulating the electrical and biochemical properties of neurons and muscle cells. One of the ways in which calcium channels regulate long-lasting neuronal properties is by activating signaling pathways that control gene expression, but the mechanisms that link calcium channels to the nucleus are not well understood. We report that a C-terminal fragment of Ca(V)1.2, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (LTC), translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription. We show that this calcium channel associated transcription regulator (CCAT) binds to a nuclear protein, associates with an endogenous promoter, and regulates the expression of a wide variety of endogenous genes important for neuronal signaling and excitability. The nuclear localization of CCAT is regulated both developmentally and by changes in intracellular calcium. These findings provide evidence that voltage-gated calcium channels can directly activate transcription and suggest a mechanism linking voltage-gated channels to the function and differentiation of excitable cells."

Sumoylated PCNA binds Srs2, a helicase counteracting certain recombination events. Here we show that ubc9 mutants depend on checkpoint, recombination, and replication genes for growth. ubc9 cells maintain stalled-fork stability but exhibit a Rad51-dependent accumulation of cruciform structures during replication of damaged templates. Mutations in the Mms21 SUMO ligase resemble the ubc9 mutations. However, siz1, srs2, or pcna mutants altered in sumoylation do not exhibit the ubc9/mms21 phenotype. Like ubc9/mms21 mutants, sgs1 and top3 mutants also accumulate X molecules at damaged forks, and Sgs1/BLM is sumoylated. We propose that Ubc9 and Mms21 act in concert with Sgs1 to resolve the X structures formed during replication. Our results indicate that Ubc9- and Mms21-mediated sumoylation functions as a regulatory mechanism, different from that of replication checkpoints, to prevent pathological accumulation of cruciform structures at damaged forks."

Tafazzin expression induced a new enzymatic function in Sf9 cell mitochondria, namely 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:monolysocardiolipin linoleoyltransferase. We also found evidence for the reverse reaction, because tafazzin expression caused transfer of acyl groups from phospholipids to 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine. An affinity-purified tafazzin construct, tagged with the maltose-binding protein, catalyzed both forward and reverse transacylations between cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine, but was unable to utilize CoA or acyl-CoA as substrates. Whereas tafazzin supported transacylations between various phospholipid-lysophospholipid pairs, it showed the highest rate for the phosphatidylcholine-cardiolipin transacylation.

Radiochemicals—1-Palmitoyl-2-[linoleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (53 Ci/mol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[oleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (56 Ci/mol), 1-stearoyl-2-[arachidonoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine (56 Ci/mol), 1-palmitoyl-2-[linoleoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (53 Ci/mol), and 1-acyl-2-[arachidonoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylethanolamine (56 Ci/mol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [1-14C]Linoleic acid (51 Ci/mol), 1-[palmitoyl-1-14C]-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine (55 Ci/mol), and 1-[oleoyl-9,10-3H(N)]-2-lyso-phosphatidic acid (47 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using Ecoscint from National Diagnostics. Human Specimens—Cardiac tissue was excised from whole hearts after transplantation and stored at –80 °C. Lymphoblast cell lines were established by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of leukocytes isolated from whole blood using Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (50 international units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Patients with Barth syndrome had an established mutation in the tafazzin gene and presented with cardiomyopathy plus at least one non-cardiac symptom, such as neutropenia, growth retardation, or skeletal muscle weakness. Control patients had a normal tafazzin gene and presented either with idiopathic-dilated cardiomyopathy (heart tissue controls) or with unrelated neurological conditions (lymphoblast controls). Further details of the clinical protocols and approvals by institutional review boards, have been published (7Schlame M. Kelley R.I. Feigenbaum A. Towbin J.A. Heerdt P.M. Schieble T. Wanders R.J.A. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 42: 1994-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Drosophila Strains—Tafazzin mutants of Drosophila melanogaster were generated by imprecise excision of the P element insert from fly stock y[1]; P{y[+mDint2] w[BR.E.BR] = SUPor-P}tafazzin[KG02529]/SM1; ry[506] (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center) as described (10Xu Y.

Control flies were derived from the same strain by precise excision of the P element, which does not cause tafazzin deletion. A detailed characterization of the Drosophila model is given elsewhere (10Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein was mutated in fly stock y[1] w[*]; P{w[+mC] = lacW}mtacp1[j4A6]/TM6B, Tb[+] because of insertion of a P element in the first exon. Because flies homozygous for this mutation were not viable after the larval stage, all analyses of CL compositions were done in larvae. Homozygous larvae were collected under a fluorescence microscope after the stock was rebalanced with TM6B, GFP balancer. All flies were maintained in 3-inch culture vials at 22 °C on a standard cornmeal-sucrose-yeast medium. Baculovirus-Sf9 Cell Expression System—All reagents for baculovirus expression, including the Sf9 cell line and the Baculo-Gold™ TNM-FH insect medium, were purchased from BD Biosciences. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27 °C and passaged every 3 days. The cDNA encoding the full-length isoform of Drosophila tafazzin (dTAZ-RA) was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pAc-GHLT-A vector, designed to express an N-terminal GST fusion protein. Two million Sf9 cells were seeded per 60-mm cell culture dish and co-transfected with 5 μg of pAc-GHTL-A-dTAZ-RA DNA and 0.5 μg of linearized baculovirus DNA, using the BD BaculoGold transfection kit. Transfected cells were kept at 27 °C for 4 h, after which the transfection medium was removed and replaced by fresh TNM-FH medium. Transfected cells were cultured at 27 °C for several days and transfection efficiency of the supernatant was monitored. When sufficient transfection efficiency was reached, the supernatant was harvested and stored as GST-dTAZ-RA baculovirus stock solution at 4 °C until used in expression experiments. For tafazzin expression, Sf9 cells were infected with GST-dTAZ-RA baculovirus stock or with wild-type baculovirus stock as control. Cells were cultured at 27 °C for 3–4 days before isolation of subcellular fractions. Isolation of Mitochondria and Microsomes—Yeast mitochondria (16Koshkin V. Greenberg M.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and lymphoblast mitochondria (17Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated as described. Mitochondria were isolated from adult D. melanogaster and from Sf9 cells by differential centrifugation at 4 °C. Whole animals or cells were homogenized with a tight-fitting Teflon glass homogenizer in isolation buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min. Mitochondria were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 20 min. Microsomes were collected from the post-mitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Mitochondria and microsomes were washed, resuspended in a small volume of buffer, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations of subcellular fractions were determined by the method of Lowry (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were denatured by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer and then applied to 10% gels for SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a solution containing 20% methanol in Tris-glycine-SDS (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Drosophila tafazzin (10Xu Y. Condell M. Plesken H. Edelman-Novemsky I. Ma J. Ren M. Schlame M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11584-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This was followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:3500; Bio-Rad) for 2 h at room temperature. SuperSignal (Pierce) was used as peroxidase substrate. E. coli Expression and Purification of Tafazzin—The full-length cDNA of Drosophila tafazzin was inserted into the EcoRI-SaII site of the pMAL-c2 vector for expression of a protein construct consisting of tafazzin and the maltose-binding protein (MBP). BL21 E. coli cells were transformed with the vector and grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6, after which expression of MBP-tafazzin was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. Incubation was continued for 2 h at 32 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were kept frozen until they were lysed by sonication in ice-cold buffer, containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture. Membranes and cell debris were cleared from the lysate by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with amylose resin for 1 h at 4°C to bind MBP-tafazzin. The resin was collected by centrifugation, washed, and then incubated in a medium containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4), 0.01% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor either in the absence or presence of 10 mm maltose to release MBP-tafazzin. The resin was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C for enzyme assays, SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, and Western blots with the tafazzin antibody. Lipid Analytical Methods—Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated by thinlayer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates and visualized by brief exposure to iodine vapor. Individual phospholipids were identified by comparison with commercial standard compounds. One-dimensional thin-layer chromatography was carried out with the solvent chloroform-methanol-water (65:25:4). Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography was carried out with chloroform-methanol-20% ammonium hydroxide (65:30:5) in the first dimension and chloroform-acetone-methanol-acetic acid-water (50:20:10:10:5) in the second dimension. For fatty acid analysis, phospholipids were isolated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Silica gel spots were scraped off and treated overnight with 1 ml of 0.5 m HCl in methanol at 90 °C and subsequently neutralized with 1 ml of saturated sodium bicarbonate. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane, treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate, dried, and reconstituted in a few microliters of hexane. The fatty acid composition was analyzed by gas chromatography at 185 °C using an SP 2330 capillary column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and a flame ionization detector. For the analysis of molecular species, PC was isolated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, extracted from silica into chloroform-methanol (2:3) and digested by 15 units of phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus) in a two-phase system consisting of diethyl etherethanol (95:5) and aqueous buffer (0.25 m Hepes, 0.03 m boric acid, pH 7.2). The produced diacylglycerol was derivatized with 3,5-dinitrobenzoylchloride and resolved by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a Nucleosil C18 column (5-μm particles, 4.6 × 250-mm column dimension) developed with acetonitrile-2-propyl alcohol (4:1) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (20Takamura H. Narita H. Urade R. Kito M. Lipids. 1986; 21: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, the solvent was evaporated, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The composition of CL was analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. To this end, naphthyl-1-acetyl-CL dimethyl ester was produced and purified by solid-phase extraction as described before (21Schlame M. Shanske S. Doty S. Konig T. Sculco T. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1585-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transacylation Assays—The reaction mixture contained 0.1 μCi (2 nmol) of [14C]acyl-labeled phospholipid as acyl donor and 10 nmol of lysophospholipid as acyl acceptor in a total volume of 0.2 ml of buffer (10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3) equilibrated at 37 °C. Phospholipids were dried at the glass wall and re-dispersed in buffer using a sonicator bath. The reaction was started by addition of mitochondria (100 μg of protein) or MBP-tafazzin (3 μg) and terminated after 10 min by addition of 2 ml of methanol. For the measurement of endogenous transacylation activities in mitochondria from lymphoblasts, yeast, and fruit flies, the amount of mitochondrial protein was increased to 1.0 mg, 4 mm ADP was included in the reaction mixture, and the incubation time was extended to 30 min. Reactions were nearly linear under these conditions. After incubation, lipids were extracted, tracer phospholipids were added, and phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography as described above. Phospholipids were visualized on silica with iodine vapor, and the silica spots were scraped off for the measurement of radioactivity. In some experiments, free fatty acids were recovered from the solvent front, and acyl-CoA was recovered from the aqueous phase after lipid extraction. LPC Acyltransferase Assays—The reaction mixture contained 0.05 μCi (1 nmol) of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC in 0.2 ml of buffer (10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3) equilibrated at 37 °C. The reaction was started by addition of mitochondria (30 μg of protein) or MBP-tafazzin (3 μg), and it was stopped after 5 min by addition of 2 ml of methanol. In some experiments, acyl donors were added as indicated in the figure legends. When LPC:linoleoyl-CoA acyltransferase activity was measured in mitochondria, the reaction mixture also contained 50 μm linoleoyl-CoA, and the amount of protein was reduced to 5 μg. Reactions were nearly linear under these conditions. After incubation, lipids were extracted, PC was added as tracer, and phospholipids were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography as described above. PC spots were visualized on silica with iodine vapor and scraped off for the measurement of radioactivity. Data Presentation—All measurements were performed in triplicate unless indicated otherwise. Data are expressed as means and S.E. Role of Phosphopantetheine-linked Acyl Groups—Tafazzin shares an acyltransferase motif with several enzymes that use phosphopantetheine-linked acyl groups as substrate, i.e. acyl-CoA and acyl-acyl carrier protein (3Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that tafazzin catalyzes a similar reaction and expected to find a decrease in the incorporation of [14C]linoleoyl-CoA into phospholipids in patients with tafazzin deficiency. However, the incorporation of [14C]linoleoyl-CoA into PC, PE, and CL was severalfold increased in cardiac biopsies from patients with Barth syndrome (Table 1). Because this result did not confirm our hypothesis, we considered the possibility that tafazzin transfers acyl groups from or to the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (mtACP). If this was the case, significant mutations of the mtACP should affect tafazzin function, including the remodeling of CL. However, we found that insertion of a P element into the first exon of the D. melanogaster mtACP gene, did not change the molecular composition of CL, even though the mutation was lethal at the larval stage. In contrast, mutation of the tafazzin gene resulted in alteration of the CL composition (Fig. 1). The data show that tafazzin but not mtACP is essential for CL remodeling in D. melanogaster. Overall, these results do not support the idea that phosphopantetheine-linked acyl groups are substrates of tafazzin.TABLE 1Incorporation of [14C]linoleic acid into cardiac phospholipidsLysophospholipidRate of [14C]linoleoyl incorporationControlBarth syndromepmol/min/mg proteinLPC70 ± 2364 ± 38aSignificant difference between control biopsies and biopsies from patients with Barth syndrome (t test, p < 0.01, n = 4).LPE9.6 ± 2.136.2 ± 5.0aSignificant difference between control biopsies and biopsies from patients with Barth syndrome (t test, p < 0.01, n = 4).MLCL0.44 ± 0.081.38 ± 0.34aSignificant difference between control biopsies and biopsies from patients with Barth syndrome (t test, p < 0.01, n = 4).a Significant difference between control biopsies and biopsies from patients with Barth syndrome (t test, p < 0.01, n = 4). Open table in a new tab Phospholipid Transacylation in Isolated Mitochondria—Our previous study in rat liver mitochondria suggested involvement of phospholipid transacylation in cardiolipin remodeling (15Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To investigate whether tafazzin is indeed a phospholipid transacylase, we measured acyl transfer from PC to MLCL in tafazzin-deficient mitochondria from human lymphoblasts, yeast, and fruit flies. Transacylation was reduced compared with the controls, but a significant residual activity remained (Fig. 2, upper panel). We also measured LPC acyltransferase activity in these mitochondria because Testet et al. (13Testet E. Laroche-Traineau J. Noubhani A. Coulon D. Bunoust O. Camougrand N. Manon S. Lessire R. Bessoule J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) had shown that yeast tafazzin carries this function. The effect of tafazzin deficiency on LPC acyltransferase was similar to the effect on PC-CL transacylation (Fig. 2, lower panel). The data shown in Fig. 2 are consistent with the idea that tafazzin can catalyze both LPC reacylation and PC-CL transacylation. However, clear-cut conclusions could not be drawn, because both activities remained detectable in tafazzin-deficient mitochondria. To boost the tafazzin activity relative to other acyltransferases, we utilized the baculovirus-Sf9 cell expression system. To this end, we transferred cDNA of the full-length Drosophila tafazzin (dTAZ-RA) into a baculovirus and expressed the recombinant baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells. This system produced GST-tagged tafazzin and a minor band with the size of untagged tafazzin, both of which were localized in mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Tafazzin expression altered the fatty acid composition of CL in Sf9 cells (Fig. 3B). At the same time, a novel transacylase activity was induced in Sf9 mitochondria, which transferred [14C]linoleoyl residues from PC to MLCL (Fig. 4A). Tafazzin expression also caused an increase of [14C]LPC acylation activity in the absence of acyl-CoA (Fig. 4B). In contrast, tafazzin expression did not change the activity of [14C]LPC:linoleoyl-CoA acyltransferase, which was 470 ± 78 pmol/min/mg protein in control Sf9 mitochondria and 478 ± 23 pmol/min/mg protein in tafazzin-expressing Sf9 mitochondria.FIGURE 4Acyl transfer activities in Sf9 mitochondria expressing Drosophila tafazzin. Mitochondria were isolated from non-transfected Sf9 cells (NT), Sf9 cells infected with wild-type baculovirus (BacV), and Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding Drosophila tafazzin (TAZ-BacV). A, formation of [14C]CL from 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PC and MLCL. B, formation of [14C]PC from 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC. C, formation of [3H]PA from 1-[3H]oleoyl-2-lyso-PA. Conditions were the same as for B, except that 1 μCi 1-[3H]oleoyl-2-lyso-PA was added instead of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data shown in Fig. 4 suggest that Drosophila tafazzin is a phospholipid transacylase that uses PC as an acyl donor and MLCL as an acyl acceptor. The parallel expression of LPC acyltransferase activity gave the hint that this activity may be a reverse transacylation, with CL acting as acyl donor and LPC acting as acyl acceptor. To verify that CL can indeed donate acyl groups to [14C]LPC, we analyzed the effect of exogenous tetralinoleoyl-CL on the molecular composition of [14C]PC formed from [14C]LPC. When 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC was incubated with tafazzin-expressing Sf9 mitochondria in the absence of exogenous acyl donors, radiolabeled PC was found in two peaks. Peak 1 contained 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-palmitoleoyl-PC and peak 2 contained 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the endogenous fatty acid composition of Sf9 cells, where palmitoleoyl and oleoyl make up 19 ± 2 and 52 ± 3% of all phospholipid-bound acyl groups, respectively. Upon addition of exogenous tetralinoleoyl-CL, peak 1, which also harbors 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-PC, increased at the expense of peak 2, suggesting that linoleoyl groups were transferred from CL to [14C]LPC (Fig. 5B). Phospholipid Transacylation in Purified Tafazzin—To unequivocally identify substrates and products of the tafazzin reaction, we affinity-purified a tafazzin fusion protein. Because we encountered difficulties in the purification of GST-tagged tafazzin from Sf9 cells, we expressed an MBP-tagged tafazzin in E. coli and isolated it by affinity binding to amylose resin. This method yielded a nearly homogeneous preparation of the MBP-tafazzin fusion protein, which had high transacylase activity, measured either by acyl transfer from 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-PC to MLCL or by acyl transfer from CL to 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-PC (Fig. 6A). The purified enzyme was able to convert [14C]LPC into [14C]PC only in the presence of CL but not in the presence of linoleoyl-CoA (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, addition of CoA did not stimulate the transfer of acyl groups from CL to [14C]LPC (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate CoA-independent phospholipid transacylation by tafazzin. The purified enzyme transferred [14C]linoleoyl residues from [14C]PC to MLCL but not to CoA, forming [14C]CL but not [14C]linoleoyl-CoA (Fig. 6C). The formation of [14C]CL was strictly dependent on the presence of MLCL, and it was not affected by either CoA or ADP (Fig. 6C). Thus, the stimulating effect of ADP on CL remodeling, which we had observed in isolated mitochondria (15Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), was probably not mediated by tafazzin. Finally, purified tafazzin did not show phospholipase A2 activity, because it did not release [14C]linoleic acid from [14C]PC, even in the absence of an acyl acceptor (Fig. 6C). Substrate Specificity of Drosophila Tafazzin—To study the substrate specificity of Drosophila tafazzin, we incubated Sf9 mitochondria from tafazzin-expressing cells with various pairs of acyl donors and acyl acceptors. The transfer rate of linoleoyl groups from PC to MLCL was about 10-fold higher than the transfer rate of oleoyl groups, which in turn was about twice as high as the transfer rate of arachidonoyl groups (Fig. 7). The low activity of oleoyl substrates compared with linoleoyl substrates was also seen in the reverse reaction, because tetraoleoyl-CL did not donate acyl groups to [14C]LPC as effectively as tetralinoleoyl-CL (Fig. 5C). Drosophila tafazzin also catalyzed transacylations between PE and CL, between PC and PE, and between PC and PA, although these activities were much lower than the PC-CL transacylation (Fig. 7). As expected, these transacylations were reversible. For instance, we found similar acyl transfer rates with the substrate pairs [14C]PC/LPE and LPC/[14C]PE (Fig. 7). Palmitoleoyl groups were also transferred from exogenous PC to [14C]LPC (Fig. 5C), suggesting that tafazzin can reshuffle molecular species within a single phospholipid class. Transfer of palmitoleoyl groups by Drosophila tafazzin is consistent with the high abundance of palmitoleoyl in Drosophila CL (22Schlame M. Ren M. Xu Y. Greenberg M.L. Haller I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2005; 138: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To corroborate the fact that LPA is a substrate of Drosophila tafazzin, we incubated 1-[3H]oleoyl-2-lyso-PA with Sf9 mitochondria. The effect of tafazzin expression on [3H]LPA acylation was similar to the effect on [14C]LPC acylation, suggesting that tafazzin can transfer acyl groups from endogenous mitochondrial phospholipids to [3H]LPA (Fig. 4C). In this article, we demonstrate that full-length tafazzin from D. melanogaster is a phospholipid transacylase. When expressed in Sf9 cells, the enzyme gives raise to a new catalytic activity, which is the transfer of linoleoyl residues from PC to MLCL. This activity is not present in control Sf9 mitochondria (non-transfected control and wild-type-baculovirus control), either because the endogenous tafazzin activity is too low, or because Sf9 tafazzin has an acyl specificity that does not allow the transfer of linoleoyl groups (linoleoyl groups are absent from Sf9 phospholipids). The transacylation is reversible, converting LPC to PC with acyl groups derived from CL, PE, or PC. In addition, tafazzin catalyzes acyl transfer from PE to MLCL and from PC to LPA, suggesting that CL, PC, PE, PA, and perhaps other phospholipids are substrates of this enzyme. However, the activity is highest with the PC/MLCL substrate pair. Transacylase activity was confirmed in affinity-purified MBP-tafazzin. In the purified enzyme, we could show directly that acyl-CoA is not an acyl donor, and CoA is not an acyl acceptor of tafazzin. It was surprising to find transacylase activity in tafazzin, because tafazzin shares conserved motifs with several enzymes that operate with phosphopantetheine-linked substrates (3Neuwald A.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R465-R466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present data do not support any involvement of phosphopantetheine-linked acyl groups in CL remodeling, and they clearly show that Drosophila tafazzin does not possess LPC:linoleoyl-CoA acyltransferase activity. Phospholipid transacylations have been implicated in a number of cellular functions, although in most instances, the responsible enzymes have not been characterized (see Ref. 23Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar for a review). For example, phospholipid transacylation is involved in the formation of N-acyl-PE (24Natarajan V. Reddy P.V. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), bis-(monoacylglycero)-phosphate (25Amidon B. Brown A. Waite M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13995-14002Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and plasmenylethanolamine (26Kramer R.M. Deykin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13806-13811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transacylases are generally thought to be phospholipases that allow acyl transfer from an active enzyme-acyl intermediate back to a lysophospholipid, as an alternative pathway to hydrolysis (23Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This type of transacylation is a ping-pong reaction, in which the donor phospholipid and the acceptor lysophospholipid alternate at the active site. However, tafazzin does not follow this mechanism, because it does not possess any phospholipase activity, even in the absence of acyl acceptors, suggesting that the reaction does not proceed via a free enzyme-acyl intermediate. Furthermore, tafazzin is not homologous to phospholipases, but rather contains the HX4D motif that is highly conserved throughout the acyltransferase superfamily (27Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The invariant histidine in this motif is thought to deprotonate the sn-2 hydroxyl group of lysophospholipids, thereby facilitating a nucleophilic attack on the ester bond of the acyl donor (28Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this model does indeed apply to the tafazzincatalyzed transacylation, the active intermediate must be a lysophospholipid-phospholipid complex attached to the active site of the enzyme. The phospholipid specificity of Drosophila tafazzin is consistent with its role in CL remodeling, and the acyl specificity is consistent with the molecular composition of Drosophila CL, where linoleoyl and palmitoleoyl groups dominate (22Schlame M. Ren M. Xu Y. Greenberg M.L. Haller I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2005; 138: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, transacylations are near-equilibrium reactions that, for thermodynamic reasons, cannot facilitate unidirectional transfer of specific acyl residues from one phospholipid to another. To provide net transfer of fatty acids, transacylations have to be coupled to irreversible chemical reactions. Such irreversible reactions may hypothetically include the deacylation of CL and the reacylation of LPC by acyl-CoA, because these reactions convert the products of tafazzin back to its substrates (Fig. 8). According to this postulate, the net reaction of CL remodeling is the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA, which has a negative change in free energy and is thus capable to drive the remodeling process (Fig. 8). The scheme in Fig. 8 also makes reference to a number of previous observations. First, the MLCL concentration was shown to increase in tafazzin-deficient cells (9Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J.A. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 11Valianpour F. Mitsakos V. Schlemmer D. Towbin J.A. Taylor J.M. Ekert P.G.

Second, tafazzin deficiency affected the molecular composition of PC (7Schlame M. Kelley R.I. Feigenbaum A. Towbin J.A. Heerdt P.M. Schieble T. Wanders R.J.A. DiMauro S. Blanck T.J.J. J. Am. Coll.

Investig. 2005; 85: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that tafazzin plays an active role in PC remodeling. Third, CL remodeling was shown to involve acyl-selective inflow of fatty acids and non-selective outflow of fatty acids (15Xu Y. Kelley R.I. Blanck T.J.J. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51380-51385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our model in which only tafazzin has strong acyl specificity (Fig. 8). In conclusion, tafazzin is an acyl-specific transacylase that is crucial for CL remodeling. It may catalyze both the acylation of LPC with CL-derived acyl groups and the acylation of MLCL with PC-derived acyl groups. To our knowledge, tafazzin is the first CoA-independent phospholipid transacylase that has been identified. Tafazzin may also reshuffle the molecular composition of other phospholipids, because it is able to shuttle specific acyl groups between various phospholipid classes and even between different species of a single phospholipid class. This raises the question of whether multiple transcripts of the tafazzin gene, which have been identified in human (30Gonzalez I.L. Am. J. Med.

If tafazzin does indeed have multiple functions, they may affect more than one intracellular site, because the enzyme was recently found in both the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane (32Claypool S.M.

Our results suggest that entry of DNA into cohesin's ring requires transient dissociation of Smc1 and Smc3 hinge domains. By resisting spindle forces, sister-chromatid cohesion makes possible the tension that is thought to stabilize kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Cohesion depends on a highly conserved multisubunit complex called cohesin, which consists of a heterodimer formed between two SMC proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, that forms a complex with two non-SMC proteins, Scc1 and Scc3 (Nasmyth and Haering, 2005Nasmyth K. Haering C.H. The structure and function of smc and kleisin complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 595-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In yeast, cohesin is loaded onto chromosomes slightly before DNA replication with the assistance of a separate Scc2/Scc4 protein complex (Ciosk et al., 2000Ciosk R. Shirayama M. Shevchenko A. Tanaka T. Toth A. Shevchenko A. Nasmyth K. Cohesin's binding to chromosomes depends on a separate complex consisting of Scc2 and Scc4 proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Cohesin holds sister chromatids together until initiation of anaphase, when cleavage of its Scc1 subunit by separase releases cohesin from chromosomes and destroys sister-chromatid cohesion (Uhlmann et al., 2000Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E. Nasmyth K.

SMC proteins form 50 nm long intramolecular antiparallel coiled coils with a dimerization domain at one end and one half of an ABC-type ATPase (“head”) at the other (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S.

Heterotypic interaction between Smc1's and Smc3's dimerization domains creates a huge V-shaped structure with ABC ATPase heads at its two apices and dimerization domains at its central “hinge.” ATP bound to Walker A and Walker B motifs within Smc1's head binds to a signature motif within Smc3's head and vice versa, creating at least transiently a bipartite ring that hydrolyzes both ATP molecules sandwiched between its two heads (Haering et al., 2004Haering C.H.

Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Cohesin's Scc1 (kleisin) subunit binds via a C-terminal winged-helix domain to Smc1's head and via N-terminal sequences predicted to form a winged-helix or helix-turn-helix domain to the Smc3 head of the same Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer. This creates a huge tripartite ring with a diameter of about 40 nm, which is opened by cleavage of Scc1's central region by separase (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K.

Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cohesin grasps chromosomes topologically, by trapping DNA molecules inside its ring. If so, cohesin rings must either assemble de novo around chromatin fibers or (more likely) possess a gate that transiently opens to admit entry of DNA. Using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system, we show that linkage of Smc1's and Smc3's hinge domains by rapamycin-dependent dimerization of FKBP12 and Frb hinders de novo association of cohesin with DNA and blocks establishment, but not maintenance, of sister-chromatid cohesion. Our findings are consistent with the notion that DNA entry depends on transient dissociation of cohesin's Smc1 and Smc3 hinge domains. Two observations suggest that preassembled cohesin rings can associate with chromosomes. First, cohesin subunits stored in Xenopus eggs are preassembled into complexes but are nevertheless capable of associating with chromatin (Losada et al., 1998Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Identification of Xenopus SMC protein complexes required for sister chromatid cohesion.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Second, most cohesin in animal cells that dissociates from chromosomes during prophase in the absence of any cleavage by separase exists as a soluble complex during mitosis and reassociates with chromosomes during telophase (Waizenegger et al., 2000Waizenegger I. Hauf S. Meinke A. Peters J.M. Two distinct pathways remove mammalian cohesin from chromosome arms in prophase and from centromeres in anaphase.Cell. 2000; 103: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). If cohesin associates with chromosomes by trapping DNA, then its ring must have an entry gate. We envision four possibilities (Figure 1A): Scc1 dissociates transiently from the Smc1 or Smc3 head (carabiner models A and B), Scc1 dissociates transiently from both heads (the bicycle lock model), or Smc1 and Smc3 hinge domains dissociate transiently (the clothes peg model). To investigate whether Scc1's C-terminal winged-helix domain must dissociate from Smc1's ATPase head, we expressed from an ectopic chromosomal site a myc-tagged Scc1-Smc1 fusion in which Scc1's C terminus was connected to Smc1's N terminus (Figure 1B). The fusion protein was absent in cells arrested in G1 by α factor but present in cycling and nocodazole-arrested cells (Figure 1B). The latter contained only full-length (240 kDa) protein, while cycling cells also contained a 200 kDa separase fragment. Upon sporulation, diploid yeast cells heterozygous for SCC1 and SMC1 gene deletions and SCC1-SMC1 often produced tetrads in which three or four spores gave rise to colonies, some of which contained deletions of both SCC1 and SMC1 (Figure 1C). Strains that expressed the Scc1-Smc1 fusion protein but neither Scc1 nor Smc1 grew at 30°C (Figure 1D) and 37°C (data not shown). If the Scc1-Smc1 fusion were only functional because its Scc1 moiety bound to a Smc1 head from a separate fusion protein, then cells should remain sensitive to overexpression of Scc1's C-terminal cleavage fragment (CScc1), which competes with full-length Scc1 (Rao et al., 2001Rao H. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Varshavsky A. Degradation of a cohesin subunit by the N-end pathway is essential for chromosome stability.Nature. 2001; 410: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Fusion of Scc1 to Smc1 in fact overrides toxicity caused by CScc1 (Figure 1E). Scc1 must therefore interact with the Smc1 protein to which it is fused. This was confirmed by the finding that the fusion suppresses the temperature sensitivity (data not shown) caused by a mutation (Q544K) in Scc1's C-terminal winged-helix domain that reduces its affinity for Smc1's head (Haering et al., 2004Haering C.H. Schoffnegger D. Nishino T. Helmhart W. Nasmyth K. Lowe J. Structure and stability of cohesin's Smc1-kleisin interaction.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Scc1's detachment from Smc1's ATPase head cannot be necessary for generating sister-chromatid cohesion. To explore whether detachment of Scc1's N terminus from Smc3's head is necessary, Smc3's C terminus was connected to Scc1's N terminus. Spores expressing Smc3-Scc1 instead of individual Smc3 and Scc1 proteins also formed colonies (Figures 1F and 1G). This fusion is not fully functional, as cells grow more slowly than wild-type at 37°C (data not shown). Importantly, fusion of Scc1 to Smc3 but not to Smc1 suppressed the lethality (data not shown) caused by mutations (I24K, A47K, V81K, and D92K) in Scc1's N terminus that reduce its interaction with Smc3's head (Arumugam et al., 2006Arumugam P. Nishino T. Haering C.H. Gruber S. Nasmyth K. Cohesin's ATPase activity is stimulated by the C-terminal winged-helix domain of its kleisin subunit.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1998-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), implying that the fusion's Scc1 moiety binds to the Smc3 head with which it is joined. We conclude that detachment of Scc1's N terminus from Smc3's ATPase head is not necessary for cohesin function. To exclude the possibility that Scc1 detaches from both Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase heads, we created a Smc3-Scc1-Smc1 fusion protein. This protein was not functional even in the presence of TEV protease that cleaves the peptide sequences connecting Scc1 with Smc3 and Smc1. This could be for trivial reasons. The fusion might not fold correctly due to topological problems (see Figure S5 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), and/or, due to its length, it might not be expressed rapidly enough at the onset of S phase. We therefore used rapamycin-dependent dimerization of human FKBP12 and Frb to link Scc1 to Smc1 in a conditional manner (Ho et al., 1996Ho S.N. Biggar S.R. Spencer D.M. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Dimeric ligands define a role for transcriptional activation domains in reinitiation.Nature. 1996; 382: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) in a cohesin ring containing a Smc3-Scc1 fusion protein (Figure 2C). For these experiments, we used yeast strains carrying the TOR1-1 mutation, which confers rapamycin resistance, and a deletion of the FPR1 gene, which eliminates the most abundant yeast FKBP12-like protein and reduces binding of “free” yeast FBKP12-like proteins to the Frb moiety fused to Scc1. Fusion of human FKBP12 to Smc1's C terminus, fusion of Frb to Scc1's C terminus, and the presence of both fusions all failed to affect yeast growth in either the absence or presence of 100 nM rapamycin (Figure 2A). Interestingly, when cells expressed both Smc1-FKBP12 and Scc1-Frb, rapamycin suppressed the lethality caused by two scc1 mutations (S525N and Q544K) that weaken its binding to Smc1's head (Figure 2B), implying that rapamycin does indeed induce connection of Scc1 with Smc1. The N terminus of the Scc1-Frb fusion protein was next fused to Smc3's C terminus. Cells expressing this Smc3-Scc1-Frb fusion along with Smc1-FKBP12 (as the sole sources of Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1) were viable in absence of rapamycin and even formed colonies in its presence, albeit more slowly than in its absence (Figure S1A). Importantly, introduction of the scc1 Q544K mutation created a strain that grew only in the presence of rapamycin (Figure S1B). To investigate the effect of this alteration in cohesin's topology on sister-chromatid cohesion, we synchronized cells in G1 by growing unbudded cells isolated by centrifugal elutriation in the presence of α factor and then transferred them to fresh medium with or without rapamycin. Neither DNA replication nor the onset of nuclear division was affected by rapamycin (Figure S1C). This suggests that the drug did not greatly compromise establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion because a major defect would have activated the spindle assembly checkpoint and delayed degradation of securin by 20–30 min (Michaelis et al., 1997Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cohesins: Chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids.Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Separate aliquots of the synchronized cells were released (with and without rapamycin) into medium containing nocodazole, which blocks nuclear division. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that sister CEN4 sequences were split in 24% of cells in the absence of rapamycin (Figure 2D), which is more frequent than in wild-type. Crucially, rapamycin caused only a very modest increase in the frequency of split CEN4 sequences, from 24 to 28% (Figure 2D). To ensure that this protocol could have detected deleterious effects of a rapamycin-mediated interconnection, we repeated these experiments with a yeast strain in which FKBP12 and Frb interconnect Smc1's and Smc3's hinge domains in the presence of rapamycin (see below). Rapamycin both delayed nuclear division by 20 min (Figure S1D) and caused the frequency of split CEN4 sequences to rise from 12 to 49% (Figure 2D). These data imply that hindering a hypothetical disconnection of Scc1's C terminus from Smc1's ATPase head has no major deleterious effect on cohesin's ability to establish sister-chromatid cohesion, even when its N terminus is fused to Smc3's ATPase head. To test whether blocking dissociation of Scc1 from SMC heads has any effect on cohesin's association with chromosomes, we used quantitative PCR to measure association of a myc-tagged Scc3 subunit with specific DNA sequences following chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Some Scc3 was associated with chromatin in G1 synchronized cells, which was unexpected. A similar result was also obtained with wild-type cells (data not shown). More important, the increase in Scc3's association with centromeric and pericentric sequences as cells enter S phase was unaffected by rapamycin (Figure 2E). Thus, connecting Smc3-Scc1-Frb with Smc1-FKBP12 using rapamycin has little discernable effect on cohesin's ability to load onto chromosomes. These data are difficult to reconcile with the bicycle lock model. We next addressed whether dissociation of cohesin's hinge domains is necessary. If their sole function were to hold Smc1 and Smc3 together, then it should be possible to replace them by a different pair of heterodimer-forming protein domains. This would not be possible if SMC hinges also served as DNA entry gates. To test whether candidate heterodimers were capable of keeping cohesin rings closed tightly enough to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion, we inserted into Scc1's central region pairs of protein domains connected by three tandem TEV protease cleavage sites (Figure 3A) and measured whether TEV protease induction (from the GAL promoter) would trigger nuclear division in cells arrested in metaphase due to Cdc20 depletion. Tightly interacting protein pairs should hold N- and C-terminal Scc1 cleavage fragments together and block sister-chromatid disjunction. Cells in which FKBP12 and Frb flanked TEV sites underwent anaphase as efficiently as cells lacking these domains in the absence of rapamycin, whereas in its presence, the onset of anaphase was delayed by about 30 min but was not blocked (data not shown). The dissociation constant of FKBP12 and Frb in the presence of rapamycin is in the low nanomolar range, but the half-life of the complex is relatively short (τ ≈ 30 s) (Banaszynski et al., 2005Banaszynski L.A. Liu C.W. Wandless T.J. Characterization of the FKBP.rapamycin.FRB ternary complex.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 4715-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the complex is not stable enough to resist spindle pulling forces over extended periods of time. Two tandem copies of FKBP12 and Frb were capable of resisting anaphase onset in the presence of rapamycin (data not shown), but such a combination could not be used to replace Smc1 and Smc3 hinges. We next tested a pseudosymmetric protein complex consisting of MP1 and p14 (τ ≈ 20 min) (Kurzbauer et al., 2004Kurzbauer R. Teis D. de Araujo M.E. Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber F. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. Huber L.A. Clausen T. Crystal structure of the p14/MP1 scaffolding complex: how a twin couple attaches mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling to late endosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 10984-10989Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This complex blocked sister-chromatid disjunction despite complete Scc1 cleavage (Figure 3A) but did not do so after activation of separase (Figure 3A, +Cdc20), which cleaves to the left and right of MP1 and p14. Remarkably, cells with MP1 and p14 surrounding TEV sites proliferated vigorously upon continuous TEV protease induction (Figure 3B). We conclude that the MP1/p14 complex holds N- and C-terminal halves of Scc1 together in a manner stable enough to support mitosis. An important corollary is that disconnection of Scc1's N-terminal half from its C-terminal half rather than cleavage of Scc1 per se destroys sister-chromatid cohesion. Structural information (Figure 4A) about the MP1/p14 complex (PDB ID code 1VET) and the bacterial homodimeric SMC hinge (PDB ID code 1GXL) was used to design eight different hybrids that varied in the transition between Smc1's N-terminal amphipathic α helix and the p14 domain and between p14 and Smc1's C-terminal amphipathic α helix. Western blotting following immunoprecipitation showed that two Smc1p14 hybrids (myc9-tagged) interacted with Scc1 (Pk6-tagged) as efficiently as a hingeless version of Smc1 that, like Smc1p14, has no SMC binding partner (data not shown). Efficient binding of Scc1 implies that the ATPase heads of the hybrid proteins are folded correctly. The other six hybrids interacted with Scc1 only poorly (data not shown). We then replaced Smc3's hinge domain by mouse MP1. Five different HA3-tagged Smc3MP1 hybrids were introduced into a yeast strain expressing a Pk6-tagged version of Scc1 (Scc1-Pk6) and one of the “good” myc9-tagged Smc1p14 hybrids. Three out of five Smc3MP1 hybrid proteins coprecipitated with both Scc1 and Smc1p14 with an efficiency comparable to that between Smc3 and Scc1 or Smc3 and Smc1 (data not shown). In all three cases, dimerization between Smc3MP1 and Smc1p14 increased the efficiency with which Scc1 bound to Smc1p14 (data not shown). These data imply that Smc1p14 forms a heterodimer with Smc3MP1 and that Scc1's C-terminal winged helix binds to Smc1's ATPase head. To test whether Scc1's N terminus binds to the Smc3 head of the hinge-substituted SMC dimer (hsSMC), we expressed either wild-type Smc1/Smc3 or hinge-substituted versions in cells that express a TEV-cleavable version of Scc1 that is tagged at both N and C termini with myc epitopes (Figure 4B) (Arumugam et al., 2003Arumugam P. Gruber S. Tanaka K. Haering C.H. Mechtler K. Nasmyth K. ATP hydrolysis is required for cohesin's association with chromosomes.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1941-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitated HA3-tagged Smc3 or Smc3MP1 proteins were either directly boiled in SDS buffer (IP) or incubated with or without TEV protease for 45 min at 16°C, liberating some protein into the supernatant (SN) but leaving some associated with the beads (B). Smc3 and Smc3MP1 as well as their respective partners Smc1 and Smc1p14 remained bound to the beads even after TEV protease treatment (Figure 4B, middle and right panels). Both full-length Scc1 (1–566) and its N-terminal separase cleavage fragment (1–180) were collected on the beads by HA3-tagged Smc3 (middle panel) and Smc3MP1 (right panel) proteins with equal efficiency but not by untagged Smc3 protein (left panel). The C-terminal separase cleavage fragment (180–566) is more unstable, and less was detected with both sets of SMC proteins. Cleavage of Scc1 by TEV generates a novel set of cleavage fragments, namely an N-terminal (1–268) and a C-terminal (269–566) fragment. Crucially, both fragments remained on the beads, whether they contained Smc3 or Smc3MP1. These observations indicate that Scc1's N-terminal and C-terminal domains associate with the Smc3 and Smc1 heads respectively, forming tripartite rings, even when the Smc1/Smc3 hinge has been replaced by MP1/p14. We next tested whether the ATPase heads of Smc1p14/Smc3MP1 heterodimers can hydrolyze ATP. Scc1's C-terminal winged-helix domain stimulates the ATPase activity of purified SMC heterodimers in vitro (Arumugam et al., 2006Arumugam P. Nishino T. Haering C.H. Gruber S. Nasmyth K. Cohesin's ATPase activity is stimulated by the C-terminal winged-helix domain of its kleisin subunit.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1998-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and hinge-substituted SMC preparations had very low ATP hydrolysis activities on their own (Figure 4C, black lines), but addition of Scc1's C-terminal domain enhanced the activities of both samples (red lines). Importantly, mutation of Smc3MP1's ATP binding pocket (K38I) abolished the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by Scc1. These data imply that the Smc1 and Smc3 heads of hinge-substituted heterodimers are folded properly and cooperate to hydrolyze ATP in a manner similar to wild-type Smc1/Smc3 heterodimers. Tetrad dissection of asci from diploids heterozygous for SMC1 and SMC3 deletions showed that ectopic hinge-substituted SMC genes could not support growth of spores lacking endogenous SMC1 and SMC3 genes (Figure S6A). To address whether hsSMCs are loaded onto chromosomes in vivo, we analyzed chromosome spreads from nocodazole-arrested cells. Smc1-myc9, but very little Smc1p14-myc9, colocalized with DAPI-staining material (Figure S6B). To measure this more quantitatively, we used real-time PCR and ChIP to detect association with four loci on chromosome VI. Smc1-myc9 protein precipitated about 1.5% to 2.5% of the input material at two pericentric loci (MSH4 and SPB4), at the centromere (CEN6), and at a cohesin-rich arm site (MET10-SMC2) (Figure 4D, middle). In contrast, Smc1p14-myc9 precipitated few, if any, of these sequences (Figure 4D). We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitations with antibodies against an HA3 epitope tag on Smc3 and Smc3MP1 and hybridized the immunoprecipitated DNA to a tiled oligonucleotide array representing the entire length of chromosome VI (Figure 4E). This confirmed that wild-type Smc3 protein accumulates at centromeric and pericentromeric DNA sequences as well as at specific sites along the chromosome arms. This pattern was not observed with Smc3MP1 protein, which did not precipitate any specific region of chromosome VI (Figure 4E, bottom panel). We conclude that hsSMC proteins do not associate stably with chromosomes despite being transported normally into the nucleus (data not shown). This implies that the hinge domains of Smc1 and Smc3 have a role in cohesin's association with chromosomes that extends beyond merely holding Smc1 and Smc3 together. Having excluded DNA entry through a gate created by dissociation of Scc1 from cohesin's ATPase heads, hinge opening would appear to be the only realistic alternative. According to this notion, the MP1/p14 interaction cannot substitute for the Smc1/Smc3 hinge because the former cannot be opened in a manner that permits DNA entry. This hypothesis makes the key prediction that interconnection of Smc1 and Smc3 hinges by artificial means should hinder trapping of DNA by cohesin and, as a consequence, should destroy its ability to establish sister-chromatid cohesion. We therefore asked whether it is possible to insert FKBP12 and Frb into Smc1 and Smc3 hinges respectively without compromising cohesin function and, if so, whether the interconnection of FKBP12 and Frb by rapamycin inactivates cohesin. The hinge domains of cohesin, condensin, and most bacterial SMC proteins are highly conserved throughout their entire length. There nevertheless exist short stretches whose amino acid sequences and length are variable. Such regions form loops on the surface of the Thermotoga maritima Smc crystal structure with a high temperature factor that is indicative of structural flexibility. This raises the possibility of inserting the small globular domains of FKBP12 and Frb into one or another of these loops without greatly altering the overall structure of the SMC hinge domain. Remarkably, insertion of FKBP12 via 10 amino acid long linker peptides into Smc1's hinge domain at two out of three positions (Figure 5A, pink arrows) did not compromise Smc1's function. Likewise, insertion of Frb at analogous positions within Smc3's hinge (purple arrows) did not perturb the function of Smc3. Even more remarkable, certain combinations of Smc1FKBP12 and Smc3Frb hybrids produced functional Smc1/Smc3 heterodimers. Thus, a heterodimer formed between Smc1 with FKBP12 inserted at position L597 (horizontal pink arrow) and Smc3 with Frb inserted at position S606 (horizontal purple arrow) supported wild-type-like growth of yeast colonies at 30°C (Figure 5B, left panel) and 37°C (data not shown). To test the sensitivity of this SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb strain to rapamycin, we introduced the TOR1-1 mutation to confer rapamycin-resistant growth and a deletion of FPR1 (Δfpr1) to minimize binding of Frb to rapamycin bound to yeast FKBP12-like proteins. One hundred nanomolar rapamycin inhibited the growth of SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb cells (Fk + Fr), but not that of wild-type (WT), SMC1FKBP12 (Fk), or SMC3Frb strains (Fr) (Figure 5B, right panel), implying that interaction between FKBP12 inserted into Smc1's hinge and Frb inserted into Smc3's hinge does indeed inactivate cohesin function. We observed a similar effect when FKBP12 was inserted into Smc1 at position I647 (vertical pink arrow) instead of position L597 (data not shown). It is possible that the rapamycin-dependent lethality is caused not by the interconnection of Smc1 and Smc3 half-hinges per se but rather by the formation of a bulky Frb-rapamycin-FKBP12 complex in their vicinity. To exclude this possibility, we tested whether the rapamycin-dependent lethality is suppressed by the presence of yeast Fpr1, whose complexes with rapamycin should compete with rapamycin-FKBP12 complexes associated with Smc1 for binding to Smc3Frb. Crucially, the presence of Fpr1 fully relieved the inhibition by rapamycin of SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb cell growth (Figure 5C). If Fpr1 suppressed lethality merely by titrating rapamycin, then increasing the drug concentration would kill cells. This is not the case. SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb TOR1-1 cells lacking Fpr1 are sensitive to 10 nM rapamycin, while cells containing Fpr1 are completely resistant to 10 μM rapamycin (Figure S4). Moreover, Fpr1 is only about ten times more abundant than Smc1 (Newman et al., 2006Newman J.R. Ghaemmaghami S. Ihmels J. Breslow D.K. Noble M. DeRisi J.L. Weissman J.S. Single-cell proteomic analysis of S. cerevisiae reveals the architecture of biological noise.Nature. 2006; 441: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). To test whether rapamycin perturbs establishment of sister-chromatid cohesion in SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb cells, we measured association of sister DNA sequences at the URA3 locus 35 kb away from CEN5 that were marked by green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Michaelis et al., 1997Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cohesins: Chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids.Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). MATa SMC1FKBP12 SMC3Frb cells whose APC/C activator Cdc20 was under the control of the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter were first arrested in G1 phase by addition of α factor and then released in the presence or absence of rapamycin into medium supplemented with methionine, which allowed one synchronous round of DNA replication followed by arrest in metaphase"
https://openalex.org/W2004351764,"The heterodimeric tumor-suppressor complex BRCA1/BARD1 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and participates in cell proliferation and chromosome stability control by incompletely defined mechanisms. Here we show that, in both mammalian cells and Xenopus egg extracts, BRCA1/BARD1 is required for mitotic spindle-pole assembly and for accumulation of TPX2, a major spindle organizer and Ran target, on spindle poles. This function is centrosome independent, operates downstream of Ran GTPase, and depends upon BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Xenopus BRCA1/BARD1 forms endogenous complexes with three spindle-pole proteins, TPX2, NuMA, and XRHAMM--a known TPX2 partner--and specifically attenuates XRHAMM function. These observations reveal a previously unrecognized function of BRCA1/BARD1 in mitotic spindle assembly that likely contributes to its role in chromosome stability control and tumor suppression."

Endogenous guanidinomethylated arginines (MAs), including asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and NG-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), are released in cells upon protein degradation and are competitive inhibitors of eNOS. However, it is unknown whether intracellular MA concentrations reach levels sufficient to regulate endothelial NO production. Therefore, the dose-dependent effects of ADMA and l-NMMA on eNOS function were determined. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the Km for l-arginine is 3.14 μm with a Vmax of 0.14 μmol mg–1 min–1, whereas Ki values of 0.9 μm and 1.1 μm were determined for ADMA and l-NMMA, respectively. EPR studies of NO production from purified eNOS demonstrated that, with a physiological 100 μm level of l-arginine, MA levels of >10μm were required for significant eNOS inhibition. Dose-dependent inhibition of NO formation in endothelial cells was observed with extracellular MA concentrations as low 5 μm. Similar effects were observed in isolated vessels where 5 μm ADMA inhibited vascular relaxation to acetylcholine. MA uptake studies demonstrated that ADMA and l-NMMA accumulate in endothelial cells with intracellular levels greatly exceeding extracellular concentrations. l-Arginine/MA ratios were correlated with cellular NO production. Although normal physiological levels of MAs do not significantly inhibit NOS, a 3- to 9-fold increase, as reported under disease conditions, would exert prominent inhibition. Using a balloon model of vascular injury, ∼4-fold increases in cellular MAs were observed, and these caused prominent impairment of vascular relaxation.

It was subsequently realized that these effects were mediated through inhibition of NO release (1Hibbs Jr., J.B. Vavrin Z. Taintor R.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 550-565PubMed Google Scholar). NO has been demonstrated as a critical effector molecule in the maintenance of vascular function (2Arnold W.P. Mittal C.K. Katsuki S. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the vasculature, NO is derived from the oxidation of l-Arg, catalyzed by the constitutively expressed enzyme, eNOS (5Hecker M. Walsh D.T. Vane J.R.

This endothelial-derived NO diffuses from the vascular endothelium into the smooth muscle cell layer where it activates soluble guanylate cyclase leading to smooth muscle relaxation (2Arnold W.P.

NO, in concert with various cell signaling molecules, has been demonstrated to maintain smooth muscle cell quiescence and as such, counteracts pro-proliferative agents, specifically those involved in the propagation of athero-proliferative disorders (8Cooke J.P.

As such, eNOS dysfunction is an early symptom of vascular disease and is manifested through insufficient NO bioavailability. Several potential causes of NO deficiency in disease settings have been proposed. Among these, high circulating levels of the endogenous methylarginine NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) has been hypothesized to be of particular importance (15Boger R.H. Sydow K.

Physiol. 2004; 287: F25-F32Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In neurons and the brain, it has been shown that the methyl arginine l-NMMA is also present, however, the levels of this methylarginine have not been previously considered in studies evaluating vascular dysfunction (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ADMA and l-NMMA are endogenous inhibitors of NOS and are derived from the proteolysis of methylated arginine residues on various proteins. The methylation is carried out by a group of enzymes referred to as protein-arginine methyltransferase (23Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Subsequent proteolysis of proteins containing methylarginine groups leads to the release of free methylarginine into the cytoplasm, and if sufficient levels are reached NO production from NOS would be inhibited (24MacAllister R.J. Fickling S.A. Whitley G.S. Vallance P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Vallance P. Leone A. Calver A. Collier J. Moncada S. Lancet. 1992; 339: 572-575Abstract PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). To date, six different isoforms of the enzyme have been identified with each subtype exhibiting various levels of activity, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution (23Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 26Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These methylarginines are subsequently degraded by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ADMA or l-NMMA to l-citrulline and dimethylamine or monomethylamine (27Achan V. Tran C.T. Arrigoni F. Whitley G.S. Leiper J.M. Vallance P. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Ito A. Tsao P.S. Adimoolam S. Kimoto M. Ogawa T. Cooke J.P.

Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1593-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In support of the role of ADMA and l-NMMA as endogenous inhibitors of NOS function, several studies have demonstrated that l-Arg supplementation enhances endothelial function through increased NO bioavailability (30Aji W. Ravalli S. Szabolcs M. Jiang X.C. Sciacca R.R. Michler R.E. Cannon P.J. Circulation. 1997; 95: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Boger R.H. Bode-Boger S.M. Brandes R.P.

This effect could be due to increased substrate availability. However, when one takes into consideration that the intracellular levels of l-Arg are typically >50 times higher than the Km of the enzyme, increased NO generation would not be expected with l-Arg supplementation (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This observation of increased NO bioavailability with l-Arg supplementation has been termed the “arginine paradox.” One hypothesis put forth to explain this paradox is that l-Arg supplementation overcomes the endogenous inhibitory actions of cellular methylarginines (8Cooke J.P. Oka R.K. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2001; 3: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Leiper J. Vallance P. Cardiovasc.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, questions remain as to whether normal physiological levels of these endogenous NOS inhibitors, or the increased levels occurring in disease, significantly inhibit NOS activity inducing vascular dysfunction. Therefore, studies were performed to determine endothelial methylarginine levels and the dose-dependent effects of cellular methylarginines on eNOS-derived NO formation and vascular function. eNOS Purification—Human eNOS was expressed in yeast using a Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen) and purified as previously described (37Du M. Yeh H.C. Berka V. Wang L.H. Tsai A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6002-6011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All eNOS preparations were stored in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 m NaCl. Because full-length human eNOS expressed in yeast has a very low biopterin content, eNOS-BH4 was prepared by anaerobic incubation of purified protein with 1 mm BH4 overnight at 4 °C. Excess BH4 was removed by gel filtration through a 30- × 1.5-cm column of Bio-Gel P-6DG (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. Protein fractions were pooled, concentrated by Centriprep 30 (Amicon), and stored under liquid nitrogen. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Cell-Systems and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. EPR Spectroscopy and Spin Trapping—Spin-trapping measurements of NO were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer with Fe2+·MGD as the spin trap (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Xia Y. Cardounel A.J. Vanin A.F. Zweier J.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For enzyme studies, the reaction mixture consisted of 10 μg/ml purified eNOS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm calmodulin, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and 100 μm l-Arg. The samples (0.6 ml) were loaded into a quartz flat cell, and EPR spectra were measured at the X-band in a TM110 cavity. The Fe2+·MGD complex (0.25 mm Fe2+ and 2.5 mm MGD) was used to trap NO. For measurements of NO produced by BAECs, cells were cultured as described above, and spin-trapping experiments were performed on the media of cells grown in 35-mm dishes. Attached cells were studied because scraping or enzymatic removal leads to injury and membrane damage with impaired NO generation. The media from ∼1.0 × 106 cells attached to the surface of 35-mm dishes was removed, and the cells were washed three times in PBS (without CaCl2 or MgCl2) and incubated in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's PBS containing glucose (1000 mg/liter) and pyruvate 36 mg/liter (PBS, Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. To 0.5 ml of this PBS solution, the NO spin trap Fe2+·MGD (0.5 mm Fe2+, 5.0 mm MGD) was added, and the cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore (5 μm). Subsequent measurements of the effects of methylarginines on NO production were performed following a 30-min incubation period. Spectra recorded from either enzyme or cellular preparations were obtained using the following parameters: microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 3.16 G; and modulation frequency, 100 kHz. Oxyhemoglobin Assay—The initial rate of NO production was quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the formation of methemoglobin (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This method is based on the rapid reaction of NO with oxyhemoglobin to form methemoglobin and NO3- with an accompanying increase in differential absorbance at 401–411 nm (ϵ401–411 = 38 mm–1). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on 96-well plates and read using a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Reactions were carried out in 100 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm calmodulin, 10 μm BH4, 200 μm NADPH, 150 μm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm oxyhemoglobin. Each reaction mixture contained 30 μg/ml of purified eNOS and was initiated by the addition of substrate. Fitting of experimental points for the rate measurements were performed using a best-fit polynomial generated using Table Curve software (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). The increase in NO formation as measured by the differential absorbance at 401–411 nm remained linear for the first 2 min. Km and Vmax values were derived using the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1), and Ki values were determined using multiple inhibitor concentrations with initial rates plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration and fit using the equation for competitive inhibition (Equation 2) (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). V0=Vmax[S]/(Km+S)(Eq. 1) V0=Vmax[S]/(Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S])(Eq. 2) HPLC—BAECs were collected from confluent 75-mm culture flasks and sonicated in PBS followed by extraction using a cation-exchange column. Samples were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde and separated on a Supelco LC-DABS column (4.6 mm × 25 cm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size), and l-Arg and methylarginines were separated and detected using an ESA (Chelmsford, MA) HPLC system with electrochemical detection at 400 mV. Homoarginine was added to the homogenate as an internal standard to correct for the efficiency of extraction. The mobile phase consisted of buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0) and buffer B (ACN/MeOH 70:30) run at room temperature with a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. The following gradient method was used: 0–10 min with 90% A, and then 10–40 min with a linear gradient from 90% A to 30% A (22Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 318: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of l-Arg and methylarginines were determined from values derived from standard curves of each analyte using the ESA peak integration software assuming intracellular water content of 2 pl (40Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). ADMA and l-NMMA Uptake—BAEC uptake of ADMA was determined with HPLC measurements of washed cellular homogenate. BAECs were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes. Prior to uptake measurements, the cells were washed three times in HEPES-Krebs and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 min in buffer containing ADMA or l-NMMA (0.5–50 μm). Following the incubation period, the buffer was removed, and the cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Following the final wash, the cells were scraped in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g, 5 min, 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of water, sonicated, and extracted using a cation-exchange column as previously described. l-Arg, ADMA, and l-NMMA levels were determined using HPLC. Vascular Reactivity—Contraction and relaxation of isolated carotid rings were measured in an organ bath containing modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (118 mm NaCl, 24 mm Na2HCO3, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 4.6 mm HEPES, and 18 mm glucose) aerated with 95% CO2/5% O2, 37 °C. Carotid rings were cut into 2- to 3-mm segments and mounted on a wire myograph (Danish Myo, Aarhus, Denmark). Contraction was measured via a force transducer interfaced with Chart software for data analysis. Following a 30-min equilibration period, the rings were stretched to generate a tension of 1.0 g. The optimum resting force of the aortic rings was determined by comparing the force developed by 40 mm KCl under varying resting force. The dose-dependent effects of ADMA (1–500 μm) on vascular relaxation were measured in the presence and absence of l-Arg (100 μm). Carotid rings were preconstricted with 1 μm phenylephrine. The vascular relaxation response was determined using increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (0.1 nm to 10 μm). Carotid Injury—Male Wistar rats, weighing 400–450 g (Harlan), were fed standard pellet feed and given water ad libitum. The experimental protocol was designed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards. Animals were anesthetized with Isoflurane (1.5–2%) in air. The right carotid artery was exposed, and a 2F Fogarty balloon embolectomy catheter (Baxter) was inserted via an external carotid arteriotomy incision. The catheter was advanced to the common carotid artery, inflated to a pressure of 2 atm, and rotated in a forward and retrograde direction. The catheter was then deflated, and the process was repeated three times. At 28 days post-injury the vessels were harvested, and endothelial function was assessed by measuring vascular reactivity. The data represent the mean ± S.D. Measurement of Kinetic Parameters of eNOS Inhibition—Enzyme kinetic studies were performed to establish the Ki for each of the methylarginine analogues studied. NO formation was measured using the oxyhemoglobin conversion assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Km and Vmax values were derived using the Michaelis-Menten equation and generated values of 3.14 μm and 0.14 μmol/mg/min, respectively (Fig. 1A). The Ki values were determined using multiple inhibitor concentrations with initial rates plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration and fit using the equation for competitive inhibition (Fig. 1, B and C). The Ki for ADMA was determined to be 0.9 μm and for l-NMMA 1.1 μm. Concentration Dependence of ADMA and l-NMMA-mediated Inhibition of NO Production—EPR studies were carried out to determine the dose-dependent inhibition of both ADMA and l-NMMA upon NO formation from eNOS. Purified eNOS was incubated in reaction buffer containing 100 μm l-Arg as substrate together with either ADMA (0–500 μm) or l-NMMA (0–500 μm), and total NO production was measured over a 30-min period. Results from these studies demonstrated that ADMA dose dependently inhibited NO formation with 19% inhibition observed at 10 μm ADMA and a maximum of 86% inhibition at 500 μm ADMA (Fig. 2A). Similar inhibitory effects were observed with l-NMMA, demonstrating 17% inhibition at 10 μm l-NMMA and 90% at 500 μm (Fig. 2B). Intrinsic methylarginine levels in endothelial cells and plasma were then measured to establish normal physiological ADMA and l-NMMA concentrations. Results demonstrated the levels of l-Arg, ADMA, and l-NMMA in plasma to be 62.7 μm ± 18, 0.33 μm ± 0.1, and 0.31 μm ± 0.1, respectively. Studies from BAECs cultured in serum demonstrated l-Arg, ADMA, and l-NMMA levels to be 151 μm ± 34, 3.6 μm ± 1.0, and 2.9 μm ± 0.8, respectively. These studies suggest that, under normal physiological conditions, endogenous methylarginines would only exert modest effects on endothelial cell NO production. However, because methylarginine levels have been shown to be increased 3- to 9-fold under various pathological conditions, we examined the effects of increased cellular ADMA and l-NMMA levels on endothelial cell-derived NO production (41Boger R.H. Maas R. Schulze F. Schwedhelm E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2005; 43: 1124-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Effects of ADMA and NMMA on Endothelial Cell NO Production—Cellular studies were carried out using BAECs stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm). EPR-based NO measurements were performed in modified PBS (1 mm CaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml glucose, 0.5 mm Fe2+, and 5 mm MGD) with or without l-Arg. The dose-dependent effects of ADMA (0–100 μm) and l-NMMA (0–100 μm) were then measured. Results demonstrated that ADMA dose dependently inhibited eNOS-derived NO generation with 5 μm ADMA eliciting 38% inhibition and 100 μm ADMA, exhibiting 74% inhibition in the absence of added l-Arg (Fig. 3A). These inhibitory effects were less pronounced when the studies were performed in the presence of l-Arg. Nevertheless, in the presence of physiologically relevant l-Arg levels (100 μm), ADMA elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of BAEC-derived NO production with 12% inhibition observed at 5 μm ADMA and 52% inhibition at 100 μm ADMA (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with l-NMMA, demonstrating 42% inhibition at 5 μm l-NMMA and 81% at 100 μm l-NMMA, in the absence of l-Arg (Fig. 3B). In the presence of physiological levels of l-Arg (100 μm), 5 μm l-NMMA inhibited NO production by 9%, whereas 100 μm levels resulted in 65% inhibition (Fig. 3B). The robust inhibition observed with low concentrations of ADMA (5 μm) and l-NMMA (5 μm) in the absence of l-Arg suggested that the cells are able to concentrate methylarginines. Therefore, methylarginine uptake studies were performed on BAECs, and intracellular levels were measured. Measurement of ADMA and NMMA Uptake by BAECs—The previous studies demonstrated that, when cells were incubated with ADMA or l-NMMA in l-Arg-free buffer, low methylarginine (5 μm) levels significantly inhibited NO generation. These results would suggest that BAECs are able to efficiently take up and accumulate ADMA and l-NMMA within the cell. Therefore, studies were carried out using HPLC techniques to measure both intracellular ADMA and l-Arg. BAECs were grown to confluence in full media that contains 500 μm l-Arg. To measure the dose-dependent effects of exogenously added ADMA on the intracellular ADMA levels, ADMA (0–10 μm) was added to buffer (PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose), and the cells were allowed to incubate for 20 min. Results demonstrated that, under these conditions, l-Arg levels in the cell were 215 μm and ADMA was 2.7 μm. In the presence of 10 μm ADMA, the intracellular concentration of this inhibitor increased to 68.4 μm (Fig. 4A). These effects were dose-dependent and demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular ADMA reaching 4.4 μm when 0.5 μm was added to the incubation buffer. Uptake was reduced when the experiments were carried out in the presence of l-Arg (100 μm). With l-Arg present, the addition of 10 μm ADMA to the incubation buffer gave rise to an intracellular ADMA concentration of 23.5 μm. These results demonstrate that ADMA is preferentially taken up by endothelial cells and may be an important mechanism in NOS regulation under conditions where plasma methylarginines are increased. To further confirm our observation that BAECs concentrate methylarginines, uptake studies were also performed with l-NMMA. Results were similar to those observed with ADMA and demonstrated that BAECs, in the absence of extracellular l-Arg, were able to concentrate l-NMMA with intracellular levels reaching values ∼7 times higher than outside the cell (Fig. 4B). l-NMMA (or ADMA) uptake was inhibited >90% by l-lysine (1 mm), demonstrating that these effects are dependent on the cation amino acid transporter (data not shown). Interestingly, l-NMMA (10 μm) uptake was only inhibited by ∼65% when l-Arg (100 μm) was added to the buffer, suggesting that this transporter has a higher affinity for l-NMMA (Fig. 4B). Although the studies performed in the absence of l-Arg do not represent physiological conditions, they allow us to both modulate and determine the intracellular concentration of ADMA or l-NMMA for any given extracellular amount added. Thus, by measuring intracellular methylarginine and l-arginine levels following exogenous addition of inhibitor, we were able to plot NO production as a function of intracellular ADMA/ l-Arg or l-NMMA/l-Arg ratio (Fig. 5, A and B). Results showed that when the data points for NO production from BAECs were plotted against the methylarginine/l-Arg ratio, a strong correlation to the inhibition predicted from the kinetics of the isolated enzyme was observed (Fig. 5, A and B). The kinetic curve was generated from the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition modified for the I/S ratio (Equation 3), V=Vmax/(Km(1/S+X/Ki)+1)(Eq. 3) where X is the inhibitor/substrate ratio. These data demonstrate that the degree of cellular NOS inhibition can be predicted based on the enzyme kinetics if the cellular methylarginine/l-Arg ratios are known. Effects of ADMA on Vascular Reactivity—Although results from the isolated enzyme and cellular studies demonstrated dose-dependent methylarginine-mediated eNOS inhibition, we wanted to examine whether the effects of methylarginines on eNOS can modulate physiological processes such as vascular reactivity. Therefore, vascular studies were performed using rat carotid artery rings, and the dose-dependent effects of ADMA were measured. Carotid rings were incubated in the presence of ADMA (1–500 μm) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. Following the incubation period, the vessels were constricted with phenylephrine (1 μm), and the relaxation response to acetylcholine (1 μm) was measured. The percent relaxation to 1 μm Ach w"

https://openalex.org/W2076684722,"Chromatin organization is compromised during the repair of DNA damage. It remains unknown how and to what extent epigenetic information is preserved in vivo. A central question is whether chromatin reorganization involves recycling of parental histones or new histone incorporation. Here, we devise an approach to follow new histone deposition upon UV irradiation in human cells. We show that new H3.1 histones get incorporated in vivo at repair sites. Remarkably we find that H3.1, which is deposited during S phase, is also incorporated outside of S phase. Histone deposition is dependent on nucleotide excision repair (NER), indicating that it occurs at a postrepair stage. The histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is directly involved in the histone deposition process in vivo. We conclude that chromatin restoration after damage cannot rely simply on histone recycling. New histone incorporation at repair sites both challenges epigenetic stability and possibly contributes to damage memory."

It has consequently been proposed that oligomerization of the N-terminal domains of galectin-3 molecules, after ligand binding by the C-terminal domain, is responsible for this cross-linking.

However, little is known about the actual mode of action through which galectin-3 exerts its function. In this report we present data suggesting that oligomerization of galectin-3 molecules occurs on cell surfaces with physiological concentrations of the lectin.

We observed this fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal in different biological settings representing the different modes of action of galectin-3 that we previously proposed; that is, ligand crosslinking leading to cell activation, cell-cell interaction/adhesion, and lattice formation.

Rather, galectin-3 is composed of a N-terminal, non-lectin domain consisting of multiple repeats of a peptide sequence rich in proline, glycine, and tyrosine in addition to its C-terminal CRD (22Albrandt K.

In fact, it has been proposed and generally accepted that, upon oligosaccharide binding by the CRD, the non-lectin domain of galectin-3 molecules could oligomerize, thereby cross-linking ligands of the cell surface (20Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10841-10847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Despite of a relatively limited set of available data, the multivalency of galectin-3 is conceptually accepted. We previously proposed that galectin-3 oligomerization would lead to different galectin-3 functions through three different cross-linking modes (7Sato S. Nieminen J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Sato S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2002; 14: 285-301Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The different activities expected from those three cross-linking modes, cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and lattice formation, were previously observed by our group through the interaction of galectin-3 with different stages of neutrophils (12Nieminen J. St-Pierre C. Sato S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent elegant study by Brewer and co-workers (30Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R. Liu B. Macaluso F. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10841-10847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) indeed indicated that upon binding to synthetic sugars in solution, high concentrations of galectin-3 precipitate as pentamers, most likely through oligomerization of galectin-3 N-terminal domain. However, to date the molecular mechanism leading to galectin-3 activities has not been elucidated, and the expected galectin-3 oligomerization has not been demonstrated in biological settings with physiological concentrations of galectin-3. We, thus, sought to investigate the oligomerization of galectin-3 at the cellular level through the three different proposed crosslinking modes previously observed in neutrophil adhesion, signal transduction, and lattice formation (12Nieminen J. St-Pierre C. Sato S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique that allows the visualization of molecular interactions that would otherwise be well beyond the resolution of a fluorescence microscope (31Selvin P.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 32Hibbs A.R. Hibbs A.R. Confocal Microscopy for Biologists. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2004: 254-255Google Scholar). This technique implies the use of fluorescent molecules with emission (donor) and excitation (acceptor) spectra that overlap. When the energy from the emission of the donor is transferred to the acceptor, the acceptor fluorophore is excited, and its fluorescence (FRET signal) can be detected by fluorescence spectrometry, including fluorescence microscopes. Unlike colocalization, which merely indicates physical proximity, a FRET signal indicates that the two molecules are separated by a very small distance (less than 10 nm) and are presumably interacting (33Majoul I. Straub M. Duden R. Hell S.W. Soling H.D. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 82: 267-277PubMed Google Scholar, 34Li M. Reddy L.G. Bennett R. Silva Jr., N.D. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biophys.

In this study, galectin-3 tagged at its C terminus with a short transglutaminase substrate peptide sequence (galectin-3-TG1) was labeled with fluorescent Alexa molecules (Alexa 488 or Alexa 555) using a technique involving an enzymatic reaction with transglutaminase (36Taki M. Shiota M. Taira K. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 488 was used as the donor, and galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 555 was used as the acceptor for the detection of galectin-3 oligomerization. Combination of site-specific fluorescent labeling with confocal microscopy enabled us to visualize FRET signals in various settings where galectin-3 should act through ligand cross-linking. FRET signals were, thus, detected during galectin-3 lattice formation on neutrophils and endothelial cells, galectin-3-mediated signal transduction in neutrophils, and during galectin-3-mediated adhesion of neutrophils to an endothelial cell layer. These data suggest that galectin-3 indeed oligomerizes on cell surfaces in those three cross-linking modes. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal domain of galectin-3 by proteolytic cleavage prevented the occurrence of FRET, confirming the involvement of this domain in oligomerization. This technique has, thus, enabled the direct visualization of galectin-3 oligomerization at the cellular level in biological settings, reinforcing the importance of oligomerization in galectin-3 functions. Reagents—Chemicals and other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Neutrophil elastase was obtained from Calbiochem. Expression and Purification of Human Galectin-3—Recombinant human galectin-3 was purified as described previously and was passed through Detoxi-Gel endotoxin-removing gels (Pierce) (14Sato S. Ouellet N. Pelletier I. Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Truncated galectin-3 was prepared by incubation with human elastase (70 milliunits/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by the addition of Pefabloc (5 mg/ml) to inhibit enzyme activity. Nonspecific Labeling of Human Galectin-3—For nonspecific fluorescent labeling, the succimidyl ester-based method was used. Alexa 488- and Alexa 555-labeled galectin-3 (referred here as galectin-3-Alexa 488 or -Alexa 555) were prepared following the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) with a slight modification as previously described (28Pelletier I. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17663-17670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Pelletier I. Hashidate T. Urashima T. Nishi N. Nakamura T. Futai M. Arata Y.

C-terminal-specific Fluorescence Labeling of Human Galectin-3 Tagged with Short Transglutaminase Peptide Sequence (TG1)—The expression vector (pET27/galectin-3-TG1) was constructed to produce galectin-3 tagged with the TG1 sequence, HSV®-tag (NOVAGEN), and His6 at the C terminus. Site-directed fluorescence labeling of human galectin-3 at the C terminus was performed as described by Taki et al. (36Taki M. Shiota M. Taira K. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, galectin-3-TG1 was incubated with either Alexa 488-cadaverine or Alexa 555-cadaverine; Molecular Probes (final concentration 1 mm) in the presence of transglutaminase (0.05 unit) at room temperature for 2 h in the dark. Labeled galectin-3-TG1 was purified on a lactose-Sepharose column. Galectin-3-TG1 was eluted with 20 mm lactose in PBS containing EDTA. The purity of galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 488 and galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 555 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence intensities of galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 488 and galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 555 were measured by Fluoromax-3 (Jovan-Yvon). Fluorescent molecule (Alexa) to protein ratios of galectin-3-TG1 were 0.58 ± 0.10 and 0.40 ± 0.06, respectively. While a report suggests that the N-terminal domain of hamster galectin-3 contains a potential sequence for transglutaminase (38Mehul B. Bawumia S. Hughes R.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), very little if any fluorescence was associated with human galectin-3 when galectin-3 without TG1 was used as a substrate for labeling, suggesting that in the condition we used the majority of Alexa dyes incorporated to galectin-3-TG1 were attached to the TG1 sequence (data not shown). Before use, galectin-3-TG1-Alexa was extensively dialyzed against PBS to remove lactose and EDTA. Fluorescence Intensity and Galectin-3 Purity—All galectins-3 molecules were fractionated on a SDS-PAGE gel, and fluorescent galectins-3 were visualized using the ProXpress two-dimensional proteomic imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (excitation filter 480 nm, bandpass 30 nm; emission filter 530 nm, bandpass 30 nm) and Typhoon 3200 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) (excitation 532 nm; emission filter 555 nm, bandpass 20 nm). Galectin-3-TG1-Alexa had a slightly higher molecular mass (32 kDa) than unlabeled galectin-3 or chemically labeled-galectin-3 (∼30 kDa) (data not shown). Protein concentrations for the assays were then adjusted to achieve similar fluorescence intensities. The pair Alexa 488 and Alexa 555 was chosen for FRET analysis because the Alexa 488 emission spectra overlaps the Alexa 555 excitation spectra and the Alexa 555 emission can be detected using Far Red filters (≥660 nm) with minimum cross-talk originating from the Alexa 488 emission (39Sinev M. Landsmann P. Sineva E. Ittah V. Haas E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Microplate FRET Measurement—96-Well plates (Nunc) were coated with 4 mg/ml asialofetuin overnight. Residual binding sites on the plates were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl), different concentrations of galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 488 and/or galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 555 in 0.05% Triton X-100-TBS were added to the plates and incubated for 30 min. Plates were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min after brief washing with 0.05% Triton X-100-TBS. Plates were again washed 3 times with 0.05% Triton X-100-TBS, then PBS was added to the plates. Fluorescence was read using a Wallac Victor fluorescent reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Green fluorescence, red fluorescence, and FRET signal were read alternatively using a 485-nm excitation filter with a 535-nm emission filter, a 545-nm (bandpass 30 nm) excitation filter with a 620-nm (bandpass 30 nm) emission filter, and a 485-nm excitation filter with a 620-nm (bandpass 30 nm) emission filter, respectively. Truncated galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 488 and/or truncated galectin-3-TG1-Alexa 555 were also tested in the same manner. However, the binding of truncated galectin-3 was as low as 4-7% compared with full-length galectin-3 (data not shown). Therefore, the presence or absence of FRET could not be evaluated due to the limited sensitivity of the detector. Furthermore, truncated galectin-3 was not retained in an asialofetuin-agarose column, whereas it was retained in a lactose-Sepharose column. 3J. Nieminen, A. Kuno, J. Hirabayashi, and S. Sato, unpublished observations. This is consistent with the results obtained during microplate assays. These results suggest that stable association of soluble galectin-3 with asialofetuin requires the N-terminal domain. Neutrophils and Galectin-3—Neutrophils were purified from heparinized blood of healthy volunteers, as previously described (12Nieminen J. St-Pierre C. Sato S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Sato S. Ouellet N. Pelletier I. Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated neutrophils are referred here as unprimed neutrophils. A portion of the neutrophils was primed before the experiment by a 5-min preincubation with 5 μm cytochalasin B (referred here as primed neutrophils) (12Nieminen J. St-Pierre C. Sato S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Yamaoka A. Kuwabara I. Frigeri L.G. Liu F.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3479-3487PubMed Google Scholar, 40Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Painter R.G. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 27: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Primed and unprimed neutrophils were then incubated for the indicated times with Alexa labeled galectin-3 at 4 or 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity and protein content (2 μm) of each preparation was adjusted to similar levels with unlabeled galectin-3. After unbound galectin-3 was removed by a 5-min centrifugation at 500 × g followed by brief washing, neutrophils were used either unfixed or fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, resuspended in 50% glycerol, and mounted on a microscope slide for observation by confocal microscope. Neutrophil Adhesion—Endothelial-like cell line, ECV 304, or human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC, Cell Application) layers were grown on coverslips in the bottom of 12-well plates. Neutrophils and ECV cells or HUVEC were first labeled with calcein-acetoxymethyl (calcein, Molecular Probes) as previously published (14Sato S. Ouellet N. Pelletier I. Simard M. Rancourt A. Bergeron M.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and were incubated with 2 μm galectin-3-Alexa 546 at 37 °C. After unbound galectin-3 was removed by brief washing, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS, and coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide for observation by confocal microscope. Alternatively, unlabeled neutrophils and unlabeled ECV or HUVEC were incubated with galectin 3-TG1-Alexa 488 and/or galectin 3-TG1-Alexa 555. Again galectin-3 concentrations were adjusted to 2 μm with unlabeled galectin-3. Confocal Microscopy—Fluorescence images acquired through a60 × 1.4 NA objective (PlanApo, Olympus) were captured at serial optical sections (∼50 sections at 0.5-μm intervals) by the FLUOWVIEW FV300 confocal scanning unit (Olympus) as previously published (12Nieminen J.

https://openalex.org/W2078883869,"Nicotine, the primary addictive substance in tobacco, induces profound behavioral responses in mammals, but the underlying genetic mechanisms are not well understood. Here we develop a C. elegans model of nicotine-dependent behavior. We show that worms exhibit behavioral responses to nicotine that parallel those observed in mammals, including acute response, tolerance, withdrawal, and sensitization. These nicotine responses require nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family genes that are known to mediate nicotine dependence in mammals, suggesting functional conservation of nAChRs in nicotine responses. Importantly, we find that mutant worms lacking TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels are defective in their response to nicotine and that such a defect can be rescued by a human TRPC channel, revealing an unexpected role for TRPC channels in regulating nicotine-dependent behavior. Thus, C. elegans can be used to characterize known genes as well as to identify new genes regulating nicotine responses."
https://openalex.org/W2069519208,"TAK1 (transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and an essential intracellular signaling component in inflammatory signaling pathways. Upon stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines, TAK1 binds proteins that stimulate autophosphorylation within its activation loop and is thereby catalytically activated. This activation is transient; it peaks within a couple of minutes and is subsequently down-regulated rapidly to basal levels. The mechanism of down-regulation of TAK1 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that toxin inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases greatly enhances interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the TAK1 activation loop as well as the catalytic activity of TAK1. From proteomic analysis of TAK1-binding proteins, we identified protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a type-2A phosphatase, and demonstrated that PP6 associated with and inactivated TAK1 by dephosphorylation of Thr-187. Ectopic and endogenous PP6 co-precipitated with TAK1, and expression of PP6 reduced IL-1 activation of TAK1 but did not affect osmotic activation of MLK3, another MAPKKK. Reduction of PP6 expression by small interfering RNA enhances IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-187 in TAK1. Enhancement occurred without change in levels of PP2A showing specificity for PP6. Our results demonstrate that PP6 specifically down-regulates TAK1 through dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop, which is likely important for suppressing inflammatory responses via TAK1 signaling pathways.

The kinase activation loop of TAK1 contains phosphorylation sites at Thr-184, Thr-187, and Ser-192. Unphosphorylatable amino acid substitutions of any of these residues abolish the catalytic activity of TAK1 (8Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Catalytic activity of TAK1 is required for this phosphorylation, suggesting that TAK1 autophosphorylates its activation loop. Upon cytokine stimulation, TAK1 autophosphorylation is induced presumably through the conformational change due to assembly of the signaling complex, which converts TAK1 into a catalytically active form. Among the phosphorylation sites in the TAK1 activation loop, it has so far been established that phosphorylation at Thr-187 correlates with activation of TAK1 (22Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7359-7368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TAK1 is activated in a transient manner (23Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). IL-1 activates TAK1 within 1–2 min, and the activation peaks at 3–5 min and declines to the basal levels within 15–30 min after stimulation. Although TAK1 activation has been determined to some extent as described above, the mechanism by which TAK1 is down-regulated remains largely unknown. In general, the level of protein phosphorylation is controlled by the balanced activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Indeed, TAK1 activity is known to be regulated by protein phosphatase PP2C family members in the unstimulated state (24Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K.-I. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R.

In this study, we found that inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases results in hyperphosphorylation and hyperactivation of TAK1 in response to IL-1 stimulation. The protein Ser/Thr phosphatase family comprises the type 1 and type 2A phosphatases, and these are the major protein phosphatases that play an important role in the regulation of cell growth and a diverse set of cellular proteins, including metabolic enzymes, ion channels, hormone receptors, and kinase cascades (26Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) and protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) have been identified as novel phosphatases and have been classified as type 2A phosphatase family members based on their sequence homology (27Bastians H. Ponstingl H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2865-2874PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.

However, relative to PP2A, much less is known about the functions of PP4 and PP6. Recently, PP6 has been implicated in opposing NF-κB activation by control of IκBϵ degradation (30Stefansson B. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem.,. 2006; 281: 22624-22634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We here found that TAK1 associates with PP6 and that PP6 dephosphorylates and inactivates TAK1. We also show that reduction of PP6 expression increases phosphorylation of IL-1-induced TAK1. Our results suggest that PP6 is a negative regulator of TAK1. Chemicals, Plasmids, and Antibodies—Tautomysin, okadaic acid, cyclosporin A, and calculin A were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human IL-1β was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The mammalian expression vectors for HA-tagged TAK1 (HA-TAK1), FLAG-tagged TAK1 (FLAG-TAK1), and TAB1 have been described previously (2Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z.

Cell Cultures—293 cells, 293 IL-1RI cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine growth serum (HyClone) or fetal bovine serum. Transfection of 293 cells was carried out according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method. siRNAs—siRNAs targeted against human PP6 were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. Two siRNA against the sequences PP6–1 (47GCA AGT ACC TGC CAG AGA A65) and PP6–2 (893GAA CGA CAA CGC CAT ATT T911) were used. A pool of three siRNAs for human PP2A was purchased from B-Bridge, (target sequences 333CAC CAT TCT TCG AGG GAA T351, 663GCA AGA TAT TTC TGA GAC A681, and 3′ untranslated region GGA AAT GGG AAG AGC AAC A). Control siRNA against unrelated nucleotide sequence was purchased from Ambion (Silencer negative Control 1 siRNA). The siRNA duplexes were transfected into 293 IL-1R cells using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated in 30% fetal bovine serum for 48 h post-transfection and then stimulated with IL-1. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). Proteins from these cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of various antibodies and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The immune complexes were washed three times with wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and once with rinse buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and suspended in 30 μl of rinse buffer. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignal West Femto sensitivity substrate (Pierce). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of bacterially expressed MKK6 in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) at 25 °C for 2 min. Samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Purified PP2A was purchased from Millipore/Upstate. HA-TAK1 was activated by co-expression of TAB1 in 293 cells and was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, incubated with the purified PP2A for 30 min at 30 °C. Inhibition of Type 2A Phosphatase Activity Increases IL-1-induced Phosphorylation of TAK1—TAK1 is activated through its autophosphorylation within the activation loop induced by binding of proteins such as TAB1, TAB2, and TRAFs and is rapidly down-regulated (8Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I. Sakurai H.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TAK1 is down-regulated has not yet been elucidated, but it is likely to involve protein phosphatases. Indeed, both TAK1 phosphorylation and activation are regulated by PP2C family (also known as MPP) phosphatases, which participate in silencing TAK1 basal activity in the unstimulated state (24Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K.-I. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K.-I. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12013-12021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To further address which protein phosphatases reverse stimuli-induced TAK1 activation, we examined the effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors on IL-1-induced TAK1 phosphorylation. The 293 IL-1RI cell line, which stably expresses IL-1 receptor, was stimulated by IL-1 in the presence or absence of different phosphatase inhibitors: 1) tautomycin, an inhibitor of PP1; 2) okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of the PP2A family; 3) cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of PP2B; or 4) calyculin A, an inhibitor of both the PP1 and the PP2A families (Fig. 1). Although OA can inhibit both PP1 and PP2A at high concentrations, OA at the concentration of 100 nm was used for relatively selective inhibition of the PP2A family (31Honkanen R.E. Golden T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 2055-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Upon IL-1 treatment TAK1 was autophosphorylated and it migrated more slowly than unstimulated TAK1 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, upper panel) as described previously (8Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TAK1 in the activation loop was monitored by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody that recognized phosphorylated TAK1 at Thr-187 (anti-P-Thr-187) (Fig. 1, lower panel). IL-1-induced phosphorylation at Thr-187 was barely detected without phosphatase inhibitor, but either OA or calyculin A greatly enhanced the IL-1-dependent phosphorylation at Thr-187 and showed a large mobility shift of TAK1 on SDS-PAGE. In contrast, neither tautomycin nor cyclosporine A enhanced the TAK1 phosphorylation at Thr-187 or altered mobility in SDS-PAGE. These results suggest that inhibition of the PP2A family enhances the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187. To assess the role of PP2A family members on TAK1, we used 100 nm OA for the subsequent experiments. Inhibition of the PP2A Family Increases IL-1-induced Activation of TAK1—We examined the kinetics of TAK1 activation in the absence and presence of OA (Fig. 2). Catalytic activity of TAK1 was measured using MKK6 as a specific substrate. IL-1 addition to cells stimulated TAK1 activity at 0.5 and 1.0 min, and the activity declined rapidly thereafter, returning to basal by 5 min. Addition of OA significantly enhanced IL-1-dependent activation of TAK1. The peak levels of TAK1 catalytic activity were greatly increased, and the activity peaked at 2 min and was sustained longer (>5 min) compared with that in OA-untreated cells. The phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187 enhanced by OA was correlated with the kinetics of OA-induced TAK1 activation. These data demonstrate that inhibition of PP2A family phosphatases by OA enhances IL-1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. PP2A Can Dephosphorylate and Inactivate TAK1 in Vitro—Upon cell stimulation, TAK1 binds to the TRAF6-containing complex and autophosphorylates Thr-187 in the activation loop, thereby activating its catalytic activity (8Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that a PP2A family phosphatase may down-regulate TAK1 by dephosphorylating Thr-187 in the TAK1 activation loop. We examined whether PP2A could directly dephosphorylate Thr-187 and inactivate TAK1. We isolated an active form of TAK1 from cells co-expressing TAK1 together with its activator subunit TAB1. Ectopically expressed TAB1 induces autophosphorylation of TAK1 at the activation loop, as does treatment of cells with IL-1 (8Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The activated TAK1 was immunoprecipitated and incubated with purified PP2A (Fig. 3). PP2A dephosphorylated Thr-187 in the TAK1 activation loop and inactivated TAK1. Collectively, these results suggest that a PP2A family phosphatase negatively regulates TAK1 by dephosphorylating Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1. PP6 Interacts with TAK1—To identify the TAK1 endogenous phosphatase, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged TAK1 from transiently transfected cells. The immunocomplex was digested, and the peptides were analyzed by using a nano-scale liquid chromatography system with collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (32Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Several peptides were found to correspond to TAB1. One peptide yielded the sequence YGNANAWRYCTK, and it corresponded to protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) catalytic subunit. To confirm the interaction of TAK1 with PP6, we conducted the immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 4A). FLAG-TAK1 and HA-tagged PP6 catalytic subunit (HA-PP6) were co-expressed in 293 cells. FLAG-TAK1 co-precipitated with HA-PP6, and the interaction was confirmed by the reciprocal anti-HA immunoprecipitation. We asked whether stimulation of TAK1 and the catalytic activity of PP6 affect the interaction. We co-expressed FLAG-TAK1 with HA-PP6 wild type and a catalytically inactive form of PP6 (PP6-D84N) in 293 IL-1RI cells and treated cells with IL-1 (Fig. 4B). TAK1 associated with PP6 independent of catalytic activity of PP6. The interaction was not altered by IL-1 stimulation. These results suggest that PP6 is a constitutive binding partner of TAK1 with or without IL-1 stimulation. To verify the physiological TAK1-PP6 interaction, we examined whether endogenous TAK1 associated with PP6. Cell extracts from cells treated with or without IL-1 were prepared and endogenous TAK1 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4C). PP6 was co-precipitated with TAK1 with and without IL-1 stimulation of cells. This indicated that endogenous PP6 interacts with TAK1. PP6 Dephosphorylates and Inactivates TAK1—We examined whether PP6 can dephosphorylate TAK1. PP6 wild type or catalytically inactive form of PP6 was overexpressed in 293 IL-1RI cells, and cells were stimulated with IL-1. The phosphorylation of TAK1 was monitored by anti-P-Thr-187 antibody (Fig. 5A). We found that increased expression of PP6 reduced IL-1-dependent phosphorylation at Thr-187 of TAK1. To determine whether PP6 action is specific to TAK1 among the family members of MAPKKKs, we examined the effect of PP6 overexpression on osmotic stress-induced MLK3 activation. MLK3 is phosphorylated and activated upon osmotic stress. 293 cells were treated with 0.5 m sorbitol, and the phosphorylated form of MLK3 was detected with a phospho-specific MLK3 antibody (Fig. 5B). Ectopic expression of PP6 did not alter the phosphorylation status of MLK3. We examined whether PP6 levels affected regulation of TAK1. We tested down-regulation of PP6 by siRNA in IL-1-induced activation of TAK1. Different siRNAs (PP6-1 and PP6-2) targeted against two sequences in human PP6 were used. The synthetic siRNA duplexes were transfected into 293 IL-1RI cells, and the reduction of PP6 expression was monitored by immunoblotting of PP6 (Fig. 6A). Both siRNAs resulted in a 60–80% decrease in the level of PP6 protein. Specificity of these siRNAs was confirmed by showing no change in the protein levels of PP2A and the unrelated protein β-catenin. Knock down of PP6 led to an increased phosphorylation of Thr-187 TAK1 in IL-1-stimulated cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, siRNAs targeted against PP2A did not alter the phosphorylation of Thr-187 of TAK1 (Fig. 6C). These results confirm that PP6 is the negative regulator of TAK1 activation by IL-1 stimulation. TAK1 is an essential intermediate of IL-1 signaling pathway, and it is activated following association with the TRAF6-containing complex. This binding presumably alters TAK1 conformation and thereby induces autophosphorylation within the activation loop at Thr-187. TAK1 is in turn catalytically activated at 0.5–3 min after IL-1 stimulation. This activation is rapidly down-regulated. The mechanism of TAK1 down-regulation has not yet been defined. There are several possible mechanisms to reduce the TAK1 activity: 1) dissociation of TAK1 from the TRAF6-containing complex; 2) modification of TAK1 itself or its regulatory subunits; and 3) dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop. We have previously reported that TAK1 is dissociated from the TRAF6-complex 10–30 min after IL-1 stimulation (23Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishida S. Li X. Stark G.R. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This dissociation is likely to convert TAK1 conformation from active to the inactive state and thereby blocks further autophosphorylation of TAK1. Cheung et al. (14Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) have proposed that p38 MAPK is involved in negative regulation of TAK1. p38 is activated through TAK1 pathway in response to IL-1 stimulation. They have shown that p38 phosphorylates the TAK1 activator subunit TAB1, resulting in inactivation of TAK1 in a negative feedback loop. This modification serves to inhibit catalytically active (autophosphorylated) forms of TAK1, which may enhance the down-regulation of TAK1. We show here that PP6 interacts with TAK1, dephosphorylates Thr-187 in the activation loop of TAK1, and inactivates TAK1. Furthermore, our knock down of PP6 demonstrated that PP6 is an essential negative regulator of TAK1 activation. Therefore, TAK1 is down-regulated through several distinct mechanisms and PP6-mediated direct dephosphorylation of Thr-187 is one of the major mechanisms to inactivate TAK1. Both PP2C and PP6 can dephosphorylate and inactivate TAK1. The dephosphorylation site(s) by PP2C has not yet been defined. However, because TAK1 activity is dependent on phosphorylation at Thr-184, Thr-187, and Ser-192 within its activation loop, it is possible that both PP6 and PP2C dephosphorylate those sites. Whereas PP6 constitutively associates with TAK1, PP2C is found to dissociate from TAK1 upon IL-1 stimulation (25Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K.-I. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12013-12021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which suggests that PP2C functions to inhibit the TAK1 activity in the unstimulated state and releasing PP2C from the TAK1 complex may participate in TAK1 activation. In contrast, in this study we found that knock down of PP6 only affects IL-1-stimulted activation of TAK1 but it does not alter basal TAK1 activity seen without IL-1 stimulation. Therefore, PP6 is primarily involved in down-regulation of activated forms of TAK1 generated upon stimulation. Collectively, both PP6 and PP2C regulate TAK1 activity by dephosphorylation, but they seem to function on different forms of TAK1. Genetic studies using a mouse model have revealed that TAK1 plays a non-redundant role in innate immune responses as well as adaptive immunity in vivo (4Shim J.-H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T.

TAK1 is a master regulator of both NF-κB and JNK, which are major pathways to control inflammation. Because TAK1 plays such a key role in intracellular signaling to activate inflammation, the effective down-regulation of TAK1 following the stimuli-dependent rapid activation is important to prevent excessive immune responses. Dysregulation of inflammation is implicated in pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma. Furthermore, the chronic inflammation often associates with tumor development (33Coussens L.M. Werb Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (11188) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the mechanism of TAK1 down-regulation is essential for better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that PP6 is a potent negative regulator of TAK1 in a physiological setting. PP6 is likely to play a role that regulates inflammatory signaling in vivo, and hence PP6 may be a potential novel target for pharmacological therapy of inflammatory diseases as well as inflammation-associated tumors.

To study the effect of age on the regulation of MnSOD in the vasculature, we compared MnSOD expression and its transcriptional regulation in explanted vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) isolated from old (24 months old) versus young (6 months old) rats and grown in a normal (5 mm) or high (12.5 and 25 mm) glucose or tumor necrosis factor α (5 ng/ml) environment to induce oxidative stress. Both MnSOD protein and activity were reduced in VSMC from old compared with young animals. FOXO3a, a member of the family of Forkhead transcription factors, interacted with the promoter of the rat MnSOD gene at a specific binding site. Inhibition of FOXO3a transcription with small interfering RNA led to a reduction in MnSOD gene expression. VSMC from old rats had increased phosphorylated FOXO3a at Ser253, which paralleled the reduction of MnSOD protein. Treatment of VSMC with 5 nm insulin-like growth factor-1 induced phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a over time, repressing FOXO3a DNA binding and consequently MnSOD gene expression. Furthermore, Akt activity was selectively increased in VSMC from the old, supporting the hypothesis that increased age-related Akt activity might be responsible for the phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO3a, which in turn down-regulates MnSOD transcription.

Investig. 1995; 96: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Cao L. Leers-Sucheta S. Azhar S. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 88: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas other investigators have reported increased MnSOD activity with aging, especially in rat myocardium (7Judge S. Jang Y.M. Smith A. Hagen T. Leeuwenburgh C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and human skeletal muscle (8Gianni P. Jan K.J. Douglas M.J. Stuart P.M. Tarnopolsky M.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2004; 39: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), implicating tissue and cell type specificity. Nevertheless, MnSOD activity in VSMC from aged mice (1Moon S.K. Thompson L.J.

Physiol. 2001; 280: H2779-H2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in human arteries from older individuals (9D'Armiento F.P. Bianchi A. de Nigris F. Capuzzi D.M. D'Armiento M.R. Crimi G. Abete P. Palinski W. Condorelli M. Napoli C. Gronholdt M.L. Stroke. 2001; 32: 2472-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was reported to be significantly reduced. The transcriptional regulation of the MnSOD gene is complex. A series of transcription factors, such as specificity protein-1, activator protein-2, and NF-κB, appear to regulate MnSOD gene expression (10Wan X.S. Devalaraja M.N. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Zhu C.H. Huang Y. Oberley L.W. Domann F.E. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, a Forkhead transcription factor, DAF-16, was reported to be involved in the regulation of longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (13Lin K. Hsin H. Libina N. Kenyon C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). In the search for candidate genes for DAF-16, sod3 (MnSOD homologue in C. elegans) was found to be directly regulated by DAF-16 (14Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). FOXO (Forkhead box class O) transcription factors may be important in their ability to regulate antioxidant defense in many species. For example, FOXO3a, also known as FKHRL1, protects quiescent human cells from oxidative stress by directly increasing the quantities of MnSOD mRNA and protein (15Kops G.J.P.L. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W.A. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). FOXO transcription factors are believed to be negatively regulated by IGF-1 signaling pathway through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B, also called Akt (16Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar, 17Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FOXO transcriptional activity may be enhanced by β-catenin, which binds directly to FOXO in cells exposed to oxidative stress (18Essers M.A. Vries-Smits L.M. Barker N. Polderman P.E. Burgering B.M. Korswagen H.C. Science. 2005; 308: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). A model depicting the FOXO shuttling system was initially described to explain the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by this family member of transcription factors (19Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This shuttling system changes the intracellular localization of FOXO through phosphorylation of three Akt sites in the Forkhead domain, primarily at Ser253. In an in vitro Akt kinase assay, Brunet et al. (16Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar) tested a series of GST-FOXO3a fusion proteins in which each of the three phosphorylation sites, Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315, were mutated to Ala and confirmed that the Ser253 mutant GST-FOXO3a fusion protein was unable to be phosphorylated by Akt. Phosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser253 in the Forkhead domain leads to disruption of the nuclear localization function and its binding to DNA (20Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J.P.L. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation of FOXO3a, the complex that includes 14-3-3 proteins, a small GTPase Ran, and chromosomal region maintenance protein 1, is transported through the nuclear pore into the cytosol (21Tran H. Brunet A. Griffith E.C. Greenberg M.E. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytosol, phosphorylated FOXO proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This shuttling system provides the cell with the “double negative” regulation of FOXO factors and the subsequent regulation of transcription (22Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of Akt and FOXO3a in the regulation of MnSOD in VSMC with advancing age or under conditions known to promote atherosclerosis would be important as future targets for attenuating oxidative stress and its consequences. We hypothesized that MnSOD expression in VSMC from young and old rats might differ as a consequence of differences in age-related regulation of FOXO3a phosphorylation by Akt during oxidative stress that was simulated by exposure to high glucose (23Russell J.W. Golovoy D.A.V.I. Vincent A.M. Mahendru P.I.A. Olzmann J.A. Mentzer A.L.I.C. Feldman E.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1738-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 24Peiro C. Lafuente N. Matesanz N.

Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 326-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Explanted Aortic VSMC—Explanted VSMC isolated from young and old rats were cultured as described previously (27Li M. Mossman B.T. Kolpa E. Timblin C.R. Shukla A. Taatjes D.J. Fukagawa N.K. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Young mature (6 month old) and old (24 month old) male Fisher 344 rats were purchased from Harlan-Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). The rats were originally obtained from the NIA, National Institutes of Health aging colonies and maintained in separate security barriers at Harlan Sprague-Dawley according to the guidelines established in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and under specific pathogen-free conditions. After exsanguination, the aortas were surgically removed and cleaned of superficial adherent connective tissues. Then the aortas were minced into small pieces and placed in 6-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin. VSMC migrated from the tissue after 3-4 days at 37 °C incubation in an atmosphere of 10% CO2.Atconfluence, monolayers of cells were dispersed with 0.25% trypsin and then seeded at 0.3-0.5 × 106/75-cm2 flask. VSMC at passages 3 or 4 were used in these experiments. Pairs of cell lines from one old and one young rat were grown and treated under identical conditions in each experiment as previously described (27Li M. Mossman B.T. Kolpa E. Timblin C.R. Shukla A. Taatjes D.J. Fukagawa N.K. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). VSMC were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin containing normal glucose (5 mm) or high glucose (12.5 or 25 mm) for 3 days. Another group was exposed to TNF-α (5 ng/ml) in reduced DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 3 h to induce oxidative stress. IGF-1 Treatment—IGF-1 protein (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA) was diluted to a 1 μm stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. VSMC from young rats were grown in complete DMEM overnight after subculturing. On the second day, the medium was changed to reduced medium with 5 nm IGF-1 for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 24 h. A parallel set of VSMC in reduced medium without IGF-1 were used as controls. AG-1024 Treatment—VSMC were grown in complete DMEM overnight after subculturing. The next morning VSMC were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm AG-1024 (Calbiochem®, La Jolla, CA), an IGF-1R inhibitor. Then the medium was changed to reduced medium containing 5 nm IGF-1 with or without 10 μm AG1024 for 4 h. Alternatively, VSMC from old rats were grown in complete DMEM containing 5 mm glucose overnight. On the second day, one set of dishes was pretreated with 10 μm AG-1024 for 30 min and then continuously grown in the medium containing 5 mm or 12.5 mm glucose with 10 μm AG-1024 for 3 days. The other set of cells were grown in the same medium without AG-1024 but with 1 μl/ml Me2SO as the vehicle control. siRNA Treatments—FOXO3a siRNA SMARTpool was synthesized by Dharmacon, (Lafayette, CO) according to rat LOC294515 (XM_215421) FOXO3a (predicted). VSMC were seeded into 100-mm dishes, 6-well plates, or Nunc Lab-Tek II™ chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at 0.7 × 106/dish, 1 × 105/plate, and 5 × 104/well, respectively. After 24 h, the siRNA was diluted to a 2 μm working solution and delivered to cells at 100 nm final concentration through a lipid-mediated DharmaFECT Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon). A siGLO Cyclophiling B siRNA (Dharmacon) was also included as a transfection control. Western Blots—Antibody for MnSOD was from OXIS (Foster City, CA); antibodies for FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO3a (Ser253), Akt, phospho-Akt (Thr308), and (Ser473) were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); the monoclonal antibody for the IGF-1R β-chain was from Biomol (Plymouth, PA) and for β-actin from Abcam. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted from VSMC as described previously (27Li M. Mossman B.T. Kolpa E. Timblin C.R. Shukla A. Taatjes D.J. Fukagawa N.K. J. Cell Physiol. 2003; 197: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 15 μg of each nuclear protein or 20 μg of each cytoplasmic protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight with shaking at 4 °C. After incubation with corresponding secondary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized using a SuperSignal™ West Pico Trial Kit (Pierce) and exposed to radiographic film. The blots were reprobed with a β-actin antibody to detect nuclear (28McDonald D. Carrero G. Andrin C. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or cytoplasmic β-actin as the loading controls. The images and densities were captured with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Quantity One software version 4.2 (Bio-Rad). MnSOD Activity Assay—MnSOD activity was visualized by a method modified from the classical nitro blue tetrazolium staining (29Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9906) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60-μg protein samples were loaded onto the 12% native gel in 1× Tris-glycine running butter and run at 120 V. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with 2.4 mm nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 28 μm riboflavin and 28 mm TEMED in the dark for 30 min. The gels were illuminated under bright fluorescent light for 30 min and sandwiched in transparent paper for image scanning. Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain was used to determine protein loading. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-stranded oligonucleotides from the rat MnSOD gene (rat SOD2, X56600) promoter region, DBE consensus (DBECons), rSOD2 mutant, and octamer-1 (OCT-1, J00565) with a OCT-1 consensus binding site were synthesized by Invitrogen: rSOD2-P1a, 5′-CTCAAATATACCTCTTGTTTATTACATCAAGA-3′;rSOD2-P1b, 5′-TCTTGATGTAATAAACAAGAGGTATATTTGAG-3′;rSOD2-P2a, 5′-ACAGTATGCTAACCTAAACAATTAAAAGAGAA-3′; rSOD2-P2b, 5′-TTCTCTTTTAATTGTTTAGGTTAGCATACTGT-3′; DBEConsa, 5′-AATATACCTCTTGTTTACTACATC-3′; DBEConsb, 5′-GATGTAGTAAACAAGAGGTATATT-3′; rSOD2P2Muta, 5′-ACAGTATGCTAACCTAAATAATTAAAAGAGAA-3′;rSOD2P2Mutb, 5′-TTCTCTTTTAATTATTTAGGTTAGCATACTGT-3′; OCT-1a, 5′-TGAGGGTATGCAAATTATTAAGAAGC-3′; and OCT-1b, 5′-GCTTCTTAATAATTTGCATACCCTCA-3′. The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and EMSA and supershift EMSA were performed as described previously (30Li M. Liu R.M. Timblin C.R. Meyer S.G. Mossman B.T. Fukagawa N.K. J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, the competitive double-stranded oligonucleotides were added before loading of labeled probes at 100:1 molar ratio. Immunocytochemistry for Akt and FOXO3a—The cells grown on chamber slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with -20 °C methanol for 5 min. After blocking in a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum for 1 h, rabbit anti-FOXO3a, and mouse anti-P-Akt (Cell Signaling) were diluted to 1:200 and applied onto each of the chamber slides for over-night incubation at 4 °C. The slides were incubated with 1:400 diluted Cy3-Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson, West Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature for 2 h, followed by 15 min with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). The slides were finally examined using confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510 (CSLM, from Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) and scanned for Cy3 staining (560-615 nm), AF 488 (505-530 nm), and DAPI (420-480 nm). Akt Kinase Assay—An Akt Kinase Assay Kit was obtained from Cell Signaling in which an immobilized Akt monoclonal antibody was designed preferentially for phosphorylated Akt at serine 473 (P-Akt). Briefly, Akt was isolated from 50 μg of nuclear proteins from each treatment through immunoprecipitation (IP) overnight with 20 μl of immobilized Akt antibody at 4 °C. Following multiple washings with cell lysis buffer and kinase buffer supplied by the kit, the pellet with bound phosphorylated Akt was suspended in 50 μl of 1 × kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μl of 10 mm ATP and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) fusion protein and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C, the samples were heated and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels for further processing of Western blots. The phosphorylated GSK bands were then detected by phospho-GSK-3a/b (Ser21/9) antibody and compared with total GSK. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—VSMC histones were cross-linked to DNA by adding 1% formaldehyde directly to the culture medium for 15 min at 37 °C. The ChIP assay kit was from Upstate (Chicago, IL). The cells were lysed with 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer/1 × 106 cells, containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA in a range of 200-1000 bp with a 600-watt ultrasonic processor setting at 30% of maximum power. Cross-links in part of the chromatin were recovered for visualization of shearing efficiency on an agarose gel. Twenty μl of chromatin in the supernatant of sonicated cell lysates were saved as input/starting material, whereas the rest of the chromatin in the supernatant was diluted in a 2-ml volume with ChIP dilution buffer, which was then precleaned by protein agarose slurry. FOXO3a-bound chromatin was then immunoprecipitated by 4 μg of antibody for FOXO3a from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and then dissociated with proteins through the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. In addition, anti-mouse IgG and anti-RNA polymerase II antibodies were also included in the IP to process DNA for a negative control or a ChIP quality control, respectively. The purified DNA (ChIP DNA) from FOXO3a-bound chromatin and controls was finally used as a template for PCR amplification. In addition to rSOD2-P1a and rSOD2-P2b, two other primers used in the rat SOD2 promoter (X56600) were: SOD2P-F, 5′-TCATGGCCACTATGCCTCAA-3′; and SOD2P-R, 5′-TCTCAGCTGTGTCCTCTTCT-3′. The primers spanning glyceraldehde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NM_017008), which was cross-linked to acetyl histone H3, were also designed for quality control DNA: GAPDH-F, 5′-CATTGACCTCAACTACATGG-3′; and GAPDH-R, 5′-TGACCAGCTTCCCATTCTCA-3′. Up to 1 μg of template was added to 50 μl of PCR mixture containing 1.25 units of Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer with MgCl2, and 200 nm of each primer. PCR was run under the following conditions: 94 °C for 14 min for 1 cycle; 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min for 14 cycles; 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 20 cycles; and a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from control and siRNA-treated VSMC with UltraspecTM-II (Biotecx, Houston, TX). RT-PCR primer sets for FOXO3a (XM_215421) and MnSOD (NM_017051) mRNA were specially designed crossing exons: FOXO3a-F, 5′-CGGACAAACGGCTCACTTT-3′; FOXO3a-R, 5-TCGGCTCTTGGTGTACTTG-3′; MnSOD-2F, 5′-CAACTCAGGTTGCTCTTCA-3′; and MnSOD-R, 5′-CGACCTTGCTCCTTATTGA-3′. QuantumRNA™ Universal 18 S primers from Ambion (Austin, TX) was mixed with the supplied Competimer at the ratio of 3:7 and used as internal control. One μg of total RNA was added in 20 μl of reverse transcription mixture containing 1 μl of MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 1× MMLV RT buffer, 1 μl of random primers (Invitrogen), 0.25 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 42 °C for 70 min followed by at 98 °C for 3 min. After reverse transcription, 1-2 μl of cDNA was loaded into a total PCR mixture (20 μl) composed of 0.5 unit of Ampli Taq Gold, 1× PCR buffer with MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 22.5 nm of each forward or reverse primers, and 1 μl of 18 S primer mixture. PCR was run under the same condition as described above and then visualized on 2% agarose gels. Age Reduces MnSOD Protein and Enzyme Activity in VSMC—As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), MnSOD protein levels in VSMC from old rats were ∼35% lower than that found in young rats when VSMC were grown in control medium (5 mm glucose) for 72 h and ∼44% lower than young when grown in 12.5 mm glucose medium. At supraphysiologic levels of glucose (25 mm) or after the addition of TNF-α, there were no overall effects of age on MnSOD. Post hoc analysis revealed significant differences between young and old under control and high physiologic glucose conditions (p < 0.02). Using the nitro blue tetrazolium native gel assay to determine the catalytic activity of MnSOD, VSMC from old rats consistently showed lower activity under all conditions when compared young rats (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that VSMC from old rats have an overall lower protein content and activity of MnSOD under basal (5 mm) glucose or moderately higher (12.5 mm) glucose. In contrast, MnSOD levels and activity in cells from the young rats did not appear to change in response to high glucose or TNF-α, suggesting sufficient capacity to handle oxidative stress induced by these agents. Evidence for FOXO3a Binding to SOD2 Promoter—Because our goal was to determine the relationship between the regulation of FOXO3a and the transcription of MnSOD, we next demonstrated that direct binding of FOXO3a to the MnSOD gene occurs in the rat, as has been reported in human cells (15Kops G.J.P.L. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W.A. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). 9.8 kb of the rat MnSOD gene was previously isolated and sequenced (31Ho Y.S. Howard A.J. Crapo J.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A core sequence (TTGTTTAC), also known as a consensus of DAF-16 family protein-binding element (DBE) (14Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), then was used to search 2 kb of the rat SOD2 promoter, including another 5-kb upstream segment of the SOD2 in rat chromosome 1 genomic contig (NW_047553). No identical sequence was found, but two suboptimal sequences, each with one nucleotide difference, were obtained. One was TTGTTTAT located at 990-997 in SOD2, and the other was an inverse of TTGTTTAG located at 1309-1302. Based on the adjacent sequence of the SOD2 promoter, we were then able to design oligonucleotides for a DNA binding assay. Two 32-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized, rSOD2-P1 and rSOD2-P2, each containing one of the binding sites. The oligonucleotides, containing a consensus DBE or mutant DBE with TTATTTAC, were also synthesized. As shown in Fig. 2A, two samples of nuclear protein could bind to probe rSOD2-P2 with the TTGTTTAG site (lane 3 and 4) rather than rSOD2-P1 with the TTGTTTAT site (lanes 1 and 2) or rSOD2 mutant with a TTATTTAC site (lanes 5 and 6). The binding of nuclear protein to rSOD2-P2 could be competed by the DBE consensus sequence (lane 11), but not by the mutant version (lane 10). These data demonstrate that nuclear protein from VSMC can bind to the SOD2 promoter DNA in a cell-free binding assay. A supershift assay using an antibody for FOXO3a showed a relatively light band (lane 8), but no shifted band was observed. To further confirm that binding occurs between the FOXO3a protein and the SOD2 promoter, two primer sets adjacent to TTGTTTAG were designed for use in a more powerful ChIP assay. Primer F and R were 217 bp apart, whereas primer 1a and 2b were 345 bp apart (Fig. 2B). The native binding complex was preserved through chromatin cross-linking before collecting the cells, and FOXO3a-bound chromatin was obtained through IP. The results show that the exact sizes of PCR products, as predicted using the primer combinations, were amplified from the purified CHIP DNA (Fig. 2B). These studies for the first time identified a specific DBE site for FOXO3a binding to the rat SOD2 promoter. Effect of Age on FOXO3a Binding to the SOD2 DNA—Having demonstrated FOXO3a binding to SOD2 at the particular DBE site, we were then able to compare the binding activity between young and old VSMC using a DNA binding assay. An EMSA using only the rSOD2-P2 probe (Fig. 3A, left panel) showed that FOXO3a binding activity was lower in nuclear extracts from old VSMC grown in control and 12.5 mm glucose media but equal to or slightly higher when grown in 25 mm glucose or TNF-α. Because the EMSA approach does not easily lend itself to quantification for the lack of a loading control, a DNA probe containing an OCT-1-binding site was used. When the binding assay was run with the two probes, two distinguishable binding bands were seen (Fig. 3A, right panel). Normalizing to OCT-1 binding, the differences in the binding activity between young and old were confirmed but only significant under control (5 mm glucose) conditions (p = 0.04), as shown in Fig. 3B. FOXO3a Controls MnSOD Transcription—Thus far we have shown that old age is associated with lower MnSOD protein and activity as well as lower FOXO3a binding to SOD2 DNA in explanted VSMC. To establish whether FOXO3a is causally involved in transcriptional regulation of the MnSOD gene, the siRNA technique was used and inhibited FOXO3a gene expression as shown in the representative CSLM image in Fig. 4A. FOXO3a protein in VSMC transfected with a scrambled construct was abundant in VSMC the perinuclear region and within the nucleus. Reduction was evident when VSMC were treated with FOXO3a siRNA. The upper panels of Fig. 4B further demonstrated that the reduction of FOXO3a RNA was ∼70% using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and the reduction of nuclear FOXO3a protein was ∼58% by Western blot analyses. As expected, MnSOD RNA and protein levels were also lower with FOXO3a siRNA inhibition, ∼49% reduction in RNA and ∼51% reduction in protein, respectively, as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 4B. Furthermore, the correlated changes were confirmed by the EMSA result shown in the far right panel of Fig. 4B that shows only ∼46% of FOXO3a binding activity remained using the siRNA approach. In summary, these data not only provide proof that FOXO3a controls MnSOD transcription but also demonstrate consistent changes between MnSOD mRNA expression and protein levels using the same approach.

https://openalex.org/W2016122949,"TRPM8 represents an ion channel activated by cold temperatures and cooling agents, such as menthol, that underlies the cold-induced excitation of sensory neurons. Interestingly, the only human tissue outside the peripheral nervous system, in which the expression of TRPM8 transcripts has been detected at high levels, is the prostate, a tissue not exposed to any essential temperature variations. Here we show that the TRPM8 cloned from human prostate and heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells is regulated by the Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) signaling pathway with its end products, lysophospholipids (LPLs), acting as its endogenous ligands. LPLs induce prominent prolongation of TRPM8 channel openings that are hardly detectable with other stimuli (e.g. cold, menthol, and depolarization) and that account for more than 90% of the total channel open time. Down-regulation of iPLA(2) resulted in a strong inhibition of TRPM8-mediated functional responses and abolished channel activation. The action of LPLs on TRPM8 channels involved either changes in the local lipid bilayer tension or interaction with the critical determinant(s) in the transmembrane channel core. Based on this, we propose a novel concept of TRPM8 regulation with the involvement of iPLA(2) stimulation. This mechanism employs chemical rather than physical (temperature change) signaling and thus may be the main regulator of TRPM8 activation in organs not exposed to any essential temperature variations, as in the prostate gland."
https://openalex.org/W1981791477,"Hexameric helicases and translocases are required for numerous essential nucleic-acid transactions. To better understand the mechanisms by which these enzymes recognize target substrates and use nucleotide hydrolysis to power molecular movement, we have determined the structure of the Rho transcription termination factor, a hexameric RNA/DNA helicase, with single-stranded RNA bound to the motor domains of the protein. The structure reveals a closed-ring “trimer of dimers” conformation for the hexamer that contains an unanticipated arrangement of conserved loops required for nucleic-acid translocation. RNA extends across a shallow intersubunit channel formed by conserved amino acids required for RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and translocation and directly contacts a conserved lysine, just upstream of the catalytic GKT triad, in the phosphate-binding (P loop) motif of the ATP-binding pocket. The structure explains the molecular effects of numerous mutations and provides new insights into the links between substrate recognition, ATP turnover, and coordinated strand movement."

In clinical studies, the cellular level of YB-1 closely correlates with tumor growth and prognosis. To understand the role of YB-1 in vivo, especially in the developmental process, we generated YB-1 knock-out mice, which are embryonic lethal and exhibit exencephaly associated with abnormal patterns of cell proliferation within the neuroepithelium. β-Actin expression and F-actin formation were reduced in the YB-1 null embryo and YB-1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that the neural tube defect is caused by abnormal cell morphology and actin assembly within the neuroepithelium. Fibroblasts derived from YB-1-/- embryos demonstrated reduced growth and cell density.

The Y-box protein family is characterized by a highly conserved cold-shock domain that binds nucleic acids and shares homology with the prokaryotic cold-shock proteins (1Makino Y. Ohga T. Toh S.

YB-1 protects mammalian cells from the cytotoxic effects induced by DNA damage. We previously reported that human cancer cell lines overexpressing YB-1 resist cisplatin, whereas the reduction of YB-1 itself leads to increased sensitivity to cisplatin, other DNA-interacting drugs, and UV irradiation (2Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). YB-1 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, but translocates to the nucleus following UV irradiation of cells or treatment with anticancer drugs (12Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K.

Moreover, overexpression or the nuclear presence or absence of YB-1 plays a critical role in P-glycoprotein expression, malignant progression, poor prognosis, and global drug resistance (2Kohno K.

To understand how YB-1 proteins exert their multiple functions, we previously established mouse embryonic stem cell lines with a heterozygously targeted disruption of the YB-1 gene (YB-1+/-), and we demonstrated their hypersensitivity to cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin C (17Shibahara K. Uchiumi T. Fukuda T. Kura S. Tominaga Y. Maehara Y. Kohno K. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Kuwano M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we carried out targeted disruptions of the mouse YB-1 gene to elucidate the role of YB-1 molecules in vivo. We show that YB-1 plays a critical role in early development in mice. The targeted disruptions were fatal in the late embryonic stage, and animals showed defects in the anterior neural tube. Furthermore, we investigated the role of YB-1 in cell proliferation and the transformation activity of MEFs. Animals—Animals were mated overnight, and the females were examined for a vaginal plug the following morning. Noon on the day of vaginal plug detection was recorded as day E0.5. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines for animal experimentation at Kyushu University, Japan, and the University of Occupational Environmental Health, Japan. All experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of Kyushu University and the University of Occupational Environmental Health, Japan. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization of digoxygeninlabeled probes was performed as described previously (18Yoshida S. Ohbo K. Takakura A. Takebayashi H. Okada T. Abe K. Nabeshima Y. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The digoxigenin-labeled hybridization probe was prepared from an in vitro transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI) using the mouse YB-1 full-length cDNA (11Fukuda T. Ashizuka M. Nakamura T.

Generation of YB-1 (MSY-1)-deficient Mice—Embryonic stem cells were transfected with the linearized targeting construct that deleted exons 5 and 6 of mouse YB-1 (MSY-1) (17Shibahara K. Uchiumi T.

Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and recombinant clones were selected and microinjected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocytes. Chimeric males that transmitted the mutant allele to the germ line were mated with C57BL/6 females, and germ line transmission of the mutant allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (17Shibahara K.

Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant animals. For embryo genotyping, DNA was extracted from the corresponding embryonic tissue removed from microscope sections and amplified by 30 cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min using the following primers: YB5-1, 5′-GGAAACCATGTGGAGATGTC, and YB3-1, 5′-GGAGGTTCAAAAGCACACTC (wild-type allele); neo5, 5′-GATTGCACGCAGGTTCTCCG, and neo3, 5′-CAAGAAGGCGATAGAAGGCG (mutant allele). Immunohistochemistry—Cells seeded the previous day on glass coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and then incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min. Next, the coverslips were washed with PBS, incubated with 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified container, and then incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). After washing three times with PBS, glass slides were mounted using Slowfade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was diluted 1:200 and used to detect F-actin organization in mouse tissue and MEF cells. Immunoblot Analysis—Embryos (E11.5) and MEF cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (17Shibahara K. Uchiumi T. Fukuda T. Kura S. Tominaga Y. Maehara Y. Kohno K. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Kuwano M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antibodies against YB-1 (19Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies against β-actin (AC-15; Sigma), EF-1 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), p70 S6K (BD Biosciences), eIF4E (BD Biosciences), Akt (9272; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and PCNA (sc-56, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Band intensities were measured by Image Gauge (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Immunohistochemical Analysis of Mouse Embryo Sections—Mouse embryo tissue was fixed with 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections (5 μm thick) were cut and mounted on silane-coated glass slides. After routine deparaffination and rehydration through gradient ethanol immersions, the slides were steam-heated for 20 min to expose the antigen. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 3% (v/v) H2O2 followed by three 5-min washes in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the sections were blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS. Specimens were incubated for 1 h with the YB-1 and β-actin antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, followed by three 5-min washes in PBS, and then incubation with the FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min. Specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s and washed with tap water. The sections were immediately dehydrated by sequential immersion in gradient ethanol and xylene, then mounted with Permount (ProSciTech, Australia), and coverslips. Images were obtained using a Leica DMRX upright microscope coupled with a digital camera (Leica, Germany). Culture of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF)—Heterozygous male and female mutant mice were bred to obtain wild-type (YB-1+/+), heterozygous (YB-1+/-), and homozygous mutant (YB-1-/-) embryos. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Outgrowths were inspected daily, and their development was monitored by photography. Proliferation Assay—Cells (1 × 104) were seeded in triplicate in 35-mm dishes and grown under high serum (10% fetal bovine serum) conditions. Dishes were trypsinized and counted daily using a Coulter-type cell size analyzer (CDA-500, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Transformation Assay—Cells (3 × 103) were seeded in triplicate in 10-cm dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). Growth medium was changed every 3 days. After 14-16 days, transformation efficiency was evaluated by counting individual foci. All transformation assays were repeated at least three times. Representative plates were stained with Giemsa and photographed. Anchorage-independent Growth—Growth in soft agar was assayed in 35-mm dishes prepared with a lower layer of 0.7% agar (Invitrogen) overlaid with top agar (0.4%) containing 5 × 103 suspended cells. Cells were fed every 3 days with media. Fifteen days after plating, colonies were stained with 2% crystal violet, and colonies with >50 cells were counted on an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Knockdown Analysis Using siRNA—siRNA transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were transfected with stealth RNA interference-negative control duplexes and YB-1 siRNA oligonucleotides (CAACGUCGGUAUCGCCGAAACUUCA) at a final concentration of 100 μm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, cell number and cell volume were quantified using an electronic sizing technique with a CDA-500 Coulter-type cell size analyzer (Sysmex). Cells were also harvested for Western blotting (17Shibahara K. Uchiumi T. Fukuda T. Kura S. Tominaga Y. Maehara Y. Kohno K. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Kuwano M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Disruption of YB-1 Causes Embryonic Lethality—To elucidate the function of YB-1 during mouse development, we used gene targeting to generate YB-1-deficient mice. Although the heterozygous offspring appeared normal and fertile (Table 1), Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from 3-week-old mice revealed that no live animals (of 144 births from heterozygote crosses) were homozygous for the YB-1 mutation. Thus, loss of YB-1 results in embryonic lethality.TABLE 1YB-1 deficiency causes embryonic lethalityStageLittersEmbryos+/++/−−/−Abnormal (−/−)% expected (−/−)E10.5151202759342118E11.51366173316996E12.514821848161673E13.51812036503434118E14.512811850131357E15.57561825111177E16.5317593364E17.595526253318E18.53285201112Adult331856711800 Open table in a new tab To determine the time at which the YB-1 mutant becomes lethal, we examined embryos from YB-1+/- intercrosses at various developmental stages. PCR genotyping data of nine mouse embryos at E11.5 revealed two wild-types, five heterozygotes, and two homozygous mutants, in accordance with the expected Mendelian ratio (Fig. 1A and confirmed by PCR with four additional primer sets; data not shown). In contrast to wild-type embryos, the growth of YB-1-/- embryos appeared retarded as early as E10.5 (Fig. 1B). Most YB-1-/- embryos had been resorbed by E17.5 and YB-1-/- embryos died between E14.5 and E18.5 (Table 1). The phenotype of YB-1-/- embryos includes retarded growth, hemorrhage, and severe anemia but is otherwise normal in appearance (Fig. 1C). Mouse YB-1 Is Expressed in Most Tissues during Embryogenesis—We reported previously that human YB-1 is expressed ubiquitously in the adult (19Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar). The YB-1 transcript and protein have also been detected in mouse embryonic stem cells (17Shibahara K. Uchiumi T. Fukuda T. Kura S. Tominaga Y. Maehara Y. Kohno K. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Kuwano M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of mouse YB-1 is developmentally regulated, we performed in situ hybridization on mouse embryos tissue sections at E13.5. We found that mouse YB-1 mRNA is expressed at whole body, specifically at high levels in the brain region (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression in the brain is widespread, with some enrichment in the cortical plate, diencephalons (thalamus), roof of the neopallial cortex, and choroid plexus extending into lateral ventricle, midbrain, and cerebellar primordium (Fig. 2B). YB-1 mRNA is also strongly expressed in the posterior mesoderm, the craniofacial region, root ganglion, kidney, liver, head mesoderm, and in the developing heart (Fig. 2B). These data support a critical role for YB-1 expression during embryonic development. YB-1 protein expression in E13.5 embryos is almost ubiquitous, with high expression detected in the central nervous system, lung, kidney, and heart (Fig. 2C). YB-1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm region in wild-type embryos. No expression was detected in either connective tissues or bone of wild-type embryos and was absent from YB-1-/- embryos (Fig. 2C). Neural Tube Closure Is Impaired in YB-1-deficient Mice—As shown in Fig. 1B, YB-1-/- embryos were smaller than their wild-type littermates, although no gross abnormalities were observed in organ or limb development. When examined at E10.5 to E13.5, ∼30% of the YB-1-/- embryos exhibited exencephaly in the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions (12/80 YB-1-/- embryos) (Fig. 1B). Almost all of the mutant embryos were pale and anemic, as a consequence of severe blood loss through hemorrhage (seen as petechial and paintbrush patterns in Fig. 1C). Histological analysis of other parts of the mutant embryos revealed that the YB-1 mutation does not affect organogenesis, because all major organs were intact (data not shown). Exencephaly typically reflects a defect in closure of the anterior neural tube, which normally occurs between E8.5 and E9.5 (20Fleming A. Copp A.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 showed a severe brain malformation characterized by exencephaly, expanded midbrain, and a disrupted cortical zone. Examination of older embryos (E13.5 to E15.5) revealed that the mutant brains failed to develop further. Frontal and cross-sections of the hindbrain region of the E11.5 to E13.5 neural tube defect (NTD) embryos clearly demonstrate incomplete neural tube closure (Fig. 3, B and C), and the anterior neural tubes of most E10.5 to E11.5 YB-1-/- embryos failed to close with varying degrees of severity. No other cranial or neural tube abnormalities such as holoprosencephaly or impaired caudal neural closure were observed. Those YB-1-/- mice that achieved skull closure also possessed major brain structures but demonstrated retarded development of the maxilla and mandible (Fig. 3D). Most E15.5 YB-1-/- embryos had a subcutaneous edema of the whole body (Fig. 3D), which was not observed in wild-type and heterozygous mice. Moreover, fetal livers of YB-1-/- embryos were smaller than those of their YB-1+/- and YB-1+/+ littermates, which is suggestive of hepatic hematopoiesis (Fig. 3E). YB-1-/- embryos were also anemic as a result of macroscopically detectable defects in erythropoiesis of the fetal livers (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that exencephaly, smaller size of organ, and severe hemorrhage account for the embryonic lethality of the YB-1 mutation. Enhanced EF-1 Expression in YB-1-/- Embryos—Using whole-cell extracts of eight E11.5 mouse embryos (YB-1+/+ (n = 1), YB-1+/- (n = 5), and YB-1-/- (n = 2)), the expression of other proteins involved in the regulation of translation was examined by immunoblotting. Western blotting using antibodies against the YB-1 N- and C-terminal ends revealed that E11.5 YB-1-/- embryos did not express either the full-length or the truncated YB-1 protein (Fig. 4A; data not shown). YB-1+/- embryos expressed ∼70-80% as much YB-1 as wild-type embryos. The expression of the serine/threonine protein kinase p70 S6K (S6K) was slightly reduced in YB-1 null embryos compared with wild-type and heterozygous embryos, whereas human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), Akt, and PCNA expression was unchanged. However, translational elongation factor-1 (EF-1) was overexpressed in YB-1-/- embryos, which might reflect a compensatory mechanism. Decreased Proliferation in YB-1-/- MEFs—To examine the molecular basis of YB-1 in cellular proliferation, we established MEFs from wild-type (n = 4), YB-1+/- (n = 4), and YB-1-/- (n = 4) embryos from three independent litters at E13.5. Heterozygous MEFs (numbers 2, 56, 72, and 73) expressed approximately half as much YB-1 as wild-type MEFs, whereas YB-1 null MEFs (numbers 3, 60, 74, and 75) expressed no YB-1. PCNA expression was comparable between all MEFs (Fig. 4B). During the first three passages, cell proliferation and population doubling was comparable between YB-1+/+, YB-1+/-, and YB-1-/- MEFs. From passages 4 to 5 onward, all YB-1-/- MEFs analyzed showed greatly reduced proliferation and a reduction in cell numbers under base-line culture conditions (Fig. 4C). YB-1+/- and YB-1+/+ MEFs proliferated at a similar rate. YB-1-/- MEFs exhibited premature senescence and an extended crisis as determined by an enlarged and flattened cell morphology (Fig. 5B). After 100 days of culture, YB-1-/- MEF cells showed reduced cell proliferation and density, which could be completely recovered to wild-type levels by expression of the YB-1 vector (Fig. 4D). YB-1 expression from this vector was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate the importance of YB-1 in cell proliferation and maintaining cell morphology. NTD and Actin Assembly—NTDs involving mutations in genes that regulate actin arrangement at the cell membrane or play alternative roles in actin synthesis have been reported previously (21Harris M.J. Juriloff D.M. Teratology. 1999; 60: 292-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In all cases, the defects included exencephaly caused by a failure of cranial neural fold elevation, as observed in the YB-1-/- embryos. In addition, YB-1 has been shown to associate with β-actin mRNA and the actin protein (11Fukuda T. Ashizuka M. Nakamura T. Shibahara K. Maeda K. Izumi H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Ruzanov P.V. Evdokimova V.M. Korneeva N.L. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3487-3496PubMed Google Scholar). We used immunofluorescence to investigate whether β-actin synthesis and rearrangement are affected in E13.5 YB-1-/- embryos, and we showed that β-actin protein levels were greatly reduced in the cephalic region of the YB-1 null embryo, in comparison with the wild type (Fig. 5A). Phalloidin staining of E13.5 brain sections revealed a substantially decreased accumulation of F-actin along the basal edge of neuroepithelial cells in the null mutant embryo compared with the wild type (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the reduced β-actin levels and F-actin filament formation might be responsible for the NTDs of YB-1-/- embryos. In some mutant animals, a reduced apical constriction of the neuroepithelial cells within this region was also observed. We next examined the role of YB-1 in cell morphology and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Wild-type MEFs had an elongated morphology and an F-actin-rich polarized cytoskeleton. In contrast, YB-1-/- MEFs were round in shape, with lower cell density (Fig. 5B). Most strikingly, mutant cells lacked appreciable F-actin structures such as fibers or bundles. Instead, a small amount of F-actin was seen as a fuzzy phalloidin signal that was consistently found in the subcellular region rather than in the cell perimeter (Fig. 5B). These results show that YB-1 is essential for organizing F-actin and maintaining the cell shape of MEFs. As YB-1 possesses RNA binding activity and has been shown to regulate protein synthesis and mRNA stability (11Fukuda T. Ashizuka M. Nakamura T. Shibahara K. Maeda K. Izumi H. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Uchiumi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jurchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next investigated the interaction of YB-1 with β-actin mRNA. An in vitro RNA gel shift assay was performed using purified recombinant YB-1 and a probe corresponding to full-length β-actin mRNA. Recombinant YB-1 clearly bound to β-actin mRNA, whereas the control glutathione S-transferase protein failed to do so (supplemental Fig. 1A). To determine whether the interaction occurs in vivo, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using β-actin-specific primers on mRNA isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with YB-1. β-Actin transcript was amplified from wild-type but not from YB-1-/- MEFs (supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that YB-1 indeed interacts with β-actin mRNA in MEFs. This interaction might regulate the activity or availability of β-actin in protein synthesis. Reduced Anchorage-independent Growth by YB-1-/- Cells—We established three wild-type and three YB-1-/- immortalized MEF lines after continuous culturing for more than 6 months to investigate their spontaneous transformation ability in vitro. Although the wild-type cells did not show any signs of a decrease in proliferative rate, YB-1-/- MEFs failed to undergo morphological transformation and remained contact-inhibited after 2 weeks of cultivation (Fig. 6A, upper and middle panel). Following re-expression of transgenic YB-1, however, the MEFs underwent morphological transformation, whereas vector-only transduced MEFs failed to do so (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Furthermore, a one-fifth reduction in anchorage-independent growth was observed in the YB-1-/- MEF clones (Fig. 6B). To confirm these results, we investigated whether knockdown of endogenous YB-1 via siRNA affected cell growth and size. The siRNA oligonucleotide was directed against the YB-1 C-terminal region, with the exception of the cold-shock domain. Western blot analysis of siRNA-transfected MEFs revealed that YB-1 protein levels were reduced to 20% of wild-type levels 72 h after transfection (Fig. 7A). YB-1 siRNA-transfected MEFs also showed a reduced growth rate and were ∼10% larger (22 μm in diameter) than the negative control transfected MEFs (20 μm in diameter) (Fig. 7, B and C). This phenomenon was consistent with our earlier observations of YB-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 5B) and shows that YB-1 is involved in both regulating cell growth rates and cell size. In an anchorageindependent transformation assay in soft agar, YB-1 expressing MEFs (number 70) showed morphological transformation, but siRNA-transfected MEFs demonstrated reduced transformation activity (Fig. 7D). These results confirm our earlier finding that YB-1 is necessary for anchorage-independent transformation activity (see also Fig. 6A). This study demonstrates that YB-1 plays a critical role in DNA repair, transcription, mRNA turnover, and translational control. Previously, Lu et al. (24Lu Z.H. Books J.T. Ley T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4625-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported that targeted disruption of YB-1 exon 3 (encoding part of the cold-shock domain) causes embryonic lethality and showed tha"

Besides hyperphosphorylation, other modifications of the Tau protein, such as cross-linking, are likely to contribute to the characteristic features of paired helical filaments, including their insolubility and resistance against proteolytic degradation. In this study, we have investigated whether the four reactive carbonyl compounds acrolein, malondialdehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal accelerate the formation of Tau oligomers, thioflavin T-positive aggregates, and fibrils using wild-type and seven pseudophosphorylated mutant Tau proteins. Acrolein and methylglyoxal were the most reactive compounds followed by glyoxal and malondialdehyde in terms of formation of Tau dimers and higher molecular weight oligomers. Furthermore, acrolein and methylglyoxal induced the formation of thioflavin T-fluorescent aggregates in a triple pseudophosphorylation-mimicking mutant to a slightly higher degree than wild-type Tau. Analysis of the Tau aggregates by electron microscopy study showed that formation of fibrils using wild-type Tau and several Tau mutants could be observed with acrolein and methylglyoxal but not with glyoxal and malondialdehyde. Our results suggest that reactive carbonyl compounds, particularly methylglyoxal and acrolein, could accelerate tangle formation in vivo and that this process could be slightly accelerated, at least in the case of methylglyoxal and acrolein, by hyperphosphorylation. Interference with the formation or the reaction of these reactive carbonyl compounds could be a promising way of inhibiting tangle formation and neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies.

Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of bundles of paired helical filaments (PHFs), 3The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filament; AD, Alzheimer disease; AGE, advanced glycation end product; ALE, advanced lipid peroxidation end product; MDA, malondialdehyde; MG, methylglyoxal; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; RCC, reactive carbonyl compound; CML, carboxymethyllysine. consist of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated forms of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Neurofibrillary tangles are major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD) (1Nieto A. Correas I. Montejo de Garcini E. Avila J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Under non-pathological conditions, Tau is a developmentally regulated phosphoprotein that promotes assembly and stability of microtubules and is thus involved in axonal transport (2Cleveland D.W.

In AD and other tauopathies, Tau proteins aggregate and form fibrillar insoluble intracellular inclusions, so-called neurofibrillary tangles. It has been suggested that ionic interactions and covalent cross-linking contribute to pathological Tau aggregation and tangle formation.

More recently, reactive carbonyl compounds (RCCs), which are increased under conditions of oxidative stress and in aging (18Lovell M.A. Xie C. Markesbery W.R. Neurobiol.

Glyoxal, a product of lipid peroxidation or glycation, and methylglyoxal (MG), formed by oxidation of sugars or produced as an intermediate of triosephosphate, threonine, and glycine catabolism, reacts with proteins to form “advanced glycation end products” (AGEs). Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that glyoxal/MG-derived AGE antibodies label predominantly PHF in aggregates (26Ko L.W. Ko E.C. Nacharaju P. Liu W.K. Chang E. Kenessey A. Yen S.H.

Hyperphosphorylation is a second important modification, which has been suggested to contribute to Tau aggregation. Tau can be phosphorylated at ∼30 sites; however, little is known about which phosphorylation sites actually enhance Tau fibril formation. In in vitro aggregation assays, introduction of a negative charge by substitution of serine or threonine by glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues (“pseudophosphorylation”) has been shown to mimic the effect of phosphorylation of Tau (29Eidenmüller J. Fath T. Maas T. Pool M. Sontag E. Brandt R. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such Tau mutants have been used to examine the influence of phosphorylation at distinct sites on Tau aggregation induced by heparin and certain metal ions. It has been shown that these “pseudophosphorylated” Tau mutants, particularly those carrying substitutions in C-terminal regions, have a slightly higher tendency to aggregate than the Tau wild-type protein (30Haase C. Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we wanted to elucidate whether the reactive carbonyl compounds acrolein, glyoxal, MG, or MDA are able to induce or accelerate Tau oligomerization, formation of thioflavin T-positive Tau aggregates, and formation of PHFs. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether this aggregation process is accelerated by phosphorylation at specific sites using eight different pseudophosphorylated Tau mutants. Construction of Expression Plasmids for Tau Mutants and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Constructs for the Tau mutants were prepared as described previously (30Haase C. Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, codons for the amino acids representing the potential phosphorylation sites (Thr or Ser) were changed to GAA (glutamate) or GAT (aspartate) using one-tube, two-stage, PCR-directed in vitro mutagenesis. Mutant blunt-ended constructs were cloned into the EcoRV site of pZerO-2 and verified by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, Tau constructs were cloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 and expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. pGEX-6P-1 plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL) cells. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol overnight. Cells were grown to late exponential phase (A600 = 1.5) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactosidase for 2 h at 30 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the cell pellet resuspended in 120 of the volume of 1× binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). Cells were then lysed using a sonicator. To facilitate solubilization of protein, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, lysozyme (4000 units/ml), and benzonase (4 units/ml) were added, and the mixture slowly shaken for 1 h at 4°C. The clarified lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h to bind the expressed fusion proteins. After washing the matrix two times with binding buffer, the recombinant protein was eluted by site-specific proteolysis using PreScission™ protease (10 units/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentration was quantified according to the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Modification of Tau with Reactive Carbonyl Compounds—Glyoxal (trimer dihydrate) and acrolein (Sigma) were used without further purification. Methylglyoxal was freshly distilled from a 40% solution and then stored at –80 °C before use. Its concentration was determined according to a method described previously (32Allen R.E. Lo T.W. Thornalley P.J. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Malondialdehyde was generated in situ from malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl)acetate by hydrolysis with 1 mm HCl for 5 min. Tau protein (3 mg/ml) was dissolved in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) and incubated with each of the carbonyl compounds (in the concentrations indicated) in a microvessel at 37 °C for up to 96 h. Determination of Tau Modification and Aggregate Formation by Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Tau samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or for Western blots; Tau samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked in Roti-Block (ROTH, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. Two different AGE antibodies (6D12 and 4G9) were used. The 6D12 antibody (1:1000) (TransGenic, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) is an antibody with broad specificity. It has been described to detect AGE-human serum albumin/bovine serum albumin, AGE-α-Tos-Lys, AGE-α-Tos-Lys-o-Me, AGE-β-alanine, AGE-γ-aminobutyric acid, AGE-ε-amino capronic acid. But no Schiff bases, Amadori products, unmodified human serum albumin/bovine serum albumin, poly(Lys), unmodified Lys-derivatives, unmodified mono-amino-carbonic acids, FFI, pyrrolaldehyde, and pentosidin) (33Horiuchi S.

Membranes were incubated with the antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. After five washing steps with TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and thioflavin T (ThT)), a horseradish peroxidase rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany, 1:1500) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. After five washing steps with TBST, the blots were developed on hyperfilms using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Determination of Tau Aggregate Formation by Thioflavin T Assay—Tau (S396D/T403E/S404D) or wild-type Tau (each 1.7 mg/ml) was dissolved in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0). Thioflavin T was added (final concentration of 5 μm) and either incubated without or with 1 mm methylglyoxal or acrolein at 37 °C for 72 h. Thioflavin T fluorescence was analyzed in a volume of 100 μl in a 96-well plate (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 485 nm). Fluorescence values were set as 100% for proteins containing ThT, and changes were recorded after the addition of RCCs. As negative controls, buffer samples containing thioflavin T and either acrolein or methylglyoxal were used. Determination of Tau Aggregate Formation by Electron Microscopy—Filament formation was analyzed by electron microscopy. Samples were placed on a nickel slot grid and stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The grids were examined in a 912 OMEGA electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (charge-coupled device-slow scan, Proscan). All images were performed at a magnification of 80,000× and processed in Adobe Photoshop (scale bars = 100 nm) (Fig. 6). Formation of Tau Multimers by Reactive Carbonyl Compounds; Detection by SDS-PAGE and Commassie Blue Stain—Recombinant human Tau (full-length of wild-type Tau) and the following six Tau mutants with the following phosphorylation-mimicking amino acid substitutions were used: (a) (single substitution) aspartic acid replacing threonine at position 217 (T217D), aspartic acid replacing serine at position 262 (S262D), and glutamic acid replacing serine at position 422 (S422E); (b) (double substitution) glutamic acid replacing threonine both at positions 111 and 153 (T111E/T153E), aspartic acid replacing threonine at position 231, glutamic acid replacing serine at position 235 (T231D/S235E), glutamic acid replacing threonine at position 403, and aspartic acid replacing serine at position 404 (T403E/S404D); (c) (triple substitution) aspartic acid replacing serine at positions 396 and 404 and glutamic acid replacing threonine at position 403 (S396D/T403E/S404D) (Fig. 1). For the in vitro aggregation assays, the eight recombinant Tau proteins were incubated with methylglyoxal, glyoxal, acrolein, or malondialdehyde (Fig. 2), respectively, and then separated on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Commassie Blue.FIGURE 2Chemical structures of reactive carbonyl compounds and routes to their formation. Non-enzymatic degradation of glucose or Amadori products or glucose metabolism yields methylglyoxal or glyoxal, which can react with proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Radical-induced lipid peroxidation yields reactive carbonyl compounds such as acrolein, malondialdehyde, or glyoxal, which react with proteins to form advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALEs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the first set of experiments, RCCs were used at a concentration of 10 mm. Because Tau protein, which contains 40 lysine and 18 arginine residues, was used at a concentration of 3 mg/ml, 10 mm RCCs accord to a 2.5-fold excess/reactive basic amino acid, allowing Tau to become “maximally modified” (Table 1).TABLE 1Calculation of stoichiometric ratios between lysine and arginine residues of human Tau proteins and different concentrations of RCCsTau proteinReactive side chain3 mg/ml = 0.071 mm/10 mm RCC/1 mm RCC/250 μm RCC40 Lysine residues2.8 mm1/3.61/0.361/0.0918 Arginine residues1.3 mm1/7.81/0.771/0.19Reactive residues (Σ)4.1 mm1/2.51/0.251/0.06 Open table in a new tab Reaction with Acrolein—All Tau isoforms were completely converted to high molecular weight aggregates by 10 mm acrolein after 96 h (Fig. 3A). In some cases, diffuse bands between 120 and 200 kDa could be detected, which might represent highly modified dimers or trimers. Interestingly, the appearance of such multiple, diffuse Tau protein multimers after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been reported previously for PHFs isolated from AD brains (35Ledesma M.D. Bonay P. Colaco C. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21614-21619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Watanabe A. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7368-7378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In some cases, e.g. in the Tau T403E/S404D mutant, the combined intensity of all bands appears to be far lower than with the other RCCs. Possible explanations for this apparent loss of total Tau protein might be the formation of high molecular weight Tau multimers too large to enter the gel or the low affinity of Coomassie Blue to proteins having lost their positive charges. Reaction with Glyoxal—Incubation of wild-type Tau, Tau T111E/T153E, Tau T217D, and Tau S422E with 10 mm glyoxal resulted in a weakly stained band at 100–120 kDa (Fig. 3A), which may suggest dimerization of these Tau isoforms. In contrast, the incubation of all other Tau mutants with glyoxal only caused a small increase of the molecular weight of the monomer but did not lead to the formation of dimeric or higher oligomeric structures. The triple Tau mutant S396D/T403E/S404D behaved quite unusually, because it produced a high molecular oligomer, whereas the monomeric band at ∼50 kDa nearly disappeared. Reaction with Malondialdehyde—When Tau proteins were incubated with 10 mm MDA, formation of dimers (and trimers in the case of T111E/T153E) could be observed at ∼100-120 kDa after 96 h (Fig. 3A). Again, the Tau mutant S396D/T403E/S404D behaved quite unusually, because it produced a higher molecular oligomer, whereas the monomeric band at ∼50 kDa disappeared (Fig. 3A). Reaction with Methylglyoxal—All seven pseudophosphorylated Tau mutant proteins appeared to have reacted with 10 mm methylglyoxal after 96 h. Bands corresponding to a trimer (150 kDa), a tetramer (200 kDa), and higher molecular weight oligomeric Tau products >250 kDa could be observed (Fig. 3A). With wild-type Tau, only a faint band at ∼120 kDa could be observed. Control Incubations without Reactive Carbonyl Compounds—When wild-type Tau or the phosphorylation mimicking Tau mutant proteins were incubated at 37 °C without carbonyl compounds, no Tau dimers, oligomers, or other multimers could be observed. These negative controls are marked with c in Fig. 3. Because the results obtained from the experiments above suggested that the reactivity of the RCCs decreased in this order, acrolein > methylglyoxal > glyoxal ≈ malondialdehyde, only the most reactive compounds, methylglyoxal and acrolein, were used at lower, more physiological concentrations. At concentrations of 1 mm RCCs, only each fourth at 250 μm and each sixteenth lysine or arginine residue could be modified, respectively (Tab. 1). As shown in Fig. 3B, the reaction of Tau with 1 mm acrolein or methylglyoxal also caused the disappearance of Tau monomer and formation of high molecular weight oligomers. In contrast, incubations with 250 μm acrolein or methylglyoxal did not significantly convert Tau monomers into oligomers within the 96 h period, although intensity of monomer bands decreased and a significant increase in the apparent molecular weight of Tau (2–3 kDa) could be observed (data not shown). It was not possible to incubate the Tau preparations for longer time periods than 96 h, because residual protease activity led to obvious protein degradation. It has to be noted that some of the non-modified Tau mutant protein preparations, e.g. S262D and S396D/T403E/S404D already contained some traces of oligomers (Fig. 3B, lanes c). These oligomers disappeared after incubation with 10 mm acrolein or methylglyoxal but not with 1 mm (Fig. 3) or 250 μm (data not shown). AGE and ALE Modification of Tau Oligomers by Reactive Carbonyl Compounds; Detection by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Proteins modified with RCCs eventually form stable end products, which are termed “advanced glycation” or “advanced lipid peroxidation” end products (AGEs or ALEs). To investigate whether higher molecular weight bands of Tau are AGE- or ALE-modified, Western blot analysis was performed with wild-type Tau after incubation with 10 mm acrolein, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and MDA for 96 h (samples were identical to those shown in Fig. 3A). Glyoxal-, MDA-, and methylglyoxal-modified Tau were strongly recognized by the AGE antibody 6D12, whereas acrolein-modified Tau was only weakly recognized (Fig. 4, left panel). The specific CML antibody 4G9 detected glyoxal-modified Tau only (Fig. 4) but none of the other carbonyl modifications (data not shown). As expected, non-modified Tau showed no immunoreaction with the AGE antibody (Fig. 4, lane c) or the CML antibody (data not shown). These results suggest that most of the Tau oligomers are either AGE- or ALE-modified, assuming that the monoclonal AGE antibody not only detects AGEs but also some chemically similar ALEs. However, it appears that the epitope formed by acrolein is quite unique and cannot be detected by a “conventional” AGE antibody (37Richter T. Münch G. Lüth H.J. Arendt T. Kientsch-Engel R. Stahl P. Fengler D. Kuhla B. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 4: 465-474Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Formation of Tau Aggregates by Reactive Carbonyl Compounds; Detection by Thioflavin T Fluorescence—Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye known to interact with fibrillar protein aggregates such as Tau in neurofibrillary tangles. To study the influence of RCCs and pseudophosphorylation on the formation of such aggregates, fibrils were detected by thioflavin T after incubation with 1 mm RCCs for 96 h. The formation of thioflavin T-positive aggregates in the mutants, except the triple mutant S396D/T403E/S404D was not significantly increased compared with wild-type Tau controls (data not shown). In a further experiment investigating the time course of thioflavin T-positive fibril formation, wild-type Tau and the triple mutant were incubated with 1 mm acrolein or methylglyoxal in the presence of 5 μm thioflavin T for up to 72 h. The Tau mutant S396D/T403E/S404D (but not wild-type Tau) showed a slightly accelerated formation of thioflavin T-positive aggregates when reacted with acrolein, which became significant after 24 h (Fig. 5A). By contrast, methylglyoxal-induced formation of thioflavin T-positive aggregates initially decreased within the first 8 h of the reaction but continuously increased thereafter in both wild-type Tau and in the triple mutant, with the initial difference in favor of the mutant leveling out after 72 h (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that 1 mm methylglyoxal and acrolein generally enhances formation of thioflavin T-fluorescent aggregates (with the exception of wild-type Tau + acrolein) and that ThT-sensitive aggregate formation is slightly favored at certain time points in the triple mutant (30Haase C. Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Formation of Tau Aggregates by Reactive Carbonyl Compounds; Detection by Electron Microscopy—Further investigations by electron microscopy were performed at this stage to determine whether the reactive carbonyl compounds contribute to the formation of helical structures resembling the characteristic PHFs in Alzheimer disease brains. A further reason for such an experiment was a previous report that such filamentous structures are formed from glucose-modified (glycated) recombinant Tau (35Ledesma M.D. Bonay P. Colaco C. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21614-21619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ledesma M.D. Medina M. Avila J. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1996; 27: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analogous to the experiments described above, wild-type Tau and the phosphorylation-mimicking Tau isoforms were incubated with different concentrations of each carbonyl compound for 96 h. In a first set of experiments, wild-type Tau and three pseudophosphorylation-mimicking mutants T217D, T403E/S404D, and S422E were maximally modified by 10 mm acrolein, glyoxal, MDA, and methylglyoxal and studied by electron microscopy using negative staining. Reaction with Acrolein—Tau incubated with 10 mm acrolein formed PHF-like filaments with lengths of >100 nm with both wild-type Tau and all seven phosphorylation-mimicking Tau isoforms. Fig. 6A exemplarily shows the filaments of wild-type Tau, Tau T217D, T403E/S404D, and S422E. The formation of these large fibrillar aggregates further indicates the high reactivity of acrolein. This may also explain why almost no defined small oligomers could be detected in the SDS gel after Coomassie Blue staining. Reaction with Glyoxal—Tau incubated with 10 mm glyoxal did not form large fibrillar aggregates within 96 h. However, small protofibrils could be detected with wild-type Tau, and some amorphous structures were detected with the Tau mutant T217D (data not shown). Reaction with Malondialdehyde—Similarly, the incubation of 10 mm MDA with wild-type Tau did not yield fibrillar aggregates, but rather amorphous structures were formed (data not shown). The phosphorylation-mimicking mutants T217D and T403E/S404D yielded only partially ordered rudimental filamentous structures after MDA treatment, but did not show distinctive PHF-like aggregates (data not shown). Reaction with Methylglyoxal—Methylglyoxal also induced the formation of PHF-like filaments, both in wild-type Tau and in all phosphorylation-mimicking mutants (selected examples are shown i"

The last step of phylloquinone synthesis in cyanobacteria is the methylation of 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone by the menG gene product. Here, we report that the uncharacterized Arabidopsis gene At1g23360, which shows sequence similarity to menG, functionally complements the Synechocystis menG mutant. An Arabidopsis mutant, AtmenG, carrying a T-DNA insertion in the gene At1g23360 is devoid of phylloquinone, but contains an increased amount of 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. Phylloquinone and 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone in thylakoid membranes of wild type and AtmenG, respectively, predominantly localize to photosystem I, whereas excess amounts of prenyl quinones are stored in plastoglobules. Photosystem I reaction centers are decreased in AtmenG plants under high light, as revealed by immunoblot and spectroscopic measurements. Anthocyanin accumulation and chalcone synthase (CHS1) transcription are affected during high light exposure, indicating that alterations in photosynthesis in AtmenG affect gene expression in the nucleus. Photosystem II quantum yield is decreased under high light. Therefore, the loss of phylloquinone methylation affects photosystem I stability or turnover, and the limitation in functional photosystem I complexes results in overreduction of photosystem II under high light.

Therefore, the loss of phylloquinone methylation affects photosystem I stability or turnover, and the limitation in functional photosystem I complexes results in overreduction of photosystem II under high light. In plants and cyanobacteria, photosynthetic conversion of light into chemical energy is mediated via two photosystems, photosystem I (PSI) 3The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; Chl, chlorophyll; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; PNQ, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; PSII, photosystem II; DHNA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; Cyt, cytochrome. 3The abbreviations used are: PSI, photosystem I; Chl, chlorophyll; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ORF, open reading frame; PNQ, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone; PSII, photosystem II; DHNA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; Cyt, cytochrome. and photosystem II (PSII). PSII transfers electrons from water onto plastoquinone, an abundant prenyl quinone in thylakoids. PSI accepts electrons from plastocyanin, and they are subsequently transferred onto ferredoxin or flavodoxin. PSI forms dimers in thylakoids, with each PSI monomer harboring a special chlorophyll a pair (reaction center P700) for charge separation. The electron transfer chain through one PSI monomer encompasses two branches, each containing two further chlorophyll a molecules (A and A0) and one phylloquinone (A1). Electron flux merges at the iron-sulfur center FX, which passes electrons on to the iron-sulfur centers FB and FA (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N.

The two branches of the PSI electron transfer chain are not structurally equivalent and differ in their lipid association: Whereas phosphatidylglycerol is found in close proximity to one of the branches, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol is associated with the other branch (2Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N. Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear whether these branches are active to similar extents (4Guergova-Kuras M.

Acta. 2001; 1507: 5-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is an essential component of the human diet, because it serves as a cofactor for γ-carboxylation of glutamyl residues in different proteins, such as blood coagulation factors, but cannot be synthesized in animals and humans (6Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Selenium, and Carotenoids. Natl. Acad. Press, Washington, D.C.2003: 162-196Google Scholar). The phylloquinone molecule is composed of a naphthoquinone ring, which can exist in the oxidized quinone or in the reduced hydroquinone form, and a prenyl side chain derived from phytyl-diphosphate. The biosynthesis of menaquinone, a bacterial vitamin K analog carrying an unsaturated side chain, and of phylloquinone has been studied in Escherichia coli and in cyanobacteria, respectively (7Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

The naphthoquinone ring is derived from chorismate, which is converted into 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) by six consecutive reactions (Fig. 1). Subsequently, DHNA is converted to 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (PNQ) by DHNA phytyltransferase (MenA). The last step of phylloquinone synthesis in cyanobacteria involves the methylation at the C3-position of the naphthoquinone moiety by the menG gene product, thereby converting the unmethylated form, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, into phylloquinone. The role of phylloquinone in photosynthesis has been studied by employing loss-of-function mutants of cyanobacteria (menA, menB, menD, menE, menG) (7Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D.

A block in biosynthesis resulting in total loss of phylloquinone has only a minor impact on photosynthesis or growth of Synechocystis under low light conditions, presumably, because other hydroquinones, such as plastoquinone, can largely substitute for phylloquinone deficiency in PSI (7Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol.

However, under high light conditions, photoautotrophic growth of Synechocystis menA and menB mutant strains is severely compromised (7Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R.

Phylloquinone synthesis in plants has been studied by feeding biosynthetic precursors and by enzyme assays in spinach, Capsicum annuum, Euglena gracilis, and Galium cell cultures (11Schultz G. Ellerbrock B.H. Soll J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Gaudillière J.-P. d'Harlingue A. Camara B. Monéger R.

The first genetic study of phylloquinone synthesis in plants was presented by the isolation of the AtmenA mutant of Arabidopsis carrying a block in DHNA phytyltransferase. AtmenA plants are totally devoid of phylloquinone, contain reduced amounts of chlorophyll and PSI and show a severe reduction in photosynthetic efficiency (15Shimada H. Ohno R. Shibata M. Ikegami I. Onai K. Ohto M.-a. Takamiya K.-i. Plant J. 2005; 41: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a consequence, mutant plants are unable to survive in soil, providing strong evidence for the importance of phylloquinone as essential electron carrier of PSI (15Shimada H. Ohno R. Shibata M. Ikegami I. Onai K. Ohto M.-a. Takamiya K.-i. Plant J. 2005; 41: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gene and corresponding mutant of a multifunctional protein carrying four enzymatic domains putatively involved in phylloquinone synthesis (MenF, MenD, MenC, lipase) were recently isolated from Arabidopsis (16Gross J. Cho W.K. Lezhneva L. Falk J. Krupinska K. Shinozaki K. Seki M. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17189-17196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Disruption of the menG gene encoding PNQ methyltransferase resulted in phylloquinone deficiency in Synechocystis (10Sakuragi Y. Zybailov B. Shen G. Jones A.D. Chitnis P.R. van der Est A. Bittl R. Zech S. Stehlik D. Goldbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In their PSI particles, mutant cells contained two molecules of 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, the substrate of the MenG reaction, per PSI monomer. The gene encoding PNQ methyltransferase has not been isolated from higher plants, and the role of the final methylation reaction in phylloquinone synthesis for functional integrity of PSI in plants has not been studied. For this reason, the cDNA for an open reading frame identified as potentially homologous to menG and found in the fully sequenced genome of Arabidopsis, At1g23360, was isolated and its gene product tested for PNQ methyltransferase activity by expression in a heterologous system. The subplastidial distribution of phylloquinone and of PNQ was measured in Arabidopsis wild type and in an AtmenG knock-out mutant. Furthermore, biochemical and physiological characterization of the AtmenG mutant demonstrated that the 3-methyl group of phylloquinone is required to sustain maximal efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport, particularly at high light conditions. Isolation of the At1g23360 cDNA and Complementation of the Synechocystis menG Mutant—A cDNA corresponding to the Arabidopsis gene At1g23360 was isolated by PCR from an Arabidopsis (Columbia) cDNA library prepared from inflorescences, stems and leaves using the primers At1g23360-forward (5′-ATC TTA TAC ATA TGG CGG CTC TAC TCG GTA TCG) and At1g23360-reverse (5′-TAT GGA TCC TTT ACC TCA TAG CGA CCA AAT CC). The amplification product, which contained added flanking NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (underlined) was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescriptIISK+ (Stratagene) to generate pBluescript-At1g23360. Sequencing revealed that this clone contains an authentic fulllength open reading frame derived from the locus At1g23360. A Synechocystis menG knock-out mutant was prepared by replacement of the sll1653 gene with a spectinomycin resistance marker through homologous recombination (17Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A menG-specific knock-out vector was generated using procedures similar to those described previously (18Sattler S.E. Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Initially, sequences flanking sll1653 were amplified from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA. Primers used for amplification of a 541-base pair 5′-flanking sequence were: 5′-AAG TTT GGA TTG CGC CAG ATG-3′ (primer 5′-A) and 5′-GCT GTA CGC TCT CCT GAG TCG-3′ (primer 5′-B). Primers used for amplification of a 612-base pair 3′-flanking sequence were: 5′-GAC TCA GGA GAG CGT ACA GCG TAC GAC CGC TTT CCC ACT GGC C-3′ (primer 3′-A) and 5′-CCT AGC AGT GAC ACT TTC CGC C-3′ (primer 3′-B). The purified PCR products were combined and reamplified along with primers 5′-A and 3′-B to generate a contiguous sequence that contained an added BsiWI restriction site (underlined nucleotides in primer 3′-A) between the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. This product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to generate the plasmid pMenG-KO. An aadA gene encoding a spectinomycin resistance marker was cloned into the BsiWI site of pMenG-KO to generate pMenG-Spec-KO. This plasmid was introduced into Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 as described (17Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar), and homologous recombinant lines were selected for spectinomycin resistance. Replacement of the sll1653 gene with the spectinomycin resistance marker was confirmed by PCR analyses of genomic DNA. Complementation of the Synechocystis menG knock-out mutant was conducted by expression of the full-length AtmenG cDNA using the vector pSynExp-2 (18Sattler S.E. Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The AtmenG cDNA was isolated as an NdeI/BamHI restriction fragment from pBluescript-At1g23360 and cloned into the NdeI/BglII sites of pSynExp-2 downstream of the psbA2 promoter. The resulting plasmid was introduced into the Synechocystis menG knock-out mutant, and recombinant lines were selected by chloramphenicol and spectinomycin resistance. Incorporation of the AtmenG cDNA expression cassette was confirmed by PCR analyses of genomic DNA. Total lipids were extracted as previously described (18Sattler S.E. Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) from wild type (WT) cells, menG knock-out lines, and AtmenG-complemented knock-out lines that were maintained on solid BG11 medium (17Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar) with appropriate antibiotic selection. Phylloquinone Measurements—Phylloquinone was quantified according to Jakob and Elmadfa (20Jakob E. Elmadfa I. Food Chemistry. 1996; 56: 87-91Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, ca. 100 mg of leaf material was ground in liquid nitrogen. Lipids were extracted from leaves or cyanobacteria with 0.8 ml of isopropyl alcohol/hexane (3:1) after addition of menaquinone-4 as internal standard (250 ng in 50 μl of ethanol, Sigma). After vortexing, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and the green lipid phase transferred to a new vial. The remaining pellet was again extracted with 0.6 ml of hexane. To the combined organic phases, 0.6 ml of methanol/water (9:1) was added, and after vortexing and centrifugation, the upper hexane phase transferred to a glass vial. The solvent was evaporated with nitrogen gas and the residue dissolved in 100 μl of methanol/dichloromethane (9:1). Phylloquinone was quantified on a 1100 Series HPLC (Agilent). Lipids were separated by isocratic chromatography (flow rate: 1 ml min-1) on a reversed phase RP18 column (Eurosphos-100, 250 × 4.6 mm, Knauer, Berlin, Germany) equipped with a post-column derivatization cartridge (30 × 4 mm, filled with Zink powder, 63-μm particle size, VWR) to reduce all quinones to their respective hydroquinone forms. The solvent was composed of 900 ml of methanol, 100 ml of dichloromethane, and 5 ml of a methanolic solution of 1.37 g of ZnCl2, 0.41 g of sodium acetate, and 0.30 g of acetic acid. Phylloquinone was measured by fluorescence (excitation, 243 nm; emission, 430 nm) using menaquinone-4 as internal standard. Subcellular Localization of the At1g23360 Protein—The entire open reading frame of the At1g23360 cDNA was amplified by PCR (primers: PD592, 5′-AGG GAT CCt ATG GCG GCT CTA CTC GGT A-3′; PD593, 5′-ATC CAT GGA CCT CAT AGC GAC CAA ATT C-3′) from pBluescript-At1g23360 (see above). The PCR fragment was ligated into the BamHI and NcoI sites of pCL60 (21Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in translational fusion with the N terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence. Plasmid DNA was coated onto 1.0-μm gold microcarriers (Bio-Rad) and transferred into Arabidopsis leaves in a Biolistic PSD-1000/He particle delivery system (Bio-Rad) using 1100 psi rupture discs. After bombardment, leaves were incubated on Murashige and Skoog (22Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar) medium in the dark for 2 days. Fluorescence signals were analyzed under a Leica DM-IRBE confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) for GFP (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 518-524 nm) or for chlorophyll fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 680-690 nm). Isolation and Complementation of the Arabidopsis AtmenG Mutant—An Arabidopsis line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the At1g23360 locus (GABI_565F06) was obtained from the GABI-Kat collection in Cologne, Germany (23Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K.A. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). PCR using gene-specific primers (PD464, 5′-AGA AAT GTG TAG CTT GGC TTG ATT-3′; PD465, 5′-GTT ACT GGT TGT AGC AAG TTT GGA-3′) with genomic DNA from wild type or a heterozygous line resulted in amplification of a 1630-bp fragment, in contrast to homozygous lines where no band was produced. A 670-bp fragment containing part of the T-DNA insertion could be amplified by PCR with the primers PD464 and PD394 (T-DNA left boarder primer; 5′-CCC ATT TGG ACG TGA ATG TAG ACA C-3′) in homozygous or heterozygous lines. For complementation, the ORF was released from pBlue-script-At1g23360 with KpnI and BamHI, ligated into the corresponding sites of the binary vector pBINAR containing a CaMV 35S promoter (24Höfgen R. Willmitzer L. Plant Sci. 1990; 66: 221-230Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and transferred into the Arabidopsis AtmenG mutant via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (25Bent A.F. Kunkel B.N.

Transformed plants were selected on kanamycin-containing medium, and At1g23360 expressing lines identified by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from leaves and used for Northern blot hybridization with a 32P-labeled At1g23360 cDNA as a probe following standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T.

Radioactive lipids were separated by TLC (hexane/diethylether/acetic acid; 85:15:1) including standards (phytol, α-tocopherol, phylloquinone) and visualized with a β-scanner (Automatic TLC Linear Analyzer, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Quantification of Chlorophyll, Photosynthetic Pigments, Anthocyanin, and Tocopherol—Chlorophyll in leaves was measured photometrically in 80% acetone (28Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). Photosynthetic pigments were extracted from leaves with acetone and quantified by HPLC (29Thayer S.S. Björkman O. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 23: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Anthocyanin was extracted from leaves with 1-propyl alcohol/1% HCl/water (18:1:81), the extracts boiled for 3 min, and incubated in darkness for 2 h. Subsequently, anthocyanin was quantified photometrically according to the equation (A535 - 2 × A650) per g fresh weight (30Noh B. Spalding E.P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tocopherol was measured by fluorescence HPLC (31Thompson J.N. Hatina G. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1979; 2: 327-344Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Chloroplast Isolation and Fractionation—Chloroplasts were isolated from Arabidopsis WT and AtmenG leaves by homogenization (32Vidi P.-A. Kanwischer M. Baginsky S. Austin J.R. Csucs G. Dörmann P. Kessler F. Bréhélin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11225-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After hypotonic rupture of chloroplasts, subplastidial compartments were separated by centrifugation using a standard sucrose density gradient, and subfractions of 1 ml were collected (32Vidi P.-A. Kanwischer M. Baginsky S. Austin J.R. Csucs G. Dörmann P. Kessler F. Bréhélin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11225-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis (with antibodies against plastoglobulin AtPGL35, the translocator of the outer envelope AtToc75, chlorophyll a binding protein, CAB) was performed on subfractions of the sucrose gradient to assess the distribution of plastoglobules, envelopes, and thylakoids. The results of immunoblots were analogous to those published in Fig. 2 of Vidi et al. (32Vidi P.-A. Kanwischer M. Baginsky S. Austin J.R. Csucs G. Dörmann P. Kessler F. Bréhélin C. J. Biol.

The upper gradient fractions F1 (subfractions 1-6 or 1-5 for WT or AtmenG, respectively) and F2 (subfractions 7-13 or 6-17) contained mostly plastoglobules. Envelopes and low amounts of thylakoids were found in F3 (subfractions 14-19 or 18-21). Fraction F4 (subfractions 20-23 or 22-25) contained envelopes and thylakoids, and F5 (subfractions 24-29 or 26-29) mostly thylakoids (32Vidi P.-A. Kanwischer M. Baginsky S. Austin J.R. Csucs G.

Lipids were extracted from the five fractions with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and total fatty acids and phylloquinone were quantified by GC (33Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and fluorescence HPLC (see above), respectively. Differential Chlorophyll Absorption Measurement of PSI in Leaf Discs—As a measure for the content of photochemically active PSI, the transmission change at 830-870 nm, resulting from photo-oxidation of P700, was determined in leaf discs of Arabidopsis. The transmission changes (ΔI/I) were corrected for the contribution of plastocyanin, determined at 870-950 nm (34Kirchhoff H. Schöttler M.A. Maurer J. Weis E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but using an optimized new generation pulse amplified modulation (PAM) system (Dual-PAM, plastocyanin-P700 version, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany), which allows simultaneous determination of the difference transmission signals arising from plastocyanin and P700. 4M. A. Schöttler, C. Flügel, W. Thiele, and R. Bock, submitted manuscript. Using pre-illuminated Arabidopsis leaves with fully active Calvin cycle to avoid an acceptor-side limitation of PSI oxidation, P700 and plastocyanin were pre-oxidized by 10-s illumination with weak far-red light selectively exciting PSI, followed by a strong saturating red light pulse (100-ms duration, 6000 μmol m-2 s-1), resulting in complete photooxidation of P700 and plastocyanin and their subsequent reduction after the end of the light pulse. The maximal transmission changes between fully oxidized and fully reduced states were calculated. After transmission measurement, the leaf segment was punched, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and chlorophyll content determined (28Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). Transmission changes were normalized to a chlorophyll content of 1 mg. Thylakoid Isolation and Quantification of PSI, PSII, and Cyt b6/f—Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described (36Schöttler M.A. Kirchhoff H. Weis E. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thylakoid proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to immunoblot membranes, and blots were probed with polyclonal antiserum raised against PsaC (PS I), PsbD (PS II), or PetA (Cyt b6/f). 4M. A. Schöttler, C. Flügel, W. Thiele, and R. Bock, submitted manuscript. PSI, PSII, or Cyt b6/f were determined in isolated thylakoids by difference absorption measurements (36Schöttler M.A. Kirchhoff H. Weis E. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, PSI was measured from P700 redox changes after thylakoid membrane solubilization with 0.2% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside (50 μg Chl ml-1). Ascorbate was used as electron donor to maintain P700 in a fully reduced state in the dark, and methylviologen was used as electron acceptor during photooxidation after application of a saturating red light pulse (6000 μmol m-2 s-1, 200-ms duration). For measurements of the cytochromes in PSII and Cyt b6/f, thylakoid membranes were de-stacked in a low salt buffer containing 0.03% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside to eliminate light scattering effects. The cytochromes were oxidized with ferricyanide and subsequently reduced with ascorbate and dithionite, resulting in reduction of Cyt f and the high potential form of Cyt b559 (HP, ascorbate-ferricyanide difference absorption spectrum) and reduction of cytochrome b6 and the low potential form of Cyt b559 (LP, dithionite-ascorbate), respectively. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-550 spectrophotometer with head-on photomultiplier between 575 and 540 nm, and difference absorption spectra were deconvoluted using reference spectra and difference absorption coefficients for the cytochromes. PSII contents were calculated from the sum of the Cyt b559 HP and LP difference absorption signals (37Lamkemeyer P. Laxa M. Collin V. Li W. Finkemeyer I. Schöttler M.A. Holtkamp V. Tognetti V.B. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Kandlbinder A. Weis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Dietz K.J. Plant J. 2006; 45: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Measurement of PSI Electron Transfer Rate—PSI electron transfer activity was measured in thylakoids by recording oxygen consumption in continuous white light (5000 μmol m-2 s-1, halogen lamp) with a Clark-type electrode. Briefly, PSII activity in thylakoids was inhibited with 3-(3′, 4′-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU, 100 μm), and electron transfer from ascorbate (10 mm) via the mediator N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD, 100 μm) and plastocyanin to PSI was measured. Methylviologen (100 μm) was added as electron acceptor, resulting in the reduction of O2 to H2O2. Because catalase activity was inhibited by the addition of 1 mm NaN3, PSI activity could be calculated from O2 reduction (38Izawa S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 69: 413-433Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Low Temperature (77 K) Chlorophyll Fluorescence—Low temperature (77 K) chlorophyll a fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Jasco F6500 fluorometer with a red-sensitive photomultiplier. Isolated thylakoids were diluted to a chlorophyll concentration of 10 μg of Chl ml-1, fluorescence was excited at 430 nm and emission spectra measured from 660 to 800 nm. Spectra were corrected for the instrumental response of the photomultiplier and normalized to the PSII emission signal at 685 nm. Measurements of PS II Quantum Yield—Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a pulse amplitude modulation fluorimeter (Imaging PAM; Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with dark-adapted plants. Fluo"
https://openalex.org/W2066965662,"The role of post-translational modification, such as sumoylation, in modulating the efficacy of doxorubicin (Dox) treatment remains unclear. Transcriptional cofactor KRAB domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1) has been shown to complex with the KRAB zinc finger protein, ZBRK1, to repress the transcription of target genes. Through a combination of proteomic screening and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we have identified lysines 554, 779, and 804 as the major sumoylation sites in KAP1. We then present evidence that Dox-mediated induction of cell cycle regulator p21 expression is differentially regulated by KAP1 sumoylation status. Moreover, the KAP1 sumoylation level was transiently decreased upon Dox exposure, and transfection with the KAP1 sumoylation mimetic, SUMO-1-KAP1, desensitizes breast cancer MCF-7 cells to Dox-elicited cell death. The sumoylation-dependent stimulation of KAP1 function is achieved by enhancing the methylation of H3-K9 and attenuating the acetylation of H3-K9 and H3-K14 at the p21 core promoter. We also show that occupancy of ZBRK1 response elements located at the p21 promoter by ZBRK1·KAP1 is independent of KAP1 sumoylation. Hence, sumoylation of KAP1 represses p21 transcription via a chromatin-silencing process without affecting interaction between KAP1·ZBRK1 and DNA, thus providing a novel mechanistic basis for the understanding of Dox-induced de-repression of p21 transcription. Taken together, our results suggest that Dox-induced decrease in KAP1 sumoylation is essential for Dox to induce p21 expression and subsequent cell growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitination generally promotes protein degradation, sumoylation regulates a variety of cellular processes, including nuclear transport, genome integrity, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (1Gill G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Briefly, SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by an E1 activating enzyme, transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme, and subsequently attached covalently to the lysine acceptor site, within a particular sequence of ΨKX(D/E) (where Ψ represents hydrophobic amino acid) of SUMO-target proteins by distinct E3 ligase. Similar to phosphorylation, sumoylation is a reversible process catalyzed by de-sumoylation enzymes. The list of known SUMO targets has grown substantially in recent years, and, remarkably, over half of the presently identified SUMO targets are transcriptional factors or co-regulators. In many cases, sumoylation leads to a modified protein-protein interaction of target protein(s), thus altering the biological consequences (4Shiio Y. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13225-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 5Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Recently, a SUMO-binding motif that interacts non-covalently with sumoylated proteins has been described (6Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and this SUMO-binding motif is found to exist in nearly all proteins known to be involved in SUMO-dependent processes (7Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). SUMO proteins, SUMO-1 through -4, form a Ub-like fold in the central region, containing an α-helix packed on a β-sheet (8Huang W.C. Ko T.P. Li S.S. Wang A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4114-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, its N-terminal extension, which is not found in ubiquitin, is highly flexible and does not adopt any defined three-dimensional structure in solution. In addition, the amino acid residues at the protein surfaces in SUMO differ from those in ubiquitin, resulting in completely different surface charge distribution. Together, these two unique features of SUMO lead to the notion that SUMO functions as a special module that is covalently linked to target proteins and/or as a moiety to mediate non-covalent SUMO-dependent interaction with other proteins, hence modulating cellular function (2Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 10Jackson P.K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 5611-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An advantage of such a combined covalent modification and non-covalent interaction is to transiently and rapidly augment or attenuate protein-protein interaction and its subsequent signaling in response to extracellular stimulation (12Huang D.T. Walden H. Duda D. Schulman B.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1958-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Importantly, sumoylation has emerged as an imperative regulatory scheme to modify diverse cellular functions, including intracellular protein compartmentalization, DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional control, and hormone response (reviewed in Refs. 3Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar and 13Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1) was first identified as a transcriptional co-repressor in several reports (14Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher 3rd., F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 15Kim S.S. Chen Y.M. O'Leary E. Witzgall R. Vidal M. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that the N-terminal RING-B boxes-coiled-coil domain of KAP1 serves as a protein-protein interaction motif for the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain. KRAB domain-containing zinc finger (KZF) proteins, characteristic of their N-terminal KRAB domain and a number of zinc fingers at their C terminus, constitute the largest single protein family of transcriptional regulators known by far (17Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 231Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although a majority of KZF proteins functions to repress RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription, their respective target genes and underlying transcriptional regulation mechanism(s) remain largely elusive. Recently, zinc finger and BRCA1-interacting protein with KRAB domain 1 (ZBRK1), a KZF protein harboring KRAB domain, was found to repress the transcription of the DNA damage-responsive gene gadd45α through a 15-bp ZBRK1 response element located on its third intron (18Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Several DNA damage-responsive genes such as gadd153, p21waf1/cip1, and bax also possess this consensus ZBRK1 response element, implying its role, and possibly its partner KAP1 as well, in regulating the transcription of these DNA damage responsive genes. In addition to its N-terminal RING-B boxes-coiled-coil domain, there are several C-terminal domains that have been demonstrated to recruit chromatin-remodeling machinery to KAP1. For example, the PXVXL motif is involved in the binding of heterochromatin protein 1, and the PHD and Bromo domains interact with Mi-2α of the NuRD histone deacetylase complex and histone 3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) methyltransferase SETDB1 (19Lechner M.S.

Herein, we report that KAP1 is subjected to SUMO-1-mediated modification and the KAP1 sumoylation status correlates with its transcriptional repressive ability through ZBRK1 response element. We present evidence that KAP1 sumoylation modulates both p21-Luc reporter activation and the relative extents of H3-K9 and H3-K14 acetylation versus H3-K9 methylation at the p21 promoter in doxorubicin (Dox)-treated breast cancer MCF-7 cells. However, the ability of KAP1 to complex with ZBRK1 and the occupancy of ZBRK1 response element are not affected by KAP1 sumoylation. Moreover, Dox treatment transiently reduces KAP1 sumoylation level, and transfection with the KAP1 sumoylation mimetic, SUMO-1-KAP1, greatly enhances the cell viability against Dox treatment. Together, our results support the notion that sumoylation plays a major role in regulating the ability of KAP1·ZBRK1 to modify H3 methylation versus acetylation profile at the p21 promoter and provide a novel molecular basis for Dox to induce p21 expression and cell growth inhibition. Cell Culture—HEK293 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C under 5% CO2, whereas T47D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics otherwise as the same conditions above. Antibodies—The anti-FLAG-agarose, FLAG peptide, and anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody were purchase from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal antibody against c-Myc was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against acetylated histone 3 and di-methylated histone 3 lysine 9 were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Affinity Purification of Cellular Sumoylated Proteins—Full-length SUMO-1 in pCMV Tag 2A vector (Stratagene) was transfected into HEK293 cells, followed by the addition of 300 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate starting at the 30th h post-transfection for 2 weeks to generate the pool of FLAG-SUMO-1 stably integrated cells. Whole cell extract was prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). FLAG affinity purification was performed with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma), and nonspecific binding was washed off with twenty bed volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for three times. Immunoprecipitates were then eluted with 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and concentrated with a Microcon YM-50 concentrator where FLAG peptide and FLAG-SUMO-1 were removed. Prior to subjecting to mass spectrometric analysis, eluted proteins were digested with sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 100:1 ratio twice, and the digestion mixture was desalted by passing through ZipTip C18 resins. Liquid Chromatography-Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometric analysis of the trypsin-digested, sumoylated proteins was performed using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus mass spectrometer with reverse phase liquid chromatography implemented with an Ultra Plus II LC system (MicroTech Scientific) using a 150-mm × 75-μm C-18 reverse-phase column (5-μm, 300-Å particles) from Micro-Tech Scientific. Peptides were loaded onto a Michrom Bioresources peptide cap trap at 95% solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and 5% solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and then eluted with a linear gradient of 5–60% solvent B for 65 min and 60–90% solvent B for 10 min. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra were acquired with Xcalibur 1.2 software. A full MS scan was followed by three consecutive MS/MS scans of the top three ion peaks from the preceding full scan. Dynamic exclusion was enabled such that, after three occurrences of an ion within 1 min, the ion was placed on the exclusion list for 3 min. Other mass spectrometric data generation parameters were as follows: collision energy, 35%; full scan MS mass range, 400–1800 m/z; minimum MS signal, 5 × 104 counts; and minimum MS/MS signal, 5 × 103 counts. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a nanospray ion source (Thermo Electron) using an uncoated 10-μm ID SilicaTip™ PicoTip™ nanospray emitter (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The spray voltage of the mass spectrometer was 1.9 kV, and the heated capillary temperature was 180 °C. Analysis of MS Spectra—A Beta test version of Bioworks (Bioworks 3.1) on a nine-node (2 central processing units/node) cluster computer from Thermo Electron utilizing the SEQUEST algorithm was used to determine cross-correlation scores between acquired spectra and human KAP1 protein sequence (NCBI Accession NP_005753). SEQUEST parameters included: threshold, 1000; monoisotopic mass; enzyme, trypsin; and charge state, auto. For peptide identification, spectra passing a threshold of cross-correlation versus charge state (1.5 for +1 ion, 2.0 for +2 ions, and 2.5 for +3 ions) were then inspected to verify that all major ions were identified. MS/MS spectra were also manually validated. In Vivo and in Vitro Sumoylation Assays—The in vivo sumoylation assay was carried out with co-transfection of FLAG-KAP1 and GFP-SUMO-1 in a 1:4 ratio. Sumoylated KAP1 was detected either by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitation of FLAG-KAP1 followed by immunoblotting against FLAG or GFP tags. The in vitro sumoylation assay was performed with the sumoylation kit purchased from LAE Biotech International. Co-immunoprecipitation of KAP1 Mutants and ZBRK1—Transfection of FLAG-ZBRK1 and Myc-KAP1 expression construct was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 100 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem). For each sample, 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose was mixed with 5 mg of whole cell lysates, incubated on ice for 2 h, and washed with 600 μl of lysis buffer three times. Immunoprecipitates were then eluted in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, and half of the elution was subject to immunoblotting analysis. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Total RNA from MCF-7 and T47D cells were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The p21 mRNA transcript was reverse transcribed with the p21-specific primer (Table 1) by ThermoScript RT kit (Invitrogen) according to its manual. A fraction of RT reaction was then amplified with IQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and the p21-specific primer pair by My IQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The -fold change in p21 mRNA level was calculated by using the ΔΔCt method against 18 S rRNA.TABLE 1Primers and sequences used in this studyPrimeraFP, forward primer; RP, reverse primer.PurposeSequence18 S rRNA FPReal-time PCRCGGCGACGACCCATTCGAAC18 S rRNA RPRT and real-time PCRGAATCGAACCCTGATTCCCCGTCp21 FPReal-time PCRTTTCTCTCGGCTCCCCATGTp21 RPRT and real-time PCRGCTGTATATTCAGCATTGTGGGp21 -20 amplicon FPChIP (real-time PCR)TATATCAGGGCCGCGCTGp21 -20 amplicon RPChIP (real-time PCR)CTTCGGCAGCTGCTCACACCTp21 -713 amplicon FPChIP (real-time PCR)TTTCCCTGGAGATCAGGTTGp21 -713 amplicon RPChIP (real-time PCR)GGAAGGAGGGAATTGGAGAGp21 -3038 amplicon FPChIP (real-time PCR)CAGGCTGGTCTCAAAACTCCp21 -3038 amplicon RPChIP (real-time PCR)GCCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTTa FP, forward primer; RP, reverse primer. Open table in a new tab RNA Interference—The 27-mer duplex RNA interference molecules were designed according to a recent report (25Kim D.H. Behlke M.A. Rose S.D. Chang M.S. Choi S. Rossi J.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) and a guide provided by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The core RNAi sequences against the mRNA of ZBRK1 and KAP1 were published previously (26Furuta S. Wang J.M. Wei S. Jeng Y.M. Jiang X. Gu B. Chen P.L. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The transfection of RNA interference duplex were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase Assay—The p21 promoter was PCR cloned from a total DNA pool of HeLa cells by DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and was subcloned into pGL3b reporter (Promega) as described previously (28el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with pGL3b-p21 reporter, internal control reporter pRL-TK, ZBRK1, KAP1, or its mutants. Firefly luciferase activity was assayed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized against Renilla luciferase activity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—MCF-7 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in growth medium for 15 min. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and harvested, and then subsequently swelled in 1 ml of RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-330, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were then collected and resuspended in nuclear sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.1). Sonication was then performed to shear DNA to 500 bp or less. Samples were then diluted with 4 volumes of dilution buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS) before being precleared with 20 μl of 50% protein A/G-agarose. Approximate 3–5 μg of antibodies against acetylated histone H3 or di-methylated H3-K9 was incubated with post-clearance supernatant overnight at 4 °C, and protein A/G- or FLAG M2-agarose that had been preincubated with 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the mixture the following day and incubated for an additional 2 h. Washes were performed with LiCl buffer twice (100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm LiCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0), high salt buffer twice (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, pH 8.0), and low salt buffer twice (same as high salt buffer except with an NaCl concentration at 150 mm), and 2× TE buffer twice (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Immunoprecipitates were eluted in 2% SDS in 2× TE buffer and subsequently treated with RNase (1 h) and protease K (Sigma) (1 h), respectively. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight, and recovered DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. DNA of the designated amplicons was amplified with specific primer pairs (Table 1) using the My IQ real-time PCR detection system and an IQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). Normal sera and input DNA values were used to subtract and normalize the values from ChIP samples. Cell Viability Assay—MCF-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates to obtain a confluency of 50% on the day of the experiment. The cells were treated with vehicle or 2.5 μm Dox, and medium was changed daily for 3 days. 72 h after the start of treatment, 0.2 ml of 0.1 mg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1.5 h. After the incubation, the MTT solution was aspirated, and 0.2 ml of isopropanol was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance was read immediately at 540 nm in a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer. The results were depicted as percentage of cell viability, reported as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicates. Statistical Analysis—p values from two-tailed t tests were calculated by using a spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) and assuming equal variances. The difference between two data sets is significant when p value is <0.05. KAP1 Is Sumoylated in Vitro and in Vivo—In an attempt to understand the role of SUMO-1-mediated sumoylation, we utilized an affinity purification system to enrich sumoylated proteins for subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry. To circumvent the oversumoylation by SUMO-1 overexpression from transient transfection and to facilitate the purification of sumoylated proteins, we established HEK293 cells with stable expression of FLAG-SUMO-1. Toruleoutnon-sumoylated protein(s) also being pulled-down by non-covalent SUMO-dependent protein-protein interaction, another HEK293 line integrated with FLAG-SUMO-1aa, an unconjugatable SUMO-1, was run parallel throughout the purification and the identification processes to exclude those possibilities. The immunoprecipitates were then trypsin-digested and subjected to liquid chromatography-linked tandem mass spectrometry. Approximately 30 proteins were seized with strict filtering parameters by the SEQUEST program (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), and KAP1 was selected for further analyses reported here. The mass spectrum with y-ion and b-ion assignments of KAP1 amino acid residues 408–427 following collision-induced dissociation is shown in Fig. 1A. Next, we verified KAP1 sumoylation potential with both in vivo and in vitro sumoylation systems. Co-transfection of FLAG-KAP1 with GFP-SUMO-1 resulted in the appearance of multiple ladders with higher molecular mass other than unmodified FLAG-KAP1 visualized by an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1B). The estimated increase in molecular mass between each species approximately matched with the mass of 50-kDa of GFP-SUMO-1. The intensity of KAP1-sumolyation ladders in Fig. 1B was dependent upon the input of GFP-SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). KAP1 as a sumoylation target was further verified by in vitro sumoylation assays using purified KAP1 from HEK293 cells and sumoylation E1 (SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer) and E2 (Ubc9) enzymes purified from bacteria (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Mapping the SUMO-1 Acceptor Lysines in KAP1—Based on KAP1 protein motifs and domains (Fig. 2A), we hypothesized that KAP1 sumoylation could modulate either the interaction between KAP1 and its cognate KZF partner, or between KAP1 and its associated chromatin-remodeling activities. We then proceeded to engineer sumoylation-defective KAP1 to test these possibilities. Given the high probability of sumoylation occurring at the ΨKX(D/E) sequence, we scanned KAP1 amino acid sequence to search for putative sumoylation sites. Out of six putative sumoylation sites identified, five are located at the C terminus of KAP1. As shown in Fig. 2A, among these five potential sumoylation acceptor sites, two are in the N to C termini direction (Lys-554: VKEE; Lys-676: LKEE), and the others are in a reverse orientation (Lys-575: ETKP; Lys-779: EDKA; and Lys-804: DTKE). To map the exact SUMO-1 acceptor lysine(s), site-directed mutagenesis of these lysines to arginines individually or in combination was performed. By using in vivo sumoylation assays, KAP1 mutants carrying alterations of K554R, K779R, or K804R, but not K575R or K676R, exhibited a great reduction in their respective sumoylation capacity (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, and 7). Notably, K554R mutation in KAP1 reduced the intensities of most sumoylated species except the presumably mono-sumoylated KAP1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3). As expected, KAP1(3K/R) mutant, harboring K554R, K779R, and K804R mutations, displayed a total lack of sumoylation (Fig. 2B, lane 8). By contrast, the (2K/R) mutations at Lys-575 and Lys-676 preserved nearly all sumoylation capacity of KAP1, comparable to that of the wild-type KAP1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 2), and KAP1(2K/R) will serve as a control in the remaining studies. Therefore, we concluded that Lys-554, Lys-779, and Lys-804 are the major sumoylation sites in KAP1, and KAP1(3K/R) will be used to mimic un-sumoylated KAP1 to investigate the role of KAP1 sumoylation. Sumoylation of KAP1 Does Not Affect the Association between KAP1 and Its Cognate Repressor ZBRK1—Next, we examined the role of sumoylation in modulating the physical interaction of KAP1 with KZF proteins, thereby regulating KAP1 transcriptional co-repressor activity. One of the KZF proteins, ZBRK1, has recently been demonstrated to be the cognate KAP1 DNA-binding partner (29Liao G. Huang J. Fixman E.D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several DNA damage-responsive genes were also implicated to be under the transcriptional regulation of ZBRK1 through a 15-bp ZBRK1-responsive element originally identified in the third intron of gadd45α gene (18Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We decided to utilize this ZBRK1·KAP1 system to investigate the functional role of KAP1 sumoylation. To mimic KAP1 sumoylation, we engineered SUMO-1-KAP1 fusion protein in which SUMO-1(ΔC6) was fused to the N terminus of KAP1, thus mimicking KAP1 sumoylation by being unhydrolyzable by SUMO protease(s). ZBRK1 was previously reported to undergo ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon exposure to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) (30Yun J. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7305-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous report, co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the complex of ZBRK1 with either SUMO-1-KAP1 or KAP1(3K/R) was not detected after MMS treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). By contrast, co-immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed ZBRK1 with either SUMO-1-KAP1 or KAP1(3K/R) revealed that sumoylation did not affect KAP1·ZBRK1 interactions in the presence or absence of Dox (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, we ruled out the possibility that sumoylation of KAP1 regulates its interaction with ZBRK1 under stress and concluded that ZBRK1 and KAP1 form a complex regardless of KAP1 sumoylation status upon Dox exposure.

https://openalex.org/W1992648952,"Human APOBEC3G (hA3G) is a cytidine deaminase that restricts human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection in a vif (the virion infectivity factor from HIV)-dependent manner. hA3G from HIV-permissive activated CD4+ T-cells exists as an inactive, high molecular mass (HMM) complex that can be transformed in vitro into an active, low molecular mass (LMM) variant comparable with that of HIV-non-permissive CD4+ T-cells. Here we present low resolution structures of hA3G in HMM and LMM forms determined by small angle x-ray scattering and advanced shape reconstruction methods. The results show that LMM particles have an extended shape, dissimilar to known cytidine deaminases, featuring novel tail-to-tail dimerization. Shape analysis of LMM and HMM structures revealed how symmetric association of dimers could lead to minimal HMM variants. These observations imply that the disruption of cellular HMM particles may require regulation of protein-RNA, as well as protein-protein interactions, which has implications for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2032264569,"Activating mutations in the kinase domain of the EGF receptor have been reported in non-small cell lung cancer. The majority of tumors expressing these mutants are sensitive to ATP mimetics that inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase. The effect of antibodies that bind to the ectodomain of the receptor is less clear. We report herein the effects and mechanisms of action of the antibody cetuximab in lung cancer cells that naturally express receptor mutations and in ErbB-null 32D hematopoietic cells transfected with mutant EGFR. Treatment with cetuximab down-regulated EGFR levels and inhibited cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. This was associated with inhibition of ligand-independent EGFR signaling. These effects were seen in 32D cells arguing the growth inhibitory action was not because of the blockade of autocrine ligand action. Both antibody-induced EGFR down-regulation and inhibition of growth required receptor dimerization as monovalent Fab fragments only eliminated receptor levels or reduced cell proliferation in the presence of antihuman IgG. Finally, cetuximab inhibited growth of H1975 lung cancer cells and xenografts, which expressed L858R/T790M EGFR and were resistant to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These data suggest that cetuximab is an effective therapy against mutant EGFR-expressing cancer cells and thus can be considered in combination with other anti-EGFR molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2088418379,"The increase in the mass of adipose tissue during the development of obesity can arise through an increase in cell size, an increase in cell number, or both. Here we show that long term maintenance of C57BL/6 mice on a high fat diet (for ∼25 weeks) induces an initial increase in adipocyte size followed by an increase in adipocyte number in white adipose tissue. The latter effect was found to be accompanied by up-regulation of expression of the gene for the F-box protein Skp2 as well as by downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, a principal target of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase, in white adipose tissue. Ablation of Skp2 protected mice from the development of obesity induced either by a high fat diet or by the lethal yellow agouti (Ay) mutation, and this protective action was due to inhibition of the increase in adipocyte number without an effect on adipocyte hypertrophy. The reduction in the number of adipocyte caused by Skp2 ablation also inhibited the development of obesity-related insulin resistance in the Ay mutant mice, although the reduced number of β cells and reduced level of insulin secretion in Skp2-deficient mice resulted in glucose intolerance. Our observations thus indicate that Skp2 controls adipocyte proliferation during the development of obesity.

Stuckler D. Brownell K.D. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The expansion of WAT during the development of obesity can occur through increases in cell number (adipocyte hyperplasia) and in cell size (adipocyte hypertrophy) (2Haslam D.W. James W.P. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1197-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3425) Google Scholar, 3Hausman D.B. DiGirolama M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. Obesity Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, the precise contribution of adipocyte number to the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance remains unclear. The number of adipocytes is thought to increase as a result of the proliferation of preadipocytes and their subsequent differentiation into mature adipocytes (4Bjorntorp P. Horm. Metab. Res. 1974; 4: 77-83PubMed Google Scholar, 5Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Both the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes are characterized by marked changes in the pattern of gene expression that are achieved by the sequential induction of various transcription factors, including members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP-α,-β, and -δ), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ,-β, and -δ), basic helix-loop-helix (SREBP-1c), and Kruppel-like zinc-finger factor (KLF-5 and -15) families (6Oishi Y.

These proteins are thought to act synergistically in the transcriptional activation of a variety of adipocytespecific genes, with each also reciprocally activating the expression of the others (8Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In addition to transcription factors, the cell cycle plays an important role in adipogenesis, given that inhibition of DNA synthesis prevents the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes (10Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17653-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation is regulated at each phase of the cell cycle by the activation and deactivation of various cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (11Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar, 12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 13: 1501-1512Crossref Scopus (5071) Google Scholar). CDK4 and CDK2 regulate the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle as well as progression of S phase by phosphorylating substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (13Tsai L.-H. Harlow E. Meyerson M. Nature. 1991; 353: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Elledge S.J. Spottswood R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2653-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rb induces its dissociation from the E2F1 complex, the latter of which then promotes cell cycle progression (15Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that CDK2 (16Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 3: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) are essential not only for cell proliferation but also for differentiation during adipogenesis. CKIs include two families of proteins, the Cip (Kip) family and Ink4 family, and are central players in the exit of cells from the cell cycle (20Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The loss of p27Kip1 or p21Cip1 in mice leads to adipocyte hyperplasia as a result of increased proliferation or recruitment of preadipocytes (21Naaz A. Holsberger D.R. Iwamoto G.A. Nelson A. Kiyokawa H. Cooke P.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1925-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that these CKIs are important in regulation of adipocyte number. The SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex targets CKIs for degradation by the 26 S proteasome and thereby regulates cell cycle progression (22Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Skp2, the substrate-binding subunit of the SCFSkp2 complex, contributes to the degradation of p27Kip1, an inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK1 activities that promote entry into S phase and mitosis, respectively. The abundance of Skp2 is increased in various human cancers, in which its expression is inversely related to that of p27Kip1 (23Pagano M. Benmaamar R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the role of Skp2 in adipogenesis and show here that the amount of Skp2 mRNA is increased in WAT during the development of obesity in mice. Our genetic analyses further suggest that Skp2 controls adipocyte proliferation during the development of this condition in mice. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies to Skp2 and to Erk1 or Erk2 (Erk1/2) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), respectively. Antibodies to p27Kip1 and to cyclin E1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An adenovirus encoding Skp2 was generated as described previously (24Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Miyake S. Ishida N. Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Iemura S. Natsume T. Nakayama K.I. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Animals—Male C57BL/6 and KKAy/TaJcl mice were obtained from CLEA Japan. Skp2 knock-out mice were generated as described previously (25Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Parental Skp2+/- mice used to generate Skp2+/+, Skp2+/-, and Skp2-/- littermates for the present study were derived by backcrossing the C57BL6/129SV knock-out strain onto the C57BL/6 background for seven or eight generations. We crossed KKAy/TaJcl mice with Skp2+/- mice on the C57BL/6 background and then crossed resulting male Ay/+;Skp2+/- and female +/+; Skp2+/- animals to obtain male Ay/+;Skp2-/- and Ay/+;Skp2+/+ littermates on the C57BL/6 and KK hybrid background. Only male mice were used for experiments. For examination of the effects of a high fat diet, mice were fed from 4 weeks of age with chow containing 30% fat by weight as described previously (26Inoue H. Ogawa W. Ozaki M. Haga S. Matsumoto M. Furukawa K. Hashimoto N. Kido Y. Mori T. Sakaue H. Teshigawara K. Jin S. Iguchi H. Hiramatsu R. LeRoith D. Takeda K. Akira S. Kasuga M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 164-174Google Scholar). Experiments with mice were performed according to the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. Determination of Adipocyte Size and Number—Samples of mouse adipose tissue for determination of cell size were obtained from the epididymal or subcutaneous fat pads. The tissue (∼100 mg) was fixed with osmium tetroxide (Sigma) as described (27Hirsch J. Gallian E. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 110-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suspended in isotonic saline, and passed through a 250-μm nylon filter to remove fibrous elements. The filtrate was then passed through a 25-μm nylon filter to trap fixed adipocytes (with a diameter of >25 μm), and the cells were washed extensively with isotonic saline. A total of 10,000 cells was analyzed as described previously (28Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of a Coulter counter equipped with a 560-μm aperture tube, a stirred sample chamber, and a multichannel particle analyzer (Multisizer II, Coulter Electronics, Fullerton, CA). Analysis of the distribution of adipocyte size was performed for cells ranging from 25 to 250 μm in diameter. Given that the weight of the stromal-vascular fraction, including preadipocytes, is <5% of WAT weight, 3H. Sakaue, T. Nakamura, and M. Kasuga, unpublished observations. the total adipocyte number in WAT was determined by dividing the total WAT weight (milligrams) by the estimated mean adipocyte weight (milligrams). The latter parameter was calculated by multiplying adipocyte density (0.948 mg/ml) (29Keys A. Brozek J. Physiol. Rev. 1953; 33: 245-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) by mean adipocyte volume (milliliters), the latter of which was determined from the average value of adipocyte diameter directly measured with the Coulter counter. Immunoblot and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analyses—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (30Sakaue H. Konishi M. Ogawa W. Asaki T. Mori T. Yamasaki M. Takata M.

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR analysis was also performed as described (32Miyake K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with a Sequence detector (model 7900, Applied Biosystems) and with 36B4 mRNA as the invariant control. The primers (upstream and downstream, respectively) were 5′-AGAAATCTCTTCGGCCCGGTCAATCA-3′ and 5′-CTCCACCTCCTGCCACTCGTATCTGC-3′ for p27Kip1 mRNA, 5′-AACTTGGTGCGACTAAACCTTTGTG-3′ and 5′-TTCGGTAGCCGCTGAGGTTC-3′ for Skp2 mRNA, and 5′-AATTGCCAAGATTGACAAGACTGTG-3′ and 5′-ATGCAGTCCTAGGGTATTCAAGCTC-3′ for cyclin E1 mRNA. The primers for mouse 36B4 mRNA were as described previously (32Miyake K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Histology and Immunostaining—The pancreas and adipose tissue of mice were fixed overnight in buffered 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of ∼5 μm. The sections were mounted on Silane-treated slides and either stained with hematoxylin-eosin or subjected to immunostaining with antibodies to insulin and to glucagon (Dako, Kyoto, Japan). Immune complexes were detected with Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Images were acquired with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss). The size of pancreatic islets and that of β cells (islet size/β cell number) were determined by analysis of at least 50 islets per animal with LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss). Islet density (total islet area/pancreas area) was determined with an image analyzer (Image Processor for Analytical Pathology, Sumika Technoservice, Hyogo, Japan). Sections of the pancreas were also stained with antibodies to insulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate kit, Dako). Glucose Tolerance Test, Insulin Tolerance Test, and Measurement of Insulin Release—Mice were deprived of food for 16 h before oral loading with glucose (2 g per kilogram of body mass) for a glucose tolerance test, during which blood samples were collected at various times (0-120 min). An insulin tolerance test was performed with mice in the randomly fed state; blood glucose concentration was determined at various times (0-120 min) after intraperitoneal injection of human regular insulin (0.75 units/kg). Insulin release was measured as described previously (33Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Mice that had been deprived of food for 16 h were thus subjected to intraperitoneal injection of glucose (3 g/kg), the plasma concentration of insulin was measured at various times (0-30 min) thereafter, and insulin release was evaluated from the area under the curve between 0 and 15 min. Analysis of Metabolic Parameters—Blood glucose level was determined with a glucometer (Glutest Pro, Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho, Nagoya, Japan), and plasma insulin concentration was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and a mouse insulin standard (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). Serum leptin was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for mouse leptin (Morinaga, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between two groups were evaluated by Student's unpaired two-tailed t test as performed with StatView software. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effect of a High Fat Diet on Adipocyte Number in WAT—We first examined the size and number of adipocytes in WAT of C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet or regular chow from 4 weeks of age. Maintenance of mice on the high fat diet increased body weight and the weight of epididymal WAT by 9.0 and 0.45 g, respectively, after 10 weeks and by 19.9 and 1.3 g, respectively, after 26 weeks, compared with mice fed the normal diet (Fig. 1, A and B). The high fat diet also induced a marked increase in the size of adipocytes (Fig. 1C) but had no effect on adipocyte number (Fig. 1D) in epididymal WAT after 10 weeks. In contrast, after 26 weeks, the high fat diet increased both adipocyte size and number (Fig. 1, C and D). The size of adipocytes did not differ significantly, however, between mice fed the high fat diet for 10 or 26 weeks. These results thus showed that an increase in adipocyte size precedes an increase in adipocyte number in C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet. The loss of p27Kip1 in mice results in adipocyte hyperplasia as a result of increased proliferation or recruitment of preadipocytes (21Naaz A. Holsberger D.R. Iwamoto G.A. Nelson A. Kiyokawa H. Cooke P.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1925-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the high fat diet affected p27Kip1 expression in WAT. Maintenance of C57BL/6 mice on the high fat diet for 10 weeks, which had no effect on adipocyte number, did not affect the abundance of p27Kip1 in epididymal WAT, as compared with that apparent in animals fed the normal diet (Fig. 1E). In contrast, feeding with the high fat diet for 26 weeks resulted in a marked down-regulation of the amount of p27Kip1 in WAT without an effect on the amount of the corresponding mRNA (Fig. 1, E and F). Although Skp2 was not detected in epididymal WAT by immunoblot analysis, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the amount of Skp2 mRNA in this tissue was increased in mice fed the high fat diet for 26 weeks compared with that in those fed normal chow (Fig. 1, E and F). Similar results with regard to the effects of the high fat diet on p27Kip1 and Skp2 expression were obtained with subcutaneous WAT (data not shown). Feeding of mice with the high fat diet for 26 weeks also induced a slight decrease in the abundance of cyclin E1, another substrate of SCFSkp2 (23Pagano M. Benmaamar R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), in epididymal WAT without a significant effect on the amount of the corresponding mRNA (Fig. 1, E and F). The high fat diet thus both increased the expression of Skp2 and down-regulated that of p27Kip1 and cyclin E1 in WAT, and these effects were accompanied by an increase in adipocyte number. Adipocyte and Pancreatic β Cell Numbers in Skp2-/- Mice—To investigate whether the loss of Skp2 affects the proliferative response of adipocytes to a high fat diet, we first determined WAT weight in Skp2-/- mice fed with normal chow. As previously described (25Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), Skp2-/- mice are smaller than their Skp2+/+ littermates; their body weight was thus reduced by ∼30% compared with that of wild-type animals at 20 weeks of age (Table 1). The Skp2-/- mice at 20 weeks of age were also lean, as reflected in marked reductions in the ratios of epididymal, subcutaneous, or retroperitoneal WAT weight to body weight. Neither body weight nor the ratios of WAT weight to body weight differed significantly between Skp2+/+ and Skp2+/- mice. Measurement of adipocyte diameter revealed that adipocytes of epididymal WAT were slightly larger in Skp2-/- mice than in Skp2+/+ mice (Fig. 2, A-C). The number of adipocytes in epididymal WAT was reduced in Skp2-/- mice compared with that in Skp2+/+ mice (Fig. 2D), and this difference thus appeared to be responsible for the difference in WAT mass.TABLE 1Ratios of the weight of various tissues or organs to body weight in Skp2+/+, Skp2+/−, and Skp2−/− mice at 20 weeks of ageParameterSkp2+/+Skp2+/−Skp2−/−Body weight (g)32.1 ± 0.734.9 ± 2.421.6 ± 0.4ap < 0.005 versus Skp2+/+ mice.WAT/BW (mg/g)Epididymal WAT20.5 ± 2.519.1 ± 1.714.7 ± 1.2bp < 0.05 versus Skp2+/+ mice.Subcutaneous WAT13.1 ± 0.912.8 ± 18.010.3 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 versus Skp2+/+ mice.Retroperitoneal WAT6.9 ± 1.07.1 ± 0.74.1 ± 0.4bp < 0.05 versus Skp2+/+ mice.BAT/BW (mg/g)4.6 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.1Liver/BW (mg/g)46.5 ± 0.845.1 ± 1.046.7 ± 1.7Muscle/BW (mg/g)10.2 ± 0.511.1 ± 0.39.1 ± 1.1Spleen/BW (mg/g)2.9 ± 0.2NDcND, not determined.2.9 ± 0.1Pancreas/BW (mg/g)9.6 ± 0.38.3 ± 0.46.9 ± 0.4ap < 0.005 versus Skp2+/+ mice.a p < 0.005 versus Skp2+/+ mice.b p < 0.05 versus Skp2+/+ mice.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab There were no significant differences in the ratios of brown adipose tissue, liver, muscle (soleus plus gastrocnemius), or spleen weight to body weight among Skp2+/+, Skp2+/-, and Skp2-/- mice (Table 1). However, the ratio of the weight of the pancreas to body weight was significantly smaller in Skp2-/- mice than in their wild-type littermates. A detailed histological analysis of pancreatic sections revealed no differences in islet density (Fig. 2E) or islet size (Fig. 2, F and G) between Skp2-/- and Skp2+/+ mice. In contrast, β cells were hypertrophic, manifesting abnormalities such as nuclear enlargement, and were reduced in number in Skp2-/- mice (Fig. 2, H and I). These mutant mice thus have reduced numbers of adipocytes in WAT and of β cells in the pancreas compared with Skp2+/+ mice. Glucose Intolerance in Skp2-/- Mice—The blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations in the fasted or fed state did not differ significantly between Skp2-/- and Skp2+/+ mice at 11-12 weeks of age (Table 2). However, an oral glucose tolerance test revealed marked glucose intolerance in Skp2-/- mice (Fig. 3A). An insulin tolerance test showed that Skp2-/- and Skp2+/+ mice were similarly sensitive to the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous insulin (Fig. 3B). To evaluate further the function of pancreatic β cells in Skp2-/- mice, we measured the release of insulin in response to glucose stimulation (33Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The insulin secretory response of Skp2-/- mice was reduced compared with that of Skp2+/+ mice as early as 2 min after intraperitoneal injection of glucose, and this difference remained apparent for up to 30 min (Fig. 3C). The area under the curve for the plasma insulin concentration between 0 and 15 min after glucose injection was significantly smaller for Skp2-/- mice than for their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3D). These data indicated that the reduced number of β cells in Skp2-/- mice is reflected in a reduced insulin secretory response to glucose.TABLE 2Blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations of Skp2+/+, Skp2+/−, and Skp2−/− mice fed high fat or regular dietsParameterRegular dietHigh fat dietSkp2+/+Skp2+/−Skp2−/−Skp2+/+Skp2+/−Skp2−/−Glucose, fasting (mg/dl)80 ± 474 ± 288 ± 788 ± 684 ± 479 ± 2Glucose, fed (mg/dl)138 ± 3137 ± 2135 ± 2174 ± 5173 ± 4167 ± 7Insulin, fasting (ng/ml)0.12 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.070.55 ± 0.110.54 ± 0.130.44 ± 0.08Insulin, fed (ng/ml)0.52 ± 0.11NDaND, not determined.0.49 ± 0.055.41 ± 0.985.12 ± 0.525.23 ± 1.01a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Resistance of Skp2-/- Mice to Diet-induced Obesity—Wild-type mice fed the high fat diet gained 11.0 and 9.9 g in body weight between 8 and 16 weeks and between 20 and 28 weeks of age, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, Skp2+/- mice on this diet gained 11.1 and 8.7 g from 8 to 16 weeks and from 20 to 28 weeks, respectively. In contrast, Skp2-/- mice fed the high fat diet gained only 6.8 g from 8 to 16 weeks and 2.5 g from 20 to 28 weeks of age. The gain in the weight of WAT induced by the high fat diet was also significantly smaller for Skp2-/- mice than for their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4C). Whereas the size of adipocytes in epididymal WAT was similar for 28-week-old Skp2+/+ and Skp2-/- mice fed the high fat diet (Fig. 4D), the number of these cells was markedly reduced in the mutant animals (Fig. 4E), suggesting that their lean phenotype was attributable to this difference in adipocyte number. Consistent with the smaller WAT mass in Skp2-/- mice compared with that in wild-type animals on the high fat diet, the serum concentration of leptin was significantly lower in the Skp2-deficient mice (Fig. 4F). We next examined the effect of the high fat diet on the abundance of p27Kip1 and cyclin E1 in WAT of Skp2-/- mice at 30 weeks of age. Whereas the high fat diet induced downregulation of both p27Kip1 and cyclin E1 in epididymal WAT of Skp2+/+ mice, it had no such effects in that of Skp2-/- mice (Fig. 4G). The amounts of p27Kip1 and cyclin E1 mRNAs in epididymal WAT did not differ between mice of the two genotypes maintained on the high fat diet (Fig. 4H). These results suggested that Skp2-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 and cyclin E1 may be required for adipocyte proliferation in response to feeding a high fat diet. Metabolic Phenotype of Skp2-/- Mice Fed a High Fat Diet—We next investigated whether the resistance of Skp2-/- mice to obesity induced by a high fat diet was accompanied by protection from diet-induced insulin resistance. No significant difference in blood glucose or plasma insulin concentrations in the randomly fed state was apparent between 8- to 16-week-old Skp2-/- and Skp2+/+ mice maintained on the high fat diet (Fig. 5, A and B, and Table 2). Whereas, both Skp2+/+ (Fig. 5B) and Skp2+/- (data not shown) mice fed the high fat diet manifested pronounced hyperinsulinemia at 28 weeks of age, the plasma insulin concentration of Skp2-/- mice maintained on this diet did not differ between 16 and 28 weeks of age (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, in contrast to those of Skp2+/+ mice, pancreatic sections of Skp2-/- mice showed no compensatory increase in β cell mass in response to the high fat diet (Fig. 5C). Although these findings suggested that the protection from obesity conferred by Skp2 ablation was associated with prevention of the induction of insulin resistance by a high fat diet, an insulin tolerance test revealed that sensitivity to exogenous insulin did not differ between 28-week-old Skp2-/- and Skp2+/+ mice fed such a diet (Fig. 5D). Resistance of Skp2-/- Mice to Obesity Induced by the Lethal Yellow Agouti (Ay) Mutation—To confirm that loss of Skp2 protects against the development of obesity and obesity-induced insulin resistance, we generated Skp2-/- mice with the lethal yellow agouti (Ay) mutation. Mice that contain this mutation are studied as a well characterized animal model of obesity. We thus first crossed Skp2+/- mice and KKAy mice, in which the Ay mutation is present on the KK background (34Iwatsuka H. Shino A. Suzuoki Z. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1970; 17: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We then obtained male Ay/+;Skp2-/- and Ay/+;Skp2+/+ littermates on the C57BL/6 and KK hybrid background by crossing Ay/+;Skp2+/- males and +/+; Skp2+/- females. Ay/+;Skp2-/- mice were found to be smaller than their Ay/+;Skp2+/+ littermates at 4 weeks of age (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, Ay/+;Skp2-/- mice gained ∼37% less weight than did Ay/+;Skp2+/+ mice between 4 and 18 weeks of age (Fig. 6, A and B). This difference in body weight between the two genotypes at 18 weeks of age was attributable at least in part to a smaller WAT weight in the former animals (Fig. 6C). The number of adipocytes in epididymal WAT was significantly smaller in Ay/+;Skp2-/- mice than in Ay/+;Skp2+/+ mice, whereas adipocyte size did not differ between the two genotypes (Fig. 6, D and E). Blood glucose concentration did not differ significantly between Ay/+;Skp2-/- and Ay/+;Skp2+/+ littermates in the randomly fed state at 8, 12, or 16 weeks of age (Fig. 7A). In Ay/+;Skp2+/+ mice, the plasma concentration of insulin was greatly increased at 12 and 16 weeks of age concomitant with the development of obesity (Fig. 7B). In Ay/+;Skp2-/- mice, however, the plasma concentration of insulin at 12 or 16 weeks of age was similar to that apparent at 8 weeks of age. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed glucose intolerance in Ay/+; Skp2-/- mice at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 7C), whereas an insulin tolerance test showed that these mice were hypersensitive to the glucose-lowering effect of exogenous insulin at 16 weeks of age (Fig. 7D). Insulin immunostaining of pancreatic sections also showed that, in contrast to that in Ay/+;Skp2+/+ mice, β cell mass was not increased in Ay/+; Skp2-/- mice at 18 weeks of age (Fig. 7E). The enlargement of WAT during the development of obesity is mediated by an increase in the size of existing adipocytes and the formation of new adipocytes, the latter of which is referred to herein as adipocyte proliferation. We have shown that maintenance of C57BL/6 mice on a high fat diet for 10 weeks induced adipocyte hypertrophy without an increase in adipocyte number. In contrast, feeding mice such a diet for an additional 16 weeks resulted in an ∼2.2-fold increase in adipocyte number without a further increase in adipocyte size. The expansion of WAT mass in mice fed a high fat diet thus appears to be characterized by an initial increase in adipocyte size, until a maximal size is reached, followed by an increase in adipocyte number. Maintenance of mice on a high fat diet for 26 weeks also resulted in down-regulation of the expression of p27Kip1 in WAT. Regulation of p27Kip1 function is mediated in part by Skp2-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (23Pagano M. Benmaamar R. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to detect induction of Skp2 in WAT by immunoblot analysis, the down-regulation of p27Kip1 in WAT of mice fed the high fat diet was accompanied by an increase in the amount of Skp2 mRNA. The high fat diet-induced down-regulation of p27Kip1 was also not apparent in WAT of Skp2-/- mice. Furthermore, the lack of Skp2 protected mice on such a diet from the development of obesity, and this effect was attributable to inhibition of adipocyte proliferation rather than to prevention of adipocyte hypertrophy. Recent studies have demonstrated a functional role for Skp2 in mediating p27Kip1 degradation during the replicating process of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro (35Auld C.A. Hopkins R.G. Fernandes K.M. Morrison R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Auld C.A. Caccia C.D. Morrison R.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that Skp2-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 directly controls adipocyte proliferation during the development of obesity. In addition to a reduced number of adipocytes in WAT, Skp2-/- mice fed a high fat diet manifested a reduced number of β cells in the pancreas. We have previously shown that overexpression of p27Kip1 in β cells induced hyperglycemia in mice as a result of inhibition of β cell proliferation (37Uchida T. Nakamura T. Hashimoto N. Matsuda T. Kotani K. Sakaue H. Kido Y. Hayashi Y. Nakayama K.I. White M.F. Kasuga M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The transcription factor E2F1, which controls the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle, regulates both the growth of the pancreas and the number of β cells, but the size of β cells in E2F1 knock-out mice was found not to differ from that in wild-type animals (38Fajas L. Annicotte J.-S. Miard S. Sarruf D. Watanabe M. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The number and size of pancreatic β cells were recently shown to be reduced in mice that lack receptors for both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 in β cells as well as in those lacking phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) in these cells (39Ueki K. Okada T. Hu J. Liew C.W. Assmann A. Dahlgren G.M. Peters J.L. Shackman J.G. Zhang M. Artner I. Satin L.S. Stein R. Holzenberger M. Kennedy R.T. Kahn C.R. Kulkarni R.N. Nat.

Okamura H. Arden K.C. Herrera P.L. Noda T. Kasuga M. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Haploinsufficiency of the gene for the transcription factor Foxo1 in these PDK1 mutant mice resulted in a marked increase in the number, but not in the size, of β cells (40Hashimoto N. Kido Y. Uchida T. Asahara S. Shigeyama Y. Matsuda T. Takeda A. Tsuchihashi D. Nishizawa A. Ogawa W. Fujimoto Y. Okamura H. Arden K.C. Herrera P.L. Noda T. Kasuga M. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, Foxo1, which is regulated by a PDK1-dependent insulin signaling pathway, functions through Skp2 to regulate tumor cell proliferation (41Zhang L. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Skp2 may be a target of a PDK1-Foxo1 signaling pathway that regulates β cell number. Given the role of Skp2 in cell cycle progression, the reduced numbers of adipocytes and β cells that result from Skp2 deficiency in mice fed a high fat diet likely reflect the operation of a cell-autonomous mechanism. However, given that insulin stimulates both preadipocyte replication and adipocyte differentiation in vitro (3Hausman D.B. DiGirolama M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. Obesity Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 42Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Pals C. Banerji L. Thomas N.S. Lam E.W. Bürgering B.M. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 43Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar), the reduced number of β cells and reduced level of insulin secretion apparent in Skp2-/- mice may contribute to the inhibition of adipocyte proliferation during feeding on a high fat diet. Conversely, it is also possible that the reduced number of adipocytes may play a role in the reduction in β cell number. To investigate the consequences of a decrease in the number of adipocytes in WAT on whole-body insulin sensitivity, we performed an insulin tolerance test in Skp2+/+ and Skp2-/- mice with the obesity-inducing Ay mutation. Loss of Skp2 in the Ay mutant mice resulted in marked potentiation of the glucoselowering effect of exogenous insulin, suggesting that the reduction in the number of adipocytes caused by Skp2 ablation in these animals inhibited the development of obesity-related insulin resistance. However, given that hyperinsulinemia per se induces insulin resistance (44Zick Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and that, in contrast to the Ay/+; Skp2+/+ mice, the Ay/+;Skp2-/- mice did not develop hyperinsulinemia, generation of adipocyte-specific Skp2 knock-out mice will be required to confirm this conclusion. In summary, the intake of excess calories associated with feeding on a high fat diet in mice, and likely that associated with overeating in humans, results in storage of the extra energy initially through an increase in adipocyte size. Adipocytes do not have an unlimited capacity for enlargement, however, and long term intake of excess calories eventually results in an increase in adipocyte number to accommodate storage of the surplus energy. We have now shown that this increase in adipocyte number is associated with up-regulation of Skp2 expression in WAT. Furthermore, ablation of Skp2 resulted in inhibition of the increase in adipocyte number and improvement of obesity-related insulin resistance in obesity-prone mice. We therefore propose that Skp2 plays an essential role in adipocyte proliferation during the development of obesity. Identification of the mechanism responsible for the up-regulation of Skp2 expression in WAT during the development of obesity may provide a basis for new therapeutics targeted to obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2007702516,"A number of alanine mutations in extracellular loop two (ECL2) of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) were found to increase or decrease basal activity when compared with the wild type receptor. K565A was identified as a mutant with decreased basal activity, and strongly impaired hormone induced signaling activity. To gain insights into how ECL2 mutants affect basal activity, we focused on constitutively activating pathogenic mutant I568V in ECL2, which exhibits elevated basal activity. Because our molecular model suggests that Ile-568 is embedded in an environment of hydrophobic residues provided by transmembrane helix bundle, we tested mutants in this region to identify potential interaction partner(s) for Ile-568. Indeed, the double mutant I568V/I640L (ECL2/TMH6) suppresses the increased basal activity exhibited by I568V alone. We suggest a spatial and functional relationship between ECL2 and TMH6 in which side chain interaction between Ile-568 and Ile-640 constrains the receptor in a conformation with low basal activity. Although the single mutant I640L exhibits basal activity lower than wild type, its differently branched and bulkier side chain complements the reduced side chain bulk in I568V, restoring wild type basal activity to the double mutant. This scenario is confirmed by the reciprocal double mutant I640V/I568L. The combination of basally increased activity of I640V and basally decreased activity of mutant I568L also restores basal activity of wild type TSHR. These and other mutant phenotypes reported here support a dynamic interface between TMH6 and ECL2. Disruption of this critical interface for signaling by introduction of mutations in TSHR can either increase or decrease basal activity. A number of alanine mutations in extracellular loop two (ECL2) of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) were found to increase or decrease basal activity when compared with the wild type receptor. K565A was identified as a mutant with decreased basal activity, and strongly impaired hormone induced signaling activity. To gain insights into how ECL2 mutants affect basal activity, we focused on constitutively activating pathogenic mutant I568V in ECL2, which exhibits elevated basal activity. Because our molecular model suggests that Ile-568 is embedded in an environment of hydrophobic residues provided by transmembrane helix bundle, we tested mutants in this region to identify potential interaction partner(s) for Ile-568. Indeed, the double mutant I568V/I640L (ECL2/TMH6) suppresses the increased basal activity exhibited by I568V alone. We suggest a spatial and functional relationship between ECL2 and TMH6 in which side chain interaction between Ile-568 and Ile-640 constrains the receptor in a conformation with low basal activity. Although the single mutant I640L exhibits basal activity lower than wild type, its differently branched and bulkier side chain complements the reduced side chain bulk in I568V, restoring wild type basal activity to the double mutant. This scenario is confirmed by the reciprocal double mutant I640V/I568L. The combination of basally increased activity of I640V and basally decreased activity of mutant I568L also restores basal activity of wild type TSHR. These and other mutant phenotypes reported here support a dynamic interface between TMH6 and ECL2. Disruption of this critical interface for signaling by introduction of mutations in TSHR can either increase or decrease basal activity.

Here, for the first time, we provide a systematic evaluation of important functional properties of amino acids within the ECL2 of TSHR to gain insights into how ECL2 affects the signaling activity.Most pathogenic CAMs reported in the ECLs of TSHR are hydrophobic amino acids (ECL1, I486M,I486F (17Parma J.

Disruption of hydrophobic interactions caused by mutations at these positions may be responsible for structural rearrangements resulting in constitutive receptor activation. Because I568T,I568V in ECL2 are pathogenic CAMs (17Parma J. Van S e J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Claus M. Maier J. Paschke R. Kujat C. Stumvoll M. Fuhrer D. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we assumed a tight hydrophobic interaction for Ile-568 in the partially active wild type basal conformation. A structural model of the serpentine domain of TSHR based on the rhodopsin structure (21Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar) orientates the ECL2 between the TMHs, where Ile-568 is located at the tip of ECL2 and is embedded in an environment of hydrophobic residues provided by TMH1, -2, -6, and -7. To identify hydrophobic residues at the TMHs that may interact with Ile-568 to constrain the basal conformation, we systematically tested amino acids at TMH1, -2, -6, and -7 that are located within a feasible interaction distance with Ile-568 suggested by the putative receptor structure. Indeed, the double mutant I568V/I640L suppressed constitutive cAMP signaling of I568V to wild type level, suggesting a structural and functional interplay between ECL2 and TMH6. Our findings provide new insights into structure-function relationships in GPHRs and highlight the importance of interactions between ECL2 and TMH6 for basal activity of TSHR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—The TSHR mutants were constructed by PCR mutagenesis using the human TSHR plasmid TSHR-pSVL as template as described previously (22Libert F. Lefort A. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Perret J. Ludgate M. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1250-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) PCR fragments were digested with BspTI and Eco91I (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The obtained fragments were used to replace the corresponding fragments in the WT TSHR-pSVL constructs. Mutated TSHR sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing with dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing chemistry (ABI Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD).Cell Culture and Transient Expression of Mutant TSHRs— COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transiently transfected in 12-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) or 48-well plates (0.25 × 105 cells/well) with 1 μg of respective 0.25 μg of DNA/well using the GeneJammer® transfection reagent (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).FACS Analyses—The TSH receptor cell surface expression level was quantified on a FACS flow cytometer. Transfected cells were detached from the dishes with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline and transferred into Falcon 2054 tubes. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3 and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of a mouse anti-human TSHR antibody (2C11, 10 mg/liter, Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK) in the same buffer. Cells were washed twice and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein-conjugated F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Serotec). Before FACS analysis (FACscan, BD Biosciences) cells were washed twice and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Receptor expression was determined by the mean fluorescence intensity. The WT TSHR was set at 100%, and receptor expression of the mutants was calculated according to this. The percentage of signal positive cells corresponds to transfection efficiency, which was ∼60-70% of viable cells for each mutant.cAMP Accumulation Assay—For cAMP assays, cells were grown and transfected in 48-well plates. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were preincubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with 100 milliunits/ml bTSH (Sigma) for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of 0.1 n HCl. Supernatants were collected and dried. cAMP content of the cell extracts was determined using the cAMP AlphaScreen™ assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Stimulation of Inositol Phosphate Formation—Forty hours after transfection, cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml myo[3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Braunschweig, Germany) for 8 h. Thereafter cells were preincubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min. Stimulation by bTSH was performed in the same medium containing 100 milliunits/ml bTSH (Sigma) for 1 h. Intracellular inositol-phosphate (IP) levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography as described (23Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). IP values are expressed as the percentage of radioactivity incorporated from [3H]inositol-phosphates (IP1-3) over the sum of radioactivity incorporated in IPs and phosphatidylinositols.Linear Regression Analysis of Constitutive Activity as a Function of TSHR Expression (Slopes)—The constitutive activity is expressed as basal cAMP formation as a function of receptor expression determined by 125I-bTSH binding. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected in 24-well plates (0.5 × 105 cells/well) with increasing concentrations of WT or mutant TSHR DNA (50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 ng/well). For radioligand binding assays, cells were incubated in the presence of 160,000-180,000 cpm/ml of 125I-bTSH (BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5 milliunits/ml nonlabeled bTSH (Sigma). For cAMP assays, 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed using 0.1 n HCl. Supernatants were collected and dried. The cAMP levels were determined using the cAMP AlphaScreen Assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Basal cAMP formation as a function of receptor expression was analyzed according to Ballesteros et al. (24Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J.

The sheet-like fold of ECL2 and its general localization between the transmembrane helices were kept as in rhodopsin based on rhodopsin structure-consistent results for different accessibility of two CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antibodies, each specific for the two different β-strand epitopes of ECL2 of CCR5 (26Aarons E.J.

Wild type and mutated TSHRs were assessed after transient expression in COS-7 cells for cell surface expression, basal and TSH-stimulated cAMP, and IP accumulation. Cells transfected with a construct encoding the empty pSVL vector were used as controls.TABLE 1Functional characterization of alanine mutants at ECL2 COS-7 cells were transfected with the WT TSH receptor or described mutant TSH receptors. Functional assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because of the basal activity of the WT TSHR, cAMP levels are expressed as relative to WT TSHR basal (set at 1). Increase in cAMP and IP levels was determined after stimulation with 100 milliunits/ml bovine TSH. The TSH receptor cell surface expression was quantified on a FACS flow cytometer.

For the FSHR, the threonine mutant of Pro-519 (TSHR: Pro-571) is known as an inactivating pathogenic mutant caused by intracellular trapping of the receptor (31Meduri G. Touraine P. Beau I. Lahuna O. Desroches A. Vacher-Lavenu M.C. Kuttenn F. Misrahi M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 3491-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Amino acid Cys-569 is disulfide-linked to the conserved Cys-494 of TMH3 (Ballesteros and Weinstein number (32Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2413) Google Scholar) C3.25).Cell Surface Expression—FACS analyses revealed that the mutants show a cell surface expression in the range of 50-110% of WT TSHR with exception of mutants Y563A and I568A (Y563A 8.4%, I568A 18.7% of WT) (Table 1). We assume that the inactivity of the Y563A mutant is strongly related to its low number of receptors at the cell surface. Therefore, this mutant was not considered in further functional description.cAMP Accumulation—Alanine and phenylalanine mutants of Ile-568 are characterized by increased basal Gαs-mediated cAMP signaling when compared with WT (Table 1, supplemental Table 1). In contrast, mutants S561A, S562A, K565A, S567A, and M572A displayed decreased basal cAMP accumulation. For K565A, no basal cAMP signaling was observed (Table 1). TSH-mediated signaling is comparable with wild type or slightly decreased for all mutants (not under 50% when compared with maximum of WT) except mutant K565A with strongly impaired signaling activity.IP Accumulation—Basal inositol phosphate levels of all mutants were comparable with that of the WT TSHR (Table 1). Ligand-stimulated IP accumulation is markedly reduced by alanine mutants of Ser-561, Ser-562, Leu-565, Leu-570, and Met-572 (Table 1) and by V566F (supplemental Table 1).Potential Interaction Partners for Constitutively Activating Pathogenic Mutant I568VWe demonstrate that in addition to the known pathogenic CAMs I568T,I568V (17Parma J. Van S e J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Claus M. Maier J. Paschke R. Kujat C. Stumvoll M. Fuhrer D. Thyroid. 2005; 15: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), mutants I568A,I568F (Table 1, supplemental Table 1) are CAMs. Therefore, we hypothesized a tight hydrophobic interaction for Ile-568 with its counterpart(s) to constrain the basal WT conformation since slight side chain alterations at Ile-568 lead to a release of these constraints. Moreover, we assumed that similar modifications at the counterpart side chains (shorter, longer, or bulkier when compared with WT TSHR) might also result in constitutive activation of the TSHR. The molecular model of the TSHR suggests that ECL2 is plugged nearly horizontally into the transmembrane domain on the extracellular side. Isoleucine 568 is located at the tip of ECL2 and is directly flanked by the conserved Cys-569, which is disulfide-bridged to Cys-494 at TMH3 and embedded between hydrophobic residues of TMH1, -2, -6, and -7. The side chain of Ile-568 points downwards in a hydrophobic cleft between the TMH1, -2, -6, and -7, and toward potential interaction partners Leu-417 (TMH1), Ile-470 (TMH2), Ile-640 (TMH6), and Val-664 (TMH7) (Fig. 2). Thus we tested these four potential hydrophobic interaction partners for Ile-568 constructing valine or alanine mutants (Table 2). Indeed, the I640V mutant in TMH6 with reduced side chain length was a CAM (basal activity 240%, WT TSHR set at 100%). Interestingly, further modifications of Ile-640 to methionine (elongated but flexible side chain), leucine (different branching), and phenylalanine (angled side chain) are not CAMs (Table 3). The I640L single mutant showed a decreased cAMP basal activity (basal activity ∼40%, WT TSHR set at 100%, Table 3). Now, we opted to test whether this phenotype affects mutant I568V. Combining the CAM I568V in ECL2 and I640L in TMH6 in the double mutant I568V/I640L resulted in restoration of the WT level of basal cAMP signaling (Table 3). The cAMP accumulation of the double mutant I568V/I640L after hormone stimulation was comparable with I568V (Table 3), whereas the decreased level of the IP accumulation was comparable with the single mutant I640L (Table 3).FIGURE 2Schematic representation of the localization of Ile-568 at ECL2 and potential interaction partners in the transmembrane region. The structural model of TSHR based on rhodopsin suggests a localization of Ile-568 at the tip of ECL2 embedded in a hydrophobic environment formed by the residues Leu-417 (TMH1), Ile-470 (TMH2), Ile-640 (TMH6), and Val-664 (TMH7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 2Functional characterization of single mutants at TMH1, 2, 6 and 7 Potential hydrophobic interaction partners for I568 were constructed by substituting valine or alanine for the four potential interaction partners in TMH1, 2, 6, and 7.

Whereas I568V and all other known mutants at position 568 are CAMs (I568T,I568A,I568F (17Parma J. Van S e J. Swillens S. Tonacchera M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 725-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1, supplemental Table 1)), mutant I568L is basally inactive (Table 3). This phenotype corresponds exactly to the phenotype of I640L. The combination of CAM I640V and mutant I568L with decreased basal cAMP activity in reciprocal double mutant I640V/I568L restored the basal cAMP activity of wild type. Linear regression analysis of TSHR mutants I568V and I640V confirmed increased basal cAMP activity (supplemental Fig. 1). The expression level for mutants I568L, I640V, and I568L/I640V is close to 100%, and the signaling capacity induced by TSH is about 70% of wild type.DISCUSSIONNumerous data for different 7TMRs have shown the importance of ECL2 for receptor signaling (33Sudo S.

For the first time, the present study aimed to characterize systematically the amino acids within the ECL2 of TSHR by site-directed mutagenesis to provide deeper insights into the functional and structural interrelations during the processes of TSHR activation and intramolecular signal transduction.Lysine 565 in ECL2 Is a Key Player in the Intramolecular Signaling Processes of the TSHR—The alanine scan of ECL2 revealed K565A to be the most impaired mutant with respect to basal and hormone-induced activity (Table 1). We suggest two scenarios that might explain the low activity of K565A. (i) The cascade of constituents involved in the signal transmission process starting from the ligand-occupied ECD to intracellular effectors is interrupted by mutation of Lys-565 via breaking of hydrogen bonds or of electrostatic salt bridge interactions. (ii) Lys-565 is important for the formation of the active receptor state conformation by binding to a new interaction partner after hormone-induced signal initiation. The mutant is unable to stabilize the active receptor structurally and/or functionally.Mutant K565A at ECL2 is basally inactive and shows an impaired TSH-induced response.

Targeting HSP90 with ansamycin antibiotics disrupts the normal processing of clients of the HSP90 complex. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) is a tyrosine kinase receptor up-regulated and activated in several malignancies. Here we show that the PDGFRα forms a complex with HSP90 and the co-chaperone cdc37 in ovarian, glioblastoma, and lung cancer cells. Treatment of cancer cell lines expressing the PDGFRα with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) promotes degradation of the receptor. Likewise, phospho-Akt, a downstream target, is degraded after treatment with 17-AAG. In contrast, PDGFRα expression is not affected by 17-AAG in normal human smooth muscle cells or 3T3 fibroblasts. PDGFRα degradation by 17-AAG is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. High molecular weight, ubiquitinated forms of the receptor are detected in cells treated with 17-AAG and MG132. Degradation of the receptor is also inhibited by a specific neutralizing antibody to the PDGFRα but not by a neutralizing antibody to PDGF or by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Ultimately, PDGFRα-mediated cell proliferation is inhibited by 17-AAG. These results show that 17-AAG promotes PDGFRα degradation selectively in transformed cells. Thus, not only mutated tyrosine kinases but also overexpressed receptors in cancer cells can be targeted by 17-AAG.

HSP90 plays a key role in the process of protein folding, stabilization, and degradation (16Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The chaperone interacts with each substrate forming discrete subcomplexes, which contain different sets of co-chaperones. In cancer cells, HSP90 is present entirely in multichaperone complexes with high ATPase activity, being involved in the processing of oncoproteins critical to cancer progression (17Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). In contrast, in normal tissue, HSP90 is mostly un-complexed and latent, binding less avidly to client proteins (18Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J. Zhang L. Boehm M.F. Fritz L.C. Burrows F.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Many of the key signaling molecules deregulated in human cancers require HSP90 to stabilize their conformation and permit their function. In this manuscript, we investigate the role of HSP90 in the processing of the platelet derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), a protein implicated in transformation, particularly in human tumors originating in the mesenchyme. Ansamycin antibiotics bind to the ATP pocket of HSP90, altering the conformation of the multichaperone complex (19Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 20Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Consequently, HSP90-dependent protein folding and maturation are arrested and proteins are targeted for degradation. In cancer cells, HSP90 inhibitors (geldanamycin, radicicol, herbimycin A, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)), promote the degradation of HSP90-dependent oncoproteins, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death. Interestingly, geldanamycin derivatives accumulate and bind preferentially to HSP90 in tumor cells compared with normal cells, promoting selective cancer cell death (18Kamal A. Thao L. Sensintaffar J. Zhang L. Boehm M.F. Fritz L.C. Burrows F.J. Nature. 2003; 425: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar).

Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PDGFRα is particularly important to the physiologic functions of the mesenchyme, but its deregulation promotes transformation. For instance, the receptor is overexpressed and/or activated in glioblastomas (22Mao X. Hamoudi R.A. Cancer Genet.

Pathol. 1995; 141: 97-103PubMed Google Scholar). The PDGFRα is also expressed in epithelial cancers, such as ovarian tumors derived from mullerian elements, which are of dual epithelial/mesodermal origin (26Henriksen R. Funa K. Wilander E. Backstrom T. Ridderheim M. Oberg K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4550-4554PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schmandt R.E. Broaddus R. Lu K.H. Shvartsman H. Thornton A. Malpica A. Sun C. Bodurka D.C. Gershenson D.M.

Pathol. 1990; 136: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Given its role as an oncoprotein necessary for transformation, tumor growth, and progression, we hypothesized that a chaperone complex containing HSP90 may be needed for its stabilization. We report here that the PDGFRα forms a complex with HSP90 and the co-chaperone cdc37 in cancer cells. Targeting of HSP90 by 17-AAG leads to degradation of the receptor in transformed but not in untransformed cells. This is mediated by ubiquitination of the receptor and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. A consequence of HSP90 induced PDGFRα degradation is inhibition of PDGFRα-governed cancer cell proliferation.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Lawrence Quilliam of Indiana University. All cells were grown in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, unless otherwise specified, at 37 °C under 4% CO2 and were harvested during the log growth phase, at 80-90% confluence. Immunoblotting—Actively growing cells were lysed into RIPA buffer containing leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), PMSF (400 μm), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). Cell lysates were sonicated and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein from the supernatants (usually 100 μg per sample) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and treated with a primary antibody: anti-phospho Ser473Akt rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution), anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution), anti-PDGFRα antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), anti-PDGFRβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250), anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:3000), anti-HSP90 antibody (StressGen 1:500 dilution), anti-cdc37 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution), anti-PI 3-kinase, p85 antibody (Upstate, 1:3,000 dilution), anti-phospho-PDGFRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution), anti-β1 integrin antibody (Chemicon, 1:1000 dilution), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:10,000 dilution) during an overnight incubation at 4 °C. After incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies, enhanced chemiluminescence was used for protein visualization. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and PMSF (400 μm).

After 15 min, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet cellular debris. 500 μg of protein from the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PDGFRα or with anti-cdc37 antibodies, then with 30 μl of a slurry of Protein G Plus-agarose beads for 90 min at 4 °C. Rabbit or mouse specific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as a control for immunoprecipitation, depending on the antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Protein-antibody-bead complexes were centrifuged in a wash buffer containing 0.2% Triton and then boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS protein loading dye. Immunofluorescence—Cells plated on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (BD Biosciences) were treated with 17-AAG and/or MG132 for 6 h, then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using Triton X-100 (0.2% in PBS; 10 min). After blocking with 3% goat serum in PBS, cells were incubated with anti-PDGFRα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a 30-min incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A rabbit isotype-specific IgG served as negative control. Nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 meta-confocal multiphoton microscope system under UV excitation at 488 nm (for Alexa Fluor 488) and 340 nm (for DAPI). Separation of Cytosolic and Membrane Cellular Fractions— After treatment, C272hTert/E7 were collected in a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2 mm PMSF. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to separate the membrane fraction. The final crude membrane pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm PMSF. Transfection—To overexpress the PDGFRα, COS cells in the logarithmic phase of growth were transfected with PDGFRα cloned into the pDualGC vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using Mirus LT1 (Mirus Biocorporation, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency is typically 50-60% in these cells, as determined by estimation of green fluorescent protein expression. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and the lysate was used for immunoprecipitation. siRNA Transfection—For transient transfection with siRNA we used Ty5 cells and HSP90 α- and β-targeted oligomers (41Shang L. Tomasi T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) synthesized by Invitrogen. Control was scrambled siRNA (Dharmacon). Cells were harvested 96 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency in these cells is typically 90%, as estimated by green fluorescent protein expression. Cell Proliferation—An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay colorimetric method based on measurement of BrdUrd incorporation into DNA (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) assessed cell proliferation. In brief, after any treatment, cells were incubated with BrdUrd (10 μm) for 3 h and then fixed and denatured. Cells were subsequently treated with a peroxidase labeled anti-BrdUrd antibody for 90 min, and the colorimetric reaction was developed with a tetramethylbenzidine-based substrate. The reaction product was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices) at an emission wavelength of 370 nm. All assays were performed in quadruplicate and were repeated twice in independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical Analysis—A two-tailed Student's t test compared results of cell proliferation assays. 17-AAG Promotes Degradation of the PDGFRα in Human Cancer Cells—We have previously demonstrated that the PDGFRα is over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells (30Matei D. Emerson R.E. Lai Y.C. Baldridge L.A. Rao J. Yiannoutsos C. Donner D.D. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 42Matei D. Graeber T.G. Baldwin R.L. Karlan B.Y. Rao J. Chang D.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6289-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To test whether HSP90 is necessary for processing and/or stabilization of the PDGFRα in such cells, we treated cancer cells with 17-AAG and measured by Western blot analysis expression levels of the PDGFRα during 24 h of drug exposure. Treatment with 17-AAG decreased PDGFRα levels in immortalized C272-hTert/E7 and in C848 primary ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether this effect was observed in various cancer cell types, the effect of 17-AAG on the receptor was tested in other transformed cells. The PDGFRα levels were reduced by 17-AAG treatment of U118 glioblastoma cancer cells, SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, and TY5 neuroendocrine lung cancer cells (Fig. 1, C-E). Diminished expression of the receptor was initiated within 1-6 h of treatment depending on the cell line investigated. Thereafter, low expression of the receptor was observed for up to 24 h, without noticeable cytotoxicity. Treatment of cells with 17-AAG also decreased levels of the PDGFRβ in transformed cell lines expressing the β receptor (C848, C272/hTert/E7 and U118). Ty5 and SHSY-5Y cells do not express detectable PDGFRβ. However, the effect of 17-AAG on the PDGFRβ was less pronounced and delayed compared with its effects on the PDGFRα in C272-hTert/E7 and C848 cells. In parallel with investigation of the effects of 17-AAG on receptor stability, its effects on Akt, a mediator of PDGFRα action (43Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar), were studied. Receptor activation by PDGF leads to recruitment of PI 3-kinase with subsequent phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate. PI-3,4,5-triphosphate is formed and binds the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt causing a conformational change that allows Akt activation (phosphorylation) (44Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that after treatment with 17-AAG, Ser473 phospho-Akt levels decreased rapidly in cancer cells, and this occurred in parallel with the loss of the PDGFRα (Fig. 1, A-E). Expression of total Akt also diminished after exposure of cancer cells to 17-AAG. The effect of 17-AAG on total Akt lagged behind (by several hours) the diminished expression of the activated (phosphorylated) protein. Dose-response experiments tested the sensitivity of cells to 17-AAG. Exposure to low doses of 17-AAG (10-100 nm) for 6 h induced loss of PDGFRα and -β expression in C272/hTert/E7 ovarian cancer and U118 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Expression of Ser473 phospho-Akt decreased in parallel with the receptor. Exposure of cells to a higher concentration of 17-AAG was required to induce loss of total rather than activated Akt. In contrast, PI 3-kinase (p85) levels were unaffected by 17-AAG. This suggests that the effects of 17-AAG are target-specific rather than a general effect on activated membrane proteins. Consistent with experiments utilizing 17-AAG, down-regulation of the HSP90 chaperone complex by siRNA also led to diminished expression of the PDGFRα. In Ty5 cancer cells, decreased receptor levels were noted when HSP90 α, HSP90 β, and HSP90 α+β were knocked down using siRNA, with maximal down-regulation of PDGFRα being observed when both HSP90 α and β were knocked down (Fig. 2C). PDGFRα Expression Is Not Affected by Exposure to 17-AAG in Untransformed Cells—To test whether the effects of 17-AAG are cancer cell-specific, we examined its effects on untransformed cells. As the normal counterparts of the cancer cell lines utilized here (specifically, human ovarian epithelial or lung epithelial cells) do not express the PDGFRα, we resorted to using HSMC, a human primary culture that expresses the PDGFRα. In HSMC, PDGFRα levels were not significantly affected by treatment with 17-AAG (1 μm) even after 24 h of culture (Fig. 3A). PDGFRβ was not detectable by Western blotting in these cells and therefore the effect of 17-AAG on it was not determined. Additionally, we examined the effects of 17-AAG on 3T3 fibroblasts. To determine whether 17-AAG affects differentially the PDGFRα in transformed and untransformed cells, we compared the effects of geldanamycin on the PDGFRα in wild type and ras-transformed 3T3 fibroblasts. In untransformed 3T3 cells, PDGFRα and -β levels were not affected by exposure to 17-AAG for up to 24 h. In contrast, the PDGFRα level was significantly decreased within 1 h of 17-AAG treatment in ras-transformed fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that 17-AAG disrupts more efficiently the chaperoning activity of HSP90 in transformed than in untransformed cells. PDGFRα Forms a Complex with HSP90 and CDC37 in Cancer Cells—The effects of 17-AAG on PDGFRα levels suggest that the receptor associates with the HSP90 complex. To test the association between PDGFRα and HSP90, we transfected wild type PDGFRα into COS cells. A cell lysate was prepared, and the PDGFRα was immunoprecipitated with a specific PDGFRα antibody. The Western blot was probed for PDGFRα and for HSP90. Fig. 4A demonstrates interaction between the overexpressed receptor and the chaperone protein, HSP90. We next tested for endogenous interaction between PDGFRα and HSP90 in U118 glioblastoma cells and in untransformed 3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitation with PDGFRα antibody brings down HSP90 in cancer cells but not in untransformed fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). For other protein kinases, it is known that a co-chaperone, p50 (cdc37), is present in the HSP90 complex (45Roe S.M. Ali M.M. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2004; 116: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 46Lavictoire S.J. Parolin D.A. Klimowicz A.C. Kelly J.F. Lorimer I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5292-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus trimers of HSP90, cdc37, and protein kinases exist in cells. To determine whether the PDGFRα associates with such a chaperone complex, we immunoprecipitated cdc37 from lysates of C272/hTert/E7, U118, and Ty5 cancer cells and tested the presence of PDGFRα and HSP90 in the complex by Western blot analysis. The observations in Fig. 4C illustrate that endogenous HSP90 and the PDGFRα co-immunoprecipitate with cdc37. 17-AAG Induces PDGFRα Degradation by the Proteasome— In other cell systems and in studies of other receptors, the effects of geldanamycin have been attributed to disruption of the chaperoning activity of HSP90 and subsequent targeting of oncoproteins by the proteasome (9Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39858-39866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We tested whether the decreased PDGFRα levels induced by 17-AAG are due to receptor degradation through ubiquitination, which targets the receptor for degradation. First, we tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on PDGFRα expression. We found that loss of PDGFRα expression induced in ovarian cancer cells by a 6-h incubation with 17-AAG was inhibited by pretreatment with MG132 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, treatment with MG132 prevented the degradation of activated Akt induced by 17-AAG, indicating that disruption of the chaperoning activity of HSP90 by 17-AAG, leads to degradation of its clients through the proteasome. Akt was not affected by exposure to 17AAG for 6 h in these cells; consequently MG132 was without effect on the non-activated kinase. To exclude other potential mechanisms, we pretreated C272hTert/E7 cells with inhibitors of protein degradation or trafficking prior to geldanamycin treatment. Inhibition of lysosomal proteases (leupeptin) or of calpain (PD150606) did not prevent 17-AAG induced PDGFRα degradation, whereas MG132 rescued PDGFRα from the effects of 17AAG (Fig. 5B). Likewise, treatment with monensin, which inhibits intracellular protein trafficking, did not influence the effects of 17-AAG. Interestingly, chloroquine, an inhibitor of receptor recycling, had partial protective effects on the PDGFRα, suggesting that trapping of the receptor in endosomes may prevent its targeting to the proteasome. To test whether PDGFRα degradation was initiated by ubiquitination, C272/hTert/E7 cells were treated with 17-AAG in the presence or absence of MG132. The combination of MG132 and 17-AAG led to accumulation of high molecular forms of PDGFRα (Fig. 5C, top). By probing a Western blot with an antibody to ubiquitin, we demonstrated that ubiquinated forms"

Ironically, c-MYC is also capable of inducing massive apoptosis under certain conditions. A clear understanding of the distinct pathways activated by c-MYC during apoptosis induction and transformation is crucial to the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at selectively reactivating the apoptotic potential of c-MYC in cancer cells. We recently demonstrated that apoptosis induction in primary human cells strictly requires that c-MYC bind and inactivate the transcription factor MIZ-1. This presumably blocked the ability of MIZ-1 to activate the transcription of an unidentified pro-survival gene. Here we report that MIZ-1 activates the transcription of BCL2. More importantly, inhibition of the MIZ-1/BCL2 signal is an essential event during the apoptotic response. Furthermore, targeting BCL2 with short hairpin RNA or small molecule inhibitors restores the apoptotic potential of a c-MYC mutant that is defective for MIZ-1 inhibition. These observations suggest that repression of BCL2 transcription is the single essential consequence of targeting the MIZ-1 pathway during apoptosis induction. These data define a genetic pathway that helps to explain historical observations documenting cooperation between c-MYC and BCL2 overexpression in human cancer.

Functioning as a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, c-MYC can either activate or repress the expression of specific target genes associated with various biological functions (9Guo Q.M.

Via this transcriptional regulatory activity, c-MYC contributes to diverse aspects of cancer biology, including cell cycle progression (7Palmieri S. Kahn P. Graf T.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis by c-MYC is thought to provide a safeguard against cancer by eliminating cells that accumulate high levels of this oncoprotein. Oncoproteins such as E1A (17Rao L. Debbas M.

For tumorigenesis to occur, transformed cells must disable the apoptosis pathway normally activated by oncoproteins like c-MYC. The BCL2 family of proteins represents key regulators of apoptosis (21Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 22Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). This family includes both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members, and the balance of these two types of proteins within the cell determines whether apoptosis will occur. The pro-survival BCL2 family members BCL2, BCLxL, and MCL1 block apoptosis by binding and inactivating pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members (21Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev.

Although the mechanism by which the distinct pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members trigger cell death is not completely understood, stress-induced oligomerization of BAX and BAK does result in permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (21Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). This permeabilization liberates factors, including SMAC, HTRA2, apoptosis-inducing factor, and cytochrome c, that ultimately trigger cellular destruction via caspase activation (27Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 28Suzuki Y. Imai Y. Nakayama H. Takahashi K. Takio K. Takahashi R. Mol.

Apoptosis induction depends on the ability of c-MYC to regulate multiple factors involved in cell death. For example, by activation of the tumor suppressor p19 ARF, c-MYC promotes p53 stabilization (30Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Studies from Eμ-Myc transgenic mice suggest that inactivation of this pathway is the primary mechanism by which the apoptotic potential of c-MYC is debilitated during tumorigenesis. c-MYC can also induce apoptosis independent of p53 stabilization in fibroblasts, primary myeloid cells, and pre-B cells (31Eischen C.M. Woo D. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). An additional mechanism by which c-MYC promotes apoptosis independent of p53 is via increasing steady-state levels of the pro-apoptosis BIM protein (25Egle A. Harris A.W. Bouillet P. Cory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6164-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcription of both the BCL2 and BCLxL pro-survival factors is repressed by c-MYC, thus promoting apoptosis (31Eischen C.M. Woo D. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6008-6018Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we recently demonstrated that transcriptional repression by c-MYC contributes to apoptosis induction in human cells (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3283-3289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we showed that this repression is mediated by the ability of c-MYC to bind and inactivate the transcription factor MIZ-1 (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3283-3289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Remarkably, inhibition of MIZ-1 is specifically required during c-MYC-induced apoptosis but not c-MYC-induced transformation or cell cycle progression (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3283-3289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data led to the hypothesis that inactivation of MIZ-1 by c-MYC is critical during apoptosis induction because MIZ-1 normally activates the transcription of an unknown, pro-survival gene. Establishing the identity of this pro-survival gene should provide a critical advance in our understanding of this previously unknown pathway. A large number of findings from both human tumors and mouse models have established that expression of the pro-survival BCL2 protein cooperates with c-MYC during tumorigenesis (22Adams J.M.

Nature. 1990; 348: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Here we link these two previously unrelated sets of observations by demonstrating that MIZ-1 normally activates the transcription of the BCL2 gene, and BCL2 activation blocks c-MYC-induced apoptosis. In contrast to BCL2, the repression of previously described targets of MIZ-1 (p15INK4B, p21CIP1, NRAMP1, and MAD4) does not contribute to c-MYC-mediated apoptosis. More importantly, using a combination of shRNA 3The abbreviations used are: shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type; HDF, human diploid fibroblast; CKI, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. and a BCL2 small molecule inhibitor, we show that repression of BCL2 transcription by c-MYC is the essential event that is accomplished by targeting the MIZ-1 pathway. These data establish a novel pathway linking c-MYC, MIZ-1, BCL2, and ultimately apoptosis. Plasmids—The pMSCV c-MYC (puro), pMSCV c-MYC V394D (puro), and pUHD10.1 MIZ-1 plasmids have been described previously (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). MIZ-1, BCL2, c-MYC, green fluorescent protein, and nonspecific control shRNA lentivirus-based expression plasmids were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Early passage fibroblasts (2091 and IMR90) and epithelial cells (293T) were obtained from the ATCC and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals), 2 μm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I-reduced serum media (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. ABT-737 was diluted in Me2SO to a working concentration of 5 mm. Following further dilution in culture media, cells were treated at a concentration of 7.5 μm ABT-737. Retroviral and Lentiviral Infections—Retrovirus was produced by cotransfection of retroviral vectors and SVψ-A-MLV helper plasmid (43Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the 293T packaging cell line. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested, and three sequential viral infections were performed on target cells 24–48 h post-transfection in the presence of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide. Lentivirus was packaged in 293T cells transfected with the indicated pLKO.1-puro shRNA plasmid (Sigma) in addition to the pVSV-G and pCMVdelta8.2 helper plasmids (44Budanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Electroporation—The IMR90 cell strain was electroporated with a total of 1.5 μg of DNA according to manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa Nucleofection). Apoptosis Assays—Subsequent to retrovirus and lentivirus transduction, primary HDFs were seeded at 1.2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. The following day, cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (Pharmingen). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared in a Nonidet P-40-based buffer (45McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and Western blots were performed as described previously (45McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The BIM (StressGen), c-MYC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-tubulin (Sigma), and BCL2 (Pharmingen) antibodies used for Western blotting were obtained from commercial sources. Endogenous MIZ-1 was detected by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blot using two MIZ-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and M. Eilers, respectively). Immunoblots were quantified using Kodak one-dimensional 3.5.3 imaging software. Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was produced with SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The 7000 sequence detection system (ABI Prism) and SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) amplified ∼50-bp products during quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to a nonspecific control. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Primary HDFs engineered to overexpress c-MYC undergo apoptosis upon serum deprivation (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol.

Using a mutant c-MYC protein incapable of interaction with MIZ-1 (c-MYC V394D), we recently suggested that the c-MYC-MIZ-1 interaction is necessary for c-MYC to promote apoptosis in HDFs (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3283-3289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the c-MYC V394D mutant has been widely used, there has not been conclusive evidence that it is exclusively defective for binding to MIZ-1 (47Brenner C. Deplus R. Didelot C. Loriot A. Vire E.

As with any point mutation, it has remained possible that the mutation interferes with other functions of c-MYC. For example, valine 394 is located within the helix-loop-helix domain, an area necessary for interaction with the transcription factor MAX, the ubiquitin ligase SKP2, and the histone acetyltransferase p300 (55Vervoorts J.

To fully validate the c-MYC/MIZ-1/apoptosis pathway, it was necessary to conclusively establish whether the V394D mutation selectively blocks MIZ-1 binding. For this purpose, we reasoned that if c-MYC V394D is defective in initiating apoptosis because the mutation selectively interferes with MIZ-1 interaction, then loss of MIZ-1 should rescue the ability of c-MYC V394D to promote cell death. To examine whether loss of MIZ-1 can rescue the apoptotic potential of the c-MYC V394D mutant, we introduced an shRNA construct targeting MIZ-1 into primary HDFs. These cells were previously engineered to express either c-MYC WT or c-MYC V394D (Fig. 1A). Following 24 h of serum deprivation, cells were harvested to document MIZ-1 depletion (Fig. 1B) and quantitate apoptosis induction (Fig. 1C). The shRNA treatment resulted in MIZ-1 mRNA reduction by 60%. Consistent with our previous studies, c-MYC WT induced apoptosis in the presence of the control shRNA, and c-MYC V394D was defective in initiating cell death. The loss of MIZ-1 expression completely rescued the apoptotic defect attributed to c-MYC V394D, providing genetic evidence that this mutant is defective in promoting apoptosis solely because it blocks the interaction between c-MYC and MIZ-1. Expression of a second MIZ-1 shRNA construct yielded identical results, suggesting these data are not because of off-target effects (data not shown). Having validated a role for MIZ-1 in the inhibition of c-MYC-mediated apoptosis, studies were initiated to define the genetic pathway linking MIZ-1 to cell death. Depending on the cellular context, c-MYC overexpression induces apoptosis through either a p53-dependent or p53-independent mechanism (59Nilsson J.A. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9007-9021Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the p53-dependent pathway, c-MYC overexpression activates p19 ARF, thereby promoting MDM2 inhibition and subsequent p53 stabilization (30Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether the requirement for MIZ-1 inactivation during apoptosis induction was because of a link between the MIZ-1 pathway and p53 stabilization. For this purpose, p53 steady-state protein levels and transcription of p53-induced pro-apoptosis target genes were analyzed in serum-withdrawn HDFs expressing either c-MYC WT or c-MYC V394D (Fig. 2A). Two fibroblast strains derived from lung (IMR90) and foreskin (2091) were analyzed to address strain-specific effects. Expression of both c-MYC WT and c-MYC V394D induced p53 stabilization (Fig. 2A). In addition, similar induction of the p53 pro-apoptotic target genes BAX, NOXA, and PUMA was observed (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, depletion of p53 failed to inhibit c-MYC-mediated apoptosis in HDFs (data not shown). These findings eliminate the possibility that c-MYC WT and c-MYC V394D differ in apoptotic potential because of distinct capacities for p53 induction. The previously established antagonism between MIZ-1 and c-MYC suggests the proteins regulate apoptosis through controlling expression of a target gene subset that contributes to cell death. Although c-MYC WT is expected to repress the effector gene(s), c-MYC V394D should be defective in transcriptional repression, correlating with the loss of apoptotic induction. Although c-MYC can repress transcription of a large set of genes, only p21CIP1, p15INK4B, NRAMP1, and MAD4 have been empirically identified as also regulated by MIZ-1. Additionally, the CKI p21 CIP1 has been reported to inhibit both p53-independent and p53-dependent apoptosis (60Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar). In serum-withdrawn HDFs, the four previously established targets of c-MYC and MIZ-1 were not differentially regulated by c-MYC WT and c-MYC V394D, suggesting MIZ-1 does not regulate apoptosis through transactivation of these genes (Fig. 2A and 3). Both p21CIP1 and p15INK4B were induced in response to c-MYC WT expression. Because these CKIs are also p53 transcriptional targets (36Patel J.H. McMahon S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3283-3289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 61el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat.

Bric A. Teruya-Feldstein J. Herbst A. Nilsson J.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Cleveland J.L. Tansey W.P. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2005; 436: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis has identified several hundred genes whose transcription is activated by MIZ-1 (64Wanzel M. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Herold S. Hock A. Berns K. Park J. Hemmings B. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 65Ziegelbauer J. Wei J. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of the functional information known regarding these MIZ-1 targets revealed four pro-survival genes: BCLxL, BCL2, MCL1, and the apoptosis inhibitor immediate early response 3 (IER3). As mentioned above, both BCLxL and BCL2 have been reported previously as repressed by c-MYC (31Eischen C.M. Woo D. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7256-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these four targets were responsible for the differential apoptotic potential between c-MYC WT and V394D, mRNA induction of each target was analyzed in serum-deprived HDFs expressing wild-type or mutated c-MYC (Fig. 2A and Fig. 4, A and B). This analysis revealed that BCLxL, MCL1, and IER3 were regulated identically between c-MYC WT and c-MYC V394D. Like these targets, the pro-apoptotic BIM protein was not differentially regulated by c-MYC WT and c-MYC V394D in HDFs (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast to all other BCL2 family members examined, BCL2 itself was selectively repressed by c-MYC WT (Fig. 4, A and B). Among the MIZ-1 targets examined, BCL2 was the only pro-survival gene to be repressed by c-MYC WT and not repressed by c-MYC V394D. To confirm that c-MYC V394D was not generally defective in transcriptional repression, endogenous c-MYC transcription was examined (Fig. 4, C and D). As a mechanism of autoregulation, c-MYC binds to its own promoter to repress transcription (66Cleveland J.L. Huleihel M. Bressler P. Siebenlist U. Akiyama L. Eisenman R.N. Rapp U.R.

The V394D mutant repressed endogenous c-MYC transcription, confirming BCL2 repression by c-MYC specifically requires MIZ-1 inactivation. As the initial observation linking MIZ-1 to BCL2 transcription was made by microarray, empirical verification of these data was warranted. To assess the ability of MIZ-1 to regulate BCL2 expression, exogenous MIZ-1 was expressed in increasing concentrations, and steady-state levels of BCL2 were examined."

Kinetic studies were undertaken to better understand the effect of these mutations on the enzyme mechanism of GK activation and GKRP regulation and to relate the enzyme properties to the associated clinical phenotype of hypoglycemia. Similar to wild type GK, the transient kinetics of glucose binding for activating mutations follows a general two-step mechanism, the formation of an enzyme-glucose complex followed by an enzyme conformational change. However, the kinetics for each step differed from wild type GK and could be grouped into specific types of kinetic changes. Mutations T65I, Y214C, and A456V accelerate glucose binding to the apoenzyme form, whereas W99R, Y214C, and V455M facilitate enzyme isomerization to the active form. Mutations that significantly enhance the glucose binding to the apoenzyme also disrupt the protein-protein interaction with GKRP to a large extent, suggesting these mutations may adopt a more compact conformation in the apoenzyme favorable for glucose binding. Y214C is the most active mutation (11-fold increase in kcat/K0.5h) and exhibits the most severe clinical effects of hypoglycemia. In contrast, moderate activating mutation A456V nearly abolishes the GKRP inhibition (76-fold increase in Ki) but causes only mild hypoglycemia. This suggests that the alteration in GK enzyme activity may have a more profound biological impact than the alleviation of GKRP inhibition.

Curr. Diab. Rep. 2005; 5: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It serves as a glucose sensor due to its specific kinetic properties that include low affinity and positive cooperativity for glucose and a lack of inhibition by its product glucose-6-phosphate (4Niemeyer H. de la Luz Cardenas M.

In pancreatic β-cells, GK regulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion by modulation of the glycolytic pathway and subsequently the ATP/ADP ratio. In the liver, GK stimulates glucose disposal by converting glucose to glycogen for storage. Hepatic GK is tightly regulated by the 68-kDa glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) through the formation of a GKRP-GK complex followed by sequestration in the nucleus (7van Schaftingen E. Vandercammen A. Detheux M. Davies D.R. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the interaction between GK and GKRP is promoted by fructose-6-phosphate and suppressed by fructose-1-phosphate. Upon increasing glucose concentrations, GK dissociates from GKRP and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm resulting in an increase in GK activity. Alteration in GK activity and its regulation is associated with abnormal glycemia as evidenced in naturally occurring mutations. More than 190 inactivating GK mutations have been identified in patients with MODY2 (maturity onset diabetes of the young 2). In contrast, five activating GK mutations (T65I, W99R, Y214C, V455M, and A456V) lead to hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (8Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C. Cuesta-Munoz A. Hansen T.

The degree of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the affected patients is variable. The mutation Y214C causes severe and possibly fatal hypoglycemia, whereas other mutations are associated with mild hypoglycemia and are in some cases asymptomatic. Interestingly, all of these activating mutations cluster in an allosteric site of GK where small molecule activators bind, suggesting a critical role of the allosteric site in the regulation of GK activity. Both GK activators and activating mutations increase enzyme activity by enhancing the affinity for glucose as described by a decrease in K0.5 (8Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C.

The potential efficacy of GK activators in humans has drawn great interest as a promising therapeutic treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Because the in vitro effects of small molecule GK activators are similar to the activating mutations in GK, a better understanding of the biochemical basis for the activation of GK activity by these mutations may provide insight for the design of GK activators as effective therapeutics. Protein structural analyses have shown that substantial conformational changes in GK occur during glucose binding (15Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Recently, we investigated the GK structural changes induced by glucose binding through transient kinetic studies and demonstrated that the slow enzyme conformational change contributed to the positive cooperativity and the low binding affinity for glucose (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also showed that the most clinically severe, activating GK mutation Y214C facilitated the slow enzyme conformational changes to the active form by a factor of 7.5-fold. However, it is unknown whether all of the activating mutations at the allosteric site follow the same activation mechanism, how the mutations affect GKRP inhibitory regulation, and how the variation in their biochemical properties relate to the clinical phenotype. In this paper, we have extended our studies to include published naturally activating mutations. In addition, two engineered activating mutants, Y214A and Y215A, at the allosteric site were included in the studies to further investigate the structure-function relationship of the allosteric site involved in the protein conformational change. The GK activation and GKRP binding for the GK-activating mutations were characterized in vitro. We show that the structural perturbation at the allosteric site by single point mutations alters the kinetic basis of enzyme activation as well as the protein-protein interactions with GKRP. Materials—Glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, dithiothreitol (DTT), and ATP were obtained from Sigma. All reagents were ACS grade or better. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The cloning, expression, and purification of β-cell GK and Y214C were described previously (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Nishi S. Stoffel M. Xiang K. Shows T.B. Bell G.I. Takeda J. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 743-747PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used to generate the rest of the GK allosteric site mutations are listed as follows, wherein the sites of the mutation are italicized and underlined: T65I forward (5′-CCACCTACGTGCGCTCCATCCCAGAAGGCTCAGAAGTCGG-3′), reverse (5′-CCGACTTCTGAGCCTTCTGGGATGGAGCGCACGTAGGTGG-3′); W99R forward (5′-GGTGAGGAGGGGCAGCGGAGCGTGAAGACCAAACACC-3′), reverse (5′-GGTGTTTGGTCTTCACGCTCCGCTGCCCCTCCTCACC-3′); V455M forward (5′-GCCCTGGTCTCGGCGATGGCCTGTAAGAAGGCC-3′), reverse (5′-GGCCTTCTTACAGGCCATCGCCGAGACCAGGGC-3′); A456V forward (5′-GCCCTGGTCTCGGCGGTGGTCTGTAAGAAGGCC-3′), reverse (5′-GGCCTTCTTACAGACCACCGCCGAGACCAGGGC-3′); Y214A forward (5′-ACGATGATCTCCTGCGCCTACGAAGACCATCAG-3′), reverse (5′-CTGATGGTCTTCGTAGGCGCAGGAGATCATCGT-3′); Y215A forward (5′-ATGATCTCCTGCTACGCCGAAGACCATCAGTGC-3′), reverse (5′-GCACTGATGGTCTTCGGCGTAGCAGGAGATCAT-3′). The recombinant GK WT and mutations with a hexa-His tag at the N terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the protocol described previously. A complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to each step of the purification for the A456V mutation to reduce the proteolysis of the protein. Purity of the enzyme was verified to be >95% by SDS-PAGE and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of His-tagged GK was confirmed to be 55 kDa by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Enzyme concentration was determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Aliquots of WT and mutated GK were stored at -80 °C in a pH 7.5 buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. The cloning of GKRP has been described previously (19Mookhtiar K.A. Kalinowski S.S. Brown K.S. Tsay Y.H. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G.W. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GKRP with a C-terminal FLAG tag was expressed in E. coli DH10B cells using a pFLAG-CTC expression vector. Expression was confirmed by Western analysis using an anti-GKRP monoclonal antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bacterial cells were grown in a 10-liter fermentation with Terric Broth medium initially at 37 °C, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and inducted with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside upon reaching an A600 of 0.6. After overnight expression at 23 °C, cells were harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were subsequently lysed by microfluidization on ice. Purification was achieved by batch absorption using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody Mab2 affinity gel (Sigma). Resin was then loaded onto a chromatography column where FLAG-tagged GKRP was eluted from the resin by competition using 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Pooled fractions were then loaded onto a size exclusion column where the peak at 72 kDa was collected. Purity of the enzyme was verified to be >95% by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). GKRP was stored in aliquots at -80 °C in a pH 7.4 buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT. Steady-state Kinetics of GK-activating Mutations—Steadystate kinetic parameters of GK WT and activating mutations were determined as described previously using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed with 0-50 mm glucose at a saturating concentration of 5 mm ATP in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NADH, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 1 unit/ml of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase at 25 °C. The saturating concentration of MgCl2 was used in the assay to ensure the majority of ATP (>98%) was present as MgATP. Control experiments were carried out to demonstrate the coupling enzymes were in excess and the initial rate was linearly dependent on GK concentrations. To determine whether activating mutations affect Km for ATP, initial rates were measured by varying ATP (0-5 mm) at a saturating concentration of 50 mm glucose at 25 °C using pH 8.0 buffer. The kinetic parameters for substrate analog 2-deoxyglucose were determined at 25 °C using pH 8.0 buffer by varying 2-deoxyglucose concentrations from 0-400 mm at 5 mm ATP. The steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rates to the Hill equation (Equation 1) for sugar substrates due to the sigmoidal kinetics and to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2) for ATP with hyperbolic kinetics using nonlinear regression analysis (Prism, Graph Pad Inc.) as follows, v=Vmax×[S]hK0.5h+[S]h(Eq. 1) where Vmax is the maximal activity of GK, S is the sugar concentration, K0.5 is the sugar concentration at half-maximal activity, h is the Hill number, and v is the activity at a given sugar concentration S. Glucose Binding to GK WT and Activating Mutations—Binding of glucose to the GK enzymes caused a change in the intrinsic enzyme fluorescence that was monitored with excitation at 290 nm. The equilibrium binding affinity of glucose was determined as described previously (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, glucose binding to GK WT and the mutations was monitored at 330 nm by fluorescence spectrometry. The KD values were determined by fitting data to a binding isotherm using non-linear regression analysis. Fluorescence=Fluorescencemax×[S]KD+[S](Eq. 2) The transient kinetics study of glucose binding to GK using a stopped flow spectrophotometer has been described in detail elsewhere (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Final enzyme concentrations of 5, 10, or 20 μm were utilized for these measurements. Briefly, presteady state kinetics were monitored using a 320-nm cutoff filter upon excitation at 290 nm by the rapid mixing of glucose and enzyme in separate syringes. The time traces were fit to the double exponential equation Y=A1e(-kobs1×t)+A2e(-kobs2×t)+C(Eq. 3) to obtain the rate constants (kobs1 and kobs2), the amplitudes (A1 and A2), and the fitting variable C. Inhibition of GK WT and the Activating Mutations by GKRP—GKRP binds to GK and inhibits the enzyme activity in a competitive manner with respect to glucose (20Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses were performed to determine the inhibition constant of GKRP with GK WT and the mutations by varying the glucose concentrations as described below and GKRP concentrations (0-500 nm). The range of glucose concentrations was adjusted to reflect the differences in glucose affinity of the mutations (0-50 mm for GK WT, W99R, V455M, and Y214A and 0-10 mm for T65I, Y214C, A456V, and Y215A). GK and GKRP were mixed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, various concentrations of glucose, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm NADH, 2 mm DTT, 1 unit/ml pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 25 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm sorbitol-6-phosphate at 25 °C. Sorbitol-6-phosphate was used in the assay, because it is a more potent analog than fructose-6-phosphate in promoting the association of GKRP with GK. The assay mix was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min before the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 mm ATP. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate with a final volume of 100 μl. The apparent inhibition constant of GKRP, Kiapp, at a given glucose concentration was determined by fitting initial rates to the Morrison equation (21Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) vivo=1-([Et]+[I]+Kiapp)-([Et]+[I]+Kiapp)2-4[Et][I]2[Et](Eq. 4) and Kiapp=Ki1+[S]Km(Eq. 5) where vi/vo is the fractional velocity of GK activity in the presence of GKRP relative to that in the absence of GKRP, Et is the total enzyme concentration, and I is the GKRP concentration. The inhibition constant Ki was determined by plotting Kiapp against varying sugar substrate concentrations S. The experiments were performed in triplicates. The Ki values of GKRP were also determined using the noncooperative substrate analog 2-deoxyglucose (0-300 mm). Kinetic analyses were performed as outlined above. Steady-state Kinetics of GK-activating Mutations—The central clinical feature of glucose levels in the range of 1-3 mm compared with the normal 4-5.4 mm (8Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S.

To correlate the effects of activating mutations to the clinical consequence, steady-state kinetic properties of the recombinant activating mutations were characterized and compared with GK WT (Table 1). All of the activating mutations lowered the K0.5 for glucose and reduced the positive cooperativity of glucose as described by a decrease in the Hill number (h). As a result, the catalytic efficiency with regards to glucose, kcat/K0.5h, is enhanced for the activating mutations. The Km values for ATP changed by 0.7-2.5-fold for the mutations.TABLE 1Steady state kinetic parameters of GK WT and activating mutations at 25 °C, pH 8.0EnzymekcathK0.5, gluckcat/K0.5hKm, ATPs—1mms—1 mm—1mmWT33 ± 11.7 ± 0.17.1 ± 0.31.1 ± 0.10.12 ± 0.02T65I8.4 ± 0.40.9 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.30.21 ± 0.02W99R17 ± 11.4 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.01Y214C28 ± 11.2 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.112 ± 10.33 ± 0.01V455M18 ± 11.3 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.14.1 ± 0.10.18 ± 0.01A456V8.1 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.13.9 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.01Y214A37 ± 11.2 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.117 ± 10.24 ± 0.01Y215A19 ± 11.4 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.10.14 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab The kcat values for some of the mutations determined here were 2-3-fold lower than the reported results in earlier studies (8Christesen H.B.

The underlying cause of the discrepancy is unknown but may be attributable to the experimental conditions, such as temperature and pH, or the GK construct, because we used a hexahistidine tag, whereas previous reports utilized a glutathione S-transferase tag (8Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C. Cuesta-Munoz A. Hansen T. Brusgaard K. Massa O. Magnuson M.A. Shiota C. Matschinsky F.M. Barbetti F.

Because of the large size of the glutathione S-transferase tag (26 kDa), we chose a His6 tag to minimize the potential disturbance of the native conformation of GK proteins. Identical kinetic properties were observed between the non-tagged and hexa-His-tagged GK enzymes (data not shown). Effects of GK-activating Mutations on Glucose Binding—Previous transient kinetic studies of glucose binding by stopped flow spectrophotometry demonstrated that glucose binding to GK WT followed biphasic kinetics that fit best to a two-step reversible mechanism (16Heredia V.V. Thomson J. Nettleton D. Sun S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7553-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The first kinetic phase was interpreted as a bimolecular event where glucose loosely binds to the apoenzyme form E*, followed by a second kinetic phase of enzyme conformational change from E*·S to E·S. The kinetic scheme was reported as follows. E*+Sk1⇄k-1E*·Sk2⇄k-2E·SSCHEME 1 All of the activating mutations retained the two-step mechanism of glucose binding but altered the individual microscopic rate constants (Table 2). Some mutations enhanced the first step of E*·glucose formation, as evidenced by either increasing k1 (observed in T65I and A456V) or decreasing k-1 (observed in Y215A). Some mutations favor E*·glucose to E·glucose transformation by increasing k2 (observed in W99R, Y214A, and V455M) or decreasing k-2 (observed in Y214C). The ratio of k1/k-1 and k2/k-2 represent the association constant of glucose binding to the apoenzyme E* and the degree of conversion of E*·S to E·S, respectively. The overall equilibrium binding affinity of glucose can be calculated based on the individual microscopic rate constants of the two-step glucose binding using the following equation (22Lin S.X. Neet K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9670-9675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KD=k-1k1×k-2(k2+k-2)(Eq. 6) The results showed a good agreement with the experimentally determined KD (Table 2). Based on the measured KD, T65I and A456V increased glucose binding the most (>10-fold), whereas W99R and V455M only increased the binding moderately (2-3-fold).TABLE 2The microscopic rate constants of transient kinetics and the equilibrium constants of glucose binding for GK WT and activating mutations The microscopic rate constants were determined from kobs1 and kobs2 as described previously (16Heredia V.V.

At various glucose concentrations, the GK WT and mutations showed a glucose-dependent linear increase in IC50 value of GKRP, indicative of competitive inhibition of GKRP with respect to glucose (see supplemental data). It has been shown that GKRP is a competitive inhibitor for GK WT (20Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To quantify the effects of the mutations on the protein-protein interaction with GKRP, the inhibition constant (Ki) of GKRP was determined for each mutation as shown in Table 3. W99R and Y214A retained similar binding interactions with GKRP compared with WT, whereas T65I, Y215A and A456V nearly abolished the GKRP interaction.TABLE 3GKRP inhibition constant Ki for GK WT and activating mutations using glucose or 2-deoxyglucose as the substrateEnzymeKi GKRP (glucose substrate)Ki GKRP (2-deoxyglucose substrate)nmnmWT27 ± 418 ± 2T65I1090 ± 1302050 ± 380W99R59 ± 635 ± 4Y214C160 ± 20125 ± 13V455M77 ± 8115 ± 10A456V2050 ± 4503650 ± 1200Y214A19 ± 310 ± 2Y215A>5000>5000 Open table in a new tab Because the GK WT and some of the mutations displayed sigmoidal kinetics for glucose that may complicate the inhibition data interpretation, the substrate analog 2-deoxyglucose was also utilized in the determination of Ki for GKRP, because it exhibits little or no cooperativity for GK WT and the activating mutations.

Here we report the crystal structure of human spindlin1 to 2.2Å of resolution, representing the first three-dimensional structure from the spin/ssty (Y-linked spermiogenesis-specific transcript) gene family. The refined structure, containing three repeats of five/four anti-parallel β-strands, exhibits a novel arrangement of tandem Tudor-like domains. Two phosphate ions, chelated by Thr-95 and other residues, appear to stabilize the long loop between domains I and II, which might mediate the cell cycle regulation activity of spindlin1. Flow cytometry experiments indicate that cells expressing spindlin1 display a different cell cycle distribution in mitosis, whereas those expressing a T95A mutant, which had a great decrease in phosphorous content, have little effect on the cell cycle. We further identified associations of spindlin1 with nucleic acid to provide a biochemical basis for its cell cycle regulation and other functions.

These two genes share more than 50% identity in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1), and together they form a new spin/ssty gene family. Homologues of spin/ssty family genes are found in Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, and Oryzias latipes but not in Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that this gene family is restricted to vertebrates (8Staub E. Mennerich D. Rosenthal A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0003)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis suggests that the spin/ssty family proteins are composed of three repeats of a new protein motif ∼50 amino acids in length (8Staub E. Mennerich D. Rosenthal A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0003)PubMed Google Scholar). Spindlin1, a human homolog of spindlin, has been shown to be related to ovarian cancer (9Yue W. Sun L.Y. Li C.H. Zhang L.X. Pei X.T. Ai Zheng. 2004; 23: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). Its expression is up-regulated in ovarian cancer cells but not in normal tissues and was found to localize in cell nuclei. The transfected cells, which are prone to grow as cancer cells in nude mice, showed a complete morphological change (10Gao Y. Yue W. Zhang P. Li L. Xie X. Yuan H. Chen L. Liu D. Yan F. Pei X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Overexpression of spindlin1 might lead to variations in cell cycle distribution during mitosis, which is consistent with previous reports for other spindlin1 homologs (11Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although previous studies indicate that members of the spin/ssty protein family play important roles in tumorigenesis and early embryogenesis, their biochemical functions and mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of human spindlin1 at 2.2 Å of resolution, which represents the first crystal structure from the vertebrate spin/ssty gene family. The structure consists of three tandem repeats of Tudor-like domains, which represent a novel tandem repeat fold. We identify Thr-95 as important for the function of spindlin1, which is a key residue for the coordination of two phosphate ions. In addition, our preliminary biochemical data also indicate that spindlin1 associates with nucleic acid. These data provide a structural basis for further biochemical analysis of spindlin1 and the spin/ssty gene family. Protein Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Mutagenesis—The protocols for purification and crystallization of human spindlin1 have been described previously (12Jiang F. Zhao Q. Qin L. Pang H. Pei X. Rao Z. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The T95A mutant was generated using GCA to replace original codon by PCR and purified similar to the wild type protein. Both wild type spindlin1 and the T95A mutant were constructed into pCDNA3.1 myc/his(-) for cell cycle analysis. Heavy Atom Derivatization—Crystals of spindlin1 were transferred into a solution containing 35% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a stepwise manner. The mercury derivative was obtained by soaking spindlin1 crystals in this buffer supplemented with 1 mm ethyl mercuric phosphate ((C2H5HgO)HPO2) for 3 days. Data Collection and Processing—Crystals of spindlin1 belong to the space group P212121, with unit cell parameters a = 40.8 Å, b = 84.9 Å, c = 136.6 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The crystals contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. Native data up to 2.2 Å were collected from a flash-cryocooled crystal with 25% (v/v) glycerol used as a cryoprotectant. The single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku RU2000 rotating CuKα anode source to 2.3 Å using a single mercury-spindlin1 crystal. Data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar), and the unit cell dimensions were determined to be a = 40.3 Å, b = 76.2 Å, c = 136.6 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. Structure Determination and Refinement—Phases for the mercury-spindlin1 crystal were initially determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using CNS (14Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The phasing power was calculated as 2.4, and three heavy atom sites were independently located by the heavy atom search routine, yielding an overall figure of merit of 0.41 after calculation of initial single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phases at 3.0 Å. The resolution was extended to 2.3 Å using CNS. After solvent flipping, the quality of the initial electron density maps was greatly improved. Initial manual model building and fitting were carried out using 2.2 Å-resolution native data in O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Positional refinement, B-factor refinement, and water molecules were added using CNS.

Open table in a new tab Cell Cycle Analysis—The cell cycle phase distribution of HeLa cells was examined by flow cytometry using FACScan and Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). 1 × 106 cells were cotransfected with pBB14 (green fluorescent protein) and pCDNA3.1 myc/his(-) vector, spindlin1 wild type, or spindlin1 point mutants. After incubation in full media for 20 h, HeLa cells were harvested and prefixed using 0.5% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline/ethanol for 1 h. The cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min after RNase digestion and analyzed. Gel Shift Assays—For DNA binding assays, purified samples of about 30 bp of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 4The abbreviation used is: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. probe, 30 bp of DNA primer, and a constructed spindlin1 vector of ∼2.5 kilobases were employed. Binding reactions were conducted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton-100 to final sample volumes of 10 μl. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 1 μl of loading buffer containing 0.05% bromphenol blue was added to the reaction mixtures. 1% agarose gels were run at room temperature at a constant voltage of 12 V·cm-1 in 1× Tris borate EDTA and afterward stained with ethidium bromide. Overall Structure of Spindlin1 Folds into Three Similar Domains—The crystal structure of recombinant spindlin1 was determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction from a single crystal soaked with mercury. The initial model was built into an electron density map calculated to 2.3 Å resolution, and data from a native crystal allowed model refinement to 2.2 Å. The two spindlin1 molecules in one asymmetric unit were traced in two (residues 25-170 and 181-235 in molecule A) (Fig. 2a) and four (residues 27-91, 104-115, 125-168, and 184-234 in molecule B) fragments totaling 237 residues, respectively. No electron density was evident for the other residues. Spindlin1, with dimensions of ∼40 × 40 × 35 Å, exhibits an all-β structure that consists of 14 β-strands and two short α-helices. The structure is folded into three structural domains that are composed mainly of β-barrel-like structures. The three domains, which correspond to residues 25-90, 101-168, and 191-234, consist of β1-β5, β6-β10, and β11-β14, respectively. The α-helices are located in domain II, ahead of its first and fifth β-strands respectively (Fig. 2, a and b). As shown in Fig. 2c, domain I, II, and III adopt a similar 5 (4Frank-Vaillant M. Haccard O. Ozon R. Jessus C. Dev. Biol. 2001; 231: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) β-strand fold, and the main chain of their strands can be superimposed with root mean square deviations of 0.8 Å (from domain II to domain I) and 2.1 Å (from domain III to domain I). Each domain is composed of two strongly bent anti-parallel β-sheets: β1, β2, β5 and β2′, β3, β4 from domain I; β6, β7, β10 and β7′, β8, β9 from domain II; β11, β12 and β12′, β13, β14 from domain III. The two β sheets of each domain are roughly perpendicular, with the first β-sheet of each domain exposed to the solvent, and the second β-sheet of each domain buried inside. The long β strands β2, β7, and β11 are bent by ∼90° around classical β-bulges located at amino acid positions 52, 53, 63 and 131, 132, 142 and 208, 209, 219, respectively. Strands β2′, β7′, and β12′ represent the posterior parts of strands β2, β7, and β11 after their respective β-bulges. The two helices are located in domain II. Helix α1 flanks β7′, whereas helix α2 is above α1 and β8, and they compose the outer layer of domain II together with strands β6, β7, and β10. These two α-helices are tightly packed against domain II, forming hydrophobic interactions with Val-112 in β6, Val-130 in β7′, Phe-141 and Ile-143 in β8, Tyr-154 in β9, and Leu-165 and Ile-167 in β10 with a total buried area of 1089 Å2. These two helices form a near vertical cross with hydrophobic interactions between Leu-103, Ala-104, and Met-107 of α1 and Leu-156, Leu-157, and Tyr-160 of α2. Sequence alignment among the three domains shows a total sequence identity of 32%, with high conservation of some aromatic residues and nonpolar residues (Fig. 2d). These residues either contribute to the hydrophobic core of each domain or for the hydrophobic interactions among the three domains. The conserved glycines and some asparagine residues are important for the protein fold. Gly-30, Gly-109, and Gly-190 are significant for the formation of the first β-strand in each domain. Asn-35—Gly-36, Asp-120—Gly-121, and Asp-199—Gly-200 form β-turns between the first and second β-strands in each domain, whereas the flexibility of Gly-43, Gly-128, and Gly-205 should be crucial for the bends of strands β2, β7, and β11. There are a number of other conserved glutamate, aspartate, asparagine, glutamine, and serine residues that are distributed on the surface of the protein, but their structural roles are less clear (Fig. 2d). Domains I, II, and III Possess a New Tudor-like Tandem Fold—A DALI search for structural similarity to the individual domains I, II, and III retrieved ∼30 structural homologs for different fragments and suggested Tudor domains and malignant brain tumor repeat domains as closest matches. The spindlin domains and Tudor domains all compose two sheets that are made up of five anti-parallel β strands. The portions of the second strands of these domains all participating in the two sheets are delineated by a kink that changes the direction of the polypeptide (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, residues that assist in forming the Tudor-like domain fold are highly conserved between domains I, II, and III of spindlin1 and the Tudor domain (Fig. 3b). However, a DALI search did not yield any match for the overall structure, suggesting the spindlin1 structure is a novel arrangement of Tudor-like domains. Although spin/ssty repeats and Tudor domains share similar folds, there are some significant differences between them. First, superposition of these domains showed some significant disparity in the backbones of the five-strand structure. The orientation of the fifth strands of the spindlin1 domains is completely diverse from that of the Tudor domains. In addition, comparison of the anterior five β-strands gives a root mean square deviation of about 3.1 ∼ 4.5 Å, indicating considerable differences between the two kinds of domains. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that the β1-β2 loop and the β3-β4 loop together with the regions between these two loops are of great importance for its function, but the residue organization in the spindlin domains is not essentially conserved with the known Tudor domains (Fig. 3, a, c, and d). All of these observations suggest that spin/ssty repeats might have a different function or at least function in a different mode than Tudor domains. The Interactions between Spindlin1 Molecules in Crystal Structure and Solution—From the crystal structure, there are two molecules in one asymmetric unit that are essentially identical with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for all Cα atoms. Examination of the crystal packing reveals the occurrence of a major interface between the two spindlin1 molecules. Each spindlin1 molecule offers two surfaces (surface A and surface B) for association with another molecule. Surface A is defined by strands β11, β14, and the loop β10-β11, whereas surface B is defined by strand β2 and the loops β1-β2, β3-β4, and β13-β14. The two spindlin1 molecules associate through an interface that involves surface A of one molecule and surface B of another molecule, the interactions of which include van der Waals contacts, steric complementarily, and hydrogen bond contacts. First, the interaction between surface A and B buries about 624 Å2 of solvent-accessible area, which would help to stabilize the dimer architecture. Meanwhile, the first strand (β11) of domain III in molecule A forms an anti-parallel β-sheet with strand β2 of domain I in molecule B. As a result, residues Pro-43 and Thr-45 in molecule B participate in the formation of the hydrophobic core of domain III of its neighboring molecule. It should be noted that domain III is composed of only four β strands, which is one strand less than domain I and II, and yet this β-barrel-like structure is closed by strand β2 from the neighboring molecule, in a similar way to strands β5 and β10 in the first two repeats. Thus, the “missing” fifth strand of this spin/ssty repeat is compensated at least in part by molecular interactions. The hydrophobic interface also involves Trp-47, Phe-69, Tyr-73, and Phe-226 in molecule B and Val-185 and Leu-188 in molecule A. In addition, the two anti-parallel β-strands between the two molecules also lead to the formation of at least eight hydrogen bonds around Asp-186 and Gln-192 (Glu-194A—Val-44B, Gln-192A—Gln-46B, Asp-186A—Tyr-73B, Lys-191A—Asp-67B, Lys-191A—Wat-78-Lys-48B, Gln-192A—Wat-29-Gln-46B, and Pro-181A—Wat-179—Asp-225B; Wat is water), which should also contribute to the interaction (Fig. 4, a and b). Consistent with our structure, spindlin1 maintains a dimeric state in solution, as confirmed by dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Cross-linking assays using ethylene glycol succinate as linker also showed that spindlin1 exists largely as a homodimer in solution (Fig. 4c). Thr-95 Is an Important Residue for Phosphate Ion Binding—Two phosphate ions maintained by hydrogen bonds in the loop between domain I and II (P loop) were found in the refined structure of spindlin1 and named c301 and c302, and their position in the overall structure is shown in Fig. 2a. Phasing with heavy atom assigned as phosphorous gives strong anomalous difference electron density at the phosphate binding site, confirming the existence of phosphates (Fig. 5a). Atomic emission spectroscopy revealed that spindlin1 associates with phosphate ions in solution, thus giving a characteristic line for phosphorus in phosphate free buffers. Several arginine and lysine residues, but no aspartate or glutamate residues, are located in the phosphate binding surfaces, which form a positively charged surface region. The electrostatic interactions between these cationic residues and anionic phosphate groups should contribute to the phosphate binding. For further stabilization, the phosphate groups also form a number of hydrogen bonds with spindlin1. There are 10 hydrogen bonds between c301 and spindlin1. The O1 oxygen of phosphate c301 forms three hydrogen bonds; two hydrogen bonds are formed directly with the OG1 and N atoms of Thr-95, and another hydrogen bond is mediated by the water molecule S40 with the main chain oxygen of Val-93. The O2 oxygen also involves three hydrogen bonds; two hydrogen bonds with the NH1 and NH2 atoms of Arg-92 and another hydrogen bond mediated by water molecule S40 with Val-93. The O3 and O4 oxygens of phosphate c301 both form two hydrogen bonds with the polypeptide. The OG1 and N of Thr-139 form two hydrogen bonds with O3, whereas the last two hydrogen bonds are generated between O4 and the N atoms of Thr-95 and Asn-138, respectively (Fig. 5b). The detailed length of each hydrogen bond is listed in Table 2.TABLE 2Hydrogen bonds between phosphate and spindlin 1Phosphate atomPhosphate c301 hydrogen bond partnerDistance X...YPhosphate atomPhosphate c302 hydrogen bond partnerDistance X...YDomainResidueGroupDomainResidueGroupÅÅO1HingeThr-95N3.2O1HingeArg-97NE3.0HingeThr-95OG12.6HingeArg-97NH22.6Water (Hinge)aThe water-mediated hydrogen bonds.

Open table in a new tab Compared with c301, the interactions for the c302 phosphate ion are weaker with a total of eight hydrogen bonds. The O1 oxygen of c302 involves the formation of three hydrogen bonds; two hydrogen bonds with the NH2 and NE atoms of Arg-97 and one mediated by water molecule S4 with the O atom of Ile-98. The O2 oxygen of c302 forms two hydrogen bonds with NH1 of Arg-133 and OD1 of Asn-138. The O3 oxygen contributes one hydrogen bond with NH2 of Arg-133, whereas O4 forms one hydrogen bond with NH2 of Arg-97 and one mediated by water S98 with the ND2 atom of Asn-138 (Table 1, Fig. 5c). From our structure, the long P loop (residues 90-100) is relatively stable (Fig. 2a) with an average B factor of 29.7 for main chain atoms. There are five residues in this loop that interact with the phosphate ions either directly (Arg-92, Thr-95, and Arg-97) or indirectly via hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules (Val-93 and Ile-98). Thus, the presence of phosphate c301 and c302 should greatly benefit the stabilization of this loop. Of these hydrogen bonds to the two phosphate ions, the interactions associated with the phosphate O1 atom are the strongest, as evidenced by the electron density between the phosphate O1 atom and OG1 of Thr-95 seen clearly even at a contour level of 3σ. From atomic emission spectroscopy experiments, the phosphorus content in wild type spindlin1 is 62 ± 2 g/mol, whereas only 24 ± 3 g/mol could be measured for the T95A mutant, indicating a greater decrease of the phosphate content in this mutant. This mutant could not be crystallized with the native crystallization conditions, which indicates that the structure of spindlin1 is at least partially influenced by the presence of phosphate. Thus, Thr-95 is a critical residue for the binding of phosphate ions. The Loop between Domain I and II Is the Key Site for Cell Cycle Regulation Activity—To examine the potential effects of the phosphate ions on the function of spindlin1, the cell cycle distribution of control HeLa cells were compared with fluorescence-activated cell-sorted green fluorescent protein-positive HeLa cells expressing either wild type spindlin1 or the T95A mutant. All cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h after transfection with their respective vectors and were then applied to fluorescence-activated cell sorter to analyze the proliferation states of these samples. Analysis of the cell cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells by propidium iodide staining revealed that 21% of cells transfected with wild type spindlin1 entered the G2/M phase, whereas only 11% of HeLa cells and 10% of cells transfected with vectors were in G2/M, indicating that overexpression of spindlin1 would lead to a marked increase in the percentage of cells in G2/M (p = 0.001). The results of fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also showed a slight increase of S stage cells when spindlin1 was overexpressed (34% of spindlin1 wild type, 26% of control cells, and 26% of cells transfected with vector, with a Student's t test difference of p = 0.05). These results were in agreement with previous studies (10Gao Y. Yue W. Zhang P. Li L. Xie X. Yuan H. Chen L. Liu D. Yan F. Pei X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Notably, cells expressing the spindlin1 T95A mutant showed a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G2/M (9%) and S (29%) phase compared with those expressing wild type spindlin1 and were nearly identical to those of the control cells (p values are 0.51 and 0.44, respectively) (Fig. 6, a and b). Thus, our data suggest that Thr-95 is crucial for the function of spindlin1. From our structure the loss of the phosphate ions, which are maintained by hydrogen bonds, is expected to result in the distortion of the loop P. Thus, we propose that mutation of Thr-95 should break the interaction between the loop P and strands β7 and β8of domain II, destroying its stability. Thus, the P loop should be related to the cell cycle regulation of spindlin1, although further work is required to confirm this hypothesis. Spindlin1 Molecules Possess DNA Binding Activity—Prompted by the observation that some Tudor-like domains possess nucleic acid binding activity together with the potential cell cycle regulation, tumorigenesis, and anti-apoptosis functions of spindlin1, we performed gel shift assays to assess the binding of spindlin1 to nucleic acid. In this assay, mixtures of different concentrations of protein and nucleic acids were analyzed on agarose gels. Our initial binding data showed that increasing the concentration of spindlin1 would lead to a shift of the band corresponding to 30 bp of dsDNA, which suggests that spindlin1 could interact with dsDNA. This interaction was not affected by altering the dsDNA probe, indicating that the association between spindlin1 and dsDNA is nonspecific. However, similar assays using 30 bp of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a probe did not show an obvious band shift, implying that spindlin1 does not bind ssDNA (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, spindlin1 also exhibited higher affinity for super helical than for open cycle dsDNA, as the super helical bands shifted much earlier than the open cycle bands when mixing spindlin1 with dsDNA vectors (Fig. 6d). Because no metal ions are found in the structure and the addition of EDTA did not inhibit the protein/DNA interaction, metal ions are not likely to be required for nucleic acid binding activity (data not shown). Our data suggest the existence of protein-nucleic acid interactions, providing a basis for investigating DNA/spindlin1 interactions and the opportunity to explore the biological consequences of this interaction in further detail. Functional Implications of Other Tudor-containing Proteins—Although not shown in the previous bioinformatics analysis, the spin/ssty repeats and Tudor domains exhibit similar folds. Interestingly, like spin/ssty repeats, Tudor domains are usually presented in a tandem repeat manner. TUD, a protein with 11 Tudor domain repeats, is also specifically expressed during oogenesis and early embryogenesis (16Bardsley A. McDonald K. Boswell R.E. Development. 1993; 119: 207-219PubMed Google Scholar). It is essential for the germ cell formation of embryos but without an obvious somatic function (17Thomson T. Lasko P. Genesis. 2004; 40: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All of these observations imply some functional relationship between spin/ssty repeat and Tudor domains. Recent work has revealed that the Tudor domain might be a methylated protein binding domain. 53bp1, a conserved checkpoint gene for DNA double-stranded breaks (18Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D.

Furthermore, the Tudor domain in survival motor neuron, a gene responsible for autosomal recessive proximal spinal muscular atrophy, is required for its methylated partner binding activity (21Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All of these domains display a similar five anti-parallel β-strand structure with spin/ssty repeats (Fig. 3a), and thus, spindlin, the gene family that contains three spin/ssty repeats, might also possess a similar binding activity, although further evidence is required to confirm this. Some other Tudor-like domains are also involved in nucleic acid binding. Research on Tudor domains in 53bp1 showed that the residues between loop β1-2 and loop β3-4 are necessary for dsDNA binding, whereas the residues Trp-18, Asn-21, Tyr-23, Asp-43, and Glu-47 should be responsible for nucleic acid binding (19Charier G.

Although sequence alignment showed that these residues are largely conserved in spin/ssty repeat as well, their spatial positions are not necessarily the same (Fig. 3, b and d). Trp-37, Asn-41, and Asp-70 in spin/ssty repeat adopt similar positions in the structure, whereas Asp-67 is located in a different strand, and the side chain of Val-44 extends in an opposite direction compared with Tyr-23 of 53bp1. In another study, Steiner and co-workers (23Steiner T. Kaiser J.T. Marinkovic S. Huber R. Wahl M.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4641-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) implied that the nucleic acid binding surface of Tudor-like domain in NusG is composed by loop β1-2 and loop β3-4 and portions of β1, β2, and β4. However, superposition of these structures shows that spindlin1 domains are greatly diverse in these loop regions, particularly in the β1-2 loop (Fig. 3, a and c). This loop is much longer in spin/ssty repeats than in other Tudor domains, leading to a greater distance between loop β1-2 and loop β3-4. It is not yet clear whether or not the spatial variations would give rise to different binding modes. Thus, whether spindlin1 interacts with nucleic acid in a similar manner to other Tudor domains awaits further resolution. The Oligomer State Might Be Important for the Function of Spindlin1—Spindlin1 is a dimeric protein from gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments, and we observe in the crystal structure an interface between two spindlin1 molecules that buries 620 Å2 from solvent. Based on our structure, the dimerization occurs by association of the surface A (strand β11, β14, loop β10-β11) and surface B (strand β2, loops β1-β2, β3-β4, β13-β14), which results in the formation of two equivalent surfaces that are not involved in dimer formation. These two surfaces may, therefore, associate with other tandems in a strictly identical way, as occurs in the crystal. Based on this, we speculate that spindlin1 has the potential to form higher order oligomers. Chemical cross-linking studies show that spindlin1 has a strong tendency to form a homodimer, yet a small portion of trimer can also be observed (Fig. 4c). Thus, the two vacant sites are likely to be the binding sites for other spindlin1 molecules. Similar dimeric architectures are also found in other structures. The homodimer of the phosphorylation domain in PhoP, which is maintained mainly by hydrogen bonds of the acidic residues, involves an asymmetric association similar to the spindlin1 homodimer. Birck and co-workers (24Birck C. Chen Y. Hulett F.M. Samama J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Chen Y. Birck C. Samama J.P. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) also believe that the two free interacting surfaces on the tandem repeats appear as an unprecedented unit of further oligomerization, which should be important for its function. Spindlin1 is highly expressed at both the mRNA and protein level. Of all the maternal mRNA, about 0.35% of transcripts encode the Spin gene (1Oh B. Hwang S.Y. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Development. 1997; 124: 493-503PubMed Google Scholar), whereas its protein product is repeatedly found in oocytes and early embryos and has been used as a marker protein for the cell cycle study (2Oh B.

Based on the accumulation of spindlin1 to the cell nuclei and its potential for oligomerization, it is possible that spindlin1 is present in the oligomeric state under certain circumstances, which should be important for its function. In summary, we have reported the three-dimensional structure of spindlin1, which is the first to be characterized from the spin/ssty gene family. The spindlin1 structure possesses a novel arrangement of the Tudor repeat domain fold. Thr-95 is a functionally important residue that plays roles in the binding of phosphate ions and stabilizing the loop between domain I and II and which is essential for regulating cell cycle progression. We have also identified double-stranded nucleic acid as its molecular binding partner, thus providing a structural and biochemical basis for further functional investigation of spindlin1.

https://openalex.org/W2076731404,"Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X) is an adaptor protein involved in down-regulation and sorting of cell surface receptors through the endosomal compartments toward the lysosome. In this study, we show that Alix interacts with the C-terminal region of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor (PDGFRβ) and becomes transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. Increased expression levels of Alix resulted in a reduced rate of PDGFRβ removal from the cell surface following receptor activation, and this was associated with decreased receptor degradation. Furthermore, Alix was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, and elevated Alix levels increased the interaction between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ. Interestingly, Alix interacted constitutively with both c-Cbl and PDGFRβ. Moreover, c-Cbl was found to be hyperphosphorylated in cells engineered to overexpress Alix compared with control cells. The increased c-Cbl phosphorylation correlated with enhanced proteasomal degradation of c-Cbl, which in turn correlated with a decreased ubiquitination of PDGFRβ. Our data suggest that Alix inhibits down-regulation of PDGFRβ by modulating the interaction between c-Cbl and the receptor, thereby affecting the ubiquitination of the receptor.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 2The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Alix, ALG-2-interacting protein X; Cbl, casitas B-lineage lymphoma; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; PAE cells, porcine aortic endothelial cells; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. is a family of signaling proteins that regulates the proliferation, survival, and migration of cells of mesenchymal origin. The PDGF family consists of four protein chains that form five biologically active dimers (PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC, and -DD) (1Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). PDGF isoforms exert their cellular effects via binding to two tyrosine kinase receptors: PDGFRα, which binds PDGF-A, -B, and -C chains; and PDGFRβ, which binds PDGF-B and -D chains. Ligand binding induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptors. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues have key roles in coupling to downstream signaling pathways as they mediate interaction with Src homology 2 domain (SH2)-containing molecules. Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X; also referred to as AIP1 or HP95) is a protein that was identified as a binding partner for ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene 2) (2Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by various stimuli requires ALG-2, and several studies have indicated a role for Alix in regulation of cell death (3Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 4Mahul-Mellier A.L. Hemming F.J. Blot B. Fraboulet S. Sadoul R. J.

Alix possesses an N-terminal Bro1 domain and a C-terminal region rich in proline and tyrosine residues, suggesting an adaptor/scaffold function. Recently, Alix has been implicated in receptor endocytosis and trafficking (7Katoh K. Shibata H. Suzuki H. Nara A. Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Yoshimori T. Maki M. J. Biol.

Cell.

Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The same group also showed that Alix interacts with and is phosphorylated by Src family kinases and that this phosphorylation reduces the interaction between Alix and EGFR, CIN85, or Pyk2, thereby releasing the inhibitory function of Alix on endocytosis (9Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3414-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another role that has emerged for Alix is in the organization of endosomes and formation of multivesicular bodies required for transportation of proteins from the early endosome to the lysosome (10Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Alix interacts with several cytoskeletal proteins, e.g. actin and tubulin, and with tyrosine kinases such as FAK and Pyk2, thereby negatively regulating cell adhesion (12Schmidt M.H. Chen B. Randazzo L.M. Bogler O. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Alix in NIH3T3 cells promotes flat cell morphology and reduced proliferation (13Wu Y. Pan S. Luo W. Lin S.H. Kuang J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6801-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and Alix overexpression in HeLa cells leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (14Wu Y. Pan S. Che S. He G. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Kuang J. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, Alix has been shown to be involved in numerous cellular events, such as modulation of cellular architecture, apoptosis, growth, and endocytosis; however, the precise function of Alix is not well understood. In the present report, we show that Alix interacts constitutively with PDGFRβ. It modulates the stability of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, thus affecting receptor ubiquitination and down-regulation. Reagents—Recombinant human PDGF-BB was generously provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting: phosphotyrosine (sc-7020) and PDGFRβ (sc-339) antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the monoclonal PDGFRβ antibody recognizing the extracellular domain (GR14L) was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA); monoclonal β-actin antibody was from Sigma (A5441); the monoclonal HA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science; the monoclonal c-Cbl antibody (610442) was from BD Transduction Laboratories; and RasGAP antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (05-178). An antiserum against Alix was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the synthetic peptide CSYPFPQPPQQSYYPQQ conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibodies were purified by chromatography over a column of the corresponding peptide immobilized on Sepharose beads. Purified antibodies were stored in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 50% glycerol at –70 °C. Rabbit antiserum against PLCγ was generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of bovine PLCγ (15Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) and 293T cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected by Lipofectamine according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. To establish stable transfectants, cells were selected 48 h after transfection by the presence of 400 μg/ml zeocin until only resistant cells were left. Affinity Purification of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins–Subconfluent PAE cells (total 109 cells) expressing either PDGFRα or PDGFRβ were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB and lysed in 0.5% Triton, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1% Trasylol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with 4G10 antibodies coupled to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 2 h. The immunocomplex was washed three times in lysis buffer and then eluted twice with 100 mm phenylphosphate in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Eluted proteins were precipitated using the Wessel-Flügge procedure (16Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were treated with 25 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature before separation by SDS-PAGE and visualization by silver staining using an in-gel digestion compatible protocol (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Protein Identification—Excised protein bands were destained (18Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and dried with acetonitrile. A solution of porcine sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10% acetonitrile was allowed to soak into the gel pieces on ice for 45 min. Approximately 100 ng trypsin/gel band was applied and incubated at 30 °C overnight. The digestion was stopped by making the samples 1% with respect to trifluoroacetic acid. After dilution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, samples were concentrated and desalted on a μZip-Tip C18 column (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the digest mixture was eluted directly onto the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) target with 70% acetonitrile, containing about 8 mg/ml matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Peptide mass fingerprinting was done by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The instrument was operated in reflector mode and optimized for analytes up to 4000 Da. The spectra were internally calibrated using autolytic trypsin peptides. The peptide mass lists were used to scan protein sequence data banks for protein identities via the ProFound search engine. Significance of matches were judged after taking several parameters into account, such as “z-score,” error distribution, number of miscuts, and migration behavior. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Subconfluent cells were starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum overnight and incubated and with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (0.5% Triton, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1% Trasylol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). Equal amounts of lysates were incubated with 1 μg of antibody as indicated. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times in lysis buffer, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitates or equal amounts of total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, samples were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P), which were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were used with the concentrations and buffers recommended by the suppliers and incubated overnight in the cold. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (both from GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection systems from Roche Applied Science on a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CCD; Fuji, Minami-Ashigata, Japan). Before reprobing, the membranes were stripped with 0.4 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, blocked, and incubated with the corresponding antibody. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for different periods of time at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1 h on ice with 0.2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline. To inactivate unbound sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, cells were treated for 5 min with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled with SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. Eluted proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and the amount of PDGFRβ was visualized and quantified by immunoblotting with PDGFRβ antibodies. Identification of Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins after PDGF Stimulation—We were interested in identifying proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated after PDGF stimulation and hence are likely to participate in signal transduction downstream of the PDGFRs. To this end we used monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) immobilized on Sepharose beads to immunoprecipitate proteins from PDGF-BB-stimulated PAE cells transfected with either PDGFRα or PDGFRβ. This allowed us to investigate the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins downstream of the two PDGFR isoforms, expressed at comparable levels in the same cellular background. Bound proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining (supplemental Fig. 1). Proteins tentatively phosphorylated after PDGF stimulation were excised and identified by mass spectroscopy as indicated in supplemental Fig. 1. Among the proteins identified, Alix was selected for further study in regard to PDGFRβ signal transduction. Interestingly, we observed that Alix was not significantly phosphorylated by PDGFRα, indicating that Alix is a preferred substrate for PDGFRβ. Alix Is Phosphorylated in Response to PDGF and Interacts Constitutively with PDGFRβ—To verify the mass spectroscopy results, we immunoprecipitated Alix from cells stimulated with PDGF-BB and resolved the immunocomplexes by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to an Immobilon P membrane. A phosphotyrosine immunoblot revealed bands with sizes corresponding to Alix (∼95 kDa) and PDGFRβ (∼180 kDa) in the Alix immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A, left panels). The 95- and 180-kDa phosphoproteins were confirmed to be Alix and PDGFRβ, respectively, by reprobing the membrane with Alix- or PDGFRβ-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A, left panels). Interestingly, we found that Alix interacted with PDGFRβ in a constitutive manner, although its tyrosine phosphorylation was ligand-dependent. The interaction could also be detected in a reciprocal experiment (Fig. 1A, right panels). Next, we performed a kinetic analysis of Alix phosphorylation. We found that Alix was transiently phosphorylated in response to PDGF-BB (Fig. 1B, top panel) with kinetics similar to the overall receptor activation as determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of WGA-Sepharose-enriched PDGFRβ (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Our results suggest that Alix is phosphorylated by PDGFRβ. It is possible that Alix is also phosphorylated indirectly by Src family kinases activated by PDGFRβ; however, such a contribution is likely to be minor, because Alix phosphorylation was only slightly inhibited by the low molecular weight inhibitor SU6656 (data not shown). Alix Binds to the C-terminal Region of PDGFRβ—To determine the binding region for Alix in PDGFRβ, we decided to analyze different C-terminally truncated mutants of the receptor for their abilities to interact with Alix. By expressing deletion mutants of the receptor in 293T cells, we found a partial loss of interaction when the 75 most C-terminal amino acid residues of PDGFRβ were deleted and an almost complete loss of binding when the last 98 amino acid residues were deleted (Fig. 2A). Because Alix, despite its not being significantly phosphorylated by PDGFRα, was also found to interact with this receptor (data not shown), we compared the amino acid sequence of PDGFRα and -β in the region important for binding. We observed that the sequence surrounding Tyr-1021 in PDGFRβ is similar between both receptor isoforms (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, this region is rich in proline residues, which can interact with SH3 domain or WW domain-containing proteins in a constitutive manner. To clarify whether this region is responsible for the interaction with Alix, we synthesized peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence between residues 1015 and 1030, with the addition of an N-terminal cysteine to facilitate coupling to a solid support (Fig. 2B), with Tyr-1021 either phosphorylated or not phosphorylated. Next we performed in vitro interaction assays using this peptide immobilized on beads followed by immunoblotting for target proteins. We found that Alix interacted with both peptides, independent of phosphorylation, in agreement with the constitutive binding observed in vivo (Fig. 2C). As a control, we analyzed the interaction between these peptides and its known interaction partner PLCγ1. Indeed, we could detect a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with PLCγ1 (Fig. 2C). As a negative control we used a peptide containing tyrosine 771 in the PDGFRβ, which is known to bind RasGAP. As seen in Fig. 2C, this peptide, when phosphorylated on tyrosine, could pull down RasGAP but not Alix. Thus, we concluded that Alix can interact with the PDGFRβ in the region between residues 1015 and 1030 in a receptor phosphorylation-independent manner. However, other regions in the PDGFRβ may contribute, because there was a weak residual binding also when the last 98 amino acids of the receptor were deleted. Alix Inhibits PDGF-BB-induced Removal of PDGFRβ from the Cell Surface—To investigate whether the expression level of Alix influenced the rate of PDGFRβ cell surface clearance, we analyzed cells that were engineered to overexpress Alix (Fig. 3A). To measure the amount of receptors on the cell surface, we stimulated cells for different periods of time and biotinylated the cell surface proteins prior to lysis. Biotinylated proteins were purified using streptavidin-agarose, and the levels of PDGFRβ were then analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). As can be seen, the PDGF-BB-induced clearance of PDGFRβ from the cell surface was reduced in Alix-overexpressing cells as compared with mock-transfected control cells. Alix Overexpression Enhances Interaction between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ and Phosphorylation of c-Cbl—Ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases is important for their internalization, and c-Cbl is a major ubiquitin ligase connected with PDGFRβ. Because we noticed a reduced rate of PDGFRβ down-regulation from the cell surface in cells overexpressing Alix (Fig. 3B), we investigated the effect of increased Alix levels on c-Cbl phosphorylation and association with the PDGFRβ after ligand stimulation. We found that elevated Alix levels resulted in increased interaction between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ (Fig. 4). In addition, we observed that Alix co-immunoprecipitated with c-Cbl. Interestingly, neither the interaction between c-Cbl and Alix nor that between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ was induced by PDGF stimulation, but it existed in a constitutive manner both in control and Alix-overexpressing cells. Moreover, PDGF-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation was augmented in cells overexpressing Alix compared with control cells (Fig. 4). Elevated Levels of Alix Lead to Reduced PDGFRβ Down-regulation but Increased c-Cbl Degradation in Response to PDGF-BB—Next, we wanted to determine whether the reduced rate of PDGFRβ removal from the cell surface in cells overexpressing Alix was associated with changes in receptor stability. We therefore stimulated cells with PDGF-BB for different periods of time and determined the amount of PDGFRβ by immunoblotting. Indeed, ligand-induced PDGFRβ degradation was reduced in Alix-overexpressing cells compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, we could not observe any effects of Alix overexpression on PDGFRβ phosphorylation. However, c-Cbl was hyperphosphorylated in cells overexpressing Alix (Figs. 4 and 5). We found that the enhanced c-Cbl phosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB stimulation in cells with elevated levels of Alix correlated with increased c-Cbl degradation (Fig. 5). The enhanced rate of c-Cbl degradation was completely inhibited by MG132, suggesting that the degradation occurred in proteasomes (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Cbl is degraded via the proteasomal pathway. A, PAE/PDGFRβ-Alix and PAE/PDGFRβ cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 25 μm MG132 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 4 h followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Lysates were prepared, and c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated (Ip), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon P membranes, and immunoblotted (Ib) as indicated. As a loading control a fraction of total cell lysate (TCL) was immunoblotted for β-actin levels. B, the intensities of the bands shown in A were measured and plotted as indicated. The value for unstimulated mock cells was used for normalization. a.u., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Elevated Alix Expression Decreases Ligand-induced PDGFRβ Ubiquitination—The observation that increased Alix expression resulted in increased proteasomal degradation of c-Cbl suggested that the level of PDGFRβ ubiquitination might also be affected. To investigate this possibility, we transfected Alix-overexpressing or mock-transfected cells with ubiquitin fused with an HA epitope and performed immunoprecipitation of PDGFRβ followed by immunoblotting with HA antibodies. Indeed, we found that the PDGFRβ was significantly less ubiquitinated in cells overexpressing Alix (Fig. 7). However, after shorter periods (5–15 min) of PDGF-BB stimulation, we could not demonstrate a significant difference in level of PDGFRβ ubiquitination between control and Alix-overexpressing cells (data not shown). This suggests that the bulk of c-Cbl proteins must first be degraded before the reduction in ubiquitination can be observed. In summary, Alix overexpression stabilizes the PDGFRβ, possibly through promoting enhanced proteasomal degradation of c-Cbl in response to PDGF-BB and thereby reducing c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the PDGFRβ. Down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases is essential for proper response to ligand, and disturbances in this process may contribute to transformation (19Peschard P. Park M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been shown that monoubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases is an important mechanism that regulates receptor internalization and intracellular trafficking (20Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). c-Cbl is a ubiquitin ligase targeting several receptor tyrosine kinases including the PDGFRs. In this report, we present data on c-Cbl and the multifunctional adaptor protein Alix and on their involvement in PDGFRβ down-regulation. In general, our results are consistent with earlier work with the EGFR (8Schmidt M.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3414-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that Alix forms a constitutive complex with PDGFRβ and is transiently phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation. An activation-independent interaction has also been reported between Alix and the EGFR (8Schmidt M.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We mapped the binding site of Alix to the C-terminal tail of PDGFRβ. However, contributions from other regions of the receptor in this interaction cannot be excluded. The C-terminal region contains a proline-rich sequence that may mediate the interaction with Alix. However, Alix does not contain any domain that is known to interact with proline-rich regions. Thus, it is possible the interaction between Alix and PDGFRβ is indirect, through an adaptor protein. In fact, Alix is believed to bind indirectly to the EGFR because the association cannot be observed using recombinant proteins (8Schmidt M.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interaction between Alix and PDGFRβ was not affected by mutation of tyrosines 1009 and 1021 in the C-terminal tail of the receptor to phenylalanine (data not shown). It was recently shown that overexpression of Alix results in a reduced EGFR internalization (8Schmidt M.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Alix also reduced the rate of ligand-induced PDGFRβ removal from the cell surface compared with mock-transfected cells; this reduction was accompanied by a decreased rate of receptor degradation. Moreover, we observed c-Cbl hyperphosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB in Alix-overexpressing cells that was associated with enhanced proteasomal degradation of c-Cbl. These observations are in concurrence with a study from Bao et al. (21Bao J. Gur G. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showing that expression of active Src (or overexpression of normal Src) promotes c-Cbl hyperphosphorylation and, as a consequence, its degradation (21Bao J. Gur G. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the low molecular weight Src inhibitor SU6656 had no significant effect on PDGF-BB-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation in our cell model (data not shown). Our results suggest that that c-Cbl, Alix, and PDGFRβ interact constitutively, although our data could not distinguish whether a ternary complex or separate binary complexes are formed. However, elevated Alix expression enhances the interaction between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ. Notably, the constitutive interaction between c-Cbl and PDGFRβ was also detected in mock-transfected cells and hence is not an artifact of overexpression. The enhanced c-Cbl phosphorylation observed in cells overexpressing Alix may be explained by enhanced interaction between c-Cbl and the receptor, which may allow a more efficient phosphorylation. Given that c-Cbl is a major ubiquitin ligase downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (22Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), we anticipated that an increase in c-Cbl degradation would be reflected in a decreased level of receptor ubiquitination. Indeed, we observed that Alix overexpression correlated with a reduced level of PDGFRβ ubiquitination. It has been suggested that degradation of hyperphosphorylated c-Cbl allows the EGFR to recycle back to the plasma membrane instead of being sorted for lysosomal degradation (21Bao J. Gur G. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), potentially because of a lack of sustained ubiquitination (23Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N. Donoghue S. Rogers R.A. Bowtell D. Naramura M. Gu H. Band V. Band H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is compatible with our results showing that Alix overexpression leads to increased c-Cbl phosphorylation and degradation, as well as to a reduced rate of PDGFRβ clearance from the cell surface. It remains to be determined whether this is because of decreased internalization or increased recycling. In conclusion, Alix may function as an adaptor/scaffold protein regulating PDGFRβ ubiquitination and consequently intracellular sorting by modulating the degradation of c-Cbl.

The human FANCM protein is an ortholog of the archaeabacterial helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA and contains both DNA helicase-like and endonuclease-like domains (14Meetei A.R.

FANCG contains several putative tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (27Blom E. van de Vrugt H.J. de Vries Y. de Winter J.P. Arwert F. Joenje H. DNA Repair (Amst. 2004; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TPR domains typically serve as protein interaction modules within multisubunit enzymes (28Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) or as scaffolds for the assembly of multiprotein complexes (29D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem.

Although TPR motifs exhibit a considerable degree of sequence diversity, their structures are remarkably similar. The remaining FA core complex proteins have a predicted α-helical character suggestive of helical repeats that might function as a scaffold that interacts with DNA damage response or repair proteins. The FANCF protein is a component of the FA core complex that is necessary for FANCD2 monoubiquitination (15de Winter J.P. Van der Weel L. de Groot J. Stone S. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. Scheper R.J.

In addition, both N- and C-terminal regions of FANCF synergistically support one another's interactions with their respective partners. For example, mutations in the C-terminal half of FANCF partially compromise interactions with FANCC and with FANCE, proteins that bind to the N-terminal half of FANCF (33Leveille F. Blom E.

The synergistic interactions of the N- and C-terminal halves of FANCF with the FANCA:FANCG and FANCC:FANCE subcomplexes, respectively, engendered the notion that FANCF functions as a physical adaptor that is essential for the integrity of the FA core nuclear complex (33Leveille F.

Our x-ray crystallographic studies of FANCF reveal that the C-terminal domain of FANCF comprises a series of helical hairpins arranged in a right handed solenoid. Four loops inserted between these α-helical hairpins constitute a significant portion of the protein surface. Residues located in two of these loops are critical for the interaction of FANCF with FANCA: FANCG, a prerequisite for FANCD2 monoubiquitination and normal cellular tolerance of cross-linking agents like mitomycin C. In addition, the FANCF protein is structurally similar to Cand1, a protein regulator of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Our structure and mutational analyses of FANCF provide direct support for the suggestion that the FA protein complex may share structural characteristics with multiprotein ubiquitin ligases. Protein Expression and Purification—The FANCF156-357 protein was expressed as a thioredoxin fusion using a modified pET32a vector where the enterokinase cleavage site has been replaced with a Prescission protease site. BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 16 °C. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). The cleared cell lysate was passed through a 5-ml HiTrap HP chelating cartridge (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 500 mm KCl and 20 mm imidazole in the lysis buffer. Protein was eluted by on-resin cleavage with Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q cation exchange cartridge. The protein was eluted by a 50-1000 mm KCl gradient over 15 column volumes in buffer Q (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol). In the final step, the protein was applied to an S-200 size exclusion column equilibrated with buffer S (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of FANCF156-357 were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from a 10 mg/ml protein stock. Crystals appeared overnight and grew to maximum size in 3-5 days at 21 °C in well buffer containing 100 mm Bistris, pH 7.0, 200 mm Li2SO4, 20-25% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 10% ethylene glycol. Two related fragments, FANCF156-368 and FANCF156-374, prepared in the same manner, were tested in crystallization, but both of these proteins failed to produce useful crystals. For diffraction experiments, crystals were equilibrated into cryoprotecting buffer (100 mm Nacacodylate, pH 7.0, 200 mm Li2SO4, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20% glycerol) and cooled in liquid N2. A mercury derivative was prepared by soaking crystals overnight at 21 °C in a cryoprotection buffer containing 0.03 mm ethylmercuric phosphate and 0.03 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The crystals belong to the P3121 space group with cell dimensions a = b = 96.4 Å, c = 48.0 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. A single anomalous dispersion data set was collected on the X-12C beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source in Upton, NY. Diffraction data were processed in HKL2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to locate one mercury site in the asymmetric unit. After solvent flattening, a partial model built using RESOLVE (36Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Wild-type (normal adult) lymphoblast lines (39Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 2457-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (PD7 and GM02554) and the FA lymphoblast line EUFA121 (FA-F) were used in this study. Mammalian Expression Vectors—The retroviral expression vector pMMP-puro was described previously (40Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). pMMP-puro-FLAG-FANCF was generated by adding the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) to the N terminus of FANCF. Production of pMMP retroviral supernatants was performed as previously described (41Naf D. Kupfer G.M. Suliman A. Lambert K. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5952-5960Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). FANCF mutations were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange Kit, Stratagene). Truncations and internal deletions of FANCF were generated with standard PCR cloning techniques. Retroviral Infection—FA-F lymphoblasts underwent three rounds of infection with supernatant from 293GPG fibroblasts transfected with pMMP-FANCF. Cells were exposed to the virus-containing supernatant for 24 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) followed by incubation for 24 h in regular RPMI (15% fetal bovine serum). After the final round, the infected cells were washed free of viral supernatant and resuspended in growth medium. After 48-72 h, the cells were transferred to medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. Dead cells were removed over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) cushion after 5 days, and the remaining cells were grown under continuous selection in puromycin. MMC Sensitivity and Chromosomal Breakage Assays—The MMC sensitivity of transduced lymphoblasts was determined as described previously (42Yamashita T. Barber D.L. Zhu Y. Wu N. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) but using the CyQuant cell proliferation assay kit (Invitrogen). Chromosome breakage analysis was performed by the Cytogenetics Core Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as described previously (43Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Taniguchi T.

Immunoprecipitations—Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) supplemented with protease tablets (Roche Applied Science). Each lysate was normalized to contain 2 mg of total protein, and FLAG-FANCF was immunoprecipitated with 50 μl of packed M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma Aldrich) for 24 h at 4 °C. The agarose was then washed 3-4 times with chilled lysis buffer. FLAG-FANCF was eluted with either 150 ng/ml FLAG peptide or with SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 3-8% gradient gel (Invitrogen) for FANCD2 or a 4-12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) with MES buffer (Invitrogen) for FANCA, -F, and -G. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a submerged transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) filled with transfer buffer (Invitrogen). After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody diluted in TBS-T (1:500 dilution for FANCA, -D2, -F, -G; 1:1000 for M5; and 1:250 for rabbit anti-FLAG), washed extensively, and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was used for detection. Generation of DNA Damage—Cells growing in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine were exposed to 2 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 24 h. For mitomycin C (Sigma) treatment, see the MMC sensitivity and chromosomal breakage assays section. The Highly Conserved CTD of FANCF Is a Helical Repeat Motif—Two regions of high sequence conservation are evident when comparing FANCF proteins from human, mouse, toad (Xenopus), and pufferfish, one region near the N terminus, and another close to the C terminus (supplemental Fig. 1). Of special note is the highly conserved C-terminal region of FANCF (Fig. 1, b and c). Eleven of the 23 residues in the Leu-329-Leu-352 stretch are strictly conserved in all species compared, and four additional residues retain a conserved hydrophobic character (e.g. Phe or Tyr at position 339; Ile or Val at position 346). Overall, 43 of 374 residues, or 11.5% in human FANCF, are strictly conserved in orthologous proteins, whereas 48% are identical in the Leu-329-Leu-352 region (Fig. 1b), and the homology reaches 65% if the four conserved hydrophobic residues are included. We therefore focused our attention on the C-terminal region of the FANCF protein, creating several expression constructs for human FANCF fragments based on the aligned sequences. When fused to thioredoxin, the C-terminal region of FANCF was soluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, in contrast to full-length FANCF, which was completely insoluble. Limited proteolysis of this fragment of FANCF further demarcated a domain that was resistant to proteolytic cleavage with trypsin and proteinase K. Both enzymes produced similar, stable fragments of FANCF that were identified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing (data not shown). On the basis of these results, three additional expression constructs were generated (see “Experimental Procedures”), and these C-terminal fragments were expressed and purified for crystallographic studies. Well diffracting crystals were obtained for the fragment encompassing residues 156-357, whereas fragments with additional C-terminal residues failed to produce useful crystals. The structure of the FANCF156-357 was determined by single anomalous dispersion using crystals derivatized with ethylmercuric phosphate. The crystallographic model was refined against x-ray data extending to 2.4 Å resolution, resulting in a crystallographic R value of 19% and an Rfree value of 25% (Table 1). The structure encompasses residues Leu-329-Leu-352, and it highlights several features of the protein that were targeted for mutagenesis and found to be functionally important.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupP3121Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)96.4, 96.4, 48.0α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120Resolution (Å)50-2.4 (2.49-2.40)aParentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.Rsym (%)3.8 (26.2)I/σI9.8 (6.2)Completeness (%)99.6 (97.0)Redundancy7.1 (6.8)RefinementResolution range24.0-2.4No. reflections9,109Rwork/Rfree0.19/0.25No. atomsProtein1,344Water80B-factors (Å2)52.5Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.024Bond angles (°)2.421a Parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab FANCF Has Structural Similarity to Cand1—We searched the Protein Data Bank for proteins that were structurally homologous to FANCF using the DALI (47Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) server. The CTD of FANCF is most structurally similar to the Cand1 regulatory subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (48Goldenberg S.J. Cascio T.C. Shumway S.D. Garbutt K.C. Liu J. Xiong Y. Zheng N.

Guntert P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 29: 205-206Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Cand1 protein forms an extended solenoid that coils around the SCF scaffold Cul1 (48Goldenberg S.J. Cascio T.C. Shumway S.D. Garbutt K.C. Liu J. Xiong Y. Zheng N. Cell. 2004; 119: 517-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both the Cand1 and Cse1p proteins are composed of Huntington elongation A subunit target of rapamycin (HEAT) repeats. The HEAT repeats are 40-residue-long, two-helix motifs often found in tandem arrays within functionally divergent proteins (50Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The core region of FANCF encompassing helices α1-α6 of FANCF CTD also bears superficial resemblance to the armadillo helical repeats of importin-α (51Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and related proteins. However, the candidate armadillo repeats of FANCF do not have hydrophobic core residues in the canonical positions of a true armadillo repeat, indicative of a different packing arrangement between α-helices in the FANCF CTD. Surface Loop Residues Are Critical for Proper FANCF Function—The C-terminal domain of FANCF (CTD, residues 156-357) consists almost entirely of α-helices connected by several loops, with overall dimensions of 58 × 38 × 29 Å (Fig. 1a). Successive pairs of antiparallel helices, or helical hairpins, are arranged in a right-handed solenoid with an extended shape. The hairpins are composed of helices ranging in lengths from 9 to 18 residues. Four hairpin repeats (HP1-HP4) are formed by helices α2-α9 and capped on either end by helices α1 and α10 (Fig. 1a). Short connecting loops join the helices within each hairpin, and the longer connections joining the hairpins together consist of loops that vary in length from 4 to 23 residues. The N-terminal helix (helix α1) of the CTD fragment is amphipathic with an outer, solvent-accessible surface decorated with charged and hydrophilic residues Ser-162 and Thr-165 and Glu-168, -172, and -176. This feature suggests that the CTD fragment derived by proteolytic digestion of FANCF encompasses a complete domain of helical hairpin repeats and that helix α1 is solvent-exposed in full-length FANCF.

We have determined the crystal structures of eEF2 in complex with two novel sordarin derivatives. In both structures, the three domains of eEF2 that form the ligand-binding pocket are oriented in a different manner relative to the rest of eEF2 compared with our previous structure of eEF2 in complex with the parent natural product sordarin. Yeast eEF2 is also shown to bind adenylic nucleotides, which can be displaced by sordarin, suggesting that ADP or ATP also bind to the three C-terminal domains of eEF2. Fusidic acid is a universal inhibitor of translation that targets EF-G or eEF2 and is widely used as an antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria. Based on mutations conferring resistance to fusidic acid, cryo-EM reconstructions, and x-ray structures of eEF2, EF-G, and an EF-G homolog, we suggest that the conformation of EF-G stalled on the 70 S ribosome by fusidic acid is similar to that of eEF2 trapped on the 80 S ribosome by sordarin.

The elongation phase of translation consists of three steps (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 89-126Google Scholar). First, elongation factor 1A (eEF1A in eukaryotes and EF-Tu in prokaryotes) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site. Second, the peptidyl transferase activity within the large subunit of the ribosome catalyzes the rapid transfer of the peptidyl moiety from the peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosomal P-site to the aminoacyl-tRNA at the A-site with the formation of the peptide bond. Finally, the deacylated tRNA in the P-site and the peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site must be translocated to the E- and P-site, respectively. The mRNA must also translocate by exactly three bases to maintain the reading frame and expose the next codon in the decoding site of the small subunit. The translocation reaction is catalyzed by elongation factor 2 (eEF2 in eukaryotes and EF-G in prokaryotes). In fungi, an additional elongation factor, eEF3, is required to facilitate release of the deacylated tRNA from the E-site (2Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This may be considered as an extension to the normal translocation reaction, because it prepares the fungal 80 S ribosome for delivery of the next aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site. Although both eEF1A and eEF2 use the energy derived from GTP hydrolysis for function, the activity of eEF3 depends on its hydrolysis of ATP (3Uritani M. Miyazaki M. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1985; 16: 229-232Google Scholar). Translocation involves the coordinated movement of three macromolecules relative to the ribosome and is therefore likely to be rather complex. The mechanism of translocation is currently not well defined, although thorough kinetic studies of how EF-G promotes translocation on 70 S ribosomes have been conducted (4Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I.

Advanced kinetic studies of the eukaryotic system are currently lacking, but the fundamental mechanism is believed to be conserved between the kingdoms, and both the ribosome and the elongation factor have high structural homology. This has been confirmed by cryo-EM 3The abbreviations used are: cryo-EM, cryoelectron microscopy; GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotri phosphate). 3The abbreviations used are: cryo-EM, cryoelectron microscopy; GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotri phosphate). reconstructions of eEF2 in a sordarin-stabilized complex with the 80 S ribosome (8Gomez-Lorenzo M.G.

Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both antibiotics prevent the release of the elongation factor from the ribosome after translocation (11Justice M.C. Hsu M.J. Tse B. Ku T. Balkovec J. Schmatz D. Nielsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3148-3151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In both cases domain IV of eEF2/EF-G protrudes into the A-site of the small ribosomal subunit, and the location of the remaining domains is also quite similar for eEF2 and EF-G (9Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Agrawal R.K.

The function of EF-G/eEF2 appears to be dual, prior to translocation it promotes conformational changes within the pretranslocational ribosome-tRNA-mRNA complex, and after translocation it prevents peptidyl-tRNA from slipping back from the P-site. Conformational flexibility within EF-G is required for translation but apparently not for GTP hydrolysis (12Peske F. Matassova N.B. Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 501-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A detailed kinetic scheme has recently been derived for bacterial translocation (4Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Mohr D. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1517-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The main features of this are that GTP hydrolysis precedes a conformational change (unlocking) of the 70 S-EF-G complex required for translocation. In other studies, the state of the P-site tRNA is shown to govern the structural properties of the ribosome (5Zavialov A.V. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 114: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Valle M. Zavialov A. Sengupta J. Rawat U. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Cell. 2003; 114: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). When deacylated tRNA, but not peptidyl-tRNA, is present conformational changes within the small subunit and its rotation relative to the large subunit are induced upon binding of EF-G (13Valle M. Zavialov A. Sengupta J. Rawat U. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Cell. 2003; 114: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A similar rotation is observed when eEF2 binds to the 80 S ribosome (9Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Beckmann R. Penczek P.A. Ballesta J.P. Frank J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1008-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Potentially this rotation may contribute significantly to the physical movement of the two tRNA molecules, but several studies have also shown stringent requirements for the structural integrity of the two tRNA molecules to obtain efficient and in-frame translocation (reviewed in Ref. 14Joseph S. RNA. 2003; 9: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A model for the movement of tRNA during translocation based on crystal structures, hydroxyl radical probing, and RNase protection experiments (15Noller H.F. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Cate J.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggests that peptide bond formation induces movement of the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the classical A/A state to a hybrid A/P state, where the anticodon stemloop is still located in the 40 S A-site, whereas the acceptor stem and end is in the 60 S P-site. In the same manner, the deacylated tRNA has moved to the P/E hybrid state. The existence of the P/E state on the 70 S ribosome has been confirmed by cryo-EM (13Valle M. Zavialov A. Sengupta J. Rawat U. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. Cell. 2003; 114: 123-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), whereas only subtle movements of the peptidyl-tRNA have been observed so far by either cryo-EM or crystallography.

The biochemical mechanism of action underlying the antifungal activity of sordarin has been elucidated (11Justice M.C. Hsu M.J. Tse B. Ku T. Balkovec J. Schmatz D. Nielsen J. J. Biol.

Sordarins are selective inhibitors of fungal protein synthesis and impair the function of eEF2. The binding of sordarin to eEF2 is greatly enhanced in the presence of ribosomes. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have established that resistance to sordarin is conferred by mutations in eEF2 or the ribosomal stalk protein rpP0, although eEF2 is the principal determinant of sordarin specificity (11Justice M.C.

For example, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Cryptococcus neoformans are quite sensitive to these compounds, whereas Cryptococcus parapsilosis and Cryptococcus krusei are relatively insensitive. Growth inhibition and in vitro translation assays using chimeric Candida-S. cerevisiae eEF2 proteins expressed in S. cerevisiae, have identified three amino acid residues in the protein (Tyr521, Ser523, and Glu524 in yeast eEF2) that are critical determinants of the spectrum of antifungal activity of sordarin (23Shastry M.

Modified sordarins, including synthetic analogs such as GM 237354 (22Herreros E. Martinez C.M. Almela M.J. Marriott M.S. De Las Heras F.G. Gargallo-Viola D. Antimicrob.

In this report, we describe the crystal structures of eEF2 in complex with two modified sordarins, both of which induce a conformation within eEF2 that is quite distinct from that described earlier for eEF2 in the presence of sordarin (25Jørgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mammalian eEF2 has previously been shown to bind adenylic nucleotides in a site distinct from the well characterized binding site for GDP/GTP (26Gonzalo P. Sontag B. Lavergne J.P. Jault J.M. Reboud J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13558-13564Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We show that this is a universal feature of eEF2 and that sordarin can displace both ADP and ATP from eEF2. This suggests that either the binding site of sordarin overlaps with that of ADP/ATP or that sordarin induces a conformation in eEF2, which is incompatible with binding of ADP/ATP. Finally, we suggest that the conformation of EF-G on the prokaryotic ribosome targeted by fusidic acid is similar to that of the eEF2-sordarin complex on the eukaryotic ribosome. Structure Determination and Modeling—Purification and crystallization of eEF2 in complex with moriniafungin or compound 1 was done essentially as described (25Jørgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The antibiotics were solubilized in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and added to the concentrated eEF2 solution at a final concentration of 1-2 mg/ml prior to crystallization. The data were collected with synchrotron radiation to a maximum resolution of 2.9 Å for the eEF2-moriniafungin complex and 3.15 Å for the eEF2-compound 1 complex, and the data were processed with XDS (28Kabsch W. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar) (Table 1). The structures of the two complexes were solved by molecular replacement with Molrep (29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The refined eEF2-sordarin structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1N0U) was divided into two search models containing residues 3-482 and 483-842, respectively. For the eEF2-moriniafungin complex the asymmetric unit contains two molecules of eEF2, whereas only one molecule is present for the eEF2-compound 1 complex. Following molecular replacement, the solutions were improved with rigid body refinement followed by positional refinement and grouped B-factor refinement to yield the initial model. The starting eEF2-moriniafungin model was completed by iterative cycles of rebuilding using O (30Jones T.A. Cowan S. Zou J.-Y. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refinement with CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied domain-wise between the two copies until Rfree was below 30%. Harmonic restraints were imposed on the main chain atoms. The structure of the eEF2-compound 1 was completed in similar manner, but without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints because there is only one complex in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the structures was inspected with PRO-CHECK (32Laskowski R. MacArthur M.W. Mos D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and domain movements were analyzed with Dyn-Dom (33Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The coordinates and structure factors for both structures are deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entries 2NPF and 2E1R. All of the figures were created in PyMOL (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Modeling of EF-G conformations based on structures of eEF2 in complex with sordarins or the conformation of eEF2 observed by cryo-EM (9Spahn C.M. Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Grassucci R.A. Jorgensen R.

Diastereomers of compound 1 and moriniafungin were generated with an in-house distance geometry program based on published theory and algorithms (35Crippen C.M. Havel T.F.

NMR. 1992; 2: 33-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A distance-dependent dielectric model of 2r was employed for all minimizations. The atoms of eEF2 were held fixed except for side chain within 5 Å of the modeled ligand, which were allowed to minimize in conjunction with the ligand and energy-minimized with the Merck molecular force field (37Halgren T.A.

Open table in a new tab Measurement of Ligand Binding to Yeast eEF2—The binding of ADP, ATP, mant-ADP, mant-ATP, and sordarin to eEF2 was measured in 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm quartz cuvettes by the quenching of intrinsic protein (Trp) fluorescence of the protein as a function of ligand concentration. In the case of the unmodified nucleotides and sordarin, the Trp quenching was a direct mechanism caused by the binding of the ligand to the eEF2 protein. The basis for Trp quenching induced by the mantnucleotides was due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the Trp to the mant-chromophore conjugated to the nucleotides. Triplicate measurements were performed over a concentration range of 0-50 μm (adenine nucleotides) or 0-100 μm (sordarin) in the presence of 0.5 μm eEF2 at 25 °C in an initial volume of 600 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 8 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6). The samples were excited at 295 nm (5-nm band pass), and the fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 340 nm (5-nm band pass) in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Canada Inc.) for titration experiments or in a PTI Alphascan-2 fluorescence spectrometer for wavelength scanning experiments. The fluorescence signal for the titration experiments was collected and averaged for 15 s for each measurement. A cuvette containing buffer only was also titrated with the corresponding ligand, and the signal from this sample was subtracted from the protein-containing samples. The fluorescence intensity measurements were also corrected for the dilution factor resulting from the titration (total dilution factor was less than 5%). The KD for sordarin or adenine nucleotides binding to eEF2 was determined using the following equation as part of the nonlinear fitting function of Origin 6.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA): ΔFi/ΔFmax = ([ligand] × Bmax)/(KD + [ligand]), where ΔFi is the change in fluorescence intensity for each ligand concentration upon macromolecular association, ΔFmax is the maximum change in fluorescence intensity at saturation of the ligand-binding site within eEF2, KD is the dissociation constant for the binding of each ligand with eEF2, and Bmax is the total eEF2 concentration (number of binding sites). The mant-derivatives of adenine nucleotides were excited at 350 nm, and the emission was scanned from 360 to 650 nm. While possessing intrinsic antifungal activity that specifically targets eEF2, the parent natural product sordarin has limited spectrum of activity. In the current study we have determined the crystal structures of eEF2 in complex with two sordarin analogs (Fig. 1), both of which have improved potency and spectrum of fungal activity. Compound 1, an 11-chloro substituted analog of GM 237354 (22Herreros E. Martinez C.M. Almela M.J. Marriott M.S. De Las Heras F.G. Gargallo-Viola D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2863-2869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains a tetrahydrofuran ring with an exomethylene group fused at positions C-3′ and C-4′ of the sugar moiety of the sordarin molecule. Moriniafungin, a novel analog of sordarin isolated from the fungus Morinia pestalozzioides (24Basilio A. Justice M. Harris G. Bills G. Collado J. de la Cruz M. Diez M.T. Hernandez P. Liberator P. Nielsen-Kahn J. Pelaez F. Platas G. Schmatz D. Shastry M. Tormo J.R. Andersen G.R. Vicente F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), contains a 2-hydroxysebacic acid residue linked to the C-3′ of the sordarose moiety through a 1,3-dioxolan-4-one ring. To provide starting molecular models for fitting into the electron density for their respective complexes, we modeled both moriniafungin and compound 1 into the anti-fungal binding cleft in the eEF2-sordarin complex (25Jørgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The sordaricin aglycone core common to sordarin, moriniafungin, and compound 1 provided the initial docking. For both moriniafungin and compound 1, alternative possible conformers were studied while maintaining the initial core superposition and maximizing interactions between eEF2 and the additional substituents that differentiate these compounds from sordarin. This was trivially accomplished for compound 1 by fusing its tetrahydrofuran ring onto the terminal sugar of the crystallographic coordinates for sordarin. Moriniafungin was more problematic because of the flexible nature of the substituent as well as the unknown stereochemistry at two stereocenters. Ultimately, the two diastereomers of the 1,3-dioxolan-4-one in agreement with the NMR data, the C3′(R)/C-2″(S) (R/S) and C3′(S)/C-2″(R) (S/R) configurations (24Basilio A. Justice M. Harris G. Bills G. Collado J. de la Cruz M. Diez M.T. Hernandez P. Liberator P. Nielsen-Kahn J. Pelaez F. Platas G. Schmatz D. Shastry M. Tormo J.R. Andersen G.R. Vicente F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were modeled into the binding pocket. For each diastereomer, 150 conformations were generated, energy-minimized, rigidly superposed onto the sordarin core structure, and evaluated by complementarity to the binding cavity. Upon positioning of the conformers for the two possible diastereomers of moriniafungin onto the sordarin template, it was apparent that the preponderance of the conformers for the octanylic acid moiety of the S/R diastereomer were in an equatorial relationship with the sordarose ring, whereas those of the R/S diastereomer were axially situated. Approximately 30 representative conformers for each diastereomer were energy-minimized within the context of the binding cavity (37Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chemistry. 1999; 20: 730-748Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The lowest energy conformers of the S/R diastereomer that had the greatest interaction energy with eEF2 fit the octanylic acid moiety into a surface groove situated between the side chains of Gln795 and Val797 with the acid exposed to solvent. On the other hand, the lowest energy conformers of the R/S diastereomer filled the pore beneath the sugar moiety with the octanylic linker extending through the hydrophobic region created primarily by the side chains of Met796, Val488, and Gln490. Because such a location for the octanylic acid matched the electron density for the eEF2-moriniafungin complex, the R/S diastereomer was used for model building. The structure of the eEF2-moriniafungin complex was determined to a maximum resolution of 2.9 Å (Table 1). There are only minor structural differences between the two copies in the asymmetric unit. In contrast to the structure of either eEF2-sordarin or ADP-ribosylated eEF2-sordarin, which both had p21212 symmetry (38Jorgensen R. Yates S.P. Teal D.J. Nilsson J. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Andersen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45919-45925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the space group for the eEF2-moriniafungin complex is p21. For the eEF2-compound 1 structure there is only one complex in the asymmetric unit and the space group p21212 with cell parameters related to those of eEF2-sordarin. Despite these differences in the crystal parameters for moriniafungin and compound 1, the two resulting structures are quite similar. The crystal packings within the crystals of eEF2-compound 1 and eEF2-moriniafungin do contain common elements, but many other packing interactions are not conserved between the two systems. This, combined with the similar unit cell parameters of eEF2-compound 1 and the original eEF2-sordarin structure, makes it likely that the novel conformation of eEF2 is not induced by similarities in the crystal packing for the two new structures. Instead, the conformational differences probably reflect an intrinsic conformation of eEF2 that is trapped by either of the two sordarin derivatives. However, we cannot completely exclude the effects of crystal packing. Compared with our previous structure of eEF2-sordarin, these two new structures have an eEF2 conformation in which domains III, IV, and V are rotated by 25° relative to domains I, G′, and II (Fig. 2). The overall dimensions of this new conformation are 135 × 74 × 57 Å compared with 125 × 83 × 55 Å for the structure of eEF2-sordarin. The electron densities for both moriniafungin and compound 1 allow unambiguous placement of all nonhydrogen atoms (Fig. 3, B and C). The overall location of moriniafungin and compound 1 bound to eEF2 is very close to that previously observed for sordarin. The tetracyclic diterpene is held in a pocket formed by residues from domains III, IV, and V of eEF2, whereas the substituents are recognized by residues in domains III and V only (Fig. 3, D-F). Interactions between the sordarins and eEF2 involve, in all three cases, both van der Waals' interactions and hydrogen bonds. Two hydrogen bonds are consistently formed from the diterpene carboxylic group and the hydroxylic group to main chain nitrogens in Glu524 and Val561 in eEF2, respectively. In both eEF2-sordarin and eEF2-moriniafungin, a third hydrogen bond is also formed between the pyran group and the oxaspiro group to the main chain nitrogen"

A homology model of the three-dimensional structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme complexed with ADP-Glc has been generated to study the substrate-binding site in detail. A set of amino acids in the model has been identified to be in close proximity to the glucose moiety of the ADP-Glc ligand. The role of these amino acids (Glu194, Ser212, Tyr216, Asp239, Phe240, Trp274, and Asp276) was studied by site-directed mutagenesis through the characterization of the kinetic properties and thermal stability of the designed mutants. All purified alanine mutants had 1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower apparent affinity for Glc-1-P compared with the wild type, indicating that the selected set of amino acids plays an important role in their interaction with the substrate. These amino acids, which are conserved within the ADP-Glc PPase family, were replaced with other residues to investigate the effect of size, hydrophobicity, polarity, aromaticity, or charge on the affinity for Glc-1-P. In this study, the architecture of the Glc-1-P-binding site is characterized. The model overlaps with the Glc-1-P site of other PPases such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa dTDP-Glc PPase and Salmonella typhi CDP-Glc PPase. Therefore, the data reported here may have implications for other members of the nucleotide-diphosphoglucose PPase family.

The biosynthetic pathways of starch and bacterial glycogen are very similar (1Preiss J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 419-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The initial and key regulatory step is the formation of the glucosyl donor molecule ADP-Glc from ATP and Glc-1-P via a reaction catalyzed by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (PPase 4The abbreviation used is: PPase, pyrophosphorylase. 4The abbreviation used is: PPase, pyrophosphorylase.; glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.27), with the requirement of a divalent cation (Mg2+): ATP + Glc-1-P ← Mg2+ → ADP-Glc + PPi. Most ADP-Glc PPases are allosterically regulated by small effector molecules. Although these vary according to the source, they are all intermediates of the principal carbon assimilation pathway in the respective cell (2Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Biochem. Educ. 1992; 20: 196-203Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh H.P. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4491-4504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Preiss J. Sivak M.N. Pinto B.M.

Thus, bacterial glycogen and plant starch syntheses are not modulated only by the availability of ATP but also by the accumulation of key metabolites that represent the carbon and energy balance within the cell. For instance, the enzymes from heterotrophic bacteria such as Escherichia coli are regulated by intermediates of the glycolytic pathway, with Fru-1,6-P2 as the main activator and AMP as the main inhibitor. On another hand, the ADP-Glc PPases from cells performing oxygenic photosynthesis and assimilating atmospheric CO2 through the reductive pentose phosphate pathway or the Calvin cycle (specifically cyanobacteria, green algae, and photosynthetic tissues from higher plants) are activated by 3-phosphoglycerate and inhibited by Pi (6Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A.

The native enzyme is a homotetramer, similar to the bacterial enzyme, but is regulated by 3-phosphoglycerate and Pi, like the plant enzyme, and is also immunologically more related to the plant enzyme (13Iglesias A.A.

They also reported the structural determination of the enzyme complexed with either ATP or ADP-Glc at 2.6 and 2.2 Å, respectively. Attempts to obtain information on the E. coli enzyme structure through x-ray crystallography were unsuccessful. The potato tuber small subunit has only ∼33% sequence identity to the E. coli enzyme, but the similar predicted secondary structure profile, together with available biochemical data, suggests that they share a common three-dimensional fold (5Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 1058-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis (16Hill M.A. Kaufmann K. Otero J. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12455-12460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies on E. coli ADP-Glc PPase identified Lys195 as an important residue for Glc-1-P interaction. Replacement with other amino acids generated 100-10,000-fold increases in the S0.5 for this substrate, with all other kinetic constants at wild-type levels. Later, Fu et al. (17Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported similar results from analysis of the homologous Lys198 in the potato tuber catalytic subunit. The proposed role of this amino acid is to form an ionic bond between the ϵ-amino group and the negatively charged phosphate of Glc-1-P. Results with Hex-1-P analogs, which differ from Glc-1-P in their hydroxyl groups, suggest that other residues in the active site participate in substrate binding. Our aim was to obtain structural information on E. coli ADP-Glc PPase by building a homology model and to probe a set of highly conserved residues in the N-terminal domain possibly involved in Glc-1-P binding. We studied the role of Glu194, Ser212, Tyr216, Asp239, Phe240, Trp274, and Asp276 by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic characterization of the mutant enzymes and their thermal stability. All residues were replaced with alanine and other amino acids to evaluate the importance of size, charge, or hydrophobicity on the effects observed in substrate interaction. Because these residues are highly conserved among ADP-Glc PPases, it was of interest to investigate whether they are present in other PPases that use Glc-1-P as a substrate. The observations made by comparison of the putative Glc-1-P site from our E. coli ADP-Glc PPase model and the reported crystal structures of two pyrophosphorylases, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa dTDP-Glc PPase Rm1A (18Blankenfeldt W.

Plasmid pMAB3 containing the E. coli ADP-Glc PPase gene between NdeI and SacI sites, previously obtained in our laboratory, 5M. A. Ballicora and J. Preiss, unpublished data. was used as a template. The flanking primers, which annealed with the T7 promoter and the SacI site (underlined) were 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and 5′-GATATCTGAATTCGAGCTC-3′, respectively. The overlapping primers for each mutant are depicted in supplemental Table 1. The final PCR products were gel-purified, digested with NdeI and SacI, and subcloned to obtain the different pMAB3-single mutant plasmids. Plasmid pETEC-NΔ15-D276N was obtained using pETEC-NΔ15 (39Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a template, with the T7 promoter and T7 terminator as flanking primers and the same mutated overlapping primers used for pMAB3-D276N (supplemental Table 1). All plasmids were sequenced at the Genomics Facility of Michigan State University to confirm incorporation of only the desired mutation. E. coli AC70R1-504 cells lacking endogenous ADP-Glc PPase activity were used for expression of the wild-type and pMAB3-mutant enzymes as described previously for pML10 (35Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). EcNΔ15-D276N was expressed as EcNΔ15 (39Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One-liter cultures of AC70R1-504 cells transformed with the pMAB3-single mutant plasmids or BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pETEC-NΔ15-D276N were grown in 25 μg/ml kanamycin/Luria broth (1 liter) at 37 °C up to A600 = 0.8. Induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration), with subsequent incubation at 25 °C for 16 h. After induction, cells were harvested, and crude extracts were obtained as described previously (35Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% sucrose). The samples were individually applied to a DEAE-Fractogel column (EMD Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled and desalted. After this step, samples were 60-70% pure and suitable for performing kinetic analysis. Mutants E194A/Q/D, D276A/N, W274A, Y216F, and D239N were resuspended in buffer B (buffer A plus 1.2 m ammonium sulfate); applied to a phenyl-Superose fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B; and eluted with a linear gradient of 1.2 to 0.001 m ammonium sulfate. Further purification of the rest of the mutants and the wild type was performed by applying the DEAE pool samples to a Matrex™ gel green A affinity chromatography column (Amicon Corp.) and eluting with a linear gradient of 0-2 m NaCl. The purest fractions of each enzyme were pooled, desalted, and concentrated; and after these steps, the proteins were >95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Protein assay, electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and immunoblotting were performed following protocols described previously (40Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46319-46325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples were desalted and concentrated with Centricon-30 devices (Amicon Corp.). Assay A: Pyrophosphorolysis Direction—Formation of [32P]ATP from [32P]PPi was determined by the method of Morell et al. (41Morell M.K. Bloom M. Knowles V. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1987; 85: 182-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in a mixture containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm [32P]PPi (1500-2500 dpm/nmol), 4 mm ADP-Glc, 4 mm NaF, 2 mm Fru-1,6-P2, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin plus enzyme in a total volume of 0.25 ml. Assay B: Synthesis Direction—Formation of ADP-[14C]Glc from [14C]Glc-1-P was determined by the method of Yep et al. (42Yep A. Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Dubay J.R. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C in a mixture containing [14C]Glc-1-P (∼400 dpm/nmol), ATP, MgCl2, and Fru-1,6-P2 at varying concentrations according to the mutant enzyme assay; 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0); 1.5 units/ml pyrophosphatase; and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin plus enzyme in a total volume of 0.20 ml. One unit of enzyme activity is 1 μmol of product (either [32P]ATP or ADP-[14C]Glc) formed per min at 37 °C. Kinetic data were plotted as specific activity (units/mg) versus substrate or effector concentration. Kinetic constants were acquired by fitting the data to the Hill equation with a nonlinear least-square formula using Origin™ Version 5.0. Hill plots were used to calculate the Hill coefficient and the kinetic constants corresponding to the substrate or activator concentrations giving 50% of the maximal velocity (S0.5) or activation (A0.5). Enzyme samples were in buffer A supplemented with bovine serum albumin to 1 mg/ml in a final volume of 100 μl. Half of the sample (50 μl) was incubated in a water bath equilibrated at 60 °C for 5 min and placed on ice immediately after. The remaining half (50 μl) was kept on ice as a control. The enzyme activities for both the heat-treated and control samples were determined in the ADP-Glc synthesis direction as described for Assay B. Homology Modeling—We obtained a three-dimensional model of E. coli ADP-Glc PPase by comparative modeling using the coordinates of the recently solved crystal structure of the potato tuber ADP-Glc PPase small subunit (Protein Data Bank code 1YP2) as a template as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). Although modeling is generally guaranteed to be successful if residue identity is >40%, for lower percentages, errors can be reduced employing an accurate sequence alignment (43Sánchez R. Sali A. Webster D.M. Protein Structure Prediction: Methods and Protocols. 143. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 97-129Google Scholar, 44Sánchez R. Sali A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 45Tramontano A. Methods (San Diego). 1998; 14: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our two enzymes shared only 33% residue identity; therefore, the alignment was manually edited, incorporating information such as conservation of functional residues and prediction of secondary structures. Using MODELLER6 Version 1, we generated 143 models after several iterative refinements of the alignment to accommodate gaps, deletions, and insertions of the query sequence with respect to the template in the best possible way. We assessed the models with the program VERIFY_3D (23Luthy R. Bowie J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 24Bowie J. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” which evaluates the compatibility of a given residue (1D) in a certain environment (3D). A score below zero for a given residue means that the conformation adopted by that residue in the model is not compatible with its surrounding environment. In our study, we considered only those models with all 1D-3D averaged scores above zero; and among them, we chose the one with a profile most similar to that generated by the template crystal structure (Fig. 1B). The two profiles followed the same general trend except for two specific regions, both corresponding to residues located in or adjacent to loops not present in the template structure (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1A). The first, encompassing Phe90-Glu97 in the E. coli enzyme, aligns with a region in the potato tuber enzyme that is disordered in the crystal structure. The second loop, containing Lys259-Pro271, is an insertion in the bacterial enzyme. Therefore, the final conformation of these two loops in the model, which might also affect immediately adjacent secondary structures, accounted for the differences from the template structure profile. According to the model, these loops are not part of the active site, and they do not contain important conserved residues. In agreement with our previous biochemical results (46Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Gómez Casati D.F. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the modeled monomer shows a two-domain structural organization (Fig. 1A). The N terminus of ∼300 residues presents a β-α-β motif arranged in an open twisted β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. It resembles the Rossmann fold, typically present in nucleotide-binding domains (47Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.-I. Bansazak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). Residues important for catalysis, Asp142 (40Frueauf J.B. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46319-46325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and for substrate binding, Tyr114 for ATP (48Kumar A. Tanaka T. Lee Y.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14634-14639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lys195 for Glc-1-P (16Hill M.A. Kaufmann K. Otero J. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12455-12460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are located in the active-site pocket in close proximity to the ADP-Glc molecule (Fig. 1C), observations that further validate the quality of our model. The C terminus is a separate domain folded as a β-helix and linked to the N terminus by a long loop. The two domains are in intimate interaction through extensive hydrophobic contacts, supporting the requirement of a full-length polypeptide to obtain normal enzyme activity and regulation (46Bejar C.M. Ballicora M.A. Gómez Casati D.F. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Selection of Residues for Analysis—The three-dimensional model complexed with ADP-Glc shows the ligand placed in a well defined pocket in the active site (Fig. 1A), and several direct interactions between the ligand and the enzyme are evident (Fig. 2). Lys195 makes a salt bridge with the glucose phosphate, an interaction that has been biochemically probed by Hill et al. (16Hill M.A. Kaufmann K. Otero J. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12455-12460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in E. coli ADP-Glc PPase and by Fu et al. (17Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in their analysis of the homologous residue (Lys198) in the potato tuber enzyme. Additionally, the hydroxyl groups of the glucosyl moiety of the ligand are involved in a complex network of hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. The side chains of Glu194, Asp276, and Ser212 and the backbone of the latter participate in such interactions. We performed a multiple sequence alignment using the catalytic subunits of 15 ADP-Glc PPases from several sources, each of them representative of a different taxonomic group. Fig. 3 depicts part of the aligned sequences, comprising residues located in and around the putative Glc-1-P-binding domain in the N terminus of the protein. The residues that, in the model, appear to interact through hydrogen bonds with the glucosyl moiety of the ligand are absolutely conserved among all ADP-Glc PPases analyzed, suggesting that they are involved in a conserved role such as substrate binding. According to our structural model, other conserved residues in this region are also located in the substrate-binding pocket. Based on our observations, we selected Tyr216, Asp239, Phe240, and Trp274 to be characterized together with Glu194, Ser212, and As"
https://openalex.org/W2042864892,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) serves as a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) only when bound to lipid. The N-terminal domain of lipid-free apoE exists as globular 4-helix bundle that is conferred with LDLR recognition ability after undergoing a lipid binding-induced conformational change. To investigate the structural basis for this phenomenon, site-directed spin label electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments were conducted, focusing on the region near the C-terminal end of helix 4 (Ala-164). Using C112S apoE-N-terminal as template, a series of single cysteine substitution variants (at sequence positions 161, 165, 169, 173, 176, and 181) were produced, isolated, and labeled with the nitroxide probe, methane thiosulfonate. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that lipid association induced fixed secondary structure in a region of the molecule known to exist as random coil in the lipid-free state. In a complementary approach, site-directed fluorescence analysis using an environmentally sensitive probe indicated that the lipid-induced transition of this region of the protein to α helix was accompanied by relocation to a more hydrophobic environment. In studies with full-length apoE single Cys variants, a similar random coil to stable backbone transition was observed, consistent with the concept that lipid interaction induced an extension of helix 4 beyond the boundary defining its lipid-free conformation. This structural transition likely represents a key conformational change necessary for manifestation of the LDLR recognition properties of apoE.

Conversely, mice overexpressing apoE display a marked regression of atherosclerotic lesions and resistance to diet-induced atherosclerosis (5Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L.

ApoE3, the most common isoform, bears a Cys and Arg at these positions, respectively. ApoE is composed of two independently folded structural domains that are linked by a protease sensitive loop (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Dong J. Balestra M.E. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2576-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 22-kDa N-terminal (NT) domain bears amino acids critical for LDLR binding, whereas the 10-kDa C-terminal domain manifests high lipid binding affinity and is responsible for apoE self-association in the absence of lipid. X-ray crystallography of apoE3-NT reveals a 4-helix bundle molecular architecture (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The classical LDLR recognition sequence encompasses a cluster of positively charged amino acids in the region of residues 134-150 on helix 4 of the N-terminal domain (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another positively charged residue, Arg-72, has also been implicated in LDLR binding (8Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Dong J. Balestra M.E. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2576-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, lipid association appears to be an essential prerequisite for apoE binding to LDLR. Interestingly, full-length apoE and the NT domain are equivalent in terms of LDLR binding ability (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstituted apoE (full-length or NT domain) phospholipid disks possess full receptor binding activity and provide a convenient model for studies of the lipid-associated conformation of apoE. Infrared spectroscopy studies show that helical segments in apoE3-NT domain align perpendicular to phospholipid fatty acyl chains around the perimeter of bilayer disk complexes (10Raussens V.

In fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies it has been reported that apoE3-NT adopts an extended conformation wherein the molecule aligns in tandem with a second apoE3-NT around the perimeter of the disk (11Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Spin labeled fatty acids and single tryptophan variants were used to show that apoE3-NT and full-length apoE adopt similar extended conformations (13Narayanaswami V. Maiorano J.N. Dhanasekaran P. Ryan R.O. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14273-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In another approach, a peptide corresponding to apoE residues 126-183 was generated that possessed lipid and LDLR binding activity (14Raussens V. Mah M. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Multidimensional NMR studies of apoE (126-183) associated with dodecylphosphocholine micelles revealed that residues known to exist as random coil in the lipid-free state adopt helical structure in the presence of lipid (15Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25998-26006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Questions emerging from these studies relate to whether the lipid-induced random coil to α-helix transition of this 58-residue peptide fragment also applies to apoE-NT or full-length apoE. To address this question we employed site-directed spin label-electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) spectroscopy to investigate the effect of lipid interaction on spin label probes positioned at regular intervals between amino acids 161 and 181 in apoE-NT (see Fig. 1) and full-length apoE. The data reveal that lipid association induces residues beyond Ala-164 (the termination site of helix 4 in lipid-free apoE) to transition from random coil to a more stable backbone. We conclude that the molecular basis for the divergent behavior of lipid-free and lipid-bound apoE in terms of LDLR binding is related to lipid binding-induced extension of helical structure beyond its termination site in the helix bundle state. Production and Bacterial Expression of apoE Variants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions, and all mutations were verified by dideoxy automated DNA sequencing. ApoE3-NT and full-length variants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with an apoE-pET-20b plasmid with His tag and purified on a Hi-Trap chelating nickel column from GE Healthcare as described (16Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 1: 98-103Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on precast 4-20% acrylamide gradient SDS gels (Invitrogen) at 30-mA constant current and stained with Coomassie Blue. Nitroxide-labeled apoE—Spin labeling was carried out as described earlier (17Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mg of apoE in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3 m guanidine-HCl, and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol was loaded onto a Hi-Trap column. The column was then washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A containing 3 m guanidine-HCl and 100 μm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride followed by three column volumes of buffer A containing 3 m guanidine-HCl plus 160 μm methane thiosulfonate (MTS) and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C. The column was then washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A and protein eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole. Eluted protein was dialyzed to remove imidazole and stored at 4 °C. ApoE·phospholipid Complexes—Dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC)-apoE disks were prepared as described earlier (18Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, DMPC was dissolved in chloroform:methanol (3:1 v/v) and dried into a thin film in a glass tube. Following dispersion of the DMPC in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 (TBS), MTS-labeled apoE variants were added (2.5:1 DMPC/apoE weight ratio). This mixture was subjected to bath sonication until clear. Solubilized apoE·DMPC complexes were dialyzed against TBS and stored at 4 °C until use. Native PAGE of DMPC·apoE complexes was performed to evaluate the size of lipoprotein complexes. For UV circular dichroism spectroscopy, analysis of apoE-NT single cysteine variants was conducted on a Jasco-710 spectropolarimeter maintained at 24 °C. The results indicated that α-helix content was not adversely affected by probe attachment. Furthermore, with each variant examined, association with DMPC induced a 2-12% increase in α-helix content. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Measurements—EPR spectra were recorded at 22 °C in TBS buffer on a JEOL-X band spectrometer equipped with a loop gap resonator in a single scan over 100 G as described earlier (17Oda M.N. Forte T.M. Ryan R.O. Voss J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The microwave power was set at 2 milliwatts, and the modulation amplitude was set at 1 G. C112S apoE-NT served as a control for MTS labeling. EPR spectroscopy of this protein yielded no signal, confirming the specificity of label incorporation. LDLR Binding Assay—The ability of variant apoE-NT to interact with recombinant human LDLR was evaluated as described by Yamamoto et al. (19Yamamoto T. Lamoureux J. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1091-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, C112S apoE-NT (3 μg protein (lipid free or DMPC bound)) was pre-incubated for 5 min with 4 μg of recombinant LDLR (residues 1-699) followed by the addition of 1 μg of tryptophan-null apoE-NT·DMPC that was labeled on Cys-112 with the fluorescent probe, N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (AEDANS). The mixtures were incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 2 mm CaCl2, 90 mm NaCl at 25 °C for 1 h prior to fluorescence analysis. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C on a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer as described (19Yamamoto T. Lamoureux J. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1091-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In other experiments, specified single Cys substitution variants of C112S apoE-NT were labeled with AEDANS, and fluorescence emission spectra of the labeled variants (∼5 μg of protein) were recorded in lipid-free or lipid-bound state as described earlier (20Narayanaswami V. Szeto S.S.W. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 345 nm and the fluorescence emission spectra acquired between 350 and 600 nm, with a slit width of 3.5 nm. Study Design and Rationale—To investigate the hypothesis that lipid association induces residues beyond the termination site in helix 4 to adopt a helical conformation that confers LDLR recognition properties, SDSL-EPR studies were designed. Initially, Cys-112 in apoE3-NT was substituted with serine. This conservative substitution was necessary to permit subsequent specific labeling of the engineered cysteines. Prior to introducing new cysteine mutations, C112S apoE-NT was expressed and characterized in terms of secondary structure and its LDLR binding activity. Far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the secondary structure content of the protein was unaffected by the C112S mutation. Furthermore, expected increases (13Narayanaswami V. Maiorano J.N. Dhanasekaran P. Ryan R.O. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14273-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in negative ellipticity were noted for spectra obtained in the presence of the helix inducing co-solvent trifluoroethanol (50% v/v) or when present as DMPC disks (data not shown). The results of LDLR binding assays (Fig. 2) revealed that, whereas lipid-free C112S apoE-NT is a poor competitor ligand, upon association with DMPC, this variant manifests LDLR binding activity equivalent to wild type (WT) apoE3-NT. Based on these results, C112S apoE-NT was used as a template to generate a series of single cysteine substitution apoE variants that were then labeled with MTS and subjected to EPR spectroscopy in their lipid-free and lipid-bound states. Characterization of Single Cysteine Variants—Single cysteine apoE-NT variants, including V161C, G165C, G169C, G173C, A176C, and L181C, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel revealed a single band whose migration properties were indistinguishable from that of WT apoE3-NT (Fig. 3a). A corresponding gel electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3b) revealed the presence of significant amounts of disulfide-linked homodimers in WT apoE3-NT and the different cysteine substitution variants. As expected, C112S apoE-NT did not show evidence of dimer formation. The dimer band present in each of the cysteine substitution mutants migrated faster than WT apoE3-NT dimer. This may be related to the fact that Cys-112 was located in a more central region of the 4-helix bundle, and upon disulfide formation, dimers were less able to fully extend in the presence of SDS compared with variants with a cysteine in closer proximity to the C terminus of the protein. Cysteine residues in different apoE-NT variants were then labeled with MTS, reconstituted into DMPC disks, and characterized by nondenaturing pore limiting gradient PAGE (Fig. 4). The gel indicates that C112S apoE-NT and MTS-labeled apoE-NT variants associated with DMPC to form lipid complexes of similar size (∼17 nm). ApoE3-NT-DMPC particles of this size were previously reported to possess between 4 and 6 apoE molecules per disk complex (12Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Native PAGE of apoE-NT·DMPC complexes.

Representative EPR spectra of lipid-free (black) and lipid-bound (red) apoE-NT variants spin-labeled at positions 161, 165, 169, 173, 176, and 181 are shown. In the lipid-free state, apoE-NT-bearing spin labels at positions 173, 176, and 181 display similar narrow-lined spectra. This is typical of spin labels undergoing rapid tumbling motion and is indicative of a dynamic and unstructured state for the backbone of these residues. In contrast, the EPR spectrum of lipid-free apoE-NT spin labeled at position 161 displays a broadened spectrum, indicative of a site located along a region of fixed secondary structure. Introducing a spin label at this position served as a positive control because x-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that residue 161 forms part of helix 4, which encompasses residues 130-164 (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The spectrum obtained for this variant, which reveals an immobilized residue in a surface helical location, establishes the validity of this approach (21Hubbell W.L. Calfiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). ApoE-NT spin-labeled at position 165 displays a similar line shape, suggesting a relatively structured helical state for this site. The spectrum of apoE-NT spin-labeled at position 169 reveals a small extent of narrowing of spectral line shape, suggesting a more flexible, unstructured state, intermediate between that observed for residues 165 and 173. Upon lipid interaction, there was a dramatic alteration in the EPR spectral line shapes of all variants, which was particularly evident with labels at positions 173, 176, and 181. The observed line broadening is a characteristic feature of immobilized structures, consistent with stable interaction of these sites with the lipid substrate. Interestingly, the broad splitting in the spectrum of apoE-NT labeled at position 176 is indicative of a strongly immobilized side chain, suggesting this position may represent a point of stable tertiary or quaternary contact in the lipid-bound state. Fluorescence Studies of apoE-NT Variants—To obtain independent verification that labeled residues transitioned to a more hydrophobic environment when the molecule was complexed with DMPC, fluorescence studies were performed. ApoE-NT single cysteine variants were labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorescence probe, AEDANS (22Hudson I.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and emission spectra of lipid-free and lipid-bound proteins recorded. With the exception of position 161, lipid association induced a blue shift in wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission (λmax) compared with corresponding spectra obtained in the lipid-free state (Table 1). The observed 14-nm red shift, upon lipid association, is consistent with data on the apoE (126-183) peptide. In the lipid-associated state, this residue was located on the polar face of the amphipathic α helix. In the case of G165C and G169C apoE-NT, the shift was relatively small (∼3 nm). On the other hand, the spectra of AEDANS-labeled A176C and L181C displayed a blue shift of 12-17 nm in the λmax upon association with DMPC. Thus, modified residues that adopted helical secondary structure upon lipid association also transitioned to a more hydrophobic environment.TABLE 1Fluorescence properties of AEDANS-labeled apoE-NT variantsApoE-NT variantaAll apoE-NT variants also contain C112S substitutionAEDANS λmaxbFluorescence spectra were recorded in TBS, pH 7.4 following excitation at 345 nm, with a slit width of 3.5 nm for excitation and emission monochromators. λmax is the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emissionLipid-freeDMPC-boundnmV161C468482G165C473470G169C469466A176C483471L181C483466a All apoE-NT variants also contain C112S substitutionb Fluorescence spectra were recorded in TBS, pH 7.4 following excitation at 345 nm, with a slit width of 3.5 nm for excitation and emission monochromators. λmax is the wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission Open table in a new tab EPR Analysis of Full-length apoE Variants—A question emerging from studies with the NT domain of apoE is whether results obtained can be extended to the full-length protein. To address this, full-length C112S apoE containing the same single Cys substitutions were spin-labeled and analyzed by EPR (Fig. 6). For each of the labeled variants examined, the spectral line shapes observed in buffer, as well as their response to lipid interaction, were similar to those observed for apoE-NT variants. These data suggest that secondary structure (or lack thereof) in this region of the protein is not substantially influenced by the C-terminal domain, consistent with the concept of independently folded N- and C-terminal domains initially proposed by Weisgraber and coworkers (23Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of apoE as a regulator of plasma cholesterol has been attributed to its ability to bind LDLR family members. Previous studies have mapped the classical LDLR binding site of apoE to the region encompassing residues 134-150 (7Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using various deletion mutants, it has been shown that residues 171-183 are also critical for manifestation of the LDLR binding activity of apoE (25Lalazar A. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8447-8450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Morrow et al. (8Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Dong J. Balestra M.E. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2576-2580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) determined that mutating Arg-172 results in loss of LDLR binding activity. Because lipid-free apoE also lacks LDLR binding activity, it is presumed that lipid association induces a change in the alignment or secondary structure of this residue such that it adopts a configuration appropriate for receptor interaction. The concept that correct presentation of positively charged amino acid side chains of apoE to ligand binding repeats of the LDLR is supported by the recent results (26Fisher C. Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By x-ray crystallography, it has been demonstrated that binding of an alternative ligand, the receptor associated protein to a two module segment of LDLR involves two docking sites wherein conserved, calcium coordinated acidic residues interact with positively charged amino acids in the receptor associated protein. In addition, binding avidity was shown to be regulated by interaction of ligands with more than one binding module, suggesting a general mechanism for binding of other basic ligands to LDLR family members. The present results are consistent with the concept that lipid association-induced extension of helix 4 modulates receptor binding avidity by facilitating interaction of the region of apoE encompassing residues 130-180 with multiple ligand binding modules. These observations are also in keeping with studies of a 58-residue apoE-derived peptide that encompasses apoE amino acids 126-183. Although this peptide is unstructured in solution, it adopts an extended α-helix conformation in the presence of the lipid mimetic co-solvent, trifluoroethanol (27Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Ryan R.O. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or when complexed to dodecylphosphocholine micelles (15Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25998-26006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At the same time, however, an alternative model of lipid-bound apoE has emerged recently (28Peters-Libeu C.A. Newhouse Y. Hatters D.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1073-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the basis of x-ray crystallography studies of apoE·dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine complexes, it was proposed that residues between 160 and 170 formed a hairpin loop that allowed for alignment of Arg-172 with the main receptor binding site (residues 142-149). In this manner, it is conceivable that a single apoE molecule could interact optimally with one LDLR ligand binding module. Whereas EPR spectra of apoE variants harboring spin labels at positions 161, 165, and 169 are consistent with an extended structure such as that reported earlier (13Narayanaswami V. Maiorano J.N. Dhanasekaran P. Ryan R.O. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14273-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the model reported in Ref. 28Peters-Libeu C.A. Newhouse Y. Hatters D.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1073-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar is also compatible with the data. In comparing models, however, it is important to consider differences in the respective experimental systems. For example, the present study was conducted using bilayer disk complexes of DMPC and apoE, whereas Peters-Libeu et al. (28Peters-Libeu C.A. Newhouse Y. Hatters D.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1073-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) studied spheroidal complexes generated using dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, in contrast to the present study, which employed an apoE3-like isoform, Peters-Libeu et al. (27Raussens V. Slupsky C.M. Ryan R.O. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29172-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) used the apoE4 isoform. Given that the structure and function of this isoform is profoundly influenced by N- and C-terminal domain interactions (29Drury J. Narayanaswami V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14605-14610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Hatters D.M. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

A. 2006; 103: 5644-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that apoE4 adopts an isoform-specific lipid-bound conformation. Further studies are required to explain isoform-specific differences in lipid-associated apoE. It is well known that residues beyond amino acid 164 are poorly defined in the electron density map of lipid-free apoE3-NT (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Our SDSL-EPR studies, however, provide evidence that amino acid residues at positions 165 and 169 retain some helical character in buffer alone. Beyond position 169, however, apoE exists as random structure in solution. Upon lipidation significant increases in the α-helix structure at each of the sites examined was observed, as illustrated by the substantial EPR spectral line shape changes. Thus, these sites and the region of 173-181, in particular, represent useful markers for lipid-binding events associated with apoE function. Although the precise structural organization of lipid-associated, LDLR active apoE is not known, available data are consistent with the following concept: lipid-free apoE is attracted to the surface of circulating lipoproteins by the high lipid binding affinity of the C-terminal domain. Once bound to the lipoprotein particle surface, the NT helix bundle can either retain its receptor inactive helix bundle conformation or undergo a conformational change (32Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40949-40954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Perugini M.A. Schuck P. Howlett G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5939-5949Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that results in stable contact with the lipid surface and manifestation of LDLR binding. It is possible that the NT domain reversibly transitions between an open, receptor-active conformation and a receptor-inactive helix bundle state although anchored to the lipoprotein surface via its C-terminal domain. Such a scenario suggests a molecular mechanism for regulation of lipoprotein clearance based on the conformational status of the NT domain. A key question remaining relates to why, in the absence of lipid, apoE-NT domain adopts a 4-helix bundle in which helix 4 terminates at residue 164. Although is seems very likely that folding of the domain into a globular 4-helix bundle affords considerable stability via hydrophobic helix-helix interactions, it has also been reported that the region of apoE around residue 165 conforms to a classical Schellman helix cap motif (35Schellman C.

If the termination of helix 4 in apoE is the result of a helix cap motif, then it is possible that lipid interaction induces a disruption of the cap motif, promoting extension of the helix and subsequent alignment of key positively charged residues for optimal interaction with ligand binding modules of the LDLR.

Unwilling to wait and hope for a cure, patients suffering from rare or little-studied diseases and their families are galvanizing research efforts and driving innovative approaches to develop new treatments. A decade ago, researchers knew that children with the rare fatal disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) appear to age a lifetime in just a few years, but they had no idea why. “There was no way to think about HGPS in molecular terms,” says Susan Michaelis of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Today, researchers have not only identified the genetic defect that causes HGPS (a mutation in the gene encoding the nuclear membrane structural protein lamin A) but also are discussing a possible treatment using farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), a class of anticancer drug. Clinical trials of FTIs could begin within a year. Michaelis, who coauthored some of the FTI studies, says that one person—Leslie Gordon—deserves credit for touching off this scientific boom. After her 22-month-old son was diagnosed with HGPS in 1998, Gordon helped to launch the Progeria Research Foundation (PRF) in an effort to energize research into the disease. Since then, the organization has doled out 19 research grants, staged the first scientific workshops on HGPS, and gathered tissue from progeria patients and family members. The PRF is now trying to raise $2 million (about four times its annual budget) to bankroll a clinical trial to test the FTIs. An M.D-Ph.D. who had planned to specialize in pediatric ophthalmology, Gordon says that she didn't want to take on the huge task of creating a foundation, but the dearth of resources for researchers and for HGPS families made it necessary. “We had no choice. There was nothing out there.” Gordon is not alone. Advocacy groups started by patients and their relatives are propelling research on an assortment of illnesses. They have taken aim at rare killers such as HGPS, which affects only about 40 children worldwide, and more common diseases that they contend have gotten short shrift from scientists and pharmaceutical companies, including epilepsy and autism. Patient-oriented groups date to the 1950s, says physician and historian Barron Lerner of Columbia University in New York City. But the aggressive activism of the 1970s and 1980s has colored the attitudes of today's participants, who “won't wait for science to get around to their disease,” he says. That impatience shows in tactics that go beyond funneling money into research. Advocacy groups have taken over some of the scientific work themselves, underwriting clinical trials, founding tissue banks, and in at least one case, opening a drug-testing laboratory. These organizations play a crucial role by funding risky research that the NIH is reluctant to support, says Nancy Wexler of Columbia University in New York City. A veteran of science and activism, Wexler serves as president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation, which her father established in 1968, and was on the team that tracked down the Huntington's disease gene in 1992. Advocacy groups, she notes, are “usually the only groups to fund research with pilot data.” Such support can be doubly effective. It can enable researchers to amass the data necessary to gain NIH funding. Furthermore, a fresh source of money may entice seasoned scientists and young researchers into working on a neglected disease. According to Dan Geschwind of the University of California, Los Angeles, one organization that has excelled at luring talented scientists is the Cure Autism Now (CAN) Foundation, launched 11 years ago by several families with autistic children. Former head of CAN's scientific steering committee, Geschwind credits the Los Angeles-based organization with attracting “hundreds” of scientists to the field. He is one of the recruits, garnering CAN funds for his efforts to pinpoint autism susceptibility genes. “It's hard to overemphasize the effect of CAN on raising awareness and bringing neuroscientists into research” on autism, he says. All advocacy groups want a cure, or at least a treatment without grueling side effects. The 1983 Orphan Drug Act was supposed to promote such breakthroughs by offering tax reductions and extended patent protection for companies that created drugs to treat rare diseases. But development costs are still formidable. And companies that decide to take the risk can run into other obstacles, including a scarcity of patients for clinical trials. One of the main ways that advocacy groups have contributed is by working to remove some of these barriers. For example, when it comes to new treatments, Kathy Giusti has delivered. The former executive at the pharmaceutical company G.D. Searle helped to start the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) 8 years ago, after learning she had the incurable blood cancer. Although there are about 16,000 new cases of multiple myeloma in the U.S. each year, it had drawn little interest from pharmaceutical companies, and at the time she was diagnosed the drug development pipeline was empty. One consequence of the more than $60 million the MMRF has collected for research is that the pipeline is flowing again, with three medications—Thalomid, Velcade, and Revlimid—recently approved for use against multiple myeloma. However, the MMRF's contribution goes beyond money. Research on the new drugs could have stalled without the organization's ability to reach patients. To ensure that clinical trials for all three drugs would not falter because of insufficient volunteers, the MMRF alerted patients through the clinical trials register of its web site, enrolling sufficient participants to allow the trials to proceed. Progress on new epilepsy drugs halts long before the clinical trials stage, according to Warren Lammert, cofounder of the Epilepsy Therapy Development Project. The “kink in the therapy pipeline” is academic scientists, says Lammert. “There are many, many researchers with interesting and exciting ideas who don't know how to move them along to get therapeutics to patients.” To address this shortcoming, the Epilepsy Therapy Development Project matches academics who have made an encouraging discovery with companies that have the expertise to commercialize it. Last year, for example, the organization brokered a deal to provide backing for Meir Bialer of Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, who is seeking gentler derivatives of the standard epilepsy treatment valproic acid. Although the drug quells seizures, it can cause liver damage and trigger birth defects. Bialer had identified some promising alternatives, says Lammert, but was unable to raise the money for further investigation. So, the Project and Jazz Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, California agreed to split the development costs, with the company retaining the licensing rights. This matchmaking strategy hasn't yet put any drugs into the clinic, Lammert says, and its success will depend on a steady flow of new research findings. A radical strategy for kick-starting drug research comes from James Heywood of the ALS Therapy Development Foundation, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Heywood launched the nonprofit drug-testing laboratory after his brother was diagnosed with ALS in 1998. What deters companies from working on diseases like ALS is not the small market for medications, Heywood says. It's the lack of drug targets with enough scientific support to justify the financial risk. In effect, people are saying to the industry, “We want you to develop drugs that we don't know will work.” Academic research cannot provide the supporting evidence, he says. “Science tends to be a craft industry. You have experiments that are beautiful projects,” but they can't furnish the quantity of information needed to choose whether to pursue a particular drug target. By taking over early drug testing, Heywood hopes to slash the cost of making this decision. “One thing that the activist community has been good at is getting scientists to talk to each other,” says Lerner. To engineer conversation and cooperation, some groups have established formal collaborations. An example is Giusti's latest effort, the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC), which unites experts at 11 of the top cancer centers in North America. Participants include the Mayo Clinic, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, and the University of Chicago. “It's not that people don't want to collaborate, it's that they are incredibly busy,” says Giusti. Now, time-strapped myeloma researchers at these institutions have the chance to join projects such as a clinical trial of the experimental drug TKI 258, which blocks aberrant expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR3 resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 4 and 14 in some multiple myeloma patients. The Epilepsy Therapy Development Project has launched a similar consortium. Its united front benefits drug companies that want to start clinical trials, says Lammert. Instead of negotiating with the institutional review boards at every participating institution, a company only needs to deal with one. But informal arrangements can also be productive, says Wexler. The Hereditary Disease Foundation has long sponsored unconventional workshops on Huntington's disease and related disorders. The rules ban slides—they discourage interaction, says Wexler—and require participants to discuss unpublished data and to dream up radical research strategies. One seemingly outrageous proposal from a 1979 workshop involved locating a marker for the Huntington's disease gene, something many researchers at the time thought would require 100 years, Wexler says. But after the participants concluded that the task was feasible, it took only 4 years. The discovery paved the way for identification of the Huntington's disease gene 9 years later. Advocacy groups serve another crucial function, says Wexler. They link scientists to patients who suffer from the disease, allowing researchers to understand why they have been putting in long hours. At the Hereditary Disease Foundation workshops, she always makes sure that researchers talk with Huntington's disease patients and their families, so they can grasp that the illness “wasn't just theoretical.” Gordon has followed suit in her HGPS meetings. For researchers who spend most of their time manipulating molecules in the lab, “that dialogue is incredibly motivating,” says Michaelis. Rarity makes a disease harder to study. For example, even obtaining one blood sample from an HGPS patient entails a logistical feat, given that only 12 children with the disease live in the U.S. today. Another way that advocacy groups are promoting research is by setting up the cell and tissue collections that are invaluable for probing disease mechanisms and for preliminary drug studies. Cancer experts are already requesting samples from the new MMRC tissue bank housed at the Mayo Clinic Arizona in Scottsdale, says director Rafael Fonseca. It holds bone marrow and blood from some 800 patients provided by the 11 MMRC centers. Collection and storage of the material follows a standard protocol, and patients' clinical data are included. Those features make the bank an advance over previous scattered attempts to collect myeloma patient tissue, says Fonseca. Gordon considers the HGPS tissue bank, which opened in 2002 and contains cell lines derived from 54 patients, one of her most important contributions. It proved vital for recent discoveries about the disease because researchers used the material to track down the genetic defect underpinning HGPS and to conduct some of the preclinical studies of FTIs. Another boon for gene hunters is CAN's tissue bank, the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). It houses donations from more than 800 families, each with at least two autistic children. Geschwind and his colleagues relied on AGRE samples to tease out candidate autism genes on chromosome 7. Rudy Tanzi of Harvard Medical School heads a bigger search using AGRE samples and new Affymetrix microarrays to evaluate 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The group is conducting the first “unbiased screen of the whole genome” for autism susceptibility genes, says Tanzi. That strategy might uncover genes that no one suspected were involved in the disorder, he says. The researchers have already begun the analysis, and Tanzi says he expects the data to be ready by the end of the year. The new hands-on advocacy has paid off for many patients and researchers. But some scientists see drawbacks to this type of entrepreneurial approach. For example, Wexler says that the impatience of some groups to find cures can obstruct progress instead of fostering it. They sometimes opt for short-term projects and overlook the long-term research necessary to understand the disease. Moreover, in the free-for-all to attract donations and the interest of researchers, nobody sets priorities. The most successful advocacy groups don't necessarily represent the most prevalent diseases, and organizations lacking leaders with the energy of Gordon or the insider know-how of Giusti may not be as effective. Despite these limitations, scientists agree that activism by patients and their families can keep the hunt for new treatments for rare and neglected diseases moving forward."
