https://openalex.org/W1965503707,"Mice homozygous for a disruption at the Lyn locus display abnormalities associated with the B lymphocyte lineage and in mast cell function. Despite reduced numbers of recirculating B lymphocytes, Lyn-/- mice are immunoglobulin M (IgM) hyperglobulinemic. Immune responses to T-independent and T-dependent antigens are affected. Lyn-/- mice fail to mediate an allergic response to IgE cross-linking, indicating that activation of LYN plays an indispensable role in Fc epsilon RI signaling. Lyn-/- mice have circulating autoreactive antibodies, and many show severe glomerulonephritis caused by the deposition of IgG immune complexes in the kidney, a pathology reminiscent of systemic lupus erythematosus. Collectively, these results implicate LYN as having an indispensable role in immunoglobulin-mediated signaling, particularly in establishing B cell tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W1977228353,"Regulation of neurite outgrowth and structural plasticity may involve the expression of intrinsic determinants controlling growth competence. We have tested this concept by targeting constitutive expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43 to the neurons of adult transgenic mice. Such mice showed striking spontaneous nerve sprouting at the neuromuscular junction and in the terminal field of hippocampal mossy fibers. In control mice, these nerve fibers did not express GAP-43, and did not sprout spontaneously. Lesion-induced nerve sprouting and terminal arborization during reinnervation were greatly potentiated in GAP-43-overexpressing mice. A mutant GAP-43 that cannot be phosphorylated by PKC had reduced sprout-promoting activity. The results establish GAP-43 as an intrinsic presynaptic determinant for neurite outgrowth and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2004550343,"Conversion of a solid primordium to a hollow tube of cells is a morphogenetic process used frequently during vertebrate embryogenesis. In the early mouse embryo, this process of cavitation transforms the solid embryonic ectoderm into a columnar epithelium surrounding a cavity. Using both established cell lines and normal embryos, we provide evidence that cavitation in the early mouse embryo is the result of the interplay of two signals, one from an outer layer of endoderm cells that acts over short distances to create a cavity by inducing apoptosis of the inner ectodermal cells, and the other a rescue signal mediated by contact with the basement membrane that is required for the survival of the columnar cells that line the cavity. This simple model provides a paradigm for investigating tube morphogenesis in diverse developmental settings."

https://openalex.org/W2064308761,"Normal cells contain p53 protein in a latent state that can be activated for sequence-specific transcription by low levels of UV radiation without an increase in protein levels. Microinjection of cells with an antibody specific to the C-terminal negative regulatory domain can activate the function of p53 as a specific transcription factor in the absence of irradiation damage, suggesting that posttranslational modification of a negative regulatory domain in vivo is a rate-limiting step for p53 activation. Small peptides derived from the negative regulatory domain of p53 have been used as biochemical tools to distinguish between allosteric and steric mechanisms of negative regulation of p53 tetramer activity. Presented is the development of a highly specific peptide activation system that is consistent with an allosteric mechanism of negative regulation and that forms a precedent for the synthesis of novel low molecular mass modifiers of the p53 response."
https://openalex.org/W2070994243,"The Ikaros gene is essential for lymphoid lineage specification. As previously reported, mice homozygous for a mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain fail to generate mature lymphocytes as well as their earliest described progenitors. In addition, our studies with mice heterozygous for this mutation establish the Ikaros gene as an essential regulator of T cell proliferation. Thymocytes display augmented TCR-mediated proliferative responses, and peripheral T cells are autoproliferative. A general lymphoproliferation precedes the T cell leukemia and lymphoma that rapidly develop in all heterozygotes. The first step toward leukemic transformation occurs within the maturing thymocyte population and is demarcated by clonal expansions and loss of the single Ikaros wild-type allele. From these studies, we propose that within developing and mature T lymphocytes, distinct thresholds of Ikaros activity are required to regulate proliferation. A decrease in Ikaros activity below the first threshold causes the rapid accumulation of T lymphoblasts, whereas a further decrease leads to neoplastic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2085632626,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a previously rare, tumour-like lesion of controversial biological nature. KS has since the early 1980s become frequent in patients with AIDS, particularly in homosexuals. KS is also endemic in Central Africa predominantly in otherwise healthy men but also in women and children. Recently, evidence for the presence of novel, herpes virus DNA sequences in more than 90% of AIDS Kaposi lesions (AKS) was presented. This DNA was identified using representational difference analysis (RDA) generating short, unique sequences with variable homology to several herpes virus, but no intact virus was recovered. If these DNA-sequences are also present in other, non-HIV-associated forms of Kaposi's sarcoma this would strongly suggest a specific, aetiopathological involvement of this putative new herpes virus in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, rather than a contamination of yet another opportunistic virus in immunosuppressed AIDS patients.Samples were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the putative Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV). KS DNA from HIV-negative, African, endemic (EKS) samples, and epidemic HIV-positive KS (AKS), and sporadic KS (SKS) samples were tested from Tanzania and Sweden. All of the HIV KS (18 African EKS and 4 Swedish SKS) as well as the HIV-positive AIDS-related KS (16 African and 7 Swedish AKS) biopsies were shown to contain the previously described DNA sequences. KS lesions from children, females, and males in various tissues were analyzed including skin, lymph nodes, gut and oral mucosa. All forms of KS showed a single PCR product of the expected size (233 base pairs). To exclude amplification of other types of herpes virus, virus preparations of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis, and human herpes virus type 6 (HHV6) were assayed, again by PCR, using the KSHV primers. No PCR products were obtained with any of these virus strains. However, most HIV-positive and HIV-negative KS DNA samples also contained either EBV and/or HHV6 sequences. All biopsies from non-KS tissues (cells) of HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals were consistently negative for KSHV by PCR. The observation that the same herpes virus-like DNA sequence is present in endemic and sporadic, as well as AIDS-related, Kaposi's sarcoma cases suggests a possible pathogenic association between this putative novel, herpes-like virus and KS. The herpes virus-like DNA sequences described by Y. Chang in 1994 may indeed represent a novel herpes (KSHV), etiopathologically associated with various clinical forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. Its pathogenic importance is indicated by its presence in different KS tissues with various clinical types of KS and its absence from non-KS-involved tissues. Furthermore, the presence of KSHV in KS of children suggests a nonsexual mode of transmission."

https://openalex.org/W1985481802,"The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a six protein assembly that binds S. cerevisiae origins of replication and directs DNA replication throughout the genome and transcriptional silencing at the yeast mating-type loci. Here we report the cloning of the genes encoding the 120 kDa (ORC1), 62 kDa (ORC3), and 56 kDa (ORC4) subunits of ORC and the reconstitution of the complete complex after expression of all six subunits in insect cells. Orc1p is related to Cdc6p and Cdc18p, which regulate DNA replication and mitosis, and to Sir3p, a regulator of transcriptional silencing. The N-terminal region of Orc1p is highly related to Sir3p, and studies of Orc1p/Sir3p chimeric proteins indicate that this domain is dedicated to the transcriptional silencing function of ORC."

https://openalex.org/W1967145281,"Mutations in the Drosophila mei-S332 gene cause premature separation of the sister chromatids in late anaphase of meiosis I. Therefore, the mei-S332 protein was postulated to hold the centromere regions of sister chromatids together until anaphase II. The mei-S332 gene encodes a novel 44 kDa protein. Mutations in mei-S332 that differentially affect function in males or females map to distinct domains of the protein. A fusion of mei-S332 to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is fully functional and localizes specifically to the centromere region of meiotic chromosomes. When sister chromatids separate at anaphase II, mei-S332-GFP disappears from the chromosomes, suggesting that the destruction or release of this protein is required for sister-chromatid separation."
https://openalex.org/W1980246983,"We and others have postulated that a constant number of T lymphocytes is normally maintained without regard to CD4+ or CD8+ phenotype (‘blind’ T-cell homeostasis). Here we confirm essentially constant T-cell levels (despite marked decline in CD4+ T cells and increase in CD8+ T cells) in homosexual men with incident human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), infection who remained free of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for up to eight years after seroconversion. In contrast, seroconverters who developed AIDS exhibited rapidly declining T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) for approximately two years before AIDS, independent of the time between seroconversion and AIDS, suggesting that homeostasis failure is an important landmark in HIV disease progression. Given the high rate of T-cell turnover in HIV-1 infection, blind T-cell homeostasis may contribute to HIV pathogenesis through a CD8+ T lymphocytosis that interferes with regeneration of lost CD4+ T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2014601660,"The mobility (homing) of the yeast mitochondrial DNA group II intron al2 occurs via target DNA-primed reverse transcription at a double-strand break in the recipient DNA. Here, we show that the site-specific DNA endonuclease that makes the double-strand break is a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the al2-encoded reverse transcriptase protein and excised al2 RNA. Remarkably, the al2 RNA catalyzes cleavage of the sense strand of the recipient DNA, while the al2 protein appears to cleave the antisense strand. The RNA-catalyzed sense strand cleavage occurs via a partial reverse splicing reaction in which the protein component stabilizes the active intron structure and appears to confer preference for DNA substrates. Our results demonstrate a biologically relevant ribozyme reaction with a substrate other than RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2065902777,"Clathrin polymerization into a polyhedral vesicle coat drives receptor sorting at cellular membranes during endocytosis and organelle biogenesis. To study clathrin self-assembly, we expressed the C-terminal third of the clathrin heavy chain in bacteria. The recombinant fragment trimerized, bound clathrin light chains, and morphologically resembled the hub domain of the triskelion-shaped clathrin molecule. Self-assembly of recombinant hubs demonstrated a regulatory role for clathrin light chains and for the distal portions of triskelion legs in clathrin coat formation. Deletion mutagenesis of the hub localized a domain mediating light chain binding and clathrin self-assembly and mapped a transferable trimerization domain. These studies define molecular interactions controlling clathrin self-assembly and establish a recombinant system for future analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1975842846,"Trypanosoma brucei survives in the mammalian blood-stream by regularly changing its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. The active VSG gene is located in a telomeric expression site, and coat switching occurs either by replacing the transcribed VSG gene or by changing the expression site that is active. To determine whether VSG expression site control requires promoter-specific sequences, we replaced the active VSG expression site promoter in bloodstream-form T. brucei with a ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter. These transformants were fully infective in laboratory animals, and the rDNA promoter, which is normally constitutively active, was efficiently inactivated and reactivated in the context of the VSG gene expression site. As there is no sequence similarity between the VSG expression site promoter and the rDNA promoter, VSG expression site control does not involve sequences specific to the VSG expression site promoter. We conclude that an epigenetic mechanism, such as telomeric silencing, is involved in VSG expression site control in bloodstream-form T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2015494547,"Trypanosoma brucei undergoes antigenic variation in the mammalian host. This can be achieved by activation and inactivation of telomeric variant-specific surface glycoprotein genes (vsg). In procyclic (insect midgut stage) cells, Vsg is not expressed. The mechanisms that regulate transcription of vsg expression sites (ESs) are unknown. Here we demonstrate that transcription from three different promoters was repressed when they were inserted at a transcriptionally silent telomere-proximal locus in bloodstream-form cells. This position effect was stable and heritable. Only transcription from an ES promoter was repressed in procyclic cells. The observed position effect and the promoter-specific developmental regulation suggest that these phenomena reflect the mechanisms that regulate vsg expression."

https://openalex.org/W2005096802,"Control of pandemic infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires some means of developing mucosal immunity against HIV-1 because sexual transmission of the virus occurs mainly through the mucosal tissues. However, there is no evidence as yet that the secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody induced by immunization with antigens in experimental animals can neutralize HIV-1. We demonstrate here that oral immunization with a new macromolecular peptide antigen and cholera toxin (CT) induces a high titre (1:211) of gut-associated and secretory IgA antibody to HIV-1. Using three different neutralizing assays, we clearly demonstrate that this secretory IgA antibody is able to neutralize HIV-1 IIIB, HIV-1SF2 and HIV-1MN. Our new approach may prove to be important in the development of a mucosal vaccine that will provide protection of mucosal surfaces against HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2046391028,"We present biochemical evidence for an intercellular signal transduction pathway in B. subtilis. This pathway governs the conversion of the proprotein pro-sigma E to mature transcription factor sigma E. Proteolytic processing is mediated by the membrane protein SpollGA and is triggered by the inferred extracellular signal protein SpollR. A factor in conditioned medium from B. subtilis cells engineered to produce SpollR during growth triggered processing in protoplasts of B. subtilis cells that had been engineered to produce SpollGA and pro-sigma E. The factor was also detected in, and partially purified from, extracts of SpollR-producing cells of E. coli. We speculate that SpollGA is both a receptor and a protease and the SpollR interacts with SpollGA on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, activating the intracellular protease domain of SpollGA."

https://openalex.org/W1982716670,"Simple repetitive tracts of DNA are unstable in all organisms thus far examined. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, we show that a 51 bp poly(GT) tract alters length at a rate of about 10(-5) per cell division. Insertion of a single variant repeat (either AT or CT) into the middle of the poly(GT) tract results in 100-fold stabilization. This stabilization requires the DNA mismatch repair system. Alterations within tracts with variant repeats occur more frequently on one side of the interruption than on the other. The stabilizing effects of variant repeats and polarity of repeat alterations have also been observed in trinucleotide repeats associated with certain human diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2086163429,"The 10Sa RNA, encoded by the E. coli ssrA gene, appears to modulate action of some DNA-binding proteins. When ssrA is inactivated, lacZ expression from the lac operon, as well as galK from a gal operon fused to a phage lambda promoter, is reduced from that observed in bacteria wild-type for ssrA. These differences are not observed if the relevant repressor is inactive, suggesting that in the absence of 10Sa RNA binding of LacI and lambda cI repressors is enhanced. Gel mobility shifts show that 10Sa RNA binds these repressors and that an excess of 10Sa RNA competes for binding of lambda cI with a DNA fragment containing the OR2 repressor-binding sequence. Similar observations were made in studies of the E. coli LexA repressor and phage P22 C1 transcription activator proteins. These results suggest that direct interaction with 10Sa RNA may explain this modulation of protein-DNA interactions."
