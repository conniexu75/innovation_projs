Significant interest has been given to aspects of the cell biology and substrate specificity of this family of proteases; however, quantitative descriptions of their biochemical characteristics have lagged behind. We describe the influence of a number of environmental parameters, including pH, ionic strength, detergent, and specific ion concentrations, on the activity and stability of four caspases involved in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Based on these observations, we recommend the following buffer as optimal for investigation of their characteristics in vitro: 20 mmpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. Caspase activity is not affected by concentrations of Ca2+ below 100 mm, but is abolished by Zn2+ in the submicromolar range, a common characteristic of cysteine proteases. Optimal pH values vary from 6.8 for caspase-8 to 7.4 for caspase-3, and activity of all is relatively stable between 0 and 150 mm NaCl. Consequently, changes in the physiologic pH and ionic strength would not significantly alter the activity of the enzymes, inasmuch as all four caspases are optimally active within the range of these parameters found in the cytosol of living and dying human cells.

Apoptotic cell death is a process that enables metazoans to eliminate cells that are damaged, mislocated, or have become superfluous, and is characterized by controlled proteolysis of cellular components resulting from activation of an in-built program (2Ellis H.M.

The signal for the execution of the cell may come from various stimuli: specific death receptor ligation (4Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, despite the variety of death signals, the key features of execution appear to be quite similar; the death signal converges upon the activation of a number of proteases, which in turn cleave protein substrates (8Martin S.J.

In the present article, we present a characterization of some of the basic biochemical properties of four of the caspases. We have chosen to focus on those that play a central role in the apoptotic pathway initiated by ligation of the death receptors Fas and tumor necrosis receptor 1: caspase-3 (Yama/CPP32/apopain), caspase-6 (Mch2), caspase-7 (Lap3/Mch3/CMH1), and caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH) (22Orth K.

Active caspases-3, -6, -7, and -8 were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated as described previously (22Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

The expression constructs for caspases-3, -6, and -7 contained a His6 tag at the C terminus of the full-length protein, while caspase-8 was constructed to have a His6 tag at the N terminus replacing residues 1–216 of the zymogen. The concentrations of the purified enzymes were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm based on the molar absorption coefficients for the caspases calculated from the Edelhoch relationship (28Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar): caspase-3 (ε280 = 26000 m−1cm−1), caspase-6 (ε280 = 26000m−1 cm−1), caspase-7 (ε280 = 24510 m−1cm−1), and caspase-8 (ε280 = 27390m−1 cm−1). Carbobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (Z-DEVD-AFC) was purchased from Enzyme System Products. DTT was from Diagnostic Chemicals Limited. Sucrose was from Mallinckrodt. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone was the kind gift of Joe Krebbs, IDUN Pharmaceuticals. The pH dependence of the hydrolysis of the substrate Z-DEVD-AFC were evaluated in the pH range 5.5–10. The enzymatic reaction was carried out at 37 °C in the following buffers: 20 mm MES (pH 5.5–6.5), 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.2–7.3), 20 mm PIPES (pH 6.9–8.1), 20 mm Bicine (pH 7.8–9.0) or 20 mmCHES (pH 8.8–10.0), containing NaCl, DTT (fresh), EDTA, CHAPS, and sucrose at optimized concentrations as described under “Results and Discussion.” For reasons discussed later, the optimal buffer used as a basis for further studies was 20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. The enzyme concentrations used were 1.2 nm (caspase-3), 18 nm (caspase-6), 5 nm (caspase-7), and 80 nm (caspase-8). The initial rates of enzymatic hydrolysis were measured by release of AFC from the substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (0.1 mm) as emission at 505 nm upon excitation at 400 nm using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B fluorimeter equipped with a thermostated plate reader. The pH dependences of the initial rates of hydrolysis for all four caspases were fitted to a bell shape described for two ionizing groups by the equation v = (limit × log(pH − pK a 1))/(log(2 × pH − pK a 1−pK a 2) + log(pH − pK a 1) + 1)) using Grafit 3.01 (29Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.01. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1993Google Scholar). The sensitivity toward Zn2+ and Ca2+ was determined in optimal buffer (without EDTA), containing varying concentrations of ZnCl2or CaCl2 as described above. A concentration of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol was used to replace DTT because it does not chelate zinc to the same extent as DTT. The influence of the concentration of the reductant on the zinc sensitivity was exploited for caspase-3 using varying concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol. The inhibition of the caspases by ZnCl2 was fitted to an equation describing simple competitive inhibition, v =V max/(1 + ((K s/[S]) × (1 + ([Zn2+]/K Zn)))) using Grafit 3.01 (29Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit, Version 3.01. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1993Google Scholar). The sensitivity toward ionic strength was determined in optimal buffer containing varying concentrations of NaCl as described above. The stability of the four caspases was determined by incubating the enzymes in optimal buffer at 0 °C or 37 °C. At various time points, a sample was withdrawn and the activity was determined as described above. Heterologous expression of the caspases is required to obtain sufficient amounts of starting material for a rigorous characterization. Although the mechanism is not understood, when expressed in E. coli, these caspases spontaneously undergo what appears to be autoprocessing to yield the appropriate subunits characteristic of the active enzymes (Fig.1). Processing at interdomain Asp residues was confirmed for all of the recombinant proteases by sequencing of the N termini of the two subunits (see Refs. 22Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20977-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar and 27Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

Note that both the large and small subunits migrate as homogeneous bands in SDS-PAGE, with the exception of the large subunit of caspase-6, which, based on N-terminal sequencing, represents alternative cleavages at the C terminus of the large subunit. The N-terminal peptides of caspases-3, -6, and -7 were also removed during processing, as demonstrated to occur during Fas-mediated apoptosis in vivo (22Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20977-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 could not be expressed as a full-length protein and thus was engineered with a 21-residue linker (24Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that replaces the 216-residue N-terminal segment removed during its activation in vivo after Fas ligation (25Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 26Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A.

Consequently, with the exception of the terminal purification tags, the proteins are essentially identical to the forms identified or expected in vivo in apoptotic cells. On the basis of titration with the active site-directed caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone, all proteases were 100% active, based on absorbance at 280 nm, with the exception of caspase-8, which was 50% active. Common to all the caspases is a distinct preference for aspartic acid in the P1position. 2Binding site nomenclature is in accordance with the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (1Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4744) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used Z-DEVD-AFC as the test substrate even though the four caspases investigated exhibit some degree of P4preference. Use of this substrate is suitable, inasmuch as we are interested in the properties of the caspases and not in the possible effects that the change of various parameters may have on the protein substrates. Initially, the requirements for various components were investigated in a buffer based on that used by Thornberry et al. for caspase-1 (11Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney G.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar): 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4. TableI demonstrates the effects of removal of some of these component from the assay buffer. All four caspases lose over 40% of their activity upon removal of CHAPS from the buffer, and the effect is more dramatic with caspase-6 than with caspases-3, -7, and -8. Only minor beneficial effects are found with sucrose and NaCl; in the case of caspase-6, there is a significant reduction in activity in the presence of NaCl, which will be discussed in detail below. However, 100 mm NaCl is required in the assay buffer to maintain a consistent ionic strength when varying pH. A relatively high concentration of DTT (10 mm) is required for full activity of the recombinant enzymes. They may be preactivated by DTT and the DTT removed by gel filtration; however, if neither reducing agent nor EDTA is present in the exchange buffer, the activity declines rapidly, presumably due to oxidation of the catalytic cysteine (data not shown). EDTA (1 mm) is incorporated into the assay buffer to avoid inactivation by trace metals.Table IEffect of removing various compounds from the assay bufferCaspase-3Caspase-6Caspase-7Caspase-8CHAPS0.590.030.390.30Sucrose0.950.820.810.92NaCl0.971.690.780.97 Open table in a new tab Only minor differences were observed in the pH profiles of the four caspases. The bell-shaped pH dependence signifies the existence of one active form of the enzyme with the increase in activity most likely due to the de-protonation of the catalytic Cys residue. In this respect, the caspases closely resemble other unrelated cysteine proteases in their activity pH profiles (30Lewis E.R. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 was found to be active over a broader pH range with an optimum slightly higher than the other three (see Fig. 2). Although we have analyzed the pH dependence of all four enzymes as a simple bell-shaped curve, there is a faster than expected drop-off in activity at low pH, most clearly observed with caspases-3 and -6. This indicates that more than one group is protonating, possibly another group on the enzyme, or the substrate carboxylate(s), inasmuch as the three-dimensional structure of caspases-1 and -3 demonstrates binding of unprotonated side-chains in its specificity pockets (31Wilson K.P.

The pH dependence of these caspases also indicates that they all are fully active within the pH range found in normal as well as apoptotic cells, designated by the shaded background in Fig. 2 (18Gottlieb R.A.

It is possible that changes in pH during apoptosis may affect caspase activity indirectly by altering the structure of a particular set of natural substrates. However, this hypothetical event would change only the susceptibility of the substrate, not the activity of the caspases. We used NaCl in the range 0–1m in assay buffer to address the dependence of ionic strength on caspase activity. Differential effects were found depending on the enzyme, with caspases-3 and -8 having fairly flat profiles, whereas caspases-6 and -7 demonstrated maximal activity at 0.03m and 0.25 m (Fig.3). Although the activity of caspase-6 declined faster than the others as ionic strength increased, none of the enzymes demonstrated substantial adverse effects on their activity in the physiologic range of ionic strength (34Godt R.E. Maughan D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C591-C604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), designated by the shaded background in Fig. 3. The apparent stability to substantial changes in ionic strength indicates that this would not be limiting during commitment to apoptosis. Several studies have reported that Zn2+ inhibits apoptosis. Originally, this effect was believed to be due to the inhibition of nucleases; however, caspase-6 (17Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8395-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and, more recently, caspase-3 (20Perry D.K. Smyth M.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) have been found to be inhibited completely by 2 mmZn2+. The influence of transition metal ions on the activity of cysteine proteases has been well established for a long time; for instance, members of the papain family are sensitive to Zn2+, mercury, and various organomecurials (35Sluyterman L.A. Wijdenes J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 232-240Google Scholar). Because DTT chelates Zn2+, we compared caspases for sensitivity to this ion in the presence of 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, which we determined to be the concentration of this reductant required for optimal activity of the recombinant enzymes (data not shown). Due to the inherent tendency of Zn2+ to react with thiols, we can only obtain an apparent binding constant and, under these conditions, all the caspases are inhibited by small amounts of Zn2+, although there are significant differences in the affinity (Fig. 4). Caspase-6 is most readily inhibited by Zn2+, completely inactivated by 0.1 mm, and caspase-3 is the least sensitive, requiring more than 1 mm for complete inactivation. To estimate the real binding affinity, we probed the influence of reductant on the inhibition of caspase-3 by Zn2+. Not surprisingly, there was a significant influence of the concentration of β-mercaptoethanol on the K Zn,app giving rise to values converging on an approximate value of 0.15 μm (Fig.5). From these results, it is quite evident that Zn2+ is a good inhibitor of the caspases, albeit very dependent on the thiol content, and therefore presumably the redox potential of the cell. The influence of Ca2+ was investigated in a similar manner and was found to have no effect on the activity of any of the caspases at concentrations up to 100 mm (data not shown). Thus, the reported role of Ca2+ in apoptosis (see, for example, Ref. 37Bian X. Hughes Jr., F.M. Huang Y. Cidlowski J.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is unlikely to be due to any effect on the caspases.Figure 5Influence of the concentration of β-mercaptoethanol on the apparent binding constant for Zn2+ to caspase-3. The influence of β-mercaptoethanol on K Zn,app were investigated using the concentrations 0.25 mm (▾), 0.5 mm(▿), 1 mm (▴), 2 mm (▵), 4 mm(▪), 8 mm (□), 16 mm (•), and 32 mm (○).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the basis of the foregoing results, the optimal general caspase buffer was designated as 20 mmPIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. The stability of the four caspases was tested by incubating the enzymes at 0 °C or 37 °C in the optimal assay buffer and determining the activity at various times (Fig. 6). None of the caspases showed any decrease in activity at 0 °C over the 150-min period. Caspases-3 and -6 retained full activity for 150 min at 37 °C, whereas caspases-7 and -8 showed an appreciable decrease in activity. To verify that the decrease in activity observed at 37 °C with caspases-7 and -8 was not due to sample variation, the experiment was performed with two different preparations of these enzymes giving rise to almost identical results, reducing the probability that the decrease in activity is associated with sample variations. The reason for the decrease in activity is not clear; however, SDS-PAGE analysis of caspases incubated at 0 °C and 37 °C for 150 min does not reveal any indications of degradation (data not shown). Based on these observations, the most probable explanation is a conformational change, possibly due to slow dissociation of the subunits after dilution into assay buffer, as originally described for caspase-1 (11Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney G.P.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported because the decrease in activity observed with caspase-8 appears to approach a level of approximately 60%, and remains there for an extended period of time. Whether such dissociation occurs in a cell under physiologic conditions remains an open question, but it is evident that none of the investigated caspases undergo autolysis that will significantly affect their role in apoptosis. This is in contrast to caspase-1, which has been shown to inactivate spontaneously by autolytic degradation of its small subunit (38Talanian R.V. Dang L.C. Ferenz C.R. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Welch J.P. Wong W.W. Brady K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21853-21858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that all four caspases are optimally active under normal physiologic conditions. We have to activate the recombinant enzymes by adding thiols, presumably because of reversible modification of the catalytic cysteine during expression and purification. In vivo, however, the glutathione balance would favor the reduced form, with the result that, once processed from their single chain zymogens, the caspases would be fully active. We do not rule out the possibility that natural caspase substrates are affected by changes in environmental parameters that would alter their susceptibility to specific proteolysis in vivo. In this context, caspase-1 was shown to exhibit a marked salt dependence due to effects of NaCl on the substrate pro-interleukin-1β, but not on a synthetic peptidyl substrate (39Miller D. Henderson B. Bodmer M.W. Therapeutic Modulation of Cytokines. Springer Verlag, Berlin1996: 143-170Google Scholar). However, changes in the pH and ionic strength of the cytosol would not significantly alter the activity of the enzymes themselves, inasmuch as all four caspases are optimally active within the range of these parameters found within cell cytosols, irrespective of their metabolic status.

Gp60 organization on the bovine pulmonary microvessel endothelial cell (BPMVEC) surface was punctate as shown by immunofluorescence using an anti-gp60 antibody (Ab) conjugated with bisfunctional, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl fluorophore (Cy3). Addition of a secondary Ab to anti-gp60 Ab-treated BPMVEC induced cross-linking of gp60 as evident by increased size of fluorescent particles and cell surface gp60 clustering. Gp60 cross-linking also produced 2–3-fold increases in the endothelial cell uptake and the luminal to abluminal permeability of 125I-albumin as well as the fluid-phase tracer, horseradish peroxidase. The increased transendothelial permeability of macromolecules was the result of transcytosis as it was not associated with an increase in the paracellular pathway. Incubation of anti-gp60 Ab with BPMVEC at 37 °C caused internalization of gp60, and thereby reduced the uptake of the macromolecules. Activation of gp60 by either albumin (the gp60 ligand) or gp60 cross-linking induced the phosphorylation of both gp60 and caveolin-1 (the major structural caveolar protein) on tyrosine residues. Gp60 activation also phosphorylated the Srcfamily tyrosine kinases pp60c-Src and Fyn. The activated pp60c-Src and Fyn co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 in BPMVEC membrane. Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors, herbimycin A and genistein, prevented gp60-activated macromolecule uptake and transcytosis in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the functional significance of the PTK pathway in activating albumin transcytosis. These findings indicate that activation of gp60 stimulates the Src PTK signaling pathway, and thus regulates the transcytosis of albumin across the endothelial cell monolayer.

Albumin, through its interaction with matrix components of the endothelial cell membrane, also serves a critical function in maintaining the characteristic permselective endothelial cell monolayer barrier (5Curry R.F. Michel C.C. Microvasc. Res. 1980; 20: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Morphological studies using gold-conjugated albumin tracer have shown that albumin can bind to the endothelial cell surface resulting in the localization of the albumin tracer in plasmalemmal vesicles followed within 30–60 min by deposition of the tracer in the abluminal space (6Ghinea N.

Conformationally modified albumins (i.e. albumin-Au, formaldehyde-, or maleic anhydride-treated albumin) were shown to bind preferentially with a 1000-fold greater affinity to these proteins compared with monomeric native albumin (10Schnitzer J.E. Bravo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7562-7570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schnitzer J.E. Sung A. Horvat R. Bravo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24544-24553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using lectins also identified a 60-kDa (gp60) ABP on the endothelial cell membrane which binds specifically to native albumin (12Schnitzer J.E. Carley W.W. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The lectins Limax flavus agglutinin and Ricinus communis agglutinin inhibited albumin binding to rat fat tissue microvessel endothelial cells by preventing the binding of albumin to gp60 (12Schnitzer J.E. Carley W.W. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We showed that R. communisagglutinin precipitated gp60 from endothelial cell membranes and inhibited transendothelial albumin transport by ∼50% (13Siflinger-Birnboim A. Schnitzer J.E. Lum H. Blumenstock F.A. Shen C.P.J. Del Vecchio P.J. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting an important function of gp60 in regulating albumin permeability. Antibodies (Abs) raised against purified gp60 (14Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) prevented albumin binding to the endothelial cell surface at 4 °C. The membrane-bound gp60 has several unique characteristics, among them its difference from the endothelial cell-secreted ABP, secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (14Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since the function of gp60 in regulating vascular endothelial permeability is poorly understood, in the present study, we have determined the function of gp60 in mediating the uptake of albumin and its transport via a transcellular mechanism. We have also studied the role of the protein tyrosine kinase pathway in signaling the gp60-activated albumin transport across the endothelial cell monolayer. Bovine pulmonary microvessel endothelial cells (BPMVEC) were isolated and cultured as described (15Del Vecchio P.J. Siflinger-Birnboim A. Belloni P.N. Holleran L.A. Lum H. Malik A.B. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28: 711-715Crossref Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent endothelial monolayers were incubated in serum-free medium for 15 h to deplete the albumin. Cells passed between 19 and 22 times were used in the experiments described below. Polyclonal antiserum against gp60 was prepared and purified as described (14Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Anti-gp60 Ab was labeled with Cy3 bisfunctional reactive dye (Amersham Life Science, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BPMVEC cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with serum-free medium overnight at 37 °C, and then incubated with 5% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed 3 × with Hanks' balanced salt solution at 22 °C. The cells were incubated with anti-gp60 Ab-Cy3 (50 μg/ml) for different time intervals, and washed 3 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. In some experiments, after exposure to anti-gp60 Ab-Cy3, the cells were treated with a secondary Ab (goat anti-rabbit IgG), 50 μg/ml for 20 min at 22 °C. The coverslips were fixed with mounting fluid and viewed on a Zeiss IM-35 fluorescence microscope × 40 objective. Micrographs were taken on T-max 400 film (Eastman Kodak) using identical exposure times. BPMVEC monolayers were washed twice with 10 mm HEPES/DMEM, pH 7.4 (Buffer A), and placed on ice. For uptake experiments described below, the cell monolayers were incubated with either anti-gp60 Ab or preimmune IgG (control Ab) (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at 4 °C. Endothelial cell monolayers washed twice with buffer A at 4 °C were used for uptake at 37 °C for different time intervals. For the transport experiments described below, endothelial cells cultured on filters were incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies at 22 °C, and transport of macromolecules was measured at 37 °C. The data were analyzed using the unpaired t-test and statistical significance was set atp < 0.05. Endothelial cells were grown in either 6- or 12-well culture plates to confluence. These monolayers were washed with Buffer A, and used for uptake of either 125I-albumin or horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The uptake experiments were carried out for different time intervals at 37 °C. Uptake was terminated by placing cell monolayers on ice and washing 3 times with either pH 2.5 buffer (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl) or pH 3.0 (20 mm glycine/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl) to remove surface-bound molecules (16Resink T.J. Scott-Burden T. Boulanger C. Weber E. Buhler F.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 738: 244-252Google Scholar, 17Tiruppathi C. Lum H. Andersen T.T. Fenton II, J.W. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L595-L601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed and the cell lysate was used to measure either 125I-radioactivity or HRP activity. The cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate to measure radioactivity. The endothelial monolayers were washed 3 times with pH 3.0 buffer and lysed with 20 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1% Triton X-100 to measure the lysate HRP activity as described (18Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Permeability of macromolecules across cultured endothelial cell monolayers was determined as described (13Siflinger-Birnboim A. Schnitzer J.E. Lum H. Blumenstock F.A. Shen C.P.J. Del Vecchio P.J.

This system measures the transendothelial flux of tracer molecules (luminal to abluminal) in the absence of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients. The system consists of luminal and abluminal compartments separated by a polycarbonate filter (0.4-μm pore sizes; 6.5-mm diameter). The luminal (upper) side of the filters was coated with gelatin, and endothelial cells were seeded at 105cells/filter and grown for 3 to 4 days to attain confluence. Endothelial monolayers were washed and incubated in buffer A prior to experiments. Both the luminal and abluminal compartments contained the same medium at volumes of 0.2 and 1.0 ml, respectively. The tracer molecules were added in the upper compartment and 0.05-ml samples from the lower compartment were collected at 10-min intervals for 30 min for determination of the clearance rates of tracer molecules as described (13Siflinger-Birnboim A.

The method of determining endothelial monolayer impedance has been previously described by us for assessment of the paracellular transport pathway (21Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We used this measurement to determine whether the increase in125I-albumin and HRP transport was the result of endothelial cell retraction, and opening of intercellular gaps. BPMVEC were grown to confluence on a 4.9 × 10−4cm2 gold electrode. The small electrode and the larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier (21Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). An constant current of 1 μA was applied by a 1 V, 4000 Hz AC signal connected serially to 1 MΩ resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between small electrode and larger counter electrode was continuously monitored by lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a computer. The data are presented as change in the resistive portion of the impedance normalized to its value at time 0 as described (21Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). BPMVEC cultured in 60-mm culture dishes were washed and lyzed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with blocking buffer (5% dry milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at 22 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with either anti-pp60c-Src monoclonal Ab (from Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) or anti-Fynmonoclonal Ab (from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed and the reactive proteins were identified after incubating with125I-goat anti-mouse IgG. The protein bands were identified using known molecular weight markers. BPMVEC grown in 60-mm culture dishes were washed and incubated with serum-free medium for 15 h. Then the cells were washed and incubated with DMEM containing 0.18 mm inorganic phosphate and 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. After this incubation period, the cells were stimulated with either albumin or anti-gp60 Ab. The cells were washed and lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and the clear supernatant was incubated with either anti-pp60c-Src Ab or anti-FynAb overnight at 4 °C. Then the samples were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h to separate precipitated proteins. The beads were washed 4 times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmsodium fluoride). The washed beads containing the precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The experimental protocol used was similar to the described above except that the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using either anti-caveolin Ab (from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or anti-gp60 Ab. BPMVEC grown to confluence in 60-mm dishes were washed and incubated with serum-free medium for 15 h and then treated with test components. The cells were washed, lysed with lysis buffer, and the lysate was incubated with anti-gp60 Ab at 4 °C. After this incubation, the immunoprecipitates were separated by protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 4 times with wash buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 2.5% BSA in TBS (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm sodium fluoride for 60 min at 22 °C. The membrane was washed twice with 0.05% Tween 20 containing TBS. The membrane was then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal Ab (from ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) diluted in blocking buffer for 12 h at 22 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with125I-goat anti-mouse IgG for 60 min at 22 °C. The protein bands were visualized by autoradiogram. In some experiments, anti-phosphotyrosine Ab-blotted membrane was stripped at 50 °C for 30 min with 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, washed, and then used for probing with another Ab. The anti-gp60 Ab-Cy3 binding patterns on BPMVEC revealed a punctate cell surface organization in the absence of nuclear labeling (Fig.1). The particle size was variable and the brightness increased with the time of incubation with the fluorophore (Fig. 1, A-C). Staining was competitively inhibited by unlabeled anti-gp60 Ab (data not shown). Maximum brightness was observed within 30 min of incubation, and thereafter, the fluorescence intensities remained unchanged. Addition of a secondary Ab (goat anti-rabbit IgG) to induce gp60 cross-linking significantly increased the size of fluorescent particles compared with controls (Fig. 1 D). BPMVEC monolayers were incubated with anti-gp60 Ab (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and then incubated with secondary Ab at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice at 4 °C and fresh medium containing 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, and incubated at 37 °C for 15, 30, or 60 min. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were placed on ice and washed 3 times with ice-cold acid buffer, pH 2.5, to remove surface-bound molecules, and the monolayers were lysed and the radioactivity was counted. Gp60 cross-linking increased the uptake of 125I-BSA 2–3-fold compared with either control Ab or untreated controls with the maximum increase observed at 30 min (Fig. 2). Incubation of the monolayers for 60 min decreased the uptake of BSA. These results cannot be attributed to 125I-BSA degradation following its internalization in endothelial cells since analysis by SDS-PAGE of BSA recovered from the incubation medium and cell lysate indicated that BSA remained intact in the medium and cell lysate (data not shown). We studied whether other macromolecules in the fluid phase could also be internalized by gp60 cross-linking. The uptake of HRP using the medium containing 1 mg/ml unlabeled BSA and 0.4 mg/ml HRP was studied as described above for 125I-BSA. Gp60 cross-linking increased the uptake of HRP by 2–3-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 3). HRP uptake was 5–6-fold greater in the presence of BSA than its absence, suggesting that albumin binding to gp60 facilitated the fluid phase HRP uptake (data not shown). We preincubated BPMVEC monolayers with anti-gp60 Ab for 30 min at 37 °C and washed 3 times with pH 3.0 buffer at 4 °C to remove the cell surface-bound Ab. The monolayers were treated with anti-gp60Ab and secondary Ab for 30 min at 4 °C, and used for125I-BSA uptake as described above. The125I-BSA uptake did not significantly increase in these monolayers (Fig. 4 A). Endothelial cell monolayers were incubated with anti-gp60 Ab at 37 °C for different time intervals, placed on ice, washed with ice-cold acid buffer, pH 3.0, to remove surface-bound Abs, and incubated with anti-gp60 Ab-Cy3 for 30 min at 22 °C. The fluorescent particle number on the cell surface was reduced in cells treated with anti-gp60 Ab at 37 °C for 30–60 min (Fig. 4 B), a finding consistent with internalization of the cell surface gp60 and the reduction in 125I-BSA uptake (Fig. 4 A). BPMVEC were cultured on microporous filters consisting of luminal and abluminal chambers as described under “Experimental Procedures” to measure the permeabilities of 125I-BSA and HRP. Endothelial monolayers were treated with anti-gp60 Ab at 22 °C, and permeability was measured at 37 °C. Gp60 cross-linking, increased the transendothelial 125I-BSA and HRP clearance rates by 2-fold in BPMVEC monolayers over control monolayers (Fig.5, A and B). We also studied whether gp60-induced increases in the paracellular pathway could account for the increase in endothelial permeability of macromolecules (21Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). BPMVEC cultured on gold electrodes were treated either with control Ab or anti-gp60 Ab, and then with the secondary Ab. Gp60 cross-linking did not alter the BPMVEC monolayer electrical impedance (Fig. 6), whereas addition of thrombin (which increases paracellular macromolecule permeability by opening interendothelial gaps (21Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar)) decreased the impedance of the monolayer. Because activation of Src kinases may represent an early signal induced by gp60, we studied the effects of gp60 activation on the activity of pp60c-Src and Fyn. Immunoblot analysis of BPMVEC lysate using monoclonal Abs to pp60c-Src and Fyn indicated that pp60c-Src and Fyn were expressed in BPMVEC (Fig. 7 A). We studied whether gp60 activation could mediate the phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells. BPMVEC monolayers were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (see “Experimental Procedures”) and stimulated with varying concentrations of BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with either anti-pp60c-Src Ab or anti-Fyn Ab after stimulation. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Results indicated that BSA induced the phosphorylation of both pp60c-Src and Fyn (Fig. 7B and 7C). Moreover, anti-pp60c-Src and Fyn Abs co-immunoprecipitated two other major phosphorylated proteins (21–23 and 36 kDa) in the BSA-stimulated cells. We identified the 21–23 kDa protein by immunoblot as caveolin-1, a known substrate for Src family kinases (22Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The 36-kDa protein may be the low density lipoprotein receptor (CD 36) known to be associated with Src kinases (23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H.

A. 1991; 88: 7844-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation pp60c-Src and Fyninduced by gp60 cross-linking in BPMVEC was similar to that observed with BSA stimulation (Fig. 7 D). To assess the relationship between PTK signaling and gp60 activation, we determined whether gp60 and caveolin-1 were phosphorylated following gp60 activation. BPMVEC monolayers were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and BSA was added to the cells for different time intervals, washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with either anti-gp60 Ab or anti-caveolin-1 Ab. BSA (the gp60 ligand) induced the time-dependent phosphorylation of both gp60 and caveolin-1 (Fig.8, A and B). We incubated the BPMVEC with serum-free medium and treated with BSA for 10 min, and the cells were washed, lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-gp60 Ab, and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal Ab (see “Experimental Procedures”). Results indicated that BSA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp60 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 8 C). The anti-phosphotyrosine Ab-blotted membrane was stripped and blotted with anti-gp60 Ab to determine whether the anti-gp60 Ab immunoprecipitated equal amounts of gp60 from the cell lysate. These results indicated that gp60 precipitated by the Ab was similar in each case (Fig.8 D). Because Src kinases were activated by gp60, we studied the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin A and genistein, on 125I-albumin uptake in control and anti-gp60 Ab-activated endothelial cells. Prior to the uptake determination, BPMVEC were washed and incubated with different concentrations of inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C, and these cells were then used for uptake studies as described above (Fig. 2). Both inhibitors produced dose-dependent reductions in125I-albumin uptake in cells activated by gp60 cross-linking and in control cells (Fig.9, A and B). Both herbimycin A and genistein also produced a similar inhibitory effect on transendothelial flux 125I-albumin in gp60-activated endothelial cells (data not shown). In contrast, calphostin C (protein kinase C inhibitor (25Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar)) did not alter gp60-activated macromolecule uptake in BPMVEC (Fig. 9 B, inset). Several ABPs have been identified on the endothelial cell membrane; however, their function in regulating the transendothelial permeability of albumin remains unclear (6Ghinea N. Fixman A.

Attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and to other cells is mediated by integrins. The interactions of integrins with the extracellular matrix activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and suppresses apoptosis in diverse cell types. Members of the tumor necrosis family such as Fas and Apo-2L, also known as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), induce apoptosis in both suspension and adherent cells through the activation of caspases. These caspases, when activated, cleave substrates that are important for the maintenance of nuclear and membrane integrity. In this study, we show that FAK is sequentially cleaved into two different fragments early in Apo-2L-induced apoptosis. We also demonstrate that FAK cleavage is mediated by caspases and that FAK shows unique sensitivity to different caspases. Our results suggest that disruption of FAK may contribute to the morphological changes observed in apoptotic suspension and adherent cells.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological process that is important for the elimination of transformed cells, the elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes, and for the organization of developing tissues (1Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Apoptosis causes characteristic morphological changes that include membrane blebbing, cellular shrinkage, and chromatin condensation that lead to cellular detachment from the substratum in adherent cells or a loss of cell-cell contact in suspension cells (2Wylie A.J.

Cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PARP, poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PARP, poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; ICE, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme. is mediated by the association of integrins with extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin, whereas cell-cell interactions are mediated by the association of integrins with members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that integrins and ECM also promote cell survival. Inhibition of integrin function, for example, leads to loss of cell-cell adhesion and apoptosis in colon epithelial cells, loss of integrin interaction with ECM causes apoptosis of epithelial and endothelial cells (“anoikis”), and ECM suppresses apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells (4Ruoslahti E.

Cells attach to the ECM through focal adhesions which are sites of tight structural attachment of the integrins on the cell membrane to the ECM. The focal adhesion can mediate signal transduction events that affect cellular migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (8Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit of integrins targets the integrin to the focal adhesion (for review see Ref. 9Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Binding of integrins to ECM or clustering of integrins results in activation of specific kinases such as the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/pp125FAK (10Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar).FAK is a tyrosine kinase that localizes to focal adhesions and associates temporally and spatially with integrins (for reviews see Refs. 11Richardson A.

FAK is expressed at low levels in normal cells but is overexpressed in some cancers such as breast and colon cancer (24Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of FAK is not known, but it may regulate the assembly of focal adhesions in spreading or migrating cells or it may participate in a signal transduction pathway to inform the nucleus that a cell is bound to the ECM, which may suppress apoptosis. The first hypothesis is supported by a study that demonstrates that a truncated isoform of FAK (pp41/43FRNK), which is identical to the COOH-terminal domain of full-length FAK, inhibits cell spreading and migration (25Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Richardson and Parsons (25Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) observed that overexpression of FRNK inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, suggesting that FRNK may act as a competitive inhibitor of FAK. The latter hypothesis is supported by recent studies which report the following: 1) FAK suppresses anoikis in epithelial cells; 2) inhibition of FAK in fibroblasts results in apoptosis; 3) attenuation of FAK induces apoptosis in tumor cells; and 4) FAK is cleaved early in myc-induced apoptosis of chick embryo fibroblasts and FAK cleavage, and apoptosis is inhibited by plating the cells on fibronectin or collagen (7Frisch S.M.

Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Members of the tumor necrosis factor family such as Fas ligand and Apo-2L, also known as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), induce apoptosis in cells which express their cognate receptors (30Nagata S.

Apo-2L is more effective in killing adherent cell lines, but apoptosis induced by either ligand is inhibitable by CrmA, a cowpox-derived inhibitor of caspases (33Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Donahue C.J.

The functional significance of some of these cleavage events, however, is less clear.In view of these data that FAK is important for suppressing apoptosis, we examined if Fas- and Apo-2L-induced apoptosis leads to disruption of FAK. We report that FAK is cleaved in suspension and adherent cells during Fas and Apo-2L-induced cell death. FAK cleavage occurred coincident with PARP cleavage or perhaps slightly before and it was mediated by ICE/Ced-3 caspases. Our data suggest that cleavage of FAK by Apo-2L or Fas may cause some of the morphological changes in apoptotic cells. Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological process that is important for the elimination of transformed cells, the elimination of self-reactive lymphocytes, and for the organization of developing tissues (1Steller H.

FAK is expressed at low levels in normal cells but is overexpressed in some cancers such as breast and colon cancer (24Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of FAK is not known, but it may regulate the assembly of focal adhesions in spreading or migrating cells or it may participate in a signal transduction pathway to inform the nucleus that a cell is bound to the ECM, which may suppress apoptosis. The first hypothesis is supported by a study that demonstrates that a truncated isoform of FAK (pp41/43FRNK), which is identical to the COOH-terminal domain of full-length FAK, inhibits cell spreading and migration (25Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Richardson and Parsons (25Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) observed that overexpression of FRNK inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, suggesting that FRNK may act as a competitive inhibitor of FAK. The latter hypothesis is supported by recent studies which report the following: 1) FAK suppresses anoikis in epithelial cells; 2) inhibition of FAK in fibroblasts results in apoptosis; 3) attenuation of FAK induces apoptosis in tumor cells; and 4) FAK is cleaved early in myc-induced apoptosis of chick embryo fibroblasts and FAK cleavage, and apoptosis is inhibited by plating the cells on fibronectin or collagen (7Frisch S.M.

In view of these data that FAK is important for suppressing apoptosis, we examined if Fas- and Apo-2L-induced apoptosis leads to disruption of FAK. We report that FAK is cleaved in suspension and adherent cells during Fas and Apo-2L-induced cell death. FAK cleavage occurred coincident with PARP cleavage or perhaps slightly before and it was mediated by ICE/Ced-3 caspases. Our data suggest that cleavage of FAK by Apo-2L or Fas may cause some of the morphological changes in apoptotic cells. We thank Guiyan Xu for technical assistance.

The endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is targeted to the specialized signal-transducing membrane domains termed plasmalemmal caveolae. Caveolin, the principal structural protein in caveolae, interacts with eNOS and leads to enzyme inhibition in a reversible process modulated by Ca2+-calmodulin (Michel, J. B., Feron, O., Sacks, D., and Michel, T. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15583–15586). Caveolin also interacts with other structurally distinct signaling proteins via a specific region identified within the caveolin sequence (amino acids 82–101) that appears to subserve the role of a “scaffolding domain.” We now report that the co-immunoprecipitation of eNOS with caveolin is completely and specifically blocked by an oligopeptide corresponding to the caveolin scaffolding domain. Peptides corresponding to this domain markedly inhibit nitric oxide synthase activity in endothelial membranes and interact directly with the enzyme to inhibit activity of purified recombinant eNOS expressed in Escherichia coli. The inhibition of purified eNOS by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide is competitive and completely reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin. These studies establish that caveolin, via its scaffolding domain, directly forms an inhibitory complex with eNOS and suggest that caveolin inhibits eNOS by abrogating the enzyme's activation by calmodulin.

These homodimeric proteins share similar overall catalytic schemes to produce NO by the NADPH-, heme-, and O2-dependent oxidation ofl-arginine in a complex reaction involving numerous redox cofactors, and are absolutely dependent on the ability of the enzymes to be allosterically activated by Ca2+-calmodulin. The roles of calmodulin in NOS catalysis have been extensively studied, and the binding of calmodulin appears to facilitate interdomain electron transfer for all three enzyme isoforms. However, the NOS isoforms differ in important aspects of their Ca2+-dependence for enzyme activation by calmodulin. For the endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase isoforms (termed eNOS and nNOS, respectively), transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ promote calmodulin binding and enzyme activation; eNOS and nNOS are characteristically activated as a short-term response to receptor-dependent calcium transients. By contrast, the inflammation-related NOS (iNOS) binds calmodulin avidly and appears to be fully active even at low ambient intracellular calcium levels in immunostimulated cells.The different NOS isoforms may also be distinguished by their subcellular distribution. eNOS is unique among the NOS isoforms in being targeted to the signal-transducing membrane microdomains termed plasmalemmal caveolae (3Shaul P.W.

Plasmalemmal caveolae are cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched domains that appear to function as sites for the sequestration of diverse membrane-targeted signaling proteins (4Anderson R.G.

Biol.

These interactions appear to be mediated through a scaffolding domain comprising a 20 amino acid region (residues 82–101) within the caveolin molecule (5Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to this caveolin scaffolding domain directly interact with c-Src, Ha-Ras, and Gαs and have been shown to inhibit enzymatic activities associated with these signaling proteins (5Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 6Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H.

Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The ability of these peptides to recapitulate the inhibitory action of caveolin suggests that the caveolin scaffolding domain mediates both association with and inhibition by caveolin for diverse proteins. In the current studies, we have extended this paradigm to the analysis of the interactions between caveolin and eNOS and explored the central role of calmodulin in the modulation of this interaction.Recently, we reported the results of transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells in which we showed that the co-expression of eNOS and caveolin leads to a marked inhibition of eNOS enzyme activity (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The enzyme activities of iNOS and nNOS, which are not targeted to caveolae, are not affected by co-transfection with caveolin. Additionally, we found that the interaction between eNOS and caveolin is entirely abrogated by Ca2+-calmodulin, and we also documented that the inhibitory effect of caveolin co-expression on eNOS activity is entirely reversed by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. These data have led us to hypothesize that caveolin and calmodulin regulate eNOS through reciprocal interactions with the enzyme. However, several important questions remain following analyses of these co-transfection experiments. Does caveolin interact directly with eNOS, or are additional docking or adapter proteins required for their association? Is acylation of eNOS required for its interactions with and inhibition by caveolin? Are membrane lipids required? Which domain(s) of caveolin are required for eNOS interaction? Can interactions between purified eNOS and caveolin be reconstituted in vitro? How do caveolin and calmodulin interact in the reciprocal regulation of eNOS activity? In the current studies, we have utilized purified components of the eNOS-caveolin-calmodulin signaling system to pursue answers to these questions. We demonstrate that the caveolin scaffolding domain can potently and specifically mediate inhibition of eNOS activity and that direct interactions involving this domain are required for eNOS-caveolin heteromer formation. In addition, we document that the caveolin scaffolding domain functions as a competitive inhibitor of the allosteric activation of eNOS by Ca2+-calmodulin.DISCUSSIONThe interaction of eNOS with caveolin appears to serve as a key determinant of enzyme activity, and this interaction may be dynamically regulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent activation of NOS in endothelial cells (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The present study utilizes the purified components of this signaling system to provide further insights into the mechanisms whereby caveolin inhibits eNOS. A synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the caveolin scaffolding domain (Cav-1) contains sequences both necessary and sufficient to inhibit enzyme activity of purified eNOS, and the enzyme inhibition promoted by this peptide is completely reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin. These results with purified components further substantiate our prior observations in biological membranes: when eNOS activity is assayed in membranes prepared from COS-7 cells co-transfected with caveolin and eNOS, caveolin co-expression inhibits eNOS activity, and the inhibitory effects of caveolin are entirely abrogated by calmodulin (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In the present studies, it thus appears that the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide can serve as a surrogate for caveolin itself, at least insofar as the regulatory interactions of caveolin and calmodulin with eNOS are concerned.The targeting of eNOS to plasmalemmal caveolae is dependent on the myristoylation and palmitoylation of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 2Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since the eNOS expressed in E. coli is a soluble protein, being neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated, the potent inhibition of bacterially expressed eNOS by the Cav-1 peptide implies that eNOS acylation is not required for productive and appropriately regulated interactions of the enzyme with caveolin. Indeed, these data complement our recent studies of eNOS acylation mutants 2O. Feron, J. B. Michel, K. Sase, and T. Michel, submitted for publication. and indicate that eNOS-caveolin interactions, distinctive from eNOStargeting to caveolae, may still take place even in the absence of eNOS acylation. Clearly, the direct interactions of eNOS, caveolin, and calmodulin can be reconstructed in a soluble system involving purified components, and within the limitations of this experimental system, it appears that additional protein or lipid components are not required.Several lines of investigation provide data suggesting that caveolin and calmodulin do not interact directly; a peptide derived from the calmodulin binding site on eNOS can be shown to bind to calmodulin, but peptides derived from the caveolin scaffolding domain fail to do so (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the caveolin scaffolding domain does not have a typical calmodulin-binding sequence motif (22Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 23O'Neil K.T. Derado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Our previous data failed to show evidence for co-immunoprecipitation between caveolin and calmodulin (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and other calmodulin-dependent enzyme activities including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase do not appear to be inhibited by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide. These negative data do not preclude the possibility that under different experimental conditions the caveolin scaffolding domain (or other sequences within the caveolin molecule) might bind directly to calmodulin. However, the caveolin scaffolding domain does not appear to interact with calmodulin under the experimental conditions utilized in our studies.The binding site for caveolin has not yet been delineated for eNOS, but a sequence motif found in several other caveolin-associated proteins also appears to be present in eNOS (24Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that sequences both within the N- and C-terminal halves of caveolin appear to interact with eNOS in addition to the caveolin scaffolding domain (21Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that the caveolin scaffolding domain is both necessary and sufficient for caveolin to interact with eNOS, and thereby leads to enzyme inhibition. The formation of the heteromeric complex between eNOS and caveolin is completely blocked by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide, Cav-1; the calmodulin-binding domain peptide, CaM-B, which is derived from the eNOS sequence, has no effect on heteromer formation (Fig. 1). In addition, when Cav-1 and CaM-B peptides are mixed in calmodulin gel mobility shift experiments, the addition of the Cav-1 peptide failed to alter calmodulin association with CaM-B (Fig. 5). Although not definitive, these results suggest that eNOS domains distinct from (or in addition to) the eNOS calmodulin binding site may mediate the association of eNOS with the caveolin scaffolding domain.It is unclear how caveolin inhibits such diverse enzymes, variously attenuating the GTPase activity of Ha-Ras and G protein α-subunits, the tyrosine kinase activity of Src, as well as the NO synthase activity of eNOS. Our enzyme kinetic analyses (Fig. 4) reveal that caveolin appears to serve as a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent eNOS activation. However, the precise nature of this inhibition may be more complex than can be elucidated by these limited kinetic analyses, and the eNOS-caveolin interaction may be modulated further by interactions of these proteins with other lipid and protein constituents present in biological membranes. Aside from eNOS, the other caveolin-modulated signaling proteins are not known to be calmodulin-dependent; elements of higher order structure, as yet unidentified, may serve as the basis for caveolin inhibition of NOS activity. The ability of caveolin to dramatically alter the K a for calmodulin likely represents an important mechanism influencing eNOS activation, as the calmodulin-modulated interactions of eNOS with caveolin may be subject to both hormonal regulation and the influences of hemodynamic shear stress associated with changes in intracellular Ca2+. The interactions of eNOS with calmodulin versus caveolin provide a novel example of the reciprocal regulation of enzyme activity by competing allosteric protein-protein interactions.

Smart E.J. Robinson L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Plasmalemmal caveolae are cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched domains that appear to function as sites for the sequestration of diverse membrane-targeted signaling proteins (4Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Several signaling proteins, including eNOS, have been shown to interact with caveolin, an oligomeric integral membrane protein that appears to serve as the structural “scaffold” within caveolae.

Biol.

These interactions appear to be mediated through a scaffolding domain comprising a 20 amino acid region (residues 82–101) within the caveolin molecule (5Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to this caveolin scaffolding domain directly interact with c-Src, Ha-Ras, and Gαs and have been shown to inhibit enzymatic activities associated with these signaling proteins (5Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 6Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H.

Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The ability of these peptides to recapitulate the inhibitory action of caveolin suggests that the caveolin scaffolding domain mediates both association with and inhibition by caveolin for diverse proteins. In the current studies, we have extended this paradigm to the analysis of the interactions between caveolin and eNOS and explored the central role of calmodulin in the modulation of this interaction. Recently, we reported the results of transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells in which we showed that the co-expression of eNOS and caveolin leads to a marked inhibition of eNOS enzyme activity (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The enzyme activities of iNOS and nNOS, which are not targeted to caveolae, are not affected by co-transfection with caveolin. Additionally, we found that the interaction between eNOS and caveolin is entirely abrogated by Ca2+-calmodulin, and we also documented that the inhibitory effect of caveolin co-expression on eNOS activity is entirely reversed by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. These data have led us to hypothesize that caveolin and calmodulin regulate eNOS through reciprocal interactions with the enzyme. However, several important questions remain following analyses of these co-transfection experiments. Does caveolin interact directly with eNOS, or are additional docking or adapter proteins required for their association? Is acylation of eNOS required for its interactions with and inhibition by caveolin? Are membrane lipids required? Which domain(s) of caveolin are required for eNOS interaction? Can interactions between purified eNOS and caveolin be reconstituted in vitro? How do caveolin and calmodulin interact in the reciprocal regulation of eNOS activity? In the current studies, we have utilized purified components of the eNOS-caveolin-calmodulin signaling system to pursue answers to these questions. We demonstrate that the caveolin scaffolding domain can potently and specifically mediate inhibition of eNOS activity and that direct interactions involving this domain are required for eNOS-caveolin heteromer formation. In addition, we document that the caveolin scaffolding domain functions as a competitive inhibitor of the allosteric activation of eNOS by Ca2+-calmodulin. DISCUSSIONThe interaction of eNOS with caveolin appears to serve as a key determinant of enzyme activity, and this interaction may be dynamically regulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent activation of NOS in endothelial cells (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The present study utilizes the purified components of this signaling system to provide further insights into the mechanisms whereby caveolin inhibits eNOS. A synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the caveolin scaffolding domain (Cav-1) contains sequences both necessary and sufficient to inhibit enzyme activity of purified eNOS, and the enzyme inhibition promoted by this peptide is completely reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin. These results with purified components further substantiate our prior observations in biological membranes: when eNOS activity is assayed in membranes prepared from COS-7 cells co-transfected with caveolin and eNOS, caveolin co-expression inhibits eNOS activity, and the inhibitory effects of caveolin are entirely abrogated by calmodulin (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In the present studies, it thus appears that the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide can serve as a surrogate for caveolin itself, at least insofar as the regulatory interactions of caveolin and calmodulin with eNOS are concerned.The targeting of eNOS to plasmalemmal caveolae is dependent on the myristoylation and palmitoylation of the enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 2Sase K. Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Since the eNOS expressed in E. coli is a soluble protein, being neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated, the potent inhibition of bacterially expressed eNOS by the Cav-1 peptide implies that eNOS acylation is not required for productive and appropriately regulated interactions of the enzyme with caveolin. Indeed, these data complement our recent studies of eNOS acylation mutants 2O. Feron, J. B. Michel, K. Sase, and T. Michel, submitted for publication. and indicate that eNOS-caveolin interactions, distinctive from eNOStargeting to caveolae, may still take place even in the absence of eNOS acylation. Clearly, the direct interactions of eNOS, caveolin, and calmodulin can be reconstructed in a soluble system involving purified components, and within the limitations of this experimental system, it appears that additional protein or lipid components are not required.Several lines of investigation provide data suggesting that caveolin and calmodulin do not interact directly; a peptide derived from the calmodulin binding site on eNOS can be shown to bind to calmodulin, but peptides derived from the caveolin scaffolding domain fail to do so (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the caveolin scaffolding domain does not have a typical calmodulin-binding sequence motif (22Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 23O'Neil K.T. Derado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Our previous data failed to show evidence for co-immunoprecipitation between caveolin and calmodulin (8Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and other calmodulin-dependent enzyme activities including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase do not appear to be inhibited by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide. These negative data do not preclude the possibility that under different experimental conditions the caveolin scaffolding domain (or other sequences within the caveolin molecule) might bind directly to calmodulin. However, the caveolin scaffolding domain does not appear to interact with calmodulin under the experimental conditions utilized in our studies.The binding site for caveolin has not yet been delineated for eNOS, but a sequence motif found in several other caveolin-associated proteins also appears to be present in eNOS (24Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that sequences both within the N- and C-terminal halves of caveolin appear to interact with eNOS in addition to the caveolin scaffolding domain (21Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that the caveolin scaffolding domain is both necessary and sufficient for caveolin to interact with eNOS, and thereby leads to enzyme inhibition. The formation of the heteromeric complex between eNOS and caveolin is completely blocked by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide, Cav-1; the calmodulin-binding domain peptide, CaM-B, which is derived from the eNOS sequence, has no effect on heteromer formation (Fig. 1). In addition, when Cav-1 and CaM-B peptides are mixed in calmodulin gel mobility shift experiments, the addition of the Cav-1 peptide failed to alter calmodulin association with CaM-B (Fig. 5). Although not definitive, these results suggest that eNOS domains distinct from (or in addition to) the eNOS calmodulin binding site may mediate the association of eNOS with the caveolin scaffolding domain.It is unclear how caveolin inhibits such diverse enzymes, variously attenuating the GTPase activity of Ha-Ras and G protein α-subunits, the tyrosine kinase activity of Src, as well as the NO synthase activity of eNOS. Our enzyme kinetic analyses (Fig. 4) reveal that caveolin appears to serve as a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin-dependent eNOS activation. However, the precise nature of this inhibition may be more complex than can be elucidated by these limited kinetic analyses, and the eNOS-caveolin interaction may be modulated further by interactions of these proteins with other lipid and protein constituents present in biological membranes. Aside from eNOS, the other caveolin-modulated signaling proteins are not known to be calmodulin-dependent; elements of higher order structure, as yet unidentified, may serve as the basis for caveolin inhibition of NOS activity. The ability of caveolin to dramatically alter the K a for calmodulin likely represents an important mechanism influencing eNOS activation, as the calmodulin-modulated interactions of eNOS with caveolin may be subject to both hormonal regulation and the influences of hemodynamic shear stress associated with changes in intracellular Ca2+. The interactions of eNOS with calmodulin versus caveolin provide a novel example of the reciprocal regulation of enzyme activity by competing allosteric protein-protein interactions. The interaction of eNOS with caveolin appears to serve as a key determinant of enzyme activity, and this interaction may be dynamically regulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent activation of NOS in endothelial cells (8Michel J.B.

https://openalex.org/W1541234884,"The cloning of a novel estrogen receptor beta (denoted ERbeta) has recently been described (Kuiper, G. G. J. M., Enmark, E., Pelto-Huikko, M., Nilsson, S., and Gustafsson, J-A. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5925-5930 and Mosselman, S., Polman, J. , and Dijkema, R. (1996) FEBS Lett. 392, 49-53). ERbeta is highly homologous to the classical estrogen receptor alpha (here referred to as ERalpha), has been shown to bind estrogens with an affinity similar to that of ERalpha, and activates expression of reporter genes containing estrogen response elements in an estrogen-dependent manner. Here we describe functional studies comparing the DNA binding abilities of human ERalpha and beta in gel shift assays. We show that DNA binding by ERalpha and beta are similarly affected by elevated temperature in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 17beta-estradiol and the partial estrogen agonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. In the absence of ligand, DNA binding by ERalpha and beta is rapidly lost at 37 degrees C, while in the presence of 17beta-estradiol and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, the loss in DNA binding at elevated temperature is much more gradual. We show that the loss in DNA binding is not due to degradation of the receptor proteins. However, while the complete antagonist ICI 182, 780 does not human ERalpha (hERalpha) from loss of DNA binding at elevated temperature in vitro, it does appear to protect human ERbeta (hERbeta), suggestive of differences in the way ICI 182, 780 acts on hERalpha and beta. We further report that ERalpha and beta can dimerize with each other, the DNA binding domain of hERalpha being sufficient for dimerization with hERbeta. Cell and promoter-specific transcription activation by ERalpha has been shown to be dependent on the differential action of the N- and C-terminal transcription activation functions AF-1 and AF-2, respectively. The existence of a second estrogen receptor gene and the dimerization of ERalpha and beta add greater levels of complexity to transcription activation in response to estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W2166710182,"Exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells. The mechanism by which UV radiation engages the suicide apparatus is unclear. Here we demonstrate that UV radiation can activate the Fas pathway via receptor aggregation and subsequent recruitment of the death adaptor molecule FADD/MORT1. UV radiation-induced apoptosis was inhibited by both a dominant negative version of FADD (FADD-DN) and the caspase inhibitor CrmA. Thus, activation of the Fas pathway represents a physiologic mechanism by which UV-damaged cells are eliminated. Exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) can induce apoptosis in mammalian cells.

Depletion of the ozone layer by chloro/fluorohydrocarbon pollutants and subsequent increase in exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation threatens to significantly increase the incidence of skin cancer. In addition, exposure to UV radiation can lead to photokeratitis, photoconjunctivitis, and permanent retinal blindness. UV irradiation of cells elicits a complex cellular response termed the UV response, which includes the post-translational activation of pre-existing transcription factors including NF-κB and AP-1 (1Devary Y.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Huang R.P. Adamson E.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 467-475PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged UV exposure results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and subsequent resumption of the cell cycle following repair or apoptosis, a mechanism to rid the organism of irreversibly damaged and potentially cancerous cells. Little is known about the mechanism by which UV radiation triggers apoptosis. It is now evident that the effector arm of the death pathway is composed of caspases, cysteine proteases that cleave death substrates including PARP and lamin B following aspartate residues (reviewed in Ref. 5Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To date ten caspases have been identified. They are normally present as single polypeptide inactive zymogens and require cleavage at internal aspartic acid residues to generate the 2-subunit catalytically competent protease. The best understood pathway leading to caspase activation is engagement of the death receptor, CD-95 (Fas/APO-1). Upon activation, an adapter molecule termed FADD is recruited to the cytoplasmic segment of the Fas receptor through a homophilic interaction between a stretch of 60–80 amino acids, dubbed the death domain that is present in both molecules. The N-terminal segment of FADD encodes a distinct binding module termed the death effector domain (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Remarkably, an equivalent domain, is present within the prodomain of FLICE (caspase-8). Interaction between the death effector domains allows for the recruitment of the death protease FLICE to the receptor signaling complex. Following conversion to the active dimeric species, FLICE is free to proteolytically activate other downstream zymogen caspases (7Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), leading to cleavage of death substrates and subsequent apoptotic demise. The ability of enucleated cells to mount a UV response has led to the suggestion that membrane or cytosolic events likely mediate the response (8Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Nature. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Google Scholar). UV exposure for example induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, suggesting a prominent role for membrane initiated events in the UV response (9Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rhamsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has recently been demonstrated that UV-irradiation results in clustering and subsequent activation of the EGF, IL-1, and TNF receptors, and this contributes to the activation of the JNK cascade observed within minutes of exposure to UV radiation (10Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Given this, we hypothesized that UV-irradiation may induce apoptosis by activation of cell surface death receptors, the prototypic example being CD-95. The MCF7 and BJAB stably transfected cell lines used in this study have been described previously (11Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1%l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The transfected MCF7 cell lines were grown in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the transfected BJAB cell lines were grown in 3 mg/ml G418 sulfate. Freshly seeded cells were irradiated in at room temperature without growth media with a germicidal UV light (254 nm). The fluence of the UV light source was measured prior to each experiment with a UVX radiometer (UVP, Inc.). Following irradiation, the cells were supplied with media and incubated for the indicated time. Apoptotic morphology was assessed by using DNA-staining dyes. For propidium iodide (Sigma) staining, MCF7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells onto chamber slides (Nunc, Inc.). Following irradiation, both treated and control slides were incubated for 48 h prior to staining. Slides were rinsed 2 times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, rinsed 3 times with PBS, and stained at room temperature for 10 min in a 100 μg/ml solution of propidium iodide in PBS. After staining, the slides were rinsed 2 times with PBS, blotted dry, and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). BJAB cells (1–2 × 106) were stained using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). After a 48-h incubation, both control and irradiated cells were rinsed 2 times with PBS, stained at room temperature for 30 min in a 0.8 mg/ml solution of Hoechst 33342 in PBS, rinsed 2 times with PBS, and wet mounted using 20 μl of the cell suspension. Slides were examined immediately after staining using a Leitz Laborlux S microscope. Apoptotic cells were quantitated based on nuclear morphology using fluorescence microscopy, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated. A minimum of 100 cells were counted for each sample, and each experiment was done in triplicate. Logarithmically growing cells were irradiated with 10 joules of UV radiation and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml. They were then mixed with an equal volume of a 1.4% suspension of low melting point agarose (Bio-Rad). The mixture was poured in a mold and allowed to solidify. The agar blocks were treated for 24 h at 56 °C with lysis solution (100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl) containing proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and Sarkosyl (1%), after which lysis solution was replaced with storage buffer (50 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris). PFGE was performed using a CHEF Mapper (Bio-Rad) at 10 °C in the 2-state mode with linear ramping. State 1 was 30 h with a 120° included angle, 1.9 V/cm, and a switching interval of 90 s. State 2 was 51 h with an included angle of 120°, 1.9 V/cm, and a switching interval of 40 min. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide (5 μg/ml) and photographed. 15 million BJAB cells were mock irradiated or treated with 15 or 30 joules of UV irradiation and incubated for 20 min. Cells were pelleted and washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS and treated with 2 mm cleavable cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate] (Pierce) for 15 min on ice, and the reaction was quenched with 10 mm ammonium acetate for 10 min. The cells were pelleted and washed twice in PBS and lysed using 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) on ice for 30 min with agitation. The lysates were then used for immunoprecipitations in the presence of an anti-Fas antibody (Apo-1, Kamiya Labs, CA) at 0.5 μg/ml (antibody limiting) or 10 μg/ml (antibody excess). Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and washed three times in lysis buffer. The precipitate was resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved samples were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.) membrane for Western blot analysis. The presence of CD-95 or associated molecules was then detected using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies followed by detection using chemiluminescence (Pierce). BJAB cells were UV irradiated with 30 joules or were mock-irradiated. After 20 min, they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for immunofluorescence using an anti-CD-95 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) followed by an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Fas-receptor specific immunostaining was visualized and photographed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal microscope with a × 60 objective. Ligand dependent activation of CD-95 requires multimerization though ligand independent activation can occur upon oligomerization following overexpression (12Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that UV-induced apoptosis used components of the CD-95 death pathway, we analyzed MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and its transfected derivative line MCF-7-Fas, which constitutively expresses approximately 5-fold more CD-95 receptor (12Jaattela M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7-Fas cells were significantly more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig.1, A and B). To examine if UV irradiation induced CD-95 multimerization, we utilized an immunoprecipitation protocol (Fig.2, A and B) employing limiting antibody conditions that would preferentially immunoprecipitate oligomerized receptor. At limiting antibody concentrations, there appeared to be a linear relationship between the amount of CD-95 immunoprecipitated and the UV dose. As expected, this relationship was not observed under conditions of antibody excess (Fig.2 B). UV-induced CD-95 multimerization was not a cell line-specific phenomenon as it was also observed in both BJAB and Jurkat cells (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence experiments using CD-95-specific antibodies were also performed to visualize CD-95 oligomerization upon UV irradiation (Fig. 2 C). In the absence of treatment, CD-95 was visualized heterogenously on the cell surface. Upon treatment with UV, CD-95 immunoreactivity was detected as very large, brightly staining aggregates.Figure 2UV irradiation results in Fas-receptor multimerization. A, diagrammatic representation of the experimental design for panel B. The basic principle is that, when antibody is limiting, more molecules of the Fas-receptor will be immunoprecipitated if aggregation occurs after UV-treatment. In contrast, when antibody is not limiting, equal amounts of Fas-receptor should be immunoprecipitated. B, BJAB cells that were unirradiated controls or irradiated with 15 and 30 joules were treated with the cross-linking reagent 3,3′-dithiobis[sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate] and lysed for immunoprecipitation using a Fas-specific antibody (ApoI) as described above under antibody (Ab) limiting conditions (top panel) or antibody excess conditions (bottom panel). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate was done using a Fas-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). C, control and UV-irradiated BJAB cells (30 joules) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for indirect immunofluorescense using a Fas-specific antibody as described above. Cells were viewed and photographed using a confocal microscope with a × 60 objective.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate if UV irradiation-mediated multimerization of CD-95 resulted in recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed (Fig.3). Immunoprecipitation of CD-95 followed by immunoblotting using a FADD-specific antiserum, revealed a UV dose-dependent increase in the association of FADD with CD-95. This phenomenon was observed in Jurkat (data not shown) and BJAB cells. FADD serves as a conduit for death signals from other death receptors including TNFR1 and DR3 (13Chinnaiyan A.M O'Rourke K. Yu G.L Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R. Xing L. Gentz R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1996; 274: 990-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A dominant negative version of FADD (FADD-DN) that lacks the death effector domain and is therefore unable to recruit FLICE inhibits cell death induced by all three receptors (CD95, TNFR1, and DR3). If UV irradiation was inducing apoptosis by activating death receptors, then the observed cell death should be inhibited by FADD-DN. Indeed, cells expressing FADD-DN (MCF7-FADD-DN) were significantly more resistant to UV-induced apoptosis than their vector-transfected counterparts (Fig. 4,A-C). Forty-eight h following UV irradiation, vector-transfected MCF-7 cells had morphological features typical of apoptosis (Fig. 4 A, top panel), including cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear condensation. The ability of FADD-DN to protect from UV-induced apoptosis was also observed with BJAB cells (Fig. 4 D). In contrast to differences seen with UV irradiation, the sensitivity to apoptosis of CD-95-overexpressing cell lines, as well as FADD-DN-expressing cells, did not differ significantly from control cell lines upon γ irradiation (Fig.4 E). These results indicate that CD-95 and FADD are not involved in γ radiation-induced apoptosis. Consistent with the involvement of the FADD-FLICE axis in UV irradiation-induced cell death was finding the CrmA, a poxvirus-encoded serpin that preferentially inhibits FLICE-blocked UV-induced cell death. Expression of CrmA, but not an active site mutant, CrmA-mut (11Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), resulted in attenuation of UV-induced apoptosis as determined by inhibition of DNA fragmentation (Fig.5). The results presented here for the first time delineate the pathway involved in UV-induced apoptosis. UV-mediated olimerization of CD-95 and likely other death receptors is the initiating event that triggers the downstream FADD-FLICE death effector pathway. The mechanism by which UV irradiation induces receptor oligomerization remains unclear. We speculate, however, that energy transfer to cell surface receptors may induce conformational changes that allow for oligomerization and engagement of the downstream signaling machinery.

In Mv1Lu cells containing a p27 inducible system, a 6-fold increase over the basal p27 level completely inhibited Cdk2 and cell cycle progression. In contrast, the same or a larger increase in p27 levels did not inhibit Cdk4 or its homologue Cdk6, despite extensive binding to these kinases.

Cell cycle transitions are controlled by the action of the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Cak, Cdk-activating kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma. and their activating subunits, the cyclins (1Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cyclin D-Cdk4 or -Cdk6, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin A-Cdk2 act sequentially during the G1/S transition and are required for cell cycle progression through this period. Cdk activity is tightly regulated by a combination of mechanisms, including changes in the cyclin or Cdk levels, phosphorylation of positive and negative regulatory sites, and interaction with stoichiometric inhibitors (3Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). The latter in particular act as mediators of a wide range of antimitogenic signals. However, their specific functions are still poorly understood. Two families of stoichiometric Cdk inhibitors have been described (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The Ink4 family, which includes p16Ink4a (5Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D.

This interaction is mediated by a homologous domain (18Luo Y. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19WaRbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M.

Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Cip/Kip proteins have higher affinity for G1 and S phase Cdks than for mitotic Cdks, and their overexpression causes G1 arrest, suggesting that they primarily regulate G1 and S phase Cdks in vivo. Cdk regulation by inhibitors is an important step in linking mitogenic or antimitogenic signals to cell cycle progression. Cdk inhibitors are thought to set thresholds for cyclin-Cdk activity by setting levels that cyclin-Cdk complexes must surpass to become active (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). According to this model, cell cycle progression or arrest would depend on the relative concentration of inhibitors and Cdks; a decrease in cyclin-Cdk components or an increase in inhibitor levels would prevent the accumulation of inhibitor-free cyclin-Cdk complexes, thus inhibiting cell cycle progression. Evidence for this type of mechanism has emerged. For example, p53 inhibits G1 progression following radiation-induced DNA damage in part by elevating p21 expression (10El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

However, the notion that Cdks are equivalent targets of p27 proteins and the concept that inhibitor-Cdk interactions are simply governed by their relative abundance in the cell are challenged by various observations. In vitro, p27 is a more effective inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk2 than of cyclin D-Cdk4 (14Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J.

During periods of proliferation as well as during exit from the cell cycle, it has been observed that p27 shuttles between Cdk4/6 and Cdk2 complexes even though the levels of p27, Cdk2, and Cdk4 may remain constant (28Poon R.Y.C.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although biochemical and structural evidence (23Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A. Massagué J. Pavletich N. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) argues that the p27-cyclin A-Cdk2 complex is inactive, p27 immunoprecipitated from proliferating human B cell lymphoma was shown to be associated with retinoblastoma protein (Rb) kinase activity that could be significantly depleted with antibodies against Cdk6 (41Soos T.J. Kiyokawa H. Yan J.S. Rubin M.S. Giordano A. DeBlasio A. Bottega S. Wong B. Mendelsohn J. Koff A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have raised the possibility that in some conditions at least, p27 may interact differently with Cdk2 and Cdk4/6 complexes, with p27 binding not necessarily causing Cdk4/6 inhibition. In the present work, we have investigated the idea whether p27-associated Cdk4 or Cdk6 complexes might exist as active kinases in vitro as well as in vivo. Here we report on the existence of p27-cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes that are largely active, whereas similar complexes of p27 with cyclin A-Cdk2 are essentially inactive. Mv1Lu cells expressing a tetracycline-regulated p27 expression system (37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J.

The culture medium was then switched to medium containing different tetracycline concentrations. After 18 h, the cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) as described previously (42Matsushime H.

Immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western immunoblot analysis with p27, Cdk4 (Pharmigen), or Cdk6 (Santa Cruz) antibodies by standard techniques. Total cell extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Western immunoblot analysis with p27 or Rb antibodies (Pharmigen). Immunocomplexes were assayed for Rb kinase activity as described previously (42Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell.

For immunodepletion, extracts were subjected to four cycles of immunoprecipitation with Cdk4 and Cdk6 antibodies or to four cycles with normal rabbit serum. The depleted extract was then immunoprecipitated with p27 antibodies, split, and assayed by Western immunoblotting with Cdk4 and Cdk6 antibodies, and assayed for Rb kinase activity.

Cell. 1990; 62: 175-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) after 18 h of incubation in the indicated tetracycline concentrations. Data are averages of triplicate determinations and are plotted as percentage relative to the cpm incorporated in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Fixed amounts of insect cell lysates containing baculovirally expressed cyclin A and Cdk2 or cyclin D2 and Cdk4 (45Kato J.-Y. Matsushime H. Hiebert S. Ewen M. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of bacterially expressed p27 or p21 and assayed (18Luo Y. Hurwitz J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2), containing 30 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and a GST-Rb fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Radioactivity incorporated into GST-Rb was quantified and plotted as a percentage relative to controls without p27. The baculoviral cyclin-Cdk complexes were prepared as described (46Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The p27 and p21 proteins were tagged at their C termini with a hexahistidine sequence and purified from Escherichia coli as described (14Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Cdk2-associated complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation either with Cdk2 antibodies or via a HA epitope tag at the C terminus of Cdk2 (46Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and Cdk4 or cyclin A-associated complexes with Cdk4 (Santa Cruz) or cyclin A (Santa Cruz) antibodies, respectively. p27-associated complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation with p27 antibodies (37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), and p21-associated complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation with p21 antibodies (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitations were performed in modified LSLD buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0. 1% Tween 20, 80 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml benzamidine) (37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), with the indicated antibody for 1–2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes were assayed for kinase activity as described above. The same antibodies and cyclin D2 antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used for Western immunoblotting. The amount of complex used in the specific activity assays was normalized by immunoblotting for the component that was not used for immunoprecipitation. Cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes expressed in insect cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p27 or Cdk4 antibodies. The immunocomplexes were incubated in a 50-μl reaction volume of Cak activation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mmMgCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 80 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml benzamidine) with or without 50 ng of purified baculovirally expressed cyclin H-Cdk7, for 1 h at 22 °C, essentially as described (25Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Cak was prepared as described (47Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were washed three times in LSLD buffer and then subjected to Rb kinase assays as described above. p27 was tagged at the N terminus with the Flag epitope sequence, expressed in E. coli, and purified on Flag-agarose beads (Eastman Kodak Co.) as described (16Lee M.-H. Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 29Lee M.-H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.-H. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). p27His-cyclin D2-Cdk4 complexes were isolated by binding to metal-agarose beads (Talon beads,CLONTECH). 260 nm p27Flagwas added to these immobilized complexes and incubated on ice, with constant mixing for 30 min. The complexes were extensively washed three times with LSLD buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and Western analysis with Cdk4 (Santa Cruz) and Flag antibodies (Kodak). Cyclin D2-Cdk4, cyclin D2, or Cdk4-containing baculoviral extracts were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was injected onto a Superose 12 column, HR 10/30 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), pre-equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and using fast protein liquid chromatography 0.5-ml fractions (0.35 ml/min) were collected. The void volume of the column was 8.3 ml. Molecular weight markers (Sigma) were subjected to gel filtration separately and monitored by UV absorption and SDS-PAGE analysis. Fractions 1–50 were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western immunoblotting with Cdk4 (Santa Cruz) or cyclin D2 (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Densitometric quantitation of the Cdk4 or cyclin D2 band was plotted as a percent of maximal immunoreactivity. Radioactivity incorporated into GST-Rb was quantified and plotted as a percentage of maximal phosphorylation. We compared the ability of p27 to inhibit Cdk2 and Cdk4 in vivo by examining its interaction with these Cdks in the Tet-p27 cell line. Tet-p27 is a derivative of the mink lung epithelial cell line (Mv1Lu) that expresses human p27 under the control of a tetracycline transactivator (37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 48Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). In media containing a high concentration of tetracycline (1 μg/ml), Tet-p27 cells do not express exogenous p27, and their basal level of endogenous p27 is similar to the level in parental Mv1Lu cells (37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In proliferating Mv1Lu and Tet-p27 cells, p27 is bound to cyclin D-Cdk4 (Fig. 1 c) and, to a lesser extent, cyclin D-Cdk6 (Fig. 1 d) and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes (Fig. 1 e). By lowering the tetracycline concentration, the p27 level in Tet-p27 cells can be gradually increased up to 25-fold over basal (Fig. 1 b), with a concomitant increase in the level of p27-bound Cdk2 or Cdk2-bound p27 (Fig. 1 e; Ref.37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), a complete loss of Cdk2-associated histone H1 kinase activity and Rb kinase activity (Fig. 1, f and g), and inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1 a; Ref. 37Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). A 6-fold increase in p27 levels is sufficient to completely inhibit Cdk2-associated kinase activity on both substrates (Fig. 1,f and g). As cyclin E-Cdk2 levels remain constant during this treatment, 2I. Reynisdóttir and J. Massagué, unpublished results. the loss of Cdk2 kinase activity is due to its increased association with p27. p27 immunoprecipitates did not contain histone H1 kinase activity even when derived from cells not overexpressing p27 (Fig.1 i), in which the level of Cdk2-associated kinase activity was high. Among G1 Cdks, Cdk2, Cdk4, and its close isoform Cdk6, all have Rb kinase activity in vitro, whereas only Cdk2 has histone H1 kinase activity (49Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.-Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). This suggested that p27-associated Cdk2 is largely inactive, an observation consistent with previous results (23Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A. Massagué J. Pavletich N. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 41Soos T.J. Kiyokawa H. Yan J.S. Rubin M.S. Giordano A. DeBlasio A. Bottega S. Wong B. Mendelsohn J. Koff A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar). A marked increase in p27 levels led only to a small (less than 2-fold) increase in the amount of p27-bound Cdk4 in the Tet-p27 cells (Fig.1 c), suggesting that most of the cyclin D-Cdk4 present in proliferating Mv1Lu cells is already bound to p27. A larger increase was observed in the level of p27-bound Cdk6 (Fig. 1 d), indicating an interesting difference in the ability of Cdk4 and Cdk6 to interact with p27. p27 immunoprecipitated from Tet-p27 cells was associated with Rb kinase activity (Fig. 1 j), which declined only partially at the highest p27 concentrations. Due to a lack of suitable antibodies against the mink proteins (the available immunprecipitating antibodies do not yield catalytically active complexes), it was not possible to directly assay cyclin D- or Cdk4/6-associated Rb kinase activity in these cells. However, immunodepletion of both kinases from cell lysates prevented the subsequent recovery of p27-associated Rb kinase activity (Fig.1 k), whereas immunodepletion with normal rabbit serum did not have any effect on p27-associated Rb kinase activity. This suggests that the majority of the Rb kinase activity in p27 immunocomplexes is due to bound Cdk4 and/or Cdk6. p27 was associated with Rb kinase activity even when precipitated from cells that contained enough p27 to cause a complete inhibition of Cdk2 (Fig. 1, f and i, lanes 2–7). The presence of Rb kinase activity in p27 complexes from these cells correlated with the presence of hyperphosphorylated Rb protein in the cells, as indicated by the levels of the slow migrating Rb band in Western immunoblotting of cell lysates with Rb antibodies (Fig. 1 h). Rb hyperphosphorylation did decrease at the highest p27 concentration, and this correlated with a decrease in p27-associated Rb kinase activity. These results therefore suggest that a large portion of Cdk4 in the exponentially growing cells is bound to p27, that p27-bound Cdk4 or Cdk6 can be active as kinases, and that p27 may not effectively inhibit these kinases in vivo. In an attempt to explain the above described phenomena, we analyzed the ability of p27 to inhibit Cdk2 and Cdk4. We measured the ability of bacterially expressed p27 to inhibit the Rb kinase activity of baculovirally expressed cyclin A-Cdk2 or cyclin D2-Cdk4 in insect cell extracts (46Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin D2-Cdk4 extracts contained a similar amount of catalytically inactive complexes, as determined by their ability to be further activated by the addition of exogenous Cak (see below). Rb kinase assays were conducted under conditions of Rb substrate excess, in the linear range of the kinase reaction, and using two different concentrations of the kinases. The use of the higher concentration allowed the visualization of p27- and Cdk-associated complexes by immunoblotting analysis. Although a 100-fold higher p27 concentration range was needed to achieve the same level of inhibition when the 100-fold higher cyclin-Cdk concentration was assayed, the inhibition profile was the same in both cases (Fig.2 a). The p27 inhibition profile was also the same when Cdk immunoprecipitated complexes were assayed (Fi"

We have now investigated the interaction of neurexin 1β with neuroligin 1 to evaluate their potential to function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules. Using detergent-solubilized neuroligins and secreted neurexin 1β-IgG fusion protein, we observed binding of these proteins to each other only in the presence of Ca2+ and in no other divalent cation tested. Only neurexin 1β lacking an insert in splice site 4 bound neuroligins, whereas neurexin 1β containing an insert was inactive. Half-maximal binding required 1–3 μm free Ca2+, which probably acts by binding to neuroligin 1 but not to neurexin 1β. To determine if neurexin 1β and neuroligin 1 can also interact with each other when present in a native membrane environment on the cell surface, we generated transfected cell lines expressing neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1β. Upon mixing different cell populations, we found that cells aggregate only if cells expressing neurexin 1β are mixed with cells expressing neuroligin 1. Aggregation was dependent on Ca2+ and was inhibited by the addition of soluble neurexin 1β lacking an insert in splice site 4 but not by the addition of neurexin 1β containing an insert in splice site 4. We conclude that neurexin 1β and neuroligin 1 (and, by extension, other β-neurexins and neuroligins) function as heterophilic cell adhesion molecules in a Ca2+-dependent reaction that is regulated by alternative splicing of β-neurexins. β-Neurexins and neuroligins are plasma membrane proteins that are displayed on the neuronal cell surface.

Neurons in the brain are connected to each other by thousands of synapses, creating a dense network of communicating cells. Cell recognition processes between neurons are likely to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of this network, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Neurexins constitute a family of polymorphic cell surface proteins that are candidates for mediating cell recognition between neurons (1Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 2Geppert M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Three mammalian genes for neurexins are known. Each gene has two promoters that drive the synthesis of long and short classes of transcripts (1Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 2Geppert M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The long transcripts encode α-neurexins, and the short transcripts encode β-neurexins. Both transcripts are detectable only in neurons (1Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar,5Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). α- and β-neurexins are type I membrane proteins that resemble cell surface receptors and are composed of canonical sets of domains. The extracellular sequences of α-neurexins contain a classical N-terminal signal peptide followed by six weakly homologous repeats with interspersed EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; LNS, laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding globulin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. -like sequences. The six repeats are related to repeated sequences found in a number of proteins and were first described in the G domain of laminin A, sex hormone-binding globulin, and neurexins (1Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 6Joseph D.R. Baker M.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2477-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason we call these repeats LNS (laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding globulin) domains. In α-neurexins, EGF-like sequences are placed after the first, third, and fifth LNS domain. After the sixth LNS domain, α-neurexins contain a short serine/threonine-rich sequence that is probably O-glycosylated (4Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the C terminus, α-neurexins have a single transmembrane region followed by a conserved short cytoplasmic sequence (55 amino acids). β-Neurexins are largely identical with α-neurexins except that they lack the first five LNS domains and the three EGF-like sequences. Instead, their N terminus is composed of an atypical signal peptide that is cleaved in vivo and is followed by a short sequence specific for β-neurexins (4Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the β-neurexins is identical with the C-terminal half of the α-neurexins starting with the sixth LNS domain. The major difference between α- and β-neurexins is that α-neurexins contain five LNS and three EGF domains at the N terminus that are absent from β-neurexins. Therefore, β-neurexins are N-terminally truncated forms of α-neurexins with a short unique N-terminal sequence. All neurexin transcripts are subject to extensive alternative splicing that may result in thousands of isoforms (5Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). There are five sites of alternative splicing in α-neurexins, labeled splice sites 1–5. By contrast, β-neurexins have only two sites of alternative splicing that correspond to splice sites 4 and 5 of α-neurexins. Different neurons express distinct combinations of differentially spliced α- and β-neurexins (5Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical neurexins, a protein in Drosophila was recently called neurexin IV whose human homologue is CASPR (8Baumgartner S. Littleton J.T. Broadie K. Bhat M.A. Harbecke R. Lengyel J.A. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 9Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M. Grumet M. Schilling J. Martinez R. Plowman G.D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This protein has an interesting function in Drosophila development but should not be considered a neurexin, because it is only distantly homologous to vertebrate neurexins, has a different domain structure, is expressed outside of the nervous system, and is not subjected to alternative splicing. The properties of its human homologue suggest a developmental function distinct from neurexins (9Peles E. Nativ M. Lustig M. Grumet M. Schilling J. Martinez R. Plowman G.D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Neuroligins represent a family of cell surface proteins that were discovered because they were stoichiometrically purified on an affinity matrix made from immobilized β-neurexins (11Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 12Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Similar to neurexins, neuroligins are type I membrane proteins composed of a long extracellular sequence that is glycosylated, a single transmembrane region, and a relatively short intracellular sequence. Different from neurexins, however, most of the extracellular sequences of neuroligins form a single large domain that is homologous to esterases, such as acetylcholine esterase (11Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 12Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The affinity purification of neuroligins on immobilized β-neurexins suggests that they bind to β-neurexins. Neuroligins are purified only on β-neurexins but not α-neurexins, suggesting that their interaction requires the presence of the short N-terminal sequence that is unique to β-neurexins. Furthermore, neuroligins are only purified on immobilized β-neurexins that lack an insert in splice site 4, which is located in the single LNS domain of β-neurexins. β-Neurexins containing an insert do not retain neuroligins. This result suggests that the binding of neuroligins to β-neurexins involves the LNS domain in addition to the N-terminal sequence and is regulated by alternative splicing. Finally, neuroligins are only retained on immobilized β-neurexins in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that a structural Ca2+-binding site in neurexins or neuroligins may be involved in the interaction. Since neuroligins only bind to a subset of β-neurexins, the other β-neurexins that are not included in this subset and all α-neurexins could potentially bind to other ligands. So far, only one additional potential ligand for neurexins has been found, a 29-kDa protein called neurexophilin that binds only to α-neurexins (13Petrenko A.G. Ullrich B. Missler M. Krasnoperov V. Rosahl T.W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurexophilin is produced in a small subset of neurons, whereas neurexins are synthesized in all neurons. The structure of neurexophilin suggests that it is synthesized as a larger precursor protein that is proteolytically processed and secreted similarly to neuropeptides (13Petrenko A.G. Ullrich B. Missler M. Krasnoperov V. Rosahl T.W. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as only two potential neurexin ligands are known, it seems likely that many additional ligands for neurexins remain to be discovered. The receptor-like structure of the neurexins suggests that they could in principle serve two types of function that are not mutually exclusive: a function as signaling receptors, which transduce an extracellular messenger into an intracellular response, or a function as cell adhesion molecules, which serve to mediate the binding of cells to each other. Both types of function are compatible with each other and with a general role as “recognition molecules.” The possible involvement of neurexins in cell recognition between neurons is based on the following properties (1Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 2Geppert M. Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Südhof T.C.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar): 1) neurexins are expressed at detectable levels only in neurons; 2) they are cell surface proteins with a receptor-like structure; 3) they are present in multiple isoforms created by the presence of three genes per genome, two different promoters per gene, extensive alternative splicing per transcript, and multiple variants for many sites of alternative splicing; and 4) different neurons express different combinations of alternatively spliced neurexins. A possible function for neurexins as cell recognition molecules would most likely be performed by interactions with isoform-specific ligands. The two currently known neurexin ligands, neuroligins and neurexophilin, could potentially serve the two types of recognition functions. Neurexophilin resembles a neuropeptide and might function as an extracellular messenger that binds to α-neurexins as a receptor. However, a signaling function for neurexophilin has not yet been demonstrated. Neuroligins resemble cell surface receptors similar to neurexins and might form heterotypic junctions by binding to β-neurexins. Since β-neurexins and neuroligins are both intrinsic membrane proteins of the neuronal cell surface, they could conceivably function as cell adhesion molecules and form heterophilic junctions between neurons. However, such a function has not been investigated to date. All interactions between neuroligins and β-neurexins were performed with solubilized proteins. It is unclear if neurexins and neuroligins can bind to each other when in a membrane and, if so, whether they mediate cell adhesion or interact on the same cell surface to form surface heterodimers. In the present study, we have addressed the possibility that neurexin 1β and neuroligin 1 form a heterophilic intercellular junction by functioning as cell adhesion molecules. Our study has two goals: 1) to analyze the properties of the interaction between neurexin 1β and neuroligin 1 and its dependence on Ca2+, and 2) to test if the in vitro binding between β-neurexins and neuroligins translates into an in vivo interaction of cells expressing β-neurexins and neuroligins. Our data demonstrate that neurexin 1β and neuroligin 1 trigger cell adhesion in a native membrane environment. The properties of the cell adhesion reaction mirror those of in vitro binding. These results suggest that β-neurexins and neuroligins form heterophilic intercellular junctions between neurons. For expression of neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1β in S2 cells (14Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar), inducible expression plasmids were constructed as follows. The coding region of neuroligin 1 was amplified by PCR from pCMVNL11 (11Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C.

The PCR product was cut with BglII and SalI and cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pRmHa2 (15Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), resulting in pRmHa2-NL1. PCR of neurexin 1β was performed on a cDNA encoding neurexin 1β without an insert in splice site 4 (4Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (primers GGGCGGTACCCATGTACCAGAGGATGCT and AAGGAGTATTATGTCTAGATCTCAG). The PCR product was cut with KpnI and BglII and cloned into KpnI and BamHI sites of pRmHa2, generating pRmHa2-L13. The expression vector encoding the IgG fusion protein of the extracellular domain of neuroligin 1 (amino acids 1–698) was generated by cloning the PCR product obtained with pCMVNL11 as template and with the primers CGCAGATCTGGGACCATGGCACTTCCCAGAT and GGGACTACTCCACAGAGCTAAGTGTCGACGCG into the BglII and SalI sites of pCMVIG-8, which contains the Fc domain of human IgG (4Ushkaryov Y.A.

The vectors encoding the neurexin 1β IgG fusion proteins (pCMVIGN1β-1 and pCMVIGN1β-3) were reported previously (4Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector encoding neurexin 1β GST fusion protein (pGEXN1β-7) was generated by amplifying residues 18–255 of neurexin 1β by PCR using pCMVIGN1β-1 as template (primers GGGACGCGTCCAGTTTGGGAGCGCAC and CCTGTCTCCGGGTAAATGAGATCTGCG). The product was cut with MluI and SalI and cloned into the same sites of pCMV5. The insert from this intermediate was then transferred into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-KG vector (16Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Production of IgG fusion proteins in COS cells and purification by protein A beads were done as described (4Ushkaryov Y.A. Hata Y. Ichtchenko K. Moomaw C. Afendis S. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brains were homogenized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and extracted with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 under stirring at 4 °C for 90 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was incubated with β-neurexin IgG fusion proteins immobilized on protein A beads at 4 °C for 2–4 h. For the Ca2+ titration curve, free Ca2+ concentrations were set with Ca2+/EGTA buffers (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the cationic specificity studies, buffers contained 4 mm EGTA with no additions (buffer only; see Fig. 1) or 4.5 mm of the indicated divalent cations. Proteins bound to the protein A beads containing the IgG fusion proteins were eluted with sample buffer, and neuroligin binding to neurexin 1β was analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies to neuroligin 1 (L067) and to neurexin 1β (P182) followed by 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and exposure to film or to PhosphorImager plates for subsequent quantitation, and neuroligin binding was normalized for the amount of neurexin 1β IgG fusion protein present. 45Ca2+ blotting experiments were performed essentially as described (18Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of purified IgG neurexin 1β-1, IgG neurexin 1β-3, IgG neuroligin 1, and bovine calmodulin were electrophoresed on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated in 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, for 10 min at room temperature. The buffer was then exchanged with fresh buffer and 1 μCi/ml45Ca2+ (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Membranes were rinsed with distilled, deionized water for 5 min, dried at room temperature, and exposed to film overnight. Expression of the neurexin 1β GST fusion protein was induced in E. coli with 30 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at room temperature. The GST fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and neurexin 1β was cleaved from the GST with thrombin in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 45 min. Eluate containing neurexin 1β protein was collected on ice, diluted 5-fold with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and applied onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Thrombin and most of the bacterial protein contaminants were retained on the Mono Q column, whereas neurexin 1β protein eluted in the flow-through and was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Neurexin 1β was further purified on a SP Sepharose XK 16/20 column eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 240 ml at 4 ml/min. Fractions containing neurexin 1β were pooled and concentrated to >10 mg/ml (Amicon Centriprep). Finally, 1 ml of protein was applied onto a Superdex 75 Hiload 16/60 FPLC gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and eluted at 1 ml/min. The protein was then homogeneously pure. It was concentrated to 20 mg/ml, frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded in an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length cuvette with approximately 10 μm of protein in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl with and without 2 mm Ca2+or Mg2+. Thermal denaturation was monitored by changes in circular dichroism absorption at 217 nm as a function of temperature (25–95 °C in 1 °C steps). The fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was calculated as (I obs −I f)/(I u −I f) (19Shao X. Li C. Fernandez I. Zhang X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20von Poser C. Ichtchenko K. Shao X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

I obs is the observed signal intensity at the respective temperature.I u and I f represent the signal intensities of the unfolded and folded states, respectively. The values of I u and I f were generated by extrapolating the linear regions of the unfolding and folding curves. S2 cells were grown at 25 °C in complete Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 g/liter streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression plasmids were co-transfected with the plasmid pPC4 (21Jokerst R.S. Weeks J.R. Zehring W.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) to confer α-amanitin resistance as the selectable marker. One day after cells were plated (1–2 × 106 cells/25-cm2flask in 4 ml of complete medium), 2 μg of pRmHa2-NL1 or pRmHa2-L13 and 1 μg of pPC4 were mixed with 0.1 ml of diluted Cellfectin reagent (20 μl of Cellfectin liposomes diluted into 0.1 ml Sf900 medium), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then added to 1.8 ml of serum-free Sf900 medium. Cells were washed once with 3 ml of serum-free Sf900 medium without antibiotics, and the DNA/liposome mixture was gently overlaid onto the cells. The cells were incubated for 12–16 h at 25 °C, and then the transfection medium was replaced with complete growth medium. After 48 h to allow for the expression of drug resistance, 5 mg/liter α-amanitin was added to the cells in complete medium. Massive cell death occurred after 1–2 weeks. Cells were then removed from the flask, pelleted, and resuspended in fresh complete medium with 5 mg/liter α-amanitin. Within 2 weeks, viable cells continued to grow to high density, and thereafter cells were diluted 1:3 in fresh complete medium with α-amanitin about every week. The selection with α-amanitin was continued for three passages. Cell cloning was performed by diluting cells to 20, 40, and 80 cells/ml in 50% conditioned growth medium and aliquoted in 0.1 ml into 96-well plates with one plate per cell concentration. After 3 weeks, clones could be seen with the unaided eye. They were split into two wells, and one was used for screening by Western blots with antibodies to neuroligin (L067) and neurexin (A473). Positive clones were further analyzed for clonal homogeneity by immunocytochemistry. Assays were modified from Refs.22Fehon R.G. Kooh P.J. Rebay I. Regan C.L. Xu T. Muskavitch M.

Protein expression in transfected cells was induced by adding 0.7 mm CuS04 to the culture medium 16–20 h before the experiments. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with serum-free medium, and resuspended by pipetting in balanced saline solution (55 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 15 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, 50 mm sucrose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Tricine, pH 6.95). Cells were counted with a hemocytometer and diluted in balanced saline solution so that the final cell density in each aggregation assay was approximately 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (0.33-ml total volume) were placed in 0.5-ml polypropylene test tubes, leaving a small air bubble between the liquid and the lid. The cell mixtures were then incubated at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The extent of cell/cell aggregation was measured at the indicated times by removing aliquots, spotting them onto slides, and counting the cells with a hemocytometer. Cell aggregation was plotted as the ratioN 0/N t, whereN 0 is the total number of cellular particles at the incubation time 0, and N t is the total number of cellular particles at incubation time t, with cellular aggregates counting as single particles. In the experiments examining the Ca2+ dependence of cell aggregation, cells were resuspended in balanced saline solution without Ca2+containing either 2 mm EGTA or 2 mmMgCl2. Inhibition experiments of cell aggregation were performed by preincubating neuroligin 1 cells with 1 μm of recombinant IgG fusion proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. Neurexin 1β cell clones were then added, and the incubation was continued for 90 min at 4 °C with agitation. Because of the high expression of neuroligin 1 and neurexin 1β and the cooperative nature of cell aggregation, the number of cells used was reduced to 1 × 106 cells/ml, and the CuSO4 induction time was reduced to 8–10 h. Previous studies showed that neuroligins bind to immobilized β-neurexins under two conditions: 1) Ca2+ had to be added to the buffer; and 2) the β-neurexins used had to lack an insert in splice site 4 (11Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 12Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The first finding suggested the possibility that Ca2+ binds to β-neurexins or neuroligins or both and that Ca2+ binding enables these molecules to interact with each other. The second finding indicated that the alternative splicing of β-neurexins regulates binding. To gain further insight into how neuroligins and neurexins bind to each other, we have now studied the effects of different divalent cations on their interactions. We used immobilized IgG neurexin 1β fusion proteins without (IGN Iβ-1) or with an insert in splice site 4 (IGN Iβ-3) as affinity matrices for rat brain proteins. Detergent-solubilized rat brain proteins were applied to the columns containing immobilized neurexin 1βs in the presence of different divalent cations. We found that neuroligins were retained on the column only in the presence of Ca2+, whereas closely related divalent cations, Ba2+ and Sr2+, were unable to substitute for Ca2+ at a 0.5 mm free ion concentration (Fig.1). Furthermore, neuroligin binding was specific to neurexin 1β lacking an insert in splice site 4 as reported before, and other divalent cations were not able to overcome this binding specificity. Thus, Ca2+ action on the binding of neurexin 1β to neuroligins is highly specific and cannot be substituted for by other cations, suggesting that a specific Ca2+-binding site is involved in binding of neuroligins to neurexin 1β. To determine the apparent affinity of the Ca2+ binding site that is required for binding neuroligins to neurexin 1β, we performed the affinity chromatography experiments as described above at different concentrations of free Ca2+. Concentrations of free Ca2+ were set with Ca2+/EGTA buffers (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Goog"

Here we have investigated the effect of a range of putative antioxidants on NF-κB activation by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor as well as the ability of H2O2 to activate NF-κB in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the transformed human endothelial cell line ECV304. Activation of NF-κB and stimulation of IκBα degradation by H2O2 was only evident in the transformed cells and required much longer contact times than that observed with interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor. Furthermore, only H2O2 was sensitive toN-acetyl-l-cysteine, and no increase in H2O2 was detected in response to either cytokine. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate has been purported to be a specific antioxidant inhibitor of NF-κB that acts independently of activating agent or cell type. However, we found that tumor necrosis factor- but not interleukin-1-driven NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation were sensitive to pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate in transformed cells, while neither pathway was inhibited in primary cells. Phorbol ester-mediated activation was sensitive in both transformed and primary cells. Other antioxidants failed to inhibit either cytokine, while the iron chelators desferrioxamine and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl mimicked the pattern of inhibition seen for the dithiocarbamate. This suggested that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was inhibiting NF-κB activation in endothelial cells primarily through its iron-chelating properties. Tumor necrosis factor, but not interleukin-1, was found to induce lipid peroxidation in ECV304 cells. This was inhibited by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and desferrioxamine. t-Butyl hydroperoxide, which induces lipid peroxidation, activated NF-κB. Finally, butylated hydroxyanisole, which inhibits lipid peroxidation but has no iron-chelating properties, inhibited NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor but not interleukin-1.Taken together, the results argue against a role for H2O2 in NF-κB activation by cytokines in endothelial cells.

The inducible, higher eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB has an important role in the regulation of a number of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. It is activated in many cell types by a wide range of stimuli including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; t-BHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; DDTC, diethyldithiocarbamate; DFO, desferrioxamine; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; EC, endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MDA, malondialdehyde; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PGA, pyroglutamic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; TEMPO, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (reviewed in Ref. 1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells (ECs), activation of NF-κB is central to the regulation of many genes by IL-1 and TNF such as the cell adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin (2Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) and tissue factor (3Bierhaus A. Zhang Y. Deng Y. Mackman N. Quehenberger P. Haase M. Luther T. Muller M. Bohrer H. Greten J. Martin E. Baeuerle P.A. Waldherr R. Kisiel W. Ziegler R. Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26419-26432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, NF-κB has been identified in an activated form in the ECs of atherosclerotic plaques (4Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Neumeier D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that NF-κB may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis (5Collins T. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 499-508PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB exists in a latent form in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells comprising a transcriptionally active dimer bound to an inhibitor protein, IκB. The currently known subunit members of the NF-κB family in mammals are p50, RelA (p65), c-Rel, p52, and RelB, while multiple forms of IκB also exist, namely IκBα, β, γ, and Bcl-3 (reviewed in Ref. 6Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The predominant form of NF-κB activated in cells is a p50/RelA heterodimer, which is associated with IκBα in resting cells. Upon stimulation with agents such as IL-1 and TNF, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated on two serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36), which targets the inhibitor protein for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). This allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes by binding with high affinity to κB elements in their promoters. The phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα are tightly coupled events (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that agents that activate NF-κB do so through the activation of a specific IκBα kinase or, alternatively, by inactivating a particular phosphatase. A high molecular mass kinase complex that phosphorylates IκBα on Ser32 and Ser36 has been identified (8Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The upstream events that lead to phosphorylation of IκBα are unclear. A model has been proposed whereby diverse agents all activate NF-κB by causing oxidative stress (an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates (ROS)) (9Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). In particular, H2O2 has been implicated as a common second messenger in the various pathways leading to NF-κB activation (10Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on several of lines of evidence. First, in some cell types H2O2 has been shown to be released in response to agents that also activate NF-κB (9Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 10Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3731-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Second, direct addition of H2O2 to culture medium has been shown to activate NF-κB in some cell lines (12Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar, 13Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Third, overexpression of the H2O2-metabolizing enzyme catalase in a mouse epidermal cell line was shown to attenuate the activation of NF-κB by TNF and okadaic acid, while overexpression of the H2O2-producing enzyme superoxide dismutase potentiated the activation, suggesting a role for H2O2 in these pathways to NF-κB (10Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Other work has suggested that some of these observations are cell-specific. H2O2 had no stimulatory effect on NF-κB in a number of other cell types (14Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.C. J.

Commun. 1995; 210: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that in COS-1 cells, overexpression of catalase did not block activation of NF-κB by either TNF or PMA. It has also been suggested that oxidative stress facilitates but does not mediate NF-κB activation (14Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar). Another line of evidence implicating oxidative stress and H2O2 as central to NF-κB activation has been the effect of antioxidants in inhibiting NF-κB activation in response to diverse stimuli. Two compounds in particular have been extensively used, the glutathione precursor and radical scavengerN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and the putative antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). However, the effect of NAC on NF-κB is also somewhat cell-specific, in that although it has proved inhibitory in some cells (12Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar, 13Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), we and others have reported NAC-insensitive pathways to NF-κB (16Brennan P. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 17Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar, 19Suzuki Y.I. Mizuno M. Packer L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar). PDTC seems to be a better general inhibitor of NF-κB and, in fact, has been proposed as a specific universal inhibitor of NF-κB that acts independently of the activating agent and cell type used (9Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). However, in addition to its radical scavenging and metal-chelating properties (9Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 20Sunderman F.W. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1991; 21: 70-81PubMed Google Scholar), PDTC can also exert a pro-oxidant effect in some cells by increasing oxidized glutathione levels (21Nobel C.S.I. Kimland M. Lind B. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26202-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 22Brennan P. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which also leads to an inhibition of NF-κB (22Brennan P. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Mihm S. Galter D. Droge W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Information on the role of oxidative stress and H2O2 in cytokine stimulation of NF-κB in ECs remains limited, mainly coming from studies using PDTC or NAC to perturb particular genes downstream of NF-κB activation (24Weber C. Erl W. Pietsch A. Strobel M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1665-1673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Orthner C. Rodgers G.M. Fitzgerald L.A.

Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Given the importance of NF-κB in ECs together with the often cell-specific nature of the effect of H2O2 and antioxidants on NF-κB activation, we decided to investigate the role of H2O2 and oxidative stress in NF-κB activation in ECs using both primary and transformed ECs. Our results show that although H2O2 activates NF-κB in transformed ECs, it is unlikely to have a role in the cytokine-mediated pathways to NF-κB in transformed or primary ECs. In transformed cells, TNF but not IL-1 was sensitive to PDTC, while in primary cells neither stimulus was inhibited. Further, we show that the ability of PDTC to inhibit NF-κB activation by TNF in transformed ECs involves inhibition of iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation that is not important for activation of NF-κB by IL-1. The immortalized human endothelial cell line ECV304 (27Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J.-I. Mukai K. Goto T In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and human Jurkat T cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United Kingdom). Pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained at first passage from Clonetics Corporation (San Diego, CA). RPMI 1640 medium, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA, and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Scotland). Human recombinant IL-1α was a gift from NCI, National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD), while human recombinant TNFα was a gift from Dr. Steve Foster (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK). The 22-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (underlined), T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the Cytotox 96TM nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The 22-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, containing the mutated NF-κB consensus sequence (underlined), the rabbit polyclonal antibody to human IκBα, and the antisera to the NF-κB subunits p50 and c-Rel were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiserum to the NF-κB subunit RelA (p65) was a gift from Dr. Jean Imbert (INSERM, Marseille, France). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent were from Amersham International (Aylesbury, UK). Poly(dI·dC) was from Pharmacia Biosystems (Milton Keynes, UK). All other reagents, including heparin (sodium salt), human recombinant acidic fibroblast growth factor, medium 199 (HEPES modification), PDTC (ammonium salt), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), pyrrolidine, pyroglutamic acid, NAC, desferrioxamine, allopurinol, the spin traps 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), FeCl3, H2O2, PMA, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA),tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP), thiobarbituric acid, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate, scopoletin, horseradish peroxidase (type II), and catalase were from Sigma (Poole, UK). ECV304 cells were grown in medium 199 (HEPES modification) containing 10% (v/v) FBS, and passaged when confluent using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA. HUVECs were grown in medium 199 containing 20% FBS, 10 ng/ml acidic fibroblast growth factor, and 90 μg/ml heparin. The medium was changed every 48 h, and cells were passaged when 80–90% confluent using trypsin-EDTA. Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine, and cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were pretreated with the test compounds or left untreated before the addition of IL-1, TNF, PMA, or H2O2 as described in the figure legends. All experiments were carried out in complete medium at 37 °C. PDTC, DDTC, and pyrrolidine were dissolved in PBS; pyroglutamic acid (PGA), desferrioxamine (DFO), and FeCl3were dissolved in H2O; NAC was dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; BHA was dissolved in ethanol; and PMA, allopurinol, TEMPO, and DMPO were dissolved in Me2SO. NAC and PGA were adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 n NaOH. None of the vehicles had any effect on NF-κB alone at the concentrations used. No metal spatulas were used. The effect of the compounds on cell viability was assessed using the Cytotox 96TM nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay, as described by the manufacturers. This system uses lactate dehydrogenase release as an index of cell toxicity. At the concentrations used here, NAC interfered with this assay, and thus the magnitude of release of lactate dehydrogenase activity from NAC-treated cells was determined directly by monitoring spectrophotometrically the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in the presence of 75 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mmNADH, and 4.8 mm sodium pyruvate. Measurement of LDH release from intact cells and examination of monolayer morphology revealed that none of the compounds used were toxic to the cells at the exposure times and concentrations used here. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified version of the method of Osborn et al. (28Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nable G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Confluent ECV304 cells or HUVECs in six-well plates (3-ml volume) were treated as described in the figure legends. Stimulation was terminated by removal of medium followed by washing twice with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS (0.145m NaCl, 0.027 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6). Washed cells were then scraped into 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Stimulation of Jurkat T cells (5 × 106 in 1 ml of medium) was terminated by the removal of cells into 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, followed by centrifugation (170 g, 10 min). Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer. Nuclear extracts were subsequently prepared as described previously (17Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Extracts were then stored at −20 °C and assayed for NF-κB activity the next day. Nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein) were incubated with 10,000 cpm of a 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence that had previously been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature, in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. For competition studies, unlabeled wild type or mutant NF-κB oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In experiments involving antisera to NF-κB subunits, 0.5 μl of a specific antiserum to p50, RelA, or c-Rel was incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice prior to the binding reaction. All incubation mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Confluent ECV304 cells in six-well plates (3-ml volume) were treated as described in the figure legends. Treatment was terminated by washing monolayers twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS in PBS) containing 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Following further disruption of cells by passage through a 21-gauge needle (5 strokes), an additional 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to samples, which were then incubated on ice for 45 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed as cell lysate. Supernatants were assayed for protein (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (2–4 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and IκBα immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (30Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). H2O2released from ECV304 cells was measured by the horseradish peroxidase-mediated oxidation of the fluorescent probe scopoletin to its nonfluorescent oxidized form (31Harpe J.D.L. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 78: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since hydrogen peroxide freely diffuses across the cell membrane, measuring extracellular release is an indication of intracellular levels. Confluent monolayers of ECV304 cells in six-well plates (3-ml volume) were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove phenol red and serum. Monolayers were incubated with 3 ml of assay solution containing stimulant (IL-1 (10 ng/ml), TNF (10 ng/ml), or PMA (100 ng/ml)), sodium azide (1 mm), scopoletin (1 μm), and horseradish peroxidase (0.2 units/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution, for 30 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a test tube and cooled to room temperature, and the fluorescence was measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Controls included cell-free plates with full assay mix and cells incubated in the absence of peroxidase. The specific decrease in fluorescence due to H2O2 was assessed by measuring scopoletin oxidation for each sample in the presence and absence of catalase (50 units/ml). H2O2 concentration was then determined against a standard curve, using concentrations of 0.05–0.5 μm H2O2, as determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 = 43.6m−1 cm−1). Protein concentrations of samples were determined (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) following alkali digestion of monolayers. H2O2 release was then expressed as pmol/min/mg of protein. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by the TBARS assay, which detects mainly malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and related esters. TBARS were measured by a modification of the method of Ohkawa et al. (32Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23298) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of ECV304 cells in 100-mm dishes were treated as described in the figure legends and washed in PBS before undergoing three cycles of freeze-thawing in 200 μl of water. A 20-μl aliquot was subsequently removed for Bradford protein determination (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), and 800 μl of assay mix (0.4% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 9.4% (v/v) acetic acid, pH 3.5) was added to the remaining sample. Samples were incubated for 60 min at 95 °C, cooled to room temperature, and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, and the absorbance of the supernatants was read at 532 nm against a standard curve prepared using the MDA standard (10 mm 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). Results were calculated as nmol of MDA equivalents/mg of protein and expressed as a percentage of matched control values. Significance was evaluated by Student's t test. Fig.1 A shows that nuclear extracts from untreated ECV304 cells contained trace amounts of NF-κB, the levels of which varied slightly between experiments (lanes 1, 9, 17, and 25). Following treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-1 (lanes 2–8) or 10 ng/ml TNF (lanes 10–16), NF-κB was activated, as evidenced by the increased retardation of the DNA probe containing the κB motif. This activation was evident from 5 min (lanes 2 and 10) and peaked at 30 min (lanes 4 and 12). NF-κB activity was strong for at least 4 h (lanes 6 and 14) and still detectable at 24 h (lanes 8 and 16). Treatment of cells with 100 ng/ml PMA (lanes 18–24) gave a somewhat different time course of activation in that active NF-κB only became detectable at 30 min (lane 20) and was greatly reduced by 24 h (lane 24). Prolonged treatment of ECV304 cells with H2O2 led to activation of NF-κB. When cells were treated with 0.2 mm H2O2 for 4 h, a strong activation was observed (compare lanes 28 and 25). In contrast to the rapid response seen for IL-1 and TNF, the H2O2-stimulated activation was not detectable after 1 h (compare lanes 26 and 25) and did not peak until 4 h (lane 29). H2O2-mediated activation was also more transient than that seen for IL-1 and TNF, with activity greatly decreased by 8 h (compare lanes 29 and 28) and identical to control levels at 24 h (compare lanes 30 and 25). A concentration of 0.2 mmH2O2 was optimal in this effect. Fig.1 B confirms that the protein-DNA complexes activated by IL-1, TNF, PMA, and H2O2 were all specific for NF-κB, since 18 or 180 fmol of unlabeled NF-κB wild type consensus sequence effectively competed with each binding activity, while the same concentrations of a mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide containing a single base pair change in the consensus sequence failed to compete with binding. Since this is the first study reporting NF-κB activation in ECV304 cells, we also characterized the NF-κB subunits present in the complexes activated by the four stimuli. Fig. 1 Cdemonstrates that IL-1, TNF, PMA, and H2O2activated similar NF-κB complexes. Using specific antisera to p50, RelA, and c-Rel, the same pattern of supershifting was seen for IL-1-, TNF-, PMA-, and H2O2-activated NF-κB (lanes 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, and 13–16, respectively). This revealed the presence of two main NF-κB complexes. Antiserum to p50 affected both the lower and upper complex (lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14), while RelA antiserum only reacted with the upper complex (lanes 3, 7, 11, and 15). There was no detectable reaction with c-Rel antiserum (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16). Hence, it was likely that IL-1, TNF, PMA, and H2O2 were activating two NF-κB complexes, tentatively identified as p50/p50 homodimers and p50/RelA heterodimers. Fig. 1 D shows that IL-1, TNF, and PMA also activated NF-κB in HUVECs as has been well characterized by others (2Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). IL-1 (10 ng/ml) gave a similar time course of activation of NF-κB to that seen in ECV304 cells, with activity detectable after 5 min (compare lanes 2 and 1), maximal at 1 h (lane 5) and still apparent at 24 h (lane 8). Activation of NF-κB by TNF (10 ng/ml) and PMA (100 ng/ml) at a single time point (1 h) is also shown (compare lanes 10 and 11, respectively, with lane 9). In contrast to ECV304 cells, H2O2 failed to activate NF-κB in HUVECs. No activation was apparent upon a 2- or 4-h incubation of HUVECs with either 0.2 or 0.4 mm H2O2 (comparelanes 12–15 with lane 9). Higher doses of H2O2 also failed to activate NF-κB (not shown). These results highlight an important dif"

Alternative mechanism(s) of effects of Ado on lymphocytes, as well as the possibility that their inhibition may be due to extracellular Ado-mediated transmembrane signaling through Ado (purinergic) receptors (5Huang S.

Sitkovsky M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1600-1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the accumulation of extAdo due to insufficient or absent ADA or under hypoxic conditions results in increased signaling through Ado receptors on T cells and causes immunosuppression. This signaling mechanism is attractive inasmuch as, if correct, it could provide a novel molecular target for immunomodulation; however, studies about the effect(s) of extAdo-triggered signaling on the effector functions of T cells and about the repertoire of expressed Ado receptors on T cells need to be performed. Clarification of the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of ADA SCID is important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In addition, studies of the effects of extAdo on T cells are valuable in devising strategies based on the use of adoptively transferred cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to patients with solid tumors where hypoxic conditions may lead to Ado accumulation (12Hoskin D.W. Reynolds T. Blay J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 854-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rational predictions of the side effects of Ado-based pharmacological agents also require this knowledge. Recent advances in understanding of mechanisms of T cell-mediated effector functions, together with the availability of molecular tools to study Ado receptors, will allow more detailed and precise evaluation of the effects of extAdo under well controlled conditions. In this study, we asked (i) whether Ado-induced immunosuppression of peripheral T lymphocytes in vivo may be at least partially explained by extracellular versus intracellular Ado-mediated inhibition of antigen/T cell receptor (TCR)-driven, perforin- and Fas-based, T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and lymphokine secretion and (ii) whether the effects of Ado could be explained by extAdo receptor-mediated signaling. Here we present data that demonstrate that even short term exposure of T cells to extAdo results in strong inhibition of TCR-triggered functions, thereby providing evidence of a “memory” of Ado effects in surrounding T cells. The ability of extAdo to rescue T cells from apoptosis strongly supports signalingversus an intracellular toxicity mechanism of Ado action. TCR-signaling antagonizing A2A receptors are identified as predominantly expressed and are probably functional transducers of the T cell-inhibiting effects of extAdo. All the reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned. Selective A2A receptor agonist CGS21680 and selective A2A receptor antagonist CSC were purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). Selective A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 was a kind gift from Dr. Joel Linden (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and Dr. Kenneth Jacobson (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Anti-CD3 ε-chain monoclonal antibody (mAb) 145-2C11 (2C11) was prepared as described (17Leo O. Foo M. Sachs D.H. Samelson L.E. Bluestone J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). Anti-Thy-1 mAb (anti-Thy-1.2, clone 53-2.1) and anti-Fas ligand (FasL) mAb were obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and Alexis (San Diego, CA), respectively. Splenocytes and thymocytes were isolated from 4–6-week-old DBA/2 mice (H-2d). Mouse CD8+ CTL clone OE4 (anti-H-2d) (18Staerz U.D. Kanagawa O. Bevan M.J. Nature. 1985; 314: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was stimulated every 4 weeks with irradiated splenocytes from DBA/2 mice in EL4-conditioned medium, expanded 4 days after stimulation, and harvested at day 8 (4 days after expansion) (19Takayama H. Shinohara N. Kawasaki A. Someya Y. Hanaoka S. Kojima H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Shinkai Y. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mouse B cell lymphoma line A20.2J (H-2d) and mouse T cell leukemia line EL4 (H-2b) were used as specific and nonspecific target cells for OE4, respectively. The perforin-deficient, FasL-expressing CD8+ CTL line P0K.3A8 (anti-H-2k) was maintained as described previously (20Kojima H. Shinohara N. Hanaoka S. Someya-Shirota Y. Takagaki Y. Ohno H. Saitoh T.

The perforin-deficient, FasL-expressing CD4+ CTL line P0P.C 2H. Kojima, unpublished results. was maintained by biweekly stimulation and expansion with irradiated spleen cells. They were usually used 12 days after the last stimulation and were cultured in complete RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2.5% supernatant from concanavalin A-stimulated rat spleen cells as source of T cell growth factors. B cell hybridoma LB 27.4 (LB; H-2b/d) (21Kappler J. White J. Wegmann D. Mustain E. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3604-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was sensitive to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and used as a target of CTL P0P.C. Mouse T helper hybridoma 2B4.11 (2B4) was prepared as described previously (22Sugiyama H. Chen P. Hunter M. Taffs R. Sitkovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25256-25263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT; Calbiochem) esterase activity was measured as described previously (23Takayama H. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 725-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Typically, the amount of secreted BLT esterase was determined after the incubation of 1 × 105 CTLs in wells coated with immobilized 2C11 mAb (5 μg/ml) with or without Ado analogs. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. To assay BLT esterase activity, 50 μl of culture supernatant was mixed with 950 μl of BLT solution (0.2 mm BLT, 0.22 mm5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Calbiochem) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 0.1 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, which was dissolved in Me2SO. The solution was diluted by 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured in comparison to a blank solution (RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 5% FCS) that was treated exactly the same as the experimental solution. Inasmuch as the culture medium does not react with 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), the experimental absorbance value minus the blank absorbance value is proportional to the BLT esterase activity. The total cellular content of the enzyme was determined using 0.1% Triton X-100-solubilized cells. Determinations were carried out in triplicates, and data are presented as the specific percent of enzymatic activity released, which was calculated from the following equation. %release=100×(E−S)/(T−S)Equation 1 E represents the mean absorbance value in the supernatants of the experimental wells, S is the mean absorbance value in the supernatants of the wells containing no stimuli, and T represents the total enzyme content of BLT esterase in the CTLs. CTL cytotoxicity was measured using a standard 51Cr release assay (24Kataoka T. Shinohara N. Takayama H. Takaku K. Kondo S. Yonehara S. Nagai K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3678-3686PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, target cells were labeled with 50 μCi of Na251CrO4 for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed three times. 51Cr-Labeled target cells (2.5 × 103) were incubated with different numbers of CTLs as indicated according to effector/target (E:T) ratio. With or without Ado or Ado analogs in 200 μl of complete RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FCS, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in V-bottomed 96-well plates. Culture supernatants were harvested using the Skatron harvesting system (Skatron, Lier, Norway). Cytolytic activity, i.e. percentage of specific 51Cr release, was calculated as follows. %of specific 51Cr release =100 × (E−S)/(T−S)Equation 2 E, S, and T indicate experimental release, spontaneous release, and total incorporation, respectively. In this assay, the A20.2J cells (H-2d) were used as targets. These cells are normally not recognized and therefore not killed by P0K.3A8 CTLs (anti-H-2k); however, the binding of anti-CD3 mAb to Fc receptors on A20.2J cells results in CTL/A20.2J conjugation and TCR triggering of the CTLs, which is followed by activation of the CTLs and the lethal hit delivery to targets, so that the target cells become susceptible to lysis (25Taffs R.E. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 722-729PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ratner A. Clark W. Sitkovsky M.V. Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells: Recognition, Effector Functions, Generation, and Methods. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1993: 487Google Scholar). 1 × 105 OE4 cells/sample were incubated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb 2C11 (5 μg/ml) alone or together with 50 μm extAdo with or without 1 μm ZM241385. Total RNA was prepared by the single-step method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (RNA STAT-60; Tel-Test “B”, Friendswood, TX). After DNase I treatment the first-strand cDNA was synthesized by the SuperScript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mouse FasL sequence was amplified with primers corresponding to 9–28 and 741–722 nucleotides of open reading frame (ORF) of mouse FasL cDNA (27Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). All PCR primers used were synthesized by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The double-strand competitor DNA for quantitation of FasL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA by RT-PCR were prepared using the PCR MIMIC Construction Kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification efficiency of each competitor sequence did not show any significant difference from that of the corresponding target cDNA sequence (data not shown). The competitive PCR was performed under standard conditions in a 30-μl reaction volume that included 3 μl of the diluted cDNA and 1.2 μl of competitor DNA. Ten μl of PCR product were electrophoresed on a 4% (w/v) NuSieve 3:1 agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and examined by ethidium bromide staining. The density of each band was determined (ImageQuant version 3.3, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) from the negative picture of the gel (no. 55 positive-negative 4 × 5 instant sheet film, Polaroid, Cambridge, MA). The densities of RT-PCR products were normalized for differences in cDNA quantity between samples using PCR quantitation of GAPDH mRNA. Primers for mouse GAPDH cDNA amplification were 290–309 and 1010–989 nucleotides of ORF. The total RNA from murine lymphoid cells was extracted as above and poly(A) RNA was subsequently isolated using Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The poly(A) RNA from 250 μg of total RNA was analyzed by standard Northern blotting procedure described previously (5Huang S. Koshiba M. Apasov S. Sitkovsky M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1600-1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first-strand cDNA was prepared from OE4 and 2B4 cells as described above. The mouse A2A sequence was amplified with primers corresponding to 556–575 and 927–910 nucleotides of ORF of mouse A2A cDNA (28Marquardt D.L. Walker L.L. Heinemann S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4508-4515PubMed Google Scholar). A2A cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. D. L. Marquardt (University of California, San Diego) and used as a positive control. The effects of different treatments of lymphocytes on their cAMP content were tested by incubating 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells alone or with different combinations of Ado analogs and/or immobilized antibodies to CD3 or Thy-1 surface antigens. Levels of cAMP were measured using the cAMP EIA System (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measurements were done in triplicate with standard deviations calculated. The effect of extAdo pretreatment on anti-CD3 mAb (2C11)-induced CTL granule exocytosis was tested by preincubating cells for 30, 20, 10, 5, 1, or 0 min with 50 μm 2-CADO in 5% FCS-containing medium. Cells were washed and incubated for 4 h in triplicate in a V-bottomed 96-well plate with 2C11 mAb immobilized at 5 μg/ml, and granule exocytosis was calculated as described. Effect of 2-CADO pretreatment on anti-CD3 mAb (2C11)-induced cell growth inhibition and IL-2 production of 2B4 cells (22Sugiyama H. Chen P. Hunter M. Taffs R. Sitkovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25256-25263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested by preincubating cells for 30, 20, 10, 5, 1, or 0 min with 50 μm 2-CADO in 5% FCS-containing medium in triplicate. Then cells were washed, incubated for 21 h with immobilized 2C11, and pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine, followed by an additional 6-h incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the presence of 2C11. The amount of secreted IL-2 in supernatants of 2B4 was estimated by sandwich ELISA (Intertest-2X mouse IL-2 ELISA kit; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). CTL-mediated cytotoxicity involves several steps including early biochemical events of TCR-mediated signaling, conjugate formation, and lethal hit delivery (29Martz E. Sitkovsky M. Henkart P. Cytotoxic Cells: Recognition, Effector Functions, Generation, and Methods. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1993: 9-49Google Scholar). CTL-mediated cytotoxicity is explained by two complementary mechanisms. CTLs kill target cells (i) due to the exocytosis of perforin- and granzyme-containing cytotoxic granules (30Henkart P.A. Hayes M.P. Shiver J.W. Sitkovsky M.V. Henkart P.A. Cytotoxic Cells: Recognition, Effector Function, Generation, and Methods. Birkhäuser, Boston, 1992: 153-165Google Scholar) and (ii) due to FasL/Fas receptor interactions (31Rouvier E. Luciani M.-F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). These are two completely different mechanisms that have in common only the requirement for TCR triggering. It was important to determine which of these pathways (or both) was susceptible to effects of extAdo. Different combinations of effector CTLs and target cells and the use of a granule exocytosis assay allowed us to use genetic controls to discriminate between Fas-mediated and granule exocytosis-based cytotoxicity. We demonstrated earlier that [cAMP] i-elevating treatments of CTLs result in inhibition of both early and late biochemical events leading to CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and to exocytosis of cytolytic granules (32Takayama H. Trenn G. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2330-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our earlier model studies, we did not use relatively low intensity extracellular signaling as a method of raising cAMP levels. Therefore, it was interesting to test whether extAdo-induced levels of cAMP will be sufficient to cause the inhibition of CTL functions if signaling through Ado receptors in peripheral T cells involves Gsprotein-coupled and cAMP-raising A2A or the A2Bsubtypes of receptors (11Jacobson K.A. van Galen P.J.M. Williams M. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We found that the presence of Ado analogs significantly inhibits TCR-triggered granule enzyme secretion (Fig.1 A), thereby providing the first demonstration of direct effects of extAdo analogs on cytotoxicity-mediating granule exocytosis in CTLs. As little as 1.0 μm NECA was able to inhibit granule exocytosis (Fig.1 A), and both NECA and 2-CADO were efficient in inhibition. Inhibition of exocytosis of cytotoxic granules in CTLs by Ado (Fig.1 A) was expected to result in the inhibition of target cell lysis, and this was demonstrated by testing the effect of extAdo on target cell lysis by CTLs (Fig. 1 B). The CTL clone used was unable to lyse the nonspecific targets, as demonstrated by the control experiment (Fig. 1 B, inset), thereby confirming that target cell lysis is antigen-specific and TCR-triggered. It was found that inclusion of Ado in the assay significantly inhibited target cell death. Of interest, not only Ado but also Ado analogs (2-CADO, NECA) were inhibitory, and up to 500 μm Ado was as efficient as nonhydrolyzable 2-CADO and NECA, suggesting that signaling, rather than Ado degradation (metabolism) products, is responsible for these effects. Selective A2A agonist CGS21680 at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm (Fig.1 B, lower left panel) also was able to inhibit the lysis of antigen-specific target cells (A20.2J) by CTL clone OE4. At such low concentrations, this agonist was shown to be highly selective for A2A receptor (33Hutchinson A.J. Williams M. de Jesus R. Yokoyama R. Oei H.H. Ghai G.R. Webb R.L. Zoganas H.C. Stone G.A. Jarvis M.F. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition by CGS21680 was comparable to that of extracellular adenosine and of 2-CADO even at higher concentrations of 50 μm (Fig.1 B, lower right panel). The most selective to date (34Poucher S.M. Keddie J.R. Singh P. Stoggall S.M. Caulkett P.W.R. Jones G. Collis M.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1096-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) A2A adenosine receptor antagonist ZM241385 was also used to identify the A2Areceptor in mediating effects of adenosine on T cells. It is shown (Fig. 1 A, lower panel) that the presence of ZM241385 at 1 μm was sufficient to almost completely protect CTL even from the exposure to the highest tested (50 μm) concentration of 2-CADO. In a control experiment, ZM241385 alone at 1 μm did not have an effect on exocytosis of TCR-triggered CTL. Thus, both antigen receptor-triggered exocytosis of cytotoxic granules and specific antigen-triggered T cell lysis were inhibited by extAdo. Although the effects of extAdo on processes in target cells undergoing perforin-induced death are still to be established, these data allow us to conclude that granule exocytosis-based CTL-mediated cytotoxicity is inhibited by extAdo. The inhibition of exocytosis was highly reproducible, but the degree of inhibition varied depending on the extent of TCR-triggered exocytosis in the particular assay and on the preparation of expanded CTL clones. Both nonhydrolyzable analogs 2-CADO and NECA were effective in inhibition of the protein synthesis-independent short term process of granule exocytosis, suggesting that these effects are due to signaling rather than to the interference into DNA synthetic pathways and dATP-triggered apoptosis (13Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed to consider the possibility that the decrease in CTL viability by Ado and anti-CD3 mAb may account for the Ado-mediated inhibition of granule exocytosis and cytotoxicity. In controls, no changes in viability of CTLs were detected using trypan blue (data not shown). In addition, this possibility is discounted by results of flow cytometry (forward scatter versus side scatter) measurements of CTL viability, inasmuch as even at very high concentrations (e.g. 5 mm) of extAdo more than 70% of CTLs were viable and not apoptotic. To study the susceptibility of Fas-versus perforin-mediated and FasL/Fas cytotoxicity pathways to inhibition by Ado, we took advantage of the availability of Fas-expressing and Fas-mediated death pathway-sensitive targets and tested the lysis of such targets with a perforin-deficient CTLs that possesses only the FasL-based mechanism of cytotoxicity. The CD4+ CTL line P0P.C cells used in the experiment described in Fig.2 A were derived from perforin-deficient mice; thus, the cytotoxicity of these CTLs depends only on the Fas-mediated pathway. It is shown (Fig. 2 A) that extAdo and Ado analog 2-CADO were able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of P0P.C CTLs against the antigen-bearing target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition by extAdo was observed at as low as 100 μm Ado, with poorly hydrolyzable analog 2-CADO being much more efficient in inhibition of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity of CTLs. This inhibition of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity could be due to (i) inhibition of adhesion protein-mediated CTL/target conjugate formation, (ii) the interference of extAdo into intracellular processes of cell death in targets, and/or (iii) inhibition of TCR-triggered FasL up-regulation. The latter was the most interesting explanation of extAdo-mediated inhibition of FasL-triggered cell death in CTL cytotoxicity assays, but it was necessary to eliminate from considerations the contribution of CTL/target conjugate formation and programmed cell death processes observed in inhibition of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 A). To exclude the possibility of inhibition of CTL/target cell conjugate formation, we utilized a “retargeting” assay in which the target cells were “armed” with anti-TCR/CD3 complex mAb. In this assay, the target cell “recognizes” the TCR on the CTL surface, and antibody/TCR links alone are s"

Here, we examined diglutathionylated wild type protease (Cys-67-SSG, Cys-95-SSG) and the monoglutathionylated protease mutants (C67A, Cys-95-SSG and C95A, Cys-67-SSG) as potential substrates for thioltransferase (glutaredoxin). Time-dependent changes in the extent of deglutathionylation of each protein were assayed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Glutathione alone was not an effective reductant, whereas thioltransferase displayed differential catalysis toward the Cys-95-SSG and Cys-67-SSG sites. At low thioltransferase concentrations (5 nm), deglutathionylation occurred almost exclusively at Cys-95-SSG. With substantially more thioltransferase (100 nm) Cys-67-SSG was partially deglutathionylated but only at 20% of the rate of Cys-95-SSG reduction. Treatment of the diglutathionylated protease with thioltransferase not only restored protease activity but generated an enzyme preparation that had a 3- to 5-fold greater specific activity relative to the fully reduced form. Immunoblot analysis of HIV-1MN virus with an antibody to thioltransferase detected a band co-migrating with recombinant thioltransferase that persisted following subtilisin treatment, indicating the presence of thioltransferase within HIV-1. Our results implicate thioltransferase in the regulation and/or maintenance of protease activity in HIV-1 infected cells.

This enzyme is synthesized as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor and is active as a tightly associated dimer (1Darke P.L. Jordan S.P. Hall D.L. Zugay J.A. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

Virol. 1995; 69: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have demonstrated the requirement for a defined range of protease activity for optimal viral production. Similar findings have been obtained for the avian sarcoma leukemia virus protease (9Arad G. Chorev M. Shtorch A. Goldblum A. Kotler M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, retroviral polyprotein processing is a sensitive and tightly controlled process which, if disrupted, could be deleterious to viral maturation. Recent studies have indicated that the two cysteines of the HIV-1 protease may be involved in redox regulation of protease activity (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The two cysteine residues are highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates from patients. Of 31 different HIV-1 isolates spanning 6 different major subtypes, all contain cysteine 95, whereas 29 contain cysteine 67 (11$$Google Scholar). By contrast, the HIV-2 protease does not contain conserved cysteine residues, suggesting that the cysteine residues of the HIV-1 protease are not absolutely required for retroviral polyprotein processing but rather may offer a selective advantage for HIV-1in vivo. Under native conditions, both cysteines of the HIV-1 protease are unusually susceptible to oxidation (12Karlstrom A.R. Shames B.D. Levine R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Modification of either cysteine residue of the HIV-1 protease with sulfhydryl modifying reagents, such as 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), leads to a decrease or loss in protease activity (10Davis D.A.

Additional studies, utilizing protease mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis, demonstrated that mixed disulfides between the cysteine residues and glutathione (glutathionylation) have dramatic effects on protease activity. Glutathionylation of cysteine 67, a solvent exposed residue, increased activity severalfold and also stabilized the activity in vitro. However, glutathionylation of cysteine 95, located at the dimer interface, abolished protease activity (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vivo, cysteine modification of proteins with glutathione increases in cells under conditions of oxidative stress (16Rokutan K. Johnston R.B.J. Kawai K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G247-G254PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chai Y.-C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston R.B.J. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which would make the cysteines of the HIV-1 protease likely candidates for glutathionylation in HIV-1-infected cells. The reversible nature of glutathionylation and its effects on HIV-1 protease activity led us to investigate the possible involvement of human thioltransferase in regulating the redox status of these cysteine residues. Thioltransferase (EC 1.8.4.2) (also known as glutaredoxin) belongs to the class of enzymes termed thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, which include thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase (19Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E.

The prevalence of S-glutathionylation of proteins under conditions of oxidative stress has focused attention on the role of thioltransferase in maintaining the activities of important cellular proteins that are altered by glutathionylation (20Mieyal J.J.

In this light, we hypothesized that thioltransferase may play a similar role for the HIV-1 protease under conditions favoring glutathionylation during viral replication. In the current study, we discovered that thioltransferase preferentially deglutathionylates cysteine 95 of the HIV-1 protease leading to modulation of protease activity. In addition, we report, for the first time, the detection of this mammalian protein within HIV-1 virions. Recombinant HIV-1 protease (strain HXB2) and two HIV-1 protease mutants (C67A and C95A) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protease activity was assayed using a 9 amino acid peptide spanning the p17/24 junction in the HIV-1 Gag protein as the substrate, as described previously (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Assays for protease activity were carried out in 100–200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol for 1–5 min, as indicated, with a final substrate concentration of 2 mm. Recombinant human thioltransferase (57 units/mg) was expressed in E. coli, purified and assayed as described previously (25Chrestensen C.A. Eckman C.B. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and stored at −70 °C in 20% glycerol. The HIV-1 wild type protease and mutant proteases (C67A and C95A) were refolded and stored in 20 mm HCl at pH 1.6 at 0.2–1.5 mg ml−1 as described previously (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To glutathionylate the cysteines, the proteases were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8, 6.0m guanidine, 1 mm disodium EDTA and 40 mm glutathione disulfide. The reaction was stopped by acidification to pH < 2.0 with trifluoroacetic acid. More than 80% of both cysteines were glutathionylated using this procedure. The glutathionylated proteases were purified (>95%) from residual unmodified protease by RP-HPLC by exploiting the change in retention time imparted by each glutathionyl moiety. Each of the 3 glutathionylated proteases were separated on a Vydac C18column using a gradient method with solvent A, consisting of deionized water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B, consisting of acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at 1 ml min−1 and the percent of solvent B was increased linearly from 5 to 35% over 5 min followed by an increase to 57.5% solvent B over the next 15 min; solvent B was then increased to 95% over 2 min and then ramped back to the initial starting conditions over the final 5 min of the gradient program. Protease elution was monitored at both 205 and 276 nm. The location of the peaks from RP-HPLC corresponding to the glutathionylated forms of the C67A and C95A mutant proteases had been identified previously by electrospray mass spectrometry (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following purification by RP-HPLC, all proteases were refolded as described previously (14Karlstrom A.R. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5552-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except that DTT was omitted to prevent reduction of the glutathionyl disulfides. Protein concentrations were calculated using the molar absorptivity (ε280 nm = 12,800 m−1cm−1). The final stock solutions of the various proteases were stored in 20 mm HCl, pH 1.6, at −70 °C. To test the proteases as substrates for human thioltransferase, the glutathionylated forms of the protease (at 1–4 μm) were incubated in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, 60 μg ml−1 of bovine serum albumin and 0.5 mm reduced glutathione (unless otherwise indicated). Thioltransferase was added, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for various times, and where indicated in text aliquots were assayed for protease activity. The reaction was stopped by acidification (pH < 2) with trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were then analyzed by RP-HPLC, and the areas of absorbance peaks (205 nm) corresponding to the glutathionylated and deglutathionylated proteases were used to determine the extent of deglutathionylation at each cysteine residue. HIV-1MN samples were obtained from the Clone 4 cell line (26Bess J.W. Powell P.J. Issaq H.J. Schumack L.J. Grimes M.K. Henderson L.E. Arthur L.O. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and digested with subtilisin as described previously (27Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G. Sowder R.C.N. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The treated viral preparation was then repurified by sucrose banding. Viral samples were treated with 50 mm DTT and 20 mm TCEP (Calbiochem) to maintain the cysteine residues of thioltransferase in their reduced form. Samples were electrophoresed on a 10% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel with MES running buffer using the NuPage system from Novex (San Diego, CA). Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and thioltransferase was detected using an anti-glutaredoxin antibody obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Monoclonal antibodies to gp120 were provided by the AIDS Vaccine Program, NCI-FCRDC (Frederick, MD), and the monoclonal antibodies to p24 were obtained from Intracel (Cambridge, MA). For competition experiments, 20 μg of glutaredoxin antibody were preincubated at room temperature in the presence or absence of 6 μg of purified thioltransferase for 2 h at a dilution of 1:50, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to eliminate thioltransferase-bound antibodies. The wild type HIV-1 protease and the C67A and C95A mutants were each glutathionylated at their respective cysteine residues, purified by RP-HPLC, and refolded as described previously (14Karlstrom A.R. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5552-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) for use as substrates for human thioltransferase. The glutathionylated form of each protease monomer had a distinct retention time on the C18 column and could be separated easily from the corresponding unmodified form by RP-HPLC analysis, thus providing an effective assay to assess the extent of deglutathionylation (Fig.1). Of the 3 different glutathionylated HIV-1 proteases, the diglutathionylated wild type, denoted as WT-(SSG)2, eluted earliest. Further characterization showed that the eluted fraction corresponding to this peak gave the expected mass by electrospray mass spectrometry (expected 11,388 Da; obtained 11,389 Da) for the WT-(SSG)2 protease monomer (data not shown). The WT-(SSG)2 protease could be readily converted to the reduced form (>90%) in the presence of 20 mm TCEP, a potent reducing agent (28Han J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thioltransferase readily catalyzed the GSH-dependent deglutathionylation of the C67A,Cys-95-SSG (glutathionylated at cysteine 95) protease as determined by RP-HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). Further experiments demonstrated the requirement for thioltransferase catalysis, because glutathione alone (0.5 mm) showed no measurable reduction of cysteine 95 during a 10 min time course, whereas nearly 30% was deglutathionylated when 5 nm thioltransferase was added with GSH (Fig. 2). As reported previously, the C95-SSG protease is inactivated by the glutathionyl moiety (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, treatment of the inactivated protease with thioltransferase resulted in the restoration of protease activity in a time-dependent manner reflecting the rate of deglutathionylation (Fig. 2). This observation is also consistent with previous results showing that reduction of C67A,Cys-95-SSG with 10 mm DTT could restore protease activity. In contrast to the results with the C67A,Cys-95-SSG protease, the C95A,Cys-67-SSG (glutathionylated at position 67) protease was a poor substrate for thioltransferase. Treatment with 5 nmthioltransferase did not lead to measurable deglutathionylation of cysteine 67 over a 10 min assay (Fig. 2), nor did it significantly alter protease activity (Fig. 2). C95A,Cys-67-SSG, however, was not completely resistant to thioltransferase treatment. Exposure of the C95A,Cys-67-SSG protease to a much higher concentration of thioltransferase (100 nm) for 5 min deglutathionylated up to 20% of the C67-SSG protease compared with 60% for the C67A, Cys-95-SSG protease. These studies indicated that thioltransferase preferentially catalyzes the deglutathionylation of cysteine 95 of the HIV-1 protease. The wild type protease, WT-(SSG)2 (glutathionylated at both cysteine 67 and cysteine 95) (so that the dimeric protease is tetraglutathionylated), was then tested as a substrate for thioltransferase. Based on the results with the mutant proteases, one would predict that the WT-(SSG)2 protease would be selectively deglutathionylated at cysteine 95 in the presence of thioltransferase. Treatment of the WT-(SSG)2 protease with 20 nm thioltransferase and 0.5 mm GSH for 5 min resulted in a decrease in the area for the WT-(SSG)2 peak and the generation of an additional peak in the RP-HPLC chromatogram along with two minor peaks eluting later (Fig.3, top panel). The new peak eluted approximately 0.5 min later than that assigned to the WT-(SSG)2 protease, and the mass obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry was consistent with a monoglutathionylated form of the protease monomer (expected 11,083 Da; obtained 11,084 Da). The retention time for this new peak corresponded closely to the retention time for the C95A,Cys-67-SSG protease mutant (retention time of 15.6 min compared with 15.8 min for the mutant, see Fig. 1), suggesting that the new peak represented the conversion of part of the WT-(SSG)2 protease to the WT-Cys-95-SH,Cys-67-SSG protease generated by deglutathionylation at position 95 but not at position 67. If so, we would hypothesize that thioltransferase treatment of the WT-(SSG)2 protease would restore protease activity. To determine if thioltransferase restored protease activity for the WT-(SSG)2 protease, we measured protease activity following thioltransferase treatment of the inactive WT-(SSG)2 protease, expecting that selective deglutathionylation at cysteine 95 would restore protease activity. As predicted, thioltransferase treatment of the WT-(SSG)2protease did reactivate the HIV-1 protease (Fig. 3, top panel, inset). The specific activity was 2.3 μm/min/mg based on total protein (Fig. 3, top panel, inset) but it was 8.1 μm/min/mg when calculated based on the amount of protein associated with that of the new peak generated by thioltransferase treatment (Table I). The change in protease activity for the WT-(SSG)2 protease resulting from thioltransferase treatment correlated closely with the extent of deglutathionylation as assessed by RP-HPLC (Table I). Calculating specific activity based on the percentage of protease deglutathionylated to active forms by thioltransferase (which includes those forms deglutathionylated at cysteine 95 as determined by RP-HPLC analysis) yielded a specific activity approximately 3- to 5-fold greater than that expected for the TCEP-treated enzyme (Table I). These data are consistent with our previous studies, which showed that glutathionylation of C95A protease at cysteine 67 significantly increased protease activity as compared with wild type (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that selective glutathionylation of the wild type enzyme at cysteine 67 may result in a form of the enzyme with significantly greater protease activity than unmodified wild type protease.Table IActivation of HIV-1 protease activity following thioltransferase treatment of the WT-(SSG)2 proteaseTreatment of WT-(SSG)2 proteaseProtease activity% Protease deglutathionylated at Cys-95Specific Activity1-aSpecific activity was calculated based on the percent of the total enzyme that was converted to active forms as assessed by RP-HPLC (the monoglutathionylated form of the protease and the wild type unmodified form).

Open table in a new tab Deglutathionylation of the WT-(SSG)2 protease was also studied as a function of GSH concentration. In the absence of GSH, no deglutathionylation was observed (Fig.4). Measurable deglutathionylation of the WT-(SSG)2 protease by GSH alone was not detected until more than 1 mm GSH was present, whereas the thioltransferase-catalyzed reaction was already half-maximal at less than 0.1 mm GSH (Fig. 4). Based on these data, thioltransferase (20 nm), in the presence of glutathione, was more than 50,000 times more potent than GSH alone (>1 mm) at deglutathionylating cysteine 95. GSH alone at concentrations as high as 10 mm did not result in measurable deglutathionylation of the cysteine 67 residue of the WT-(SSG)2 protease. In contrast, treatment with 10 mm DTT resulted in partial deglutathionylation at both cysteine 67 and cysteine 95 as shown by the presence of four peaks in the RP-HPLC chromatogram representing the four different redox forms of the wild type protease monomer (not shown). The same four peaks were obtained when the WT-(SSG)2 protease was treated with 100 nm thioltransferase (Fig. 3, bottom panel). In this case, the protease specific activity was 5.2 μm/min/mg based on total protein but is 8.3 μm/min/mg when calculated based on the amount of active forms of the enzyme present in the mixture. This value is still significantly higher than that for the fully reduced wild type protease and may indicate progressive deglutathionylation of the tetraglutathionylated wild type protease dimer. This could generate partially glutathionylated heterodimers as intermediates that are more active than the fully reduced dimeric protease. These studies show that the enzymatic deglutathionylation by thioltransferase is much more efficient than chemical deglutathionylation by DTT on a molar basis (100 nm thioltransferase versus 10 mm DTT, i.e. 100,000 times), and the thioltransferase-catalyzed reaction displayed a clear preference for cysteine 95, which is consistent with the data for the individual mutant proteases. The activation of protease activity from the selective deglutathionylation of cysteine 95 of the HIV-1 protease by human thioltransferase suggested a possible role for this enzyme in HIV-1 replication. It has been shown that vaccinia virus and T4 phage both encode and package their own glutaredoxins, which are functional as thioltransferases (29Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7060-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Gvakharia B.O. Koonin E.K. Mathews C.K. Virology. 1996; 226: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Gvakharia B.O. Hanson E. Koonin E.K. Mathews C.K. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15307-15310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed possible that HIV-1 might package human thioltransferase in a similar manner. To test this hypothesis, we utilized viral preparations from an H9 cell clone (26Bess J.W. Powell P.J. Issaq H.J. Schumack L.J. Grimes M.K. Henderson L.E. Arthur L.O. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that produces virions in the absence of significant levels of cellular microvesicles that would contaminate the preparation with cellular proteins as indicated by others (32Gluschankof P. Mondor I. Gelderblom H.R. Sattentau Q.J. Virology. 1997; 230: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Such preparations had previously been employed to identify the presence of cyclophilin A in HIV-1 (27Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G. Sowder R.C.N. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When such a virion preparation is treated with subtilisin, proteins found on the outside of HIV-1 virions are digested, whereas proteins within HIV-1 remain intact. Following subtilisin digestion, the virus preparation is purified via a sucrose gradient that eliminates any remaining microvesicle contamination (27Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G. Sowder R.C.N. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, a band co-migrating with pure human thioltransferase was detected in purified HIV-1 virion preparations. Furthermore, following competition of the thioltransferase antibody with purified thioltransferase, the band co-migrating with thioltransferase was no longer detected, confirming this band as human thioltransferase (Fig. 5 A). After subtilisin treatment, the band intensity decreased somewhat, indicating that some of the thioltransferase was located externally to the virus. However, the remaining band was about 50% of the intensity of the untreated virus preparation. By contrast, gp120, a membrane protein located on the outside of the virion, was almost completely eliminated by subtilisin treatment (Fig. 5 B), and as expected, p24, the capsid protein, was unaffected by the subtilisin treatment (Fig.5 B). Overall, these results indicated that a significant portion of the thioltransferase band in the viral preparations represented thioltransferase within viral particles. Cysteine residues in proteins serve a number of important roles, including catalysis (33Grierson A.W. Nicholson R. Talbot P. Webster A. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), protein folding (34Lundstrom-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and DNA binding (35Grasser F.A. LaMontagne K. Whittaker L. Stohr S. Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1005-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteines can also play an important role in the regulation of enzyme activity like that described for citrate synthase and adenovirus protease (33Grierson A.W. Nicholson R. Talbot P. Webster A. Kemp G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 2761-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Webster A. Leith I.R. Hay R.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7292-7300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Webster A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20709-20713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The highly conserved nature of the two cysteine residues of the HIV-1 protease, which are neither directly involved in the catalytic mechanism nor involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation, suggests a role for these residues in the regulation or maintenance of protease activity. In support of this, Davis et al. (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that modification of cysteine 67 with the common cellular thiol glutathione leads to increased protease activity and enzyme stabilization, whereas the same modification at cysteine 95 leads to inhibition of activity. The concept of regulation is now further supported by the current studies that demonstrate thioltransferase selectivity. The data demonstrate that thioltransferase preferentially catalyzes the deglutathionylation of cysteine 95 from each of the diglutathionylated subunits of the dimeric HIV-1 wild type protease. This may then lead to a more stable form(s) of the protease (WT-Cys-95-SH,Cys-67-SSG) with greater protease activity than the fully reduced enzyme based upon studies of the glutathionylated C95A protease mutant (10Davis D.A. Dorsey K. Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Fales H.M. Levine R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2482-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is supported by the apparent increase in specific protease activity noted for the fully diglutathionylated wild type protease mixture following thioltransferase treatment. The differential effects of glutathionylation at Cys-95 and Cys-67 and the differential catalysis by thioltransferase suggest that the protease may undergo multiphasic changes in activity during the infection cycle, dependent on the redox status of the host cell and virion. Mixed disulfide formation in proteins (S-thiolation) is significantly increased in cells placed under oxidative stress (16Rokutan K. Johnston R.B.J. Kawai K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G247-G254PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chai Y.-C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston R.B.J. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Recently, evidence has accumulated indicating that HIV-1 infection leads to oxidative stress and that this is enhanced by agents that induce oxidative stress, such as tumor necrosis factor α or hydrogen peroxide (40Aukrust P.

Also, several studies have shown that HIV-1 infection leads to significant changes in the levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione in certain cells (40Aukrust P. Svardal A.M. Muller F. Lunden B. Berge R.K. Ueland P.M. Froland S.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 258-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Buhl R. Holroyd K.J. Mastrangeli A.E.A.

Lancet. 1992; 339: 909-912Abstract PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that modification of the cysteine residues of cellular and viral proteins would be favored in cells that undergo oxidative stress when infected with HIV-1. In particular, cysteine 67 may be especially susceptible to S-thiolation in HIV-1 infected cells since this residue is solvent-exposed and unusually reactive under native conditions (12Karlstrom A.R. Shames B.D. Levine R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,48D'Ettorre C. Levine R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In support of the concept that viral infection can lead to oxidative stress is the recent demonstration that sendai virus leads to the production of significant amounts of glutathione-mixed disulfides in cells 24 h after infection (49Ciriolo M.R. Palamara A.T. Incerpi S. Lafavia E. Bue M.C. De Vito P. Garaci E. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2700-2708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thioltransferase, which has been found to be a ubiquitous enzyme in mammalian cells, is abundant in human macrophages (50Rozell B. Barcena J.A. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 314-323PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore may play a significant role in maintaining the activity of the HIV-1 protease during oxidative stress. We found that thioltransferase was detectable in virion preparations following subtilisin digestion, providing evidence that this enzyme is present within virions. Other host proteins have been identified previously within HIV-1 virions including cyclophilin A, which is essential for viral infectivity (11$$Google Scholar, 27Ott D.E. Coren L.V. Johnson D.G.

Virol. 1990; 64: 3207-3211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated very low levels of thioltransferase, suggesting passive acquisition of cellular thioltransferase by the virus. It would be of interest to determine if thioltransferase within HIV-1 virions offers an advantage in regards to viral infectivity. Interestingly, vaccinia virus and T4 bacteriophage each encode two different functional glutaredoxins that have thioltransferase activity (29Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7060-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Gvakharia B.O. Koonin E.K. Mathews C.K. Virology. 1996; 226: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Gvakharia B.O.

Although the role of the glutaredoxins (thioltransferases) in the viral life cycle is uncertain, its presence in the virus supports the argument that thioltransferase may play a fundamental role in optimizing HIV-1 replication. Several roles for thioltransferase in viral replication are conceivable, including homeostatic or regulatory control of the glutathionylation status of sulfhydryl groups on vital proteins, including metabolic enzymes and transcription factors (20Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar). Thioltransferase could also affect the glutathione-dependent folding of viral proteins containing cysteine residues, including the HIV-1 protease (34Lundstrom-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, thioltransferase could protect important viral proteins that are oxidatively damaged during oxidative stress. In particular, inactivation of the protease through disulfide bond formation may explain the inability to completely restore polyprotein processing in immature virions once they have been released from cells (55Humphrey R.W. Ohagen A. Davis D.A. Fukazawa T. Hayashi H. Hoglund S. Mitsuya H. Yarchoan R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

As assessed by immunoblot analysis of one- and two-dimensional PAGE, insulin appears to dephosphorylate one site within p30C/EBPα and an additional site within p42C/EBPα. Consistent with insulin causing dephosphorylation of C/EBPα through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, addition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (e.g. wortmannin) blocks insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. In the absence of insulin, wortmannin or LY294002 enhance C/EBPα phosphorylation. Similarly, blocking the activity of FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein with rapamycin increases phosphorylation of C/EBPα in the absence of insulin. Dephosphorylation of C/EBPα by insulin is partially blocked by rapamycin, consistent with a model in which activation of FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase results in dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. The dephosphorylation of C/EBPα by insulin, in conjunction with the insulin-dependent decline in C/EBPα mRNA and protein, has been hypothesized to play a role in repression of GLUT4 transcription by insulin. Consistent with this hypothesis, the decline of GLUT4 mRNA following exposure of adipocytes to insulin correlates with dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. However, the repression of C/EBPα mRNA and protein levels by insulin is blocked with an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway without blocking the repression of GLUT4 mRNA, thus dissociating the regulation of C/EBPα and GLUT4 mRNAs by insulin. A decline in C/EBPα mRNA and protein may not be required to suppress GLUT4 transcription because insulin also induces expression of the dominant-negative form of C/EBPβ (liver inhibitory protein), which blocks transactivation by C/EBP transcription factors. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin (IC50 ∼200 pm insulin) or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IC50 ∼200 pm IGF-1) stimulates dephosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), a transcription factor involved in preadipocyte differentiation.

The 3T3-L1 cell line has been widely used to delineate the mechanisms through which insulin regulates gene expression and metabolism. (1Green H. Kehinde O.

When exposed to appropriate differentiation stimuli, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes lose their fibroblastic features, undergo two cycles of mitosis, round-up, and acquire the morphological and biochemical phenotype of adipocytes. Although our understanding of the sequence of events involved in differentiation remains incomplete, compelling evidence indicates that differentiation occurs when forces that repress differentiation are overcome by forces that stimulate it (reviewed in Refs. 7Cornelius P.

One of the transcription factors identified as playing a critical role in stimulating preadipocyte differentiation is CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; FRAP, FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein; GLUT4, insulin-responsive glucose transporter; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. C/EBPα was purified and cloned as a hepatic nuclear factor that binds to the CCAAT motif and “core homology” sequences found in certain viral promoters/enhancers, as well as the albumin gene promoter (reviewed in Ref. 13McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar). Following the cloning of the C/EBPα gene, other members of this gene family, including C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, were identified and characterized. Members of the C/EBP family share considerable amino acid sequence identity within the C-terminal domain, which confers the ability to bind DNA (basic region) and to form dimers (leucine zipper) with themselves or with other family members. In contrast, C/EBP family members share little sequence identity in the N-terminal section, which contains the domains that activate or inhibit transcription. Both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are subject to translation from alternative start sites. For example, translation is initiated predominantly from the 1st and 3rd start codons in the C/EBPα mRNA, resulting in C/EBPα isoforms with molecular masses of 42 and 30 kDa, respectively (14Lin F.-T.

A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Both p42C/EBPα and p30C/EBPα are capable of transactivating promoters that contain C/EBP-binding sites (14Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ mRNA is also translated from the 1st and 3rd start codons giving rise to an active form, liveractivator protein (LAP) (17Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and a dominant-negative form, liver inhibitoryprotein (LIP) (18Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Expression of LIP inhibits transactivation by other C/EBP transcription factors. Although C/EBPα plays a critical role in preadipocyte differentiation, the importance of C/EBPα in mature adipocytes is unknown. Expression of C/EBPα remains high in adipocytes in culture and in vivo, suggesting that C/EBPα continues to regulate expression of adipocyte genes in these contexts. If so, the regulation of C/EBPα by extracellular signals may coordinate transcription of a set of adipocyte genes, resulting in altered adipocyte gene expression and metabolism. A growing body of evidence indicates that C/EBPα may play a role in hormonal control of gene expression in adipocytes and other cell types (19Gotoh T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3694-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol.

For example, the transcription of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ is rapidly and reciprocally regulated by glucocorticoids in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and white adipose tissue (24MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Lin F.-T. Chen S.S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19041-19047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with other studies, which also implicate C/EBP transcription factors as playing a role in the effects of glucocorticoids on gene expression (19Gotoh T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3694-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Ratajczak T. Williams P.M. DiLorenzo D. Ringold G.M. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5288-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to regulation by glucocorticoids, the expression of the C/EBP transcription factors is under rapid and dynamic regulation by insulin in fully differentated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have reported (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that insulin regulates C/EBPα through at least three mechanisms: rapid dephosphorylation of C/EBPα, suppression of C/EBPα gene transcription, and inactivation of C/EBPα through induction of the dominant-negative LIP. C/EBPα, in turn, may then regulate the expression of adipocyte genes such as GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter. Consistent with GLUT4 being regulated by C/EBPα in fully differentiated adipocytes, the promoter of GLUT4 contains a functional C/EBP-binding site (27Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and induction of GLUT4 during preadipocyte differentiation is dependent upon expression of C/EBPα (28Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 29Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Moreover, the decline of GLUT4 following exposure of adipocytes to insulin (30Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) is temporally correlated with the suppression of C/EBPα mRNA and protein, the dephosphorylation of C/EBPα, and the induction of LIP (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which insulin-mediated regulation of C/EBP transcription factors results in repression of GLUT4 transcription. The current study investigates the signaling pathways by which insulin regulates C/EBPα and other C/EBP family members and correlates these results with suppression of GLUT4. Addition of insulin to adipocytes stimulates dephosphorylation of C/EBPα through wortmannin- and rapamycin-sensitive signaling molecules, suggesting the involvement of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) (31Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar) in this process. In addition, the rapid decline in the amount of C/EBPα mRNA and protein is blocked by an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We demonstrate that suppression of GLUT4 mRNA by insulin does not require a decline in C/EBPα mRNA and protein, perhaps indicating that dephosphorylation of C/EBPα and induction of LIP play important roles in the regulation of GLUT4 by insulin. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained and induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (32Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that insulin was withdrawn from the medium on day 4 (24MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P.

Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 11–14 days after induction of differentiation, were switched to fresh media (either serum-free or containing 10% fetal bovine serum) 16–24 h before subjecting cells to treatment. Insulin (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.02 m HCl. Human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. in an aqueous solution. MEK inhibitor (PD98059; Parke-Davis), wortmannin (Sigma), LY294002 (BioMol Research Labs. Inc.), rapamycin (BioMol), and FK506 (BioMol) were dissolved in Me2SO. The final concentration of vehicle was ≤0.1%. Cellular RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells using RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test “B,” Inc). The amount of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and GLUT4 mRNAs was assessed by Northern blot analysis (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Magna; Micron Separations Inc.) and covalently bonded to the membrane by exposure to ultraviolet light (1200 J/cm2). Blots were prehybridized for 30 min (60 °C) in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) and hybridized for 60 min at 60 °C in an identical solution containing 2 × 106 dpm of labeled probe per ml. Hybridized blots were washed three times in a solution containing 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was at −80 °C with Kodak X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and an intensifying screen. Results were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The DNA fragment used as a probe for C/EBPα mRNA was a ∼900-base pair SacI/HindIII fragment complementary to the 3′ end of the C/EBPα coding region, as well as part of the 3′-untranslated region (+1175 to +2078 nucleotides relative to transcriptional start site). The cDNA fragment for C/EBPβ is full length and was cloned from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte library as reported previously (35Potter J.J. Mezey E. Cornelius P. Crabb D.W. Yang V.W. Arch. Biochem.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment for GLUT4 was described previously (37Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. McLenithan J.C. Braiterman L.T. Cornelius P. Pekala P.H. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3150-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Isolated probes were labeled to high specific activity (∼1 × 109 dpm per μg) by random hexamer priming (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocyte monolayers (10-cm plates) were washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1 ml of a lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. Alternatively, monolayers from 6-cm Petri plates were lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer. Lysates were boiled for 3 min, vortexed, and then boiled for an additional 7 min prior to storing at −21 °C. Western analysis was performed essentially as described previously (28Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10.5% or 15% polyacrylamide gels (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein was transferred to PVDF-Plus (Micron Separations, Inc.) at 150 mA overnight in a buffer containing 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 0.2m glycine. Filters were then blocked in 1% casein in 1 × TBS (25 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.6) (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief wash in 1 × TTBS (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.17% concentrated HCl, and 0.001% Thimerosol), filters were incubated with antisera or affinity purified antibody in a 1% bovine γ- globulin-1 × TTBS solution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times (10 min each) in 1 × TTBS, filters were incubated in 1 × TTBS containing 1% non-fat dried milk and a 1:4000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma ImmunoChemicals) for 1 h at room temperature. Filters were washed as above prior to visualization of bound IgG-peroxidase using Super Signal or Super Signal Ultra Chemiluminescence Substrates (Pierce). Immune serum against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an internal amino acid sequence of C/EBPα (present in both p42C/EBPα and p30C/EBPα) was prepared as described previously (14Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Immune sera against synthethic peptides corresponding to internal amino acid sequences in C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were described previously (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Antisera used for Western blots are specific for each C/EBP transcription factor and interactions with other C/EBP isoforms are not observed. Isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE were performed essentially as described previously (39Wishart M.J. Groblewski G. Goke B.J. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G676-G686PubMed Google Scholar) using the ISO-DALT system (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) and the method of O'Farrell (40O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-five min after the indicated hormonal treatment, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (6-cm plates) were lysed in 300 μl of a solution containing 9 m urea, 4% Nonidet P-40, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and frozen at −21 °C. Isoelectric focusing was at room temperature for 16 h over a pH range of 3–10. Cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) at 10 °C for 16 h. Prestained molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) and whole cell lysate samples were included in separate lanes as positive controls for M r separation and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Transfer of protein to PVDF-Plus and immunoblot analysis were as described above. We have shown previously that high concentrations of insulin stimulate an increase in mobility of p30C/EBPα and p42C/EBPα on SDS-PAGE (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To assess whether insulin regulates mobility of C/EBPα through activation of the insulin receptor, we examined the dependence of this effect on concentration of insulin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 0–300 nminsulin prior to cell lysis. Based on a previous time course (21MacDougald O.A. Cornelius P. Liu R. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 647-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), adipocytes were treated with insulin for 45 min. Upon immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 A), p42C/EBPα was observed as a broad diffuse band and mobility changes in p42C/EBPα were not observed. A minor band of slightly higher mobility than p42C/EBPα can be observed in this and other figures. This band corresponds to translation from the second in-frame methionine and gives rise to a protein of approximately 40 kDa (Fig.1 A, p40). Translation from the third in-frame methionine gives rise to p30C/EBPα (14Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In lysates from nontreated adipocytes, p30C/EBPα migrates as three bands (Fig.1 A), with bands a and b expressed more highly than band c. Insulin causes p30C/EBPα to migrate almost exclusively as band a, the form that migrates most rapidly on SDS-PAGE. The concentration of insulin that elicited a half-maximal mobility shift in p30C/EBPα was between 0.1 and 0.3 nm. This concentration dependence correlates well with the K D of 0.23 nmfor the binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (41Schumacher R. Soos M.A. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Siddle K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of the insulin receptor by insulin results in the loss of low mobility forms of p30C/EBPα with a concomitant increase in the high mobility form. IGF-1 also stimulates a mobility shift in C/EBPα isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When adipocytes are treated with IGF-1 for 45 min, the generation of the high mobility form (Fig. 1 A, band a) of p30C/EBPα is observed with 2 nm IGF-1. The concentration of IGF-1 required to give a half-maximal response was approximately 0.2 nm (Fig. 1 A). This correlates with the binding constant for IGF-1 to the IGF-1 receptor (K D = 0.16 nm (41Schumacher R. Soos M.A. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Siddle K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IGF-1 stimulates the loss of lower mobility forms of C/EBP through activation of the IGF-1 receptor. A mobility shift in the migration of protein when subjected to SDS-PAGE is often indicative of a change in the phosphorylation of the protein. To determine if insulin induces dephosphorylation of C/EBPα, whole cell lysates from control adipocytes or adipocytes treated with 167 nm insulin were prepared. Approximately 200 μg of each lysate was incubated with or without alkaline phosphatase for 1 h prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis for C/EBPα. The low mobility forms (Fig.1 B, bands b and c) of p30C/EBPα observed in immunoblots from control adipocytes were greatly reduced with a concomitant increase in the high-mobility form (band a) of p30C/EBPα. The mobility of p30C/EBPα from insulin-treated adipocytes (predominantly band a) was not influenced by alkaline phosphatase treatment, suggesting that the high mobility band a of p30C/EBPα represents the dephosphorylated form. (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). A similar regulation of p42C/EBPα can also be observed, although the changes in mobility are less dramatic. The effects of alkaline phosphatase were blocked by addition of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 60 μm β-glycerol phosphate, and 5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate), and phosphatase inhibitors alone did not influence mobility of C/EBPα (data not shown). These data indicate that the retarded mobility of C/EBPα upon SDS-PAGE is due to phosphorylation of C/EBPα. Therefore, the loss of lower mobility forms of C/EBPα after insulin or IGF-1 treatment is due to dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. To ascertain whether the dephosphorylation of C/EBPα by insulin is mediated through PI 3-kinase, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with insulin (167 nm) and/or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (200 nm), prior to cell lysis and immunoblot analysis. While insulin results in a predominantly high-mobility dephosphorylated form of p30C/EBPα (Fig.2 A, band a), wortmannin results in a lower mobility phosphorylated form (Fig.2 A, band b). Although less dramatic than with p30C/EBPα, this regulation is also observed with p42C/EBPα. As expected for an inhibitor of a downstream signaling pathway, wortmannin blocks the ability of insulin to stimulate dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. Indeed, wortmannin stimulates the phosphorylation of p30C/EBPα (band b) even when insulin is added simultaneously. An even lower mobility form of p30C/EBPα (band c) can also be observed, suggesting the presence of additional phosphorylated residues not regulated by wortmannin. Since the concentration of wortmannin needed to block PI 3-kinase is much less than the concentrations needed to block other enzymes, the dependence of C/EBPα phosphorylation on concentration of wortmannin was examined (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1-6). Wortmannin caused the phosphorylation of p30C/EBPα, with a concentration-dependent loss of the dephosphorylated form of p30C/EBPα (Fig. 2 B, band a). The half-maximal effects of wortmannin on p30C/EBPα were observed between 10 and 30 nm, consistent with the concentration needed to block other effects of insulin mediated through PI 3-kinase in adipocytes, such as insulin-induced glucose uptake. To provide additional evidence that PI 3-kinase is involved in regulating C/EBPα phosphorylation, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) structurally unrelated to wortmannin was incubated with 3T3-L1 adipocytes for 45 min prior to preparation of whole cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis for C/EBPα. LY294002, like wortmannin, results in the phosphorylation of C/EBPα, as assessed by the formation of band b (and to a lesser extent, band c) of p30C/EBPα (Fig. 2 B,lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, these data indicate that PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for insulin to stimulate dephosphorylation of C/EBPα. Part of the insulin-signaling pathway beyond PI 3-kinase is mediated by FRAP (also known as rapamycin and FKBP12 target 1, mammalian targets of rapamycin, and RAPT1 (31Brown E.J. Albers M.W.

The FRAP pathway is inhibited by rapamycin, which binds specifically to FK506-binding protein. The rapamycin·FK506 binding protein complex then binds and inhibits FRAP activity. To determine whether insulin-induced dephosphorylation of C/EBPα occurs through a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, fully differentiated adipocytes were incubated with vehicle (Fig. 3,CT), rapamycin (R), insulin (I), or rapamycin and insulin (R+ I) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. We observed that the presence of serum correlated with a higher proportion of the dephosphorylated form of p30C/EBPα, and that incubation under serum-free conditions led to an increase in the phosphorylated forms. Thus, this experiment was performed after 16 h in serum-free medium (Fig. 3, lanes 1–4) or in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in serum-containing medium increases the proportion of the highest mobility form of p30C/EBPα (band a) but does not substantially influence regulation of C/EBPα phosphorylation by i"

Ccc2p appears to be both a structural and functional homolog of ATPases impaired in two human disorders of intracellular copper transport, Menkes disease and Wilson disease. In the present work, three approaches were used to determine the locus of Ccc2p-dependent copper export within the secretory pathway. First, like ccc2 mutants,sec mutants blocked in the secretory pathway at steps prior to and including the Golgi complex failed to deliver radioactive copper to Fet3p. Second, also like ccc2 mutants, vps33 and certain other mutants with defects in post-Golgi sorting exhibited phenotypes traceable to deficient copper delivery to Fet3p. These findings were sufficient to explain the respiratory deficiency of these mutants. Third, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Ccc2p was distributed among several punctate foci within wild-type cells, consistent with late Golgi or post-Golgi localization. Thus, copper export by Ccc2p appears to be restricted to a late or post-Golgi compartment in the secretory pathway.

Biochemistry of Copper. 4. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 100Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the localization of these enzymes within specific cellular compartments varies with different enzymes and is a crucial determinant of their physiological roles. In both yeast and humans, for example, cytochrome c oxidase plays an essential role in oxygen utilization in mitochondria, while Cu,Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase functions in the detoxification of oxygen-derived free radicals in the cytosol. Most of the copper in the human body is in fact found in ceruloplasmin, a multicopper oxidase and glycoprotein secreted from liver cells into the circulation. This copper enzyme appears to function in iron metabolism (2Roeser H.P. Lee G.R. Nacht S. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida K.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a ceruloplasmin homolog, Fet3p, has been identified that participates in high affinity iron uptake at the cell surface (5Askwith C. Eide D. Ho A.V. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The fact that copper enzymes are localized to various cellular compartments suggests that mechanisms exist for the transport of copper across membranes into these compartments, since it is otherwise difficult to envision how fully folded, copper-loaded proteins might enter membrane-bound compartments from the cytosol. Of particular interest is how copper is transported into the secretory pathway for delivery to secreted or extracellular copper enzymes. In humans, such enzymes carry out a variety of functions, including the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and the maturation of connective tissue. Specific mechanisms for intracellular copper transport can be expected, given that foodstuffs usually contain only trace amounts of copper, but until recently these mechanisms have been obscure.In 1993, the genes associated with two inherited disorders of human copper metabolism were identified. One of these disorders, Menkes disease (6Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 7Chelly J. Tumer Z. Tonnesen T.

Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), is marked by failure of the liver to excrete surplus copper into the biliary tract and to deliver copper to ceruloplasmin. Despite different tissue specificities, both disorders appear to involve a defect in the export of copper from the cytosol (12Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2211-2236Google Scholar). The genes associated with both of these disorders encode homologous P-type ATPases, suggesting that these ATPases mediate the export of copper from the cytosol (13Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Although functional characterization of these ATPases has proven difficult, some progress has been made in the characterization of a yeast homolog. This homolog, encoded by the CCC2 gene (14Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), also appears to export copper from the cytosol, since ccc2 mutant cells fail to deliver copper to the ceruloplasmin homolog, Fet3p, a membrane-bound glycoprotein whose copper-binding domains lie outside the cytosol (15Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Despite a failure to synthesize the holoprotein form of Fet3p,ccc2 mutant cells still produce wild-type amounts of the apoprotein form of Fet3p, and copper uptake remains unimpaired (15Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thus, ccc2 mutant cells exhibit signs of defective copper export into the secretory pathway that aptly model those observed in Menkes disease and Wilson disease.The aim of the present work was to characterize where copper enters the secretory pathway in yeast, using the genetic tools that are especially advantageous in this organism. Using a variety of yeast mutants with known defects in protein trafficking, the copper export activity of Ccc2p was assessed using biochemical and physiological assays of the copper content of Fet3p, and Ccc2p itself was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. It might be conjectured that copper export would occur within the endoplasmic reticulum, given the common requirement for metal cofactors in protein folding (16Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 381-384Google Scholar), or within the Golgi complex, in view of evidence that manganese is exported from the cytosol in yeast by a Golgi-resident P-type ATPase, Pmr1p (17Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported here suggest instead that Ccc2p-dependent copper export is restricted to a late- or post-Golgi compartment in the secretory pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast StrainsThe ccc2::URA3 and Δfet3::TRP1 cells were in the parental background YPH252 as described (15Yuan D.S.

Thesec mutant strains (sec1–1, sec4–2,sec7–1, sec18–1, sec21–1,sec23–1, sec53–6, and the congenic wild-type strain X2180–1A) (19Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) were from the Yeast Genetics Stock Center (Berkeley, CA). The vps mutant strains were part of a large collection of yeast strains generously provided by T. Stevens (20Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol.

Cells were then labeled with 67Cu (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM) (1 μCi/ml, 3 nm total copper) for 2 h at the indicated temperature. Membrane extracts were prepared and separated without prior denaturation on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels as described (15Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Loading of gels for autoradiograms was adjusted to compensate for variations in total cellular copper uptake, as measured after cell homogenization and pelleting of cell walls (22Lin C.M.

Membrane extracts were then prepared as described (15Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown for six generations in YPD medium supplemented with 25 mm each of sodium succinate and succinic acid (27Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell.

Cells were grown at 30 °C for 5 days.Expression and Visualization of Epitope-tagged Ccc2pThe CCC2 coding region together with 395 bp of 5′-DNA (and no 3′-DNA) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (28Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) using genomic DNA derived from the yeast strain YPH274 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Purified polymerase chain reaction products were introduced by ligation-independent cloning (30Aslanidis C. DeJong P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) into a low copy number yeast expression vector based on the CEN- and HIS3-containing vector, pRS413 (Stratagene) (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This vector (pDY207) was designed to fuse the 3′-ends of cloned coding sequences with sequences encoding three tandem copies of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (31Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) followed by two stop codons and the CYC1 terminator. The construction of this vector will be described elsewhere. 4D. S. Yuan, manuscript in preparation. ACCC2 fusion construct or pDY207 DNA lacking CCC2sequences was then transferred to the URA3 plasmid pRS416 (Stratagene) (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via EcoRI and XbaI sites in the multiple cloning site. Bacterial cultures (Escherichia colistrain DH5α) of CCC2 plasmids were susceptible to lysis in stationary phase; DNA was prepared from bacteria grown in Terrific Broth (60Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Bethesda Res. Lab. Focus. 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar) to a relatively low culture density (0.4A 600). Expression of aCCC2-containing plasmid (pDY228) or an empty expression vector (pDY225) in yeast cells was accomplished by growth at 30 °C in the defined medium used for copper autoradiography except with CuSO4 added to 0.1 μm (for ccc2cells with epitope-tagged Ccc2p) or 5 μm (forvps cells) and with uracil omitted. Immunofluorescence techniques were essentially as described (32Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), except that the primary antibody (1:2000) was a purified mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope tag (HA.11, Babco, Berkeley, CA) (33Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); the secondary antibody (1:200) was a Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). (Little specific signal was obtained with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 or a Texas Red conjugate.) 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) was added to the mounting medium (1 μg/ml) to stain nuclei. Confocal images were obtained using a laser scanning microscope equipped with Nomarski optics (Zeiss).DISCUSSIONIn the present work, yeast mutants with genetically determined defects in protein trafficking were used to localize Ccc2p-dependent copper export. Temperature-sensitivesec mutants were used to show that copper export requires integrity of the early secretory pathway. In particular, copper export required function of the intra-Golgi protein encoded by the SEC7 gene, while the SEC4 and SEC1gene products involved in transport and fusion of secretory vesicles were dispensable. These findings served to localize copper export to a late Golgi or post-Golgi compartment and led to the finding that Ccc2p is aberrantly distributed in a subset of vps mutants with defects in post-Golgi sorting, thereby suggesting that Ccc2p functions in a post-Golgi compartment diverted from the secretory pathway. A model encompassing these and previous (18Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) findings is presented in Fig. 6, in which Fet3p reaches this post-Golgi compartment as a complex with Ftr1p (18Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), receives copper from Ccc2p, and then completes its transit to the plasma membrane by mechanisms involving the SEC4 and SEC1 gene products (Fig. 2 B).It remains to be established whether Ccc2p is in fact localized to a sorted post-Golgi compartment or whether it is actually localized to an unsorted late-Golgi compartment within the constitutive secretory pathway. The effects of vps mutations on copper export are most simply interpreted as showing that Ccc2p functions in a sorted post-Golgi compartment, since by definition vacuolar protein sorting involves the sorting of vacuolar proteins from the constitutive secretory pathway. In this view, Fet3p would travel to this compartment for copper loading and then proceed to the plasma membrane. This maturation pathway for Fet3p apparently occurs independently of any protein sorting motifs that may exist in the membrane-spanning or cytosolic domains of Fet3p, since truncation of those domains does not affect copper loading and secretion.3 Although novel in yeast, such pathways are well described in mammalian cells in connection with major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation (e.g. Refs. 43Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar and 44Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and with the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles (e.g. Ref. 45Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two copper enzymes involved in mammalian neurotransmitter biosynthesis, dopamine-β-hydroxylase and peptidyl glycine α-amidating enzyme, are sorted away from the constitutive secretory pathway into neurosecretory vesicles through mechanisms that may involve acidic sorting compartments, independently of membrane-spanning or cytosolic domains in these enzymes (46Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The effects of vps mutations on Ccc2p localization and function may also be accounted for by the fact that many of these mutations affect the localization of late Golgi proteins as well as that of post-Golgi proteins (23Nothwehr S.F Conibear E. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 47Robinson J.S. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5813-5824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Wilsbach K. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3049-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 49Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is therefore also possible that Ccc2p is localized to a late Golgi compartment. An HA-tagged derivative of the late Golgi protein Kex2p was also redistributed in vps1, vps15, and vps33 mutants in a manner indistinguishable from that observed for the HA-tagged Ccc2p.3 Nevertheless, because of the ambiguities inherent in immunofluorescence studies of the late secretory pathway in yeast, double labeling experiments with differently tagged Ccc2p and Kex2p constructs will be necessary to determine whether these two proteins are in fact co-localized. Other phenotypes of certain vpsmutations include disruption of endocytic pathways (40Dulic V. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 50Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague Jr., G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 51Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and the mislocalization of subunits of the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (35$$Google Scholar). Notably, vma1 (tfp1) disruption mutants defective in vacuolar acidification (52Shih C.K. Wagner R. Feinstein S. Kanik-Ennulat C. Neff N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have severe copper phenotypes similar to ccc2 mutants,3 and another acidification mutant, vma3, has been isolated in a genetic screen for mutants with iron-correctable respiratory deficiency (53Eide D.J. Bridgham J.T. Zhao Z. Mattoon J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The acidification of post-Golgi organelles could be required for some aspect of the delivery of copper to Fet3p, e.g. in transporter-metal dissociation kinetics (54Rao K. van Renswoude J. Kempf C. Klausner R.D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 55Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and even in vacuolar protein sorting (Refs. 27Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and 56Yaver D.S. Nelson H. Nelson N. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It seems clear, however, that metallation of Fet3p by copper in vitro(e.g. in homogenization buffer) does not require an acidic pH and that the localization of copper export to the late secretory pathway is attributable at least in part to the localization of Ccc2p there (Fig. 5).Recent evidence in mammalian cells indicates that the Menkes disease and Wilson disease gene products also function in the late secretory pathway, within trans-Golgi or endosomal compartments (57Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Suzuki M. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,58Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). 5J. Gitlin, personal communication. Thus, the exclusion of copper from the early secretory pathway may be a general feature of copper metabolism in eukaryotic cells. A rationale for this may be found in the fact that the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has a relatively high oxidation potential (59Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Copper delivered into this environment would be oxidized to the Cu(II) oxidation state. As this copper species avidly binds imidazole groups in histidine residues and generates hydroxyl radicals in Fenton-type reactions (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. 4. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 100Google Scholar), it would probably disrupt essential functions of the early secretory pathway. Significantly, Fet3p apoprotein cannot be loaded with copper in vitro unless the copper is in the Cu(II) oxidation state.3 Therefore, at least for yeast, the ability of cells to withstand the biosynthesis of a secreted copper enzyme may hinge on their ability to segregate copper loading from other processes within the secretory pathway. Copper enzymes serve vital functions that involve molecular oxygen (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. 4. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 100Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the localization of these enzymes within specific cellular compartments varies with different enzymes and is a crucial determinant of their physiological roles. In both yeast and humans, for example, cytochrome c oxidase plays an essential role in oxygen utilization in mitochondria, while Cu,Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase functions in the detoxification of oxygen-derived free radicals in the cytosol. Most of the copper in the human body is in fact found in ceruloplasmin, a multicopper oxidase and glycoprotein secreted from liver cells into the circulation. This copper enzyme appears to function in iron metabolism (2Roeser H.P. Lee G.R. Nacht S. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1970; 49: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida K.

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the first enzyme preparation displayed a single band of 41 kDa that was identified as 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase A (thiolase A) by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The second enzyme preparation consisted of a 58- and a 46-kDa band. The 58-kDa polypeptide reacted with antibodies raised against either sterol carrier protein 2 or the thiolase domain of sterol carrier protein 2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase (SCP-2/thiolase), formerly also called sterol carrier protein X, whereas the 46-kDa polypeptide reacted only with the antibodies raised against the thiolase domain. Internal peptide sequencing confirmed that the 58-kDa polypeptide is SCP-2/thiolase and that the 46-kDa polypeptide is the thiolase domain of SCP-2/thiolase. Thiolase A catalyzed the cleavage of short, medium, and long straight chain 3-oxoacyl-CoAs, medium chain 3-oxoacyl-CoAs being the best substrates. The enzyme was inactive with the 2-methyl-branched 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA and with the bile acid intermediate 24-oxo-trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA.

Thiolases catalyze the thiolytic cleavage of 3-oxoacyl-CoAs in an acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon atoms and acetyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA in the case of 2-methyl-branched acyl-CoAs). Although reversible, the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable in the direction of condensation. Nevertheless, condensation occurs in vivo in such biosynthetic processes as cholesterol synthesis, ketone body synthesis, and fatty acid elongation. Usually, thiolases are divided into two groups: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases and 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolases (1Gehring U. Lynen F. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 391-405Google Scholar). Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases cleave only acetoacetyl-CoA, and in vivo they seem to work preferably in the direction of condensation, catalyzing, for example, the first reaction in cholesterol and ketone body synthesis (2Huth W.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thiolase A has not been purified yet, so it is not known how far its properties differ from those of the inducible thiolase B. Peroxisomes also contain a 58-kDa protein that cross-reacts with antibodies raised against SCP-2. Molecular cloning of the protein revealed that it consists of an N-terminal 404 amino acid domain that shows homology with a number of thiolases and a C-terminal 143 amino acid domain that is identical to the N-terminal presequence (20 amino acids) and mature sequence (123 amino acids) of SCP-2 (16Ossendorp B. Van Heusden P. De Beer A. Bos K. Schouten G. Wirtz K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 58-kDa protein, which was called SCP-X, and SCP-2 are transcribed from a single gene that contains two independent promoters (17Ohba T. Holt J. Billheimer J. Strauss J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10660-10668Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SCP-X has not been purified in its active form but the recombinant protein possessed 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase activity and displayed a straight chain length specificity that is roughly similar to that of thiolase B (18Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of its thiolase activity, Seedorf et al. (18Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed to rename the protein SCP-2/thiolase. Related to SCP-2/thiolase is a peroxisomal 46-kDa protein that cross-reacts with antibodies raised against various epitopes of the thiolase domain of SCP-2/thiolase but not with antibodies raised against SCP-2 (19Ossendorp B. Voorhout W. Amerongen A. Brunink F. Batenburg J. Wirtz K.W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the 46-kDa protein may originate from SCP-2/thiolase by intraperoxisomal proteolytic cleavage, possibly at the SCP-2 presequence-mature sequence transition (19Ossendorp B. Voorhout W. Amerongen A. Brunink F. Batenburg J. Wirtz K.W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes β-oxidize a wide variety of substrates including straight chain fatty acids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acids (e.g.pristanic acid), and the side chain of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids (for reviews, see Refs. 20Van den Bosch H.

We have recently found that peroxisomes contain several β-oxidation pathways with different substrate specificities. In rat liver, for example, straight chain acyl-CoAs are desaturated by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (23Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhove G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20065-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their enoyl-CoAs are then converted to 3-oxoacyl-CoAs by MFP-1, which forms (hydration) and dehydrogenatesl-3(3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (24Novikov D. Vanhove G.F. Carchon H. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27125-27135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D.

In contrast, 2-methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs and the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids are desaturated by pristanoyl-CoA oxidase and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase, respectively (23Van Veldhoven P.P.

The present study aimed at elucidating the functional role of the different peroxisomal 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolases catalyzing the last step in β-oxidation. We purified the two main thiolases present in peroxisomal fractions from normal rat liver and comparatively investigated their substrate specificity. The enzymes proved to be thiolase A and SCP-2/thiolase. Using various substrates, we could demonstrate that thiolase A cleaves straight chain 3-oxoacyl-CoAs, whereas SCP-2/thiolase is responsible for the cleavage of the 3-oxoacyl-CoAs of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids and the bile acid intermediates. Acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, medium chain acyl-CoAs, acyl-CoA oxidase (from Arthrobacter sp.), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (from porcine heart), crotonase (from bovine liver), and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Palmitoyl-CoA, CoA, DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow), and Blue Sepharose CL-6B were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Oxaloacetate, pyruvate, malate dehydrogenase (from pig heart), lactate dehydrogenase (from pig heart), NAD+, NADH, and conjugated antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. Cellulose phosphate, type P-11, was from Whatman. Econo-Pac hydroxylapatite cartridges were from Bio-Rad. DTNB and benzamidine were purchased from Janssen Chimica, and C18 silica Bondelut (500 mg; 3 ml) cartridges were from Varian Benelux. Ultrafiltration devices (Centriprep) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 were obtained from Amicon. Hexadecanedioyl-CoA (23Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhove G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P.

Asselberghs S. Eyssen H. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27125-27135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained as described. Medium chain (C6–C14) 3-oxoacyl-CoAs were synthesized enzymatically from the corresponding acyl-CoAs as described (7Seubert W. Lamberts I. Kramer R. Ohly B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 164: 498-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The incubation mixtures contained (final concentrations) 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mmpyruvate, 0.5 mm NAD+, lactate dehydrogenase (1 unit/ml), acyl-CoA oxidase (0.02 units/ml), crotonase (0.5 units/ml), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0.5 units/ml), 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 60 μm acyl-CoAs. After conversion of more than 70% of the acyl-CoAs to the corresponding oxocompounds (monitored at 303 nm by registration of the Mg2+-enolate complex formation, see below), the incubation media were adjusted to pH 5.5 by 1 m KH2PO4 and the substrates and products were separated from the synthesizing enzymes by ultrafiltration over Amicon Centriprep membranes. Partial purification of the oxocompounds was achieved by using C18 cartridges eluted with methanol (recovery 70–80%). After evaporation of the methanol under a stream of nitrogen, the residues were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The same conditions were used for the synthesis of 3-oxohexadecanedioyl-CoA from 25 μmhexadecanedioyl-CoA. The yield of the oxocompound was in the range of 25–30%. 3-Oxopalmitoyl-CoA was usually prepared by the same method from 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA (yield 25%). In some experiments 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA was made from 25 μmracemic 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA in the presence of 0.01% (w/v) albumin, the NAD+-regenerating system, and 0.5 units/ml 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (yield 25–30%). Similar conditions were used for producing 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA from 25 μm racemic 3-hydroxy-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA (yield 22–25%). For the synthesis of 24-oxo-THC-CoA from 25 μmracemic varanoyl-CoA (yield 17–20%), the incubation medium contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% (w/v) albumin, 0.5 mm oxaloacetate, 0.2 units/ml purified MFP-1, and 0.5 units/ml malate dehydrogenase. The use of malate dehydrogenase instead of lactate dehydrogenase for the regeneration of NAD+ is mandatory in this case because lactate dehydrogenase is able to reduce NAD+ in the presence of varanoyl-CoA reacting with one of the hydroxyl groups of the steroid nucleus. 2J. Adamski, F. Leenders, D. Novikov, P. P. Van Veldhoven, and G. P. Mannaerts, unpublished work. The low yields of 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA, 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA, and 24-oxo-THC-CoA after synthesis (monitored by the hydroxylamine/DTNB test, see below) prompted us to use an additional step for the purification of these compounds. After elution from the C18 cartridges and evaporation of the methanol as described above, the CoA derivatives were dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5 (buffer A), and injected onto an Econosphere C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 80 Å, 5 μm, Alltech) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The oxocompounds were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in buffer A. The adenine content of the CoA derivatives was determined at 259 nm (ε, 16,400 m−1cm−1) (27Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 931-941Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Since 3-oxo-2-methyl-branched acyl-CoAs do not form Mg2+-enolate complexes at slightly alkaline pH values (Ref. 28Middleton B. Bartlett K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 128: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, see also “Results”), concentrations of 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA and 24-oxo-THC-CoA were measured by using the ability of hydroxylamine (25 mm) to cleave specifically the thioester linkage of 3-oxo-thioesters at mild conditions (28Middleton B. Bartlett K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 128: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The release of CoA was detected with DTNB (ε, 14,100m−1 cm−1). Straight chain 3-oxocompounds were assayed with the same test or in the presence of NADH (0.2 mm) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0.5 units/ml). Male Wistar rats (body weight, approximately 200 g) maintained on a standard laboratory diet were used. Their livers were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. A light mitochondrial fraction, most enriched in lysosomes and peroxisomes, was isolated by differential centrifugation as described previously (29Verheyden K. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1109: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This fraction was then further purified by isopycnic centrifugation in an iso-osmotic self-generating Percoll gradient (30Vanhove G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhoutte F. Parmentier G. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24670-24675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified peroxisomes were collected from the gradient, diluted in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol and sonicated in a pulsed regime (4 × 15 s, output 4, 50% duty cycle; Branson sonifier B15) to release the matrix proteins from the particles. The cores and membrane fragments were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and the sediment was dissolved in the same buffer and subjected once again to sonication followed by centrifugation as described above. The supernatants of the two centrifugations were combined, concentrated, and used for further enzyme purification. This enzyme preparation contained 60–80% of the total thiolase activities, found with the different substrates in the purified whole peroxisomes. The two main thiolase activities present in the concentrate of peroxisomal matrix proteins were purified to near homogeneity by four successive chromatographic steps on different matrices. First, the enzyme preparation was mixed with CoA (10 μm, final concentration) and applied to a phosphocellulose column eluted with a linear gradient of KCl. Peroxisomal thiolases were not retained under these conditions, whereas traces of contaminating mitochondrial thiolases (3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase) were bound to the column. 3V. D. Antonenkov, P. P. Van Veldhoven, and G. P. Mannaerts, unpublished work (see also Ref. 10Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Separation of peroxisomal thiolases was achieved by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Thiolase A was eluted with the flow-through fractions, which were intensively dialyzed for the removal of CoA before reloading onto a phosphocellulose column. In the absence of CoA thiolase A bound to the column. The enzyme was eluted with a KCl gradient and passed through a Sephacryl-S-100-HR column for final purification. SCP-2/thiolase bound to the DEAE-Sepharose column and was eluted with increasing KCl concentrations. The enzyme preparation was than subjected to hydroxylapatite chromatography with KCl as the eluent. In the final purification step SCP-2/thiolase was passed through a Blue-Sepharose column, and the bound activity was eluted with a linear gradient of CoA (0–100 μm). Enzyme purification was monitored by measuring the thiolase activities (acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-oxooctanoyl-CoA as the substrates) and by analyzing the eluates by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against SCP-2 or the thiolase domain of SCP-2/thiolase (kindly provided by Prof. K. Wirtz). Final identification of the thiolases was performed by peptide sequencing of the purified enzymes. The complete purification procedure for peroxisomal thiolases, subunit structure of SCP-2/thiolase, and the effect of CoA at low concentrations on the chromatographic behavior of the thiolases will be discussed in full detail in a separate publication. 4V. D. Antonenkov, P. P. Van Veldhoven, and G. P. Mannaerts, manuscript in preparation. MFP-1 and MFP-2 were purified from rat liver peroxisomes as described previously (24Novikov D. Vanhove G.F.

Two different methods were used for the detection of thiolase activity in the direction of 3-oxoacyl-CoA cleavage. First, the enzymes were assayed by measuring the increase in absorption at 233 nm due to the formation of new thioester bonds (ε, 4,500 m−1 cm−1) (9Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1522-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (25 °C) routinely consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 60 μm CoA, and 10–60 μm oxocompound. Second, thiolase activity was also determined in terms of Mg2+-enolate complex disappearance (303 nm) as a result of the thiolytic cleavage (4Middleton B. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Seubert W. Lamberts I. Kramer R. Ohly B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 164: 498-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The assay mixture (25 °C) contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, albumin, CoA, and 3-oxoacyl-CoAs as indicated. The extinction coefficients for the Mg2+-enolate complexes were determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 303 nm after addition of acyl-CoA oxidase to the incubation mixture for the synthesis of the oxocompounds (see above) and by measuring the concentration of the 3-oxoacyl-CoAs in the same samples by means of the hydroxylamine/DTNB test. Since measurements of the Mg2+-enolate complex disappearance resulted in an underestimation of the thiolytic cleavage rates when short and medium chain substrates were used 5V. D. Antonenkov, P. P. Van Veldhoven, and G. P. Mannaerts, unpublished work. and since 2-methyl-branched oxocompounds such as 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA and 24-oxo-THC-CoA do not form Mg2+-enolate complexes (28Middleton B. Bartlett K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 128: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the Mg2+-enolate method was used in only a limited number of experiments (see Fig. 7) with 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA (ε, 8,900m−1 cm−1) and 3-oxohexadecanedioyl-CoA (ε, 10,600 m−1cm−1). 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (24Novikov D. Vanhove G.F. Carchon H. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27125-27135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), crotonase (24Novikov D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24670-24675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activities were assayed as described. Units of enzyme activity are expressed as μmol of substrate utilized or product formed per min. Products of the thiolytic cleavage of 3-oxo-2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA and 24-oxo-THC-CoA were analyzed at 25 °C on a Waters dual-pump gradient system by using an Econosphere C18 reverse-phase column (150 × 4.6 mm). Separation of the acyl-CoA thioesters was achieved by linearly increasing the acetonitrile content of the 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 5.5, elution buffer (see legends to figures for more details). Antibodies against thiolase A were prepared as follows: enzyme samples were subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE, and after transient visualization of the proteins (31Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the 41-kDa polypeptide was excised and injected into rabbits according to standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.3-18.10Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing, purified thiolase A was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and concentrated. The protein sample was then collected on a ProSorb membrane (Perkin-Elmer) and subjected to automated Edman degradation by using a Procise 492 sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Difficulties were encountered for the N-terminal sequencing of the 58-kDa SCP-2/thiolase and its related 46-kDa polypeptide due to an irregular transfer of both proteins to the ProBlot membrane (Applied Biosystems) during wet or semidry electroblotting after SDS-PAGE. Therefore, internal sequencing of these proteins was carried out following SDS-PAGE and in gel digestion of the bands of interest. The procedures for the in gel digestion were essentially based on those described by Rosenfeld et al.(33Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in 10–20% (w/v) acrylamide gradient gels, silver staining of the gels, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Novikov D. Vanhove G.F. Carchon H. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27125-27135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Peterson (34Peterson G.L. Anal.

To define the structural determinants for Ca2+ binding, cDNAs encoding GST fusion proteins that covered the complete linear cytosolic sequence of the InsP3R-1 were expressed in bacteria. The fusion proteins were screened for Ca2+ and ruthenium red binding through the use of 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red overlay procedures. Six new cytosolic Ca2+-binding regions were detected on the InsP3R in addition to the one described earlier (Sienaert, I., De Smedt, H., Parys, J. B., Missiaen, L., Vanlingen, S., Sipma, H., and Casteels, R. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27005–27012). Strong45Ca2+ and ruthenium red binding domains were localized in the N-terminal region of the InsP3R as follows: two Ca2+-binding domains were located within the InsP3-binding domain, and three Ca2+ binding stretches were localized in a 500-amino acid region just downstream of the InsP3-binding domain. A sixth Ca2+-binding stretch was detected in the proximity of the calmodulin-binding domain. Evidence for the involvement of multiple Ca2+-binding sites in the regulation of the InsP3R was obtained from functional studies on permeabilized A7r5 cells, in which we characterized the effects of Ca2+ and Sr2+ on the EC50 and cooperativity of the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. The activation by cytosolic Ca2+was due to a shift in EC50 toward lower InsP3concentrations, and this effect was mimicked by Sr2+. The inhibition by cytosolic Ca2+ was caused by a decrease in cooperativity and by a shift in EC50 toward higher InsP3 concentrations. The effect on the cooperativity occurred at lower Ca2+ concentrations than the inhibitory effect on the EC50. In addition, Sr2+ mimicked the effect of Ca2+ on the cooperativity but not the inhibitory effect on the EC50. The different [Ca2+] and [Sr2+] dependencies suggest that three different cytosolic interaction sites were involved. Luminal Ca2+ stimulated the release without affecting the Hill coefficient or the EC50, excluding the involvement of one of the cytosolic Ca2+-binding sites. We conclude that multiple Ca2+-binding sites are localized on the InsP3R-1 and that at least four different Ca2+-interaction sites may be involved in the complex feedback regulation of the release by Ca2+.

The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R-1, type 1 InsP3R; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CaM, calmodulin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R-1, type 1 InsP3R; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RyR, ryanodine receptor; CaM, calmodulin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is an intracellular Ca2+ release channel that is modulated by various physiological ligands such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3), Ca2+, nucleotides, calmodulin (CaM), FK506BP, phosphatases, and kinases (reviewed in Refs. 1Joseph S.K.

The InsP3R can be divided into three functionally different domains as follows: an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a modulatory domain, and a channel domain near the C terminus (3Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among the various modulators, Ca2+ itself plays a pivotal role and may be considered as a co-agonist exerting both positive and negative effects on InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. Cytosolic Ca2+ has a bell-shaped effect on the InsP3R, with low concentrations stimulating the release and high concentrations inhibiting the release (5Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 6Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 7Bezprozvanny I.

Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 9Iino M. Endo M. Nature. 1992; 360: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7238-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these kinetically distinct effects are believed to be crucial for the generation of Ca2+ oscillations and waves (12Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 290-306Crossref Scopus (914) Google Scholar), little is known about how Ca2+ interacts with the InsP3R. Regulation might be exerted by direct binding of Ca2+ to the InsP3R and/or via Ca2+-sensitive protein(s),e.g. via Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II and protein phosphatase 2B (13Zhang B.-X. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10997-11001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or via a Ca2+-sensitizing factor (14Benevolensky D. Moraru I.I. Watras J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Studies in which effects of Sr2+ were compared with those of Ca2+ revealed that at least two interaction sites must exist: a stimulatory site that is modestly sensitive to Sr2+ and an inhibitory site that is nearly insensitive to Sr2+ (15Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One Ca2+-binding domain has been localized on the cytosolic side of the InsP3R-1 (16Mignery G.A. Johnston P.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7450-7455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but whether this domain represents a stimulatory or an inhibitory interaction site is still unclear. Luminal Ca2+ also regulates the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. Loading of the Ca2+ stores results in a relatively more pronounced InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (18Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 455: 623-640Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Turner R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A high affinity Ca2+-binding site was detected on the luminal loop (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but its functional significance is not yet clear. The aim of the present work was two-fold. First, we wanted to investigate, at the structural level, the presence of direct Ca2+-binding sites on InsP3R-1. Second, we wanted to functionally demonstrate multiple Ca2+interactions on the InsP3R by a kinetic analysis of the effects of Ca2+ and Sr2+ on the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. For the first part of this study we constructed and expressed a number of GST fusion proteins that contain cytosolic fragments of the InsP3R sequence. The ability of these fusion proteins to bind 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red was measured by overlay procedures and verified by staining with Stains-all. These studies identified multiple Ca2+-binding domains in the InsP3R sequence. In the second part of the study we accurately determined the effects of Ca2+ and Sr2+ on the cooperativity and on the EC50 of the InsP3-induced Ca2+release in permeabilized A7r5 cells using our recently developed rapid45Ca2+ efflux technique (22Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12287-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The effects of Ca2+ on the V max of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release were not determined in the present experiments because our previous work on fully loaded stores already indicated that the Ca2+ release in response to a supramaximal [InsP3] (320 μm) was not affected when the cytosolic [Ca2+] was varied between 10 nm and 10 μm (11Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7238-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bootman M.D. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the release by cytosolic Ca2+ was due to a shift in EC50 toward lower InsP3 concentrations. The inhibition by Ca2+ was due, first, to a decrease in cooperativity, and second, to a shift in EC50 toward higher InsP3 concentrations. Both types of inhibition had a different [Ca2+] dependence. Sr2+ only mimicked the effect on the cooperativity indicating that both inhibitory effects were exerted at different sites. Luminal Ca2+ had no effect on the EC50 nor on the cooperativity indicating that luminal Ca2+ did not exert its effect by acting on a cytosolic Ca2+-binding site. Therefore at least four Ca2+-interaction sites must be present to explain these functional data. 45CaCl2 (2.2 mCi/ml, 134 μg of Ca2+/ml) was obtained from Amersham Int., UK. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Belgium, or New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. InsP3 and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were supplied by Boehringer Mannheim. Immobilon P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane filters were from Millipore Corp., MA. Plasmid pGEX-2T and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Sweden. New England Biolabs supplied broad range protein markers. Triton X-100,N-lauroylsarcosine (sarcosyl), ruthenium red, and Stains-all were purchased from Sigma. The Escherichia coli hosts used in this study were DH5α and BL21(DE3). All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Primer pairs were used to synthesize the different DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction as indicated in Table I. The sequences of all 26 plasmids were confirmed by using the Automated Laser Fluorescent sequencing system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Polymerase chain reaction fragment Cyt5b contained a point mutation that introduced a Stop codon (Arg634→ Stop) in the open reading frame. As a result the recombinant fusion protein Cyt5b was 12 amino acids shorter than expected for the chosen primer pair. Expression, growth, induction, and harvest of GST fusion proteins was carried out as described previously (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Isolation of the recombinant proteins was carried out as follows: the cell cultures, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100, were sonicated at 20 kHz, 9 times for 10 s using a MSE Ltd. (Westminster, Great Britain) probe sonicator. The sonicated material was centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor). At this stage, the procedure differed for the soluble GST fusion proteins and the insoluble GST fusion proteins. The supernatant of the soluble GST fusion proteins was immediately incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, whereas the initial supernatants of the insoluble recombinant proteins were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of PBS containing 1% sarcosyl (25De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the soluble material was removed by centrifugation as stated above. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2%. Finally, this supernatant was also incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for at least 30 min at 4 °C. After the incubation period, the beads were washed three times with 3 ml of wash buffer 1 (1% Triton X-100 in PBS), wash buffer 2 (PBS), and wash buffer 3 (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0), respectively. All wash buffers were supplemented with benzamidine (0.83 mm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm). The fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after protein precipitation by 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. 45Ca2+ and ruthenium red binding was carried out as described previously (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In brief, GST fusion proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membranes were washed overnight at room temperature in nominally Ca2+-free (2 to 3 μm Ca2+) incubation medium (60 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgCl2) and then overlaid with 2 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 or 25 mg/liter ruthenium red in the same medium for 10 min at room temperature. Membranes subjected to 45Ca2+ overlay were rinsed for 5 min in ice-cold 50% ethanol/water mixture and air-dried.45Ca2+ quantification of the bands was done by means of the Storm PhosphorImager model 840 equipped with the Image Quant NT 4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Membranes subjected to ruthenium red overlay were washed with incubation medium and kept in distilled water. The 45Ca2+ overlay technique used in this study will detect high affinity Ca2+-binding sites but may fail to detect some low affinity Ca2+-binding sites, since the wash procedures may remove 45Ca2+ from kinetically labile sites (27Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Stains-all staining was carried out as described previously (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the gels were fixed overnight with 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid, 43% water (v/v), extensively washed with 2-propanol (24 h) and stained in the dark with a solution containing 0.0025% (w/v) Stains-all in 25% 2-propanol, 7.5% formamide, and 67.5% 30 mm Tris base, pH 8.8 (v/v), as described by Campbell et al. (28Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A7r5 cells from embryonic rat aorta were used between the 7th and the 19th passage after receipt from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD) and subcultured weekly by trypsinization. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 9% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.8 mml-glutamine, 0.9% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 85 IU/ml penicillin, and 85 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were seeded in 12-well dishes (4 cm2; Costar Europe, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands) at a density of approximately 104 cells/cm2. 45Ca2+ fluxes on permeabilized cells were done on a thermostated plate at 25 °C. The culture medium was aspirated and replaced by 1 ml of permeabilization medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg/ml saponin. This solution was removed after 10 min, and the cells were washed once with a similar saponin-free solution. 45Ca2+ uptake into the non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores was accomplished by incubation for 60 min in 2 ml of loading medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, and 100 nm free 45Ca2+. After this phase of45Ca2+ accumulation, the monolayers were incubated in 1 ml of efflux medium containing 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 μm thapsigargin. Additions of InsP3 or Ca2+ are indicated in the figures. This efflux medium was replaced every 6 s as described (22Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12287-12293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiment the 45Ca2+ remaining in the stores was released by incubation in 1 ml of 2% (w/v) SDS for 30 min. Recombinant peptides have been widely used for the identification of the binding sites of various ligands such as Ca2+, ATP, and CaM. In earlier studies on the InsP3R-1 (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we already identified a cytosolic and a luminal region with Ca2+-binding properties. To detect additional Ca2+-binding sites on the InsP3R, we performed a complete screening of the remaining cytosolic InsP3R-1 sequence for Ca2+-binding sites. We constructed and expressed a total of 26 GST fusion proteins that contain small fragments (56–202 amino acids) of the InsP3R-1 in E. coli. These short fragments of the InsP3R covered the complete cytosolic N-terminal 2275 amino acids, including the S-I and the S-II splice domain (29Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal 150 amino acids of the mouse InsP3R-1 (Fig.1). Ca2+ binding to these fusion proteins was examined by a 45Ca2+overlay procedure as described earlier (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cytosolic Ca2+-binding domain labeled d and the Ca2+-binding domain on the luminal loop labeledl (Fig. 1) were characterized previously (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L.

Fig. 2 A shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of parental GST (pGST) and GST fusion proteins Cyt1–14, -16, and -18. Most of the GST fusion proteins migrated as single prominent bands corresponding to the expected molecular weights. Mainly little degradation was observed after expression and purification. The only exceptions were Cyt4, -8, -12, and -18 (Fig.2 A), which were strongly degraded. Fig. 2 Bdemonstrates 45Ca2+ binding of the different fusion proteins covering the cytosolic domains of the InsP3R. Strong 45Ca2+ binding was detected to Cyt3, -5, -6, -7, and -10 (Fig. 2 B).45Ca2+ binding to Cyt7 was much stronger than45Ca2+ binding to the other Ca2+-binding fusion proteins, probably reflecting a higher affinity of this site for Ca2+. pGST, the bacterial fusion partner, which has no known Ca2+-binding site was used as a negative control and showed no 45Ca2+ binding (Fig. 2 B). To define more precisely the sequences involved in Ca2+binding within the positive domains Cyt3, -5, -6, -7, and -10, each domain was further divided into two parts. The subfragments of these InsP3R sequences were expressed as GST fusion proteins and designated Cyt3a, -3b, -5a, -5b, -6a, -6b, -7a, -7b, -10a, and -10b (Fig. 1). The estimated molecular mass of most of the GST fusion proteins corresponded approximately to the predicted value, except for Cyt7b (predicted value 34 kDa) which migrated more slowly, with an apparent mobility corresponding to a polypeptide of 37 kDa (Fig.3 A). Fig. 3 B shows that 45Ca2+ bound to Cyt3a, -3b, -5b, -6a, -7b, and -10a but not to -5a, -6b, -7a, and -10b. It is of interest that the first degradation product of Cyt3a also bound45Ca2+, whereas the second degradation product that corresponds to pGST did not. The pattern of ruthenium red binding was similar to the pattern of 45Ca2+ binding in Fig. 3 B, except for fusion protein Cyt5b that failed to stain with ruthenium red (data not shown). Cyt7b stained dark blue with Stains-all, and the blue staining of the Ca2+-binding fusion proteins Cyt3a, -3b, -5b, -6a, and -10a was less intense (data not shown). In contrast, pGST and fusion proteins Cyt5a, -6b, -7a, and -10b that did not bind Ca2+ stained pink with Stains-all. These data are indicative for the presence of six new45Ca2+-binding regions within the cytosolic sequence of the mouse InsP3R-1, in addition to the one defined previously (17Sienaert I. De Smedt H.

The presence of multiple Ca2+-binding sites could be the molecular basis for a complex regulation of the InsP3R by Ca2+. We have therefore further explored the kinetics and mechanism of the interaction of Ca2+ with InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. We used Ca2+ as well as Sr2+ to discriminate and characterize between different modes of interaction with divalent cations. The cooperativity and the EC50 of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release can be determined by loading the Ca2+ stores to steady state with45Ca2+ and then incubating them with a progressively increasing [InsP3] in efflux medium (22Missiaen L.

This protocol only allows an accurate determination of the cooperativity and the EC50 if there is no InsP3-induced inactivation. To exclude such inactivation, we challenged the stores in permeabilized A7r5 cells with a progressively increasing or a progressively decreasing [InsP3]. If the InsP3R"

In this respect, the Gram-positive bacteriumBacillus subtilis seems to be exceptional, because it contains at least four chromosomally-encoded type I signal peptidases, denoted SipS, SipT, SipU, and SipV. Here, we report the identification of the sipT and sipV genes, and the functional characterization of SipT, SipU, and SipV. The four signal peptidases have similar substrate specificities, as they can all process the same β-lactamase precursor. Nevertheless, they seem to prefer different pre-proteins, as indicated by studies on the processing of the pre-α-amylase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in strains lacking SipS, SipT, SipU, or SipV. The sipU and sipV genes are constitutively transcribed at a low level, suggesting that they are required for processing of (pre-)proteins secreted during all growth phases. In contrast, the transcription of sipS and sipT is temporally controlled, in concert with the expression of the genes for most secretory proteins, which suggests that SipS and SipT serve to increase the secretory capacity of B. subtilis. Taken together, our findings suggest that SipS, SipT, SipU, and SipV serve different functions during the exponential and post-exponential growth phase of B. subtilis.

Bacterial proteins that are exported from the cytoplasm through the general pathway for protein secretion are synthesized as precursors with an amino-terminal signal peptide. The signal peptide is required for the targeting of precursor proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane, and for the initiation of their translocation across this membrane. During, or shortly after the translocation process, most signal peptides are removed by type I signal peptidases (SPases), 1The abbreviations used are: SPase, signal peptidase; Bam, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bsu,Bacillus subtilis; Cm, chloramphenicol; Em, erythromycin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Imp, inner membrane protease; Lep, leader peptidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TY, tryptone/yeast extract; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). which is a prerequisite for the release of secretory proteins from the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (1Von Heijne G.

Nevertheless, based on topological criteria, these enzymes can be divided into four distinct groups. SPases of the first and, apparently, largest group are type II membrane proteins with one amino-terminal membrane anchor. This group includes all known type I SPases from Gram-positive bacteria (6Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S.

Shelness G.S. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 59-71Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least one type I SPase from a Gram-negative bacterium (i.e. SipS of Bradyrhizobium japonicum; Ref. 21Müller P. Ahrens K. Keller T. Klaucke A. Mol.

Type I SPases of the second group, which have two amino-terminal membrane anchors, have been identified exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria (23Wolfe P.B. Wickner W. Goodman J.M. J. Biol.

Adams M.D. White O. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4702) Google Scholar) is the only known representative of the third group, having three putative amino-terminal membrane anchors. Finally, SPases of the fourth group seem to have one amino-terminal and one carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor.2Enzymes of the latter group have been identified in the Gram-negative bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (27Klug G. Jäger A. Heck C. Rauhut R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and yeast mitochondria (i.e. Imp2p; Ref. 28Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The SPase I of E. coli, also known as leader peptidase (Lep), is essential for cell viability (29Date T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SPase limitation results in the accumulation of precursors of exported proteins (30Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Genet. 1988; 214: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, the type I SPases SpsB from Staphylococcus aureus (18Cregg K.M. Wilding E.I. Black M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5712-5718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Sec11p of the yeast ER membrane (32Böhni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) are essential enzymes for cell viability. In contrast, the type I SPase SipS of Bacillus subtilis (SipS (Bsu)) is not essential for cell viability, and mutant B. subtilis strains with a disrupted sipS gene are still able to process secretory pre-proteins (6Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Bolhuis A. Sorokin A. Azevedo V. Ehrlich S.D. Braun P.G. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggested the presence of at least one additional type I SPase in B. subtilis. Support for the latter hypothesis was first obtained through the identification of two genes for homologous, but non-identical SPases, denoted SipS (Bam) (17Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman G.B.A. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and SipT (Bam) (also known as SipS2), in the closely related bacteriumB. amyloliquefaciens (16Hoang V. Hofemeister J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A few months later, genome sequencing analyses revealed the presence of two open reading frames,ycsB (34Akagawa E. Kurita K. Sugawara T. Nakamura K. Kasahara Y. Ogasawara N. Yamane K. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and yhjF 3M. A. Noback and S. Bron, unpublished results. fromB. subtilis, the deduced amino acid sequences of which showed a high degree of similarity to that of SipS (Bsu). By analogy to other SPase-encoding genes of bacilli, we renamed the latter open reading frames sipU and sipV, respectively, although SPase activity of the corresponding proteins had not been demonstrated. SipS (Bsu) and SipS (Bam) appeared to be equivalent enzymes in B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens: first, it was shown that the amino acid sequences of both enzymes are highly similar (91% identical residues and conservative replacements; Ref. 17Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman G.B.A. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); and, second, in both organisms the corresponding sipS genes were mapped immediately upstream of the rib operons for riboflavin biosynthesis (35Sorokin A. Zumstein E. Azevedo V. Ehrlich S.D. Seror P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 4H. Tjalsma, M. A. Noback, S. Bron, G. Venema, K. Yamane, and J. M. van Dijl, unpublished observations. In contrast, SipT fromB. amyloliquefaciens showed a much lower degree of sequence similarity to SipU and SipV of B. subtilis (65 and 44% identical residues and conservative replacements, respectively), and the corresponding genes were mapped at different regions of the respective chromosomes (16Hoang V. Hofemeister J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Akagawa E. Kurita K. Sugawara T. Nakamura K. Kasahara Y. Ogasawara N. Yamane K. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).3 The latter findings suggested that SipT from B. amyloliquefaciens is not the equivalent of SipU or SipV from B. subtilis and, consequently, it was conceivable that these organisms contain at least four chromosomal sip genes for type I SPases. The present studies were aimed at the verification of this hypothesis, and the functional characterization of the type I SPases of B. subtilis. We show that B. subtilis contains four closely related type I SPases which have similar, but non-identical substrate specificities. In addition, we show that the transcription of the sipT gene is temporally controlled, whereas the sipU and sipV genes are constitutively transcribed at a low level.

After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To assay the presence of the precursor and mature forms of B. amyloliquefaciens α-amylase in B. subtilis, cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 rpm, room temperature), and samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared as described in Ref. 42Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A.

SipV-Myc was visualized with specific monoclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse IgG conjugates (Amersham International). To determine whether B. subtilis contains a sipT (Bam)-like gene, Southern hybridization experiments were performed. A 3.2-kbHindIII fragment of B. subtilis chromosomal DNA was found to hybridize weakly with the sipT (Bam) gene, but not with the sipS (Bsu), sipU (Bsu), orsipV (Bsu) genes, suggesting that B. subtiliscontains a sipT (Bam)-like gene (data not shown). To identify the latter gene, a PCR was performed with the primers lba2–1 and lba2–2 (Fig. 1), which correspond to sequences within the sipT (Bam) gene. Using chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis 8G5 sipS as a template, a 300-bp fragment was amplified. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame, the deduced amino acid sequence of which showed a high degree of similarity to SipT (Bam) and, to a lesser extent, to SipS (Bsu), SipU (Bsu), and SipV (Bsu) (data not shown). The latter findings indicated that the 300-bp fragment was an internal fragment of a fourth sip gene of B. subtilis, possibly sipT. The entire sipT (Bam)-like gene of B. subtiliswas cloned in three successive PCR steps (schematically shown in Fig.1, b-d). Sequence analysis showed that the upstream sequences of this gene contain the 3′ end of the B. subtilis fruA gene for the enzyme II of the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (Fig. 1), which has been mapped at 126 degrees of the B. subtilis chromosome (49Gay P. Chalumeau H. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter finding showed that the fourth sip gene of B. subtilis is indeed the sipT (Bsu) gene (GenBank accession U45883), because the sipT (Bam) gene is also preceded by fruA on the chromosome of B. amyloliquefaciens (16Hoang V. Hofemeister J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Like other sip genes from bacilli (6Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the SipT (Bsu) protein (193 residues), shows a high degree of similarity to that of the known type I SPases from B. subtilis and related bacilli (Fig.2). Like the other Bacillusenzymes, SipT (Bsu) belongs to the subgroup of SPases with one amino-terminal membrane anchor. Furthermore, SipT (Bsu) contains the five conserved domains (A-E; Ref. 6Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that are present in all known type I SPases, and include the conserved serine (domain B) and lysine (domain D) residues implicated in catalysis (Fig. 2; Ref. 11van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3611-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The hybrid precursor pre(A13i)-β-lactamase, specified by plasmid pGDL48, is processed by SipS (Bsu) (6Van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Vehmaanperä J. Venema G. Bron S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2819-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and by plasmid-encoded type I SPases (SipP) of B. subtilis (17Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman G.B.A. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but not by Lep of E. coli. To test the functionality of SipT (Bsu), SipT (Bam), SipU (Bsu), and SipV (Bsu), the corresponding genes were amplified by PCR and cloned in pGDL48, resulting in pGDL100, pGDL110, pGDL121, and pGDL131, respectively. E. coli MC1061 was transformed with these plasmids and processing of pre(A13i)-β-lactamase was analyzed by pulse-chase labeling. In addition, E. coli MC1061 was transformed with pGDL41, carrying the sipS (Bsu) gene (positive control), or pGDL48 (no sip gene; negative control). The results showed that after a chase of 10 min significant amounts of pre(A13i)-β-lactamase were processed to the mature form in E. coli strains transformed with pGDL41, pGDL100, pGDL110, or pGDL121, but not in E. coli strains transformed with pGDL48 (Fig.3 A) or (pGDL131) (result not shown). These observations demonstrate that the sipT (Bsu),sipT (Bam), and sipU (Bsu) genes specify functional SPases that can cleave pre(A13i)-β-lactamase when produced in E. coli. Pre(A13i)-β-lactamase was processed more efficiently in E. coli cells containing sipT (Bsu) or sipT(Bam) than in cells containing sipS (Bsu) or sipU(Bsu). In the sipT (Bsu or Bam) containing cells, approximately 85% of the (A13i)-β-lactamase was mature after a chase of 10 min (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, under the same conditions, about 40% of the (A13i)-β-lactamase was mature in E. colicells containing sipS (Bsu) or sipU (Bsu) (Fig.3 A). These differences in processing activity may either reflect differences in the production of SipS, SipT, and SipU, or differences in their ability to cleave pre(A13i)-β-lactamase. Because, after a chase of 10 min, no mature (A13i)-β-lactamase could be detected in E. coli (pGDL131) cells containing the clonedsipV (Bsu) gene, pulse-chase labeling experiments were performed in which the chase was extended to 60 min. Under these conditions, approximately 90% of the (A13i)-β-lactamase was processed to the mature form in cells conta"

One of the signaling paths from the TNFα receptor induces a stress-activated protein kinase cascade. Components within this TNFα kinase cascade include mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (SEK), which regulate the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). Currently, molecules upstream of MEKK1 that link TNFα receptor to downstream kinases are not well understood. Besides TNFα, many other stimuli including several oncoproteins can activate JNK1. In most cases, the signaling cascade(s) leading from oncoproteins to JNK1 is poorly elucidated. We report here that the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I (HTLV-I) oncoprotein, Tax, can activate JNK1. We isolated a novel human cell factor, G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), by its ability to bind the HTLV-I oncoprotein, and we show that this factor can potently suppress Tax activation of JNK1. In trying to understand the mechanism of GPS2 activity, we found that it also suppressed TNFα activation of JNK1 but not TNFα activation of p38 kinase nor phorbol activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2. Because GPS2 has minimal effect on MEKK1- or SEK-regulated JNK1 activity, it could act at a point between the TNFα receptor and MEKK1 in the initial step(s) of this kinase cascade. Alternatively, it is not excluded that GPS2 could work in a parallel pathway that leads from TNFα to JNK1. GPS2 represents a new molecule that could contribute important insights toward how cytokine- and oncoprotein-mediated signal transduction might converge.

Heterotrimeric G-proteins (α, β, γ) link seven transmembrane receptors to downstream effectors. Originally, Gα was thought to solely dictate effector function; more recent evidence also supports roles for Gβ,γ in modulating effectors directly (10Clapham D.E. Neer E.J.

Here, pheromone binding to cognate receptor triggers a Gβ,γ-mediated kinase cascade (Ste20, Ste11, Ste7, Fus3/Kss1), which is structurally similar to mammalian MAPKs (i.e. Raf-MEK-ERK/MEKK-SEK-JNK; Ref. 9Waskiewicz A.J.

We have been interested in how viral proteins influence cellular signaling pathways. Because viruses are obligatory cellular parasites, it is reasonable that viral gene regulators mimic cellular counterparts. Accordingly, viruses ranging from oncogenic retroviruses (3Liu D. Wang L.-H. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to hepatitis virus (15Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6506-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have been documented to affect Ras-dependent kinase cascades. In human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-I), a viral oncoprotein, Tax, is known to transcriptionally modulate the expression of cellular immediate-early genes including c-jun (17Semmes O.J.

The mechanism through which Tax affects this class of cellular genes is unclear and is an area of intense investigation. Because it cannot bind DNA directly but can pleiotropically activate many promoters that do not share a common responsive motif (19Cross S.S. Feinberg M.L. Wolf J.B. Holbrook N.J. Wong-Staal F.

To better understand functional mechanisms, we searched for cellular factors that might bind Tax and subserve its transcriptional activity. We also asked if Tax could activate a cellular kinase cascade. Here, we show that Tax activates JNK1. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening protocol, we isolated a cDNA that encodes a novel human protein, G-protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2), that specifically binds Tax. In characterizing the function(s) of GPS2, we found that its overexpression results in suppression of a constitutively activated Gβ,γ signaling path in S. cerevisiae and also of Tax- and TNFα-mediated activation of JNK1. In Jurkat cells, induction of Tax expression reduced the ambient level of GPS2, suggesting that a loop-back regulation might, in part, contribute to the mechanism of JNK1 activation by Tax.

Gal4bd-GPS2- and Gal4ad-GPS2-expressing plasmids (pGBDT9/GPS2 and pGAD424/GPS2) were constructed by in-frame cloning into pGBDT9 and pGAD424, respectively. Two-hybrid screening was performed in yeast strain HF7c according to the Matchmaker two-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH). HF7c was transformed with bait plasmid (pGBDT9/Tax) and then screened with an HeLa S3 cell line Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH). 1 × 108 transformants were screened, and positive clones were selected based on expression of His3p and/or β-galactosidase.

Kinase assays using HA-tagged kinases were performed as described previously (13Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled 1.2-kilobase GPS2 and/or a 2-kilobase human β-actin cDNA probe as per manufacturer's protocol. E. coli-produced proteins GST, GST-GPS2, and His-Tax were purified according to manufacturers' protocols (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and Invitrogen). For binding studies, proteins were incubated either with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) or Probond resin (Invitrogen). GST and GST-GPS2-bound resins were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, whereas the His-Tax-containing resin was washed with buffer A (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 40 mm imidazole. GST and GST-GPS2 resins were equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 17% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). His-Tax was eluted from Probond resin with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. The His-Tax-containing eluate (∼5 ng/μl His-Tax) was diluted 10-fold by the addition of buffer B and incubated with the GST and GST-GPS2 resins. A flow-through fraction was collected. The resins were washed with buffer B and then eluted with buffer B containing 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 m KCl. 1 ml of the last buffer B wash and each eluate was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to concentrate the proteins. The samples were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, probed with rabbit anti-Tax serum, and visualized by chemiluminescence (Western-Light; Tropix Inc.). Protein-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated under native conditions as described previously (25Jeang K.-T. Chiu R. Santos E. Kim S.-J. Virology. 1991; 181: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates and proteins from total cell extracts were solubilized in SDS gel loading buffer (60 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples containing equal amounts (20 μg) of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) using a Millipore semi-dry blotting apparatus. Immunoblotting was performed with rabbit antisera raised against Tax (25Jeang K.-T. Chiu R. Santos E. Kim S.-J. Virology. 1991; 181: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or against synthetic GPS2 peptides (amino acids 44–69 and 307–327). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. The primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 dilutions, respectively. In searching for human proteins that might bind HTLV-I Tax, we screened 1 × 108 individual transformants from a HeLa S3 cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid approach (34Fields S. Song O.-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Five reproducibly reactive independent transformants were identified. One contained a 1,165-base pair human cDNA which encoded a protein that bound Tax but not SV40 T antigen (Fig.1 A) nor p53 (Fig.1 B). We sequenced this cDNA completely on both strands and found it to encode an open reading frame of 327 amino acids with a predicted molecular size of 37 kDa (Fig.2 A). A homology search was performed using the BLAST server from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. 2http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Our initial search uncovered no relatives in the data bases. However, at time of our sequence deposition, another cDNA differing minimally in nucleotides but extensively in amino acids was deposited concurrently from an independent group (J. Colicelli, UCLA). Based on our sequence data, the amino acid errors in that deposition were corrected, revealing that the two independently isolated cDNAs encoded for identical proteins (GenBankTM accession number of the correct sequence is U28963). By mutual agreement, this protein was named GPS2 (G-protein pathway supprressor 2). To better understand GPS2 function, two peptides (amino acids 44–69 and 307–327) were synthesized, and antisera were raised in rabbits to these peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates. Using these specific antisera, we independently confirmed an interaction between Tax and GPS2 by coimmunoprecipitating both proteins from three HTLV-I-transformed human T-cell lines (C81, MT2, and MT4; Fig.2 B, lanes 4–6). This intracellular complex between Tax and GPS2 was also confirmed biochemically in protein-protein “pull-down” chromatography (Fig. 2 C)in vitro. In this case, purified His-tagged Tax protein was preferentially retained on a GST-GPS2 fusion protein column (Fig.2 C, lanes 6–10) as compared with a GST-alone protein column (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–5). We also noted that GPS2 is distantly related to a subgroup of coiled coil proteins including transcriptional adaptor p300 (PIR A54277; smallest Poisson probability P(N) = 2.5 × 10−5), pericentrin (PIR A53188; P(N) = 4.7 × 105), trichohyalin (PIR S28589;P(N) = .8 × 10−9), gliadin (PIR B22364; P(N) = 1.3 × 10−5), and INCENP (GenBankTMZ25420;P(N) = 4.7 × 10−5). More detailed analysis revealed that the N-terminal portion (residues 15–104) of GPS2 can form coiled coils that could possibly account for contact between GPS2 and other proteins including Tax (data not shown). Although GPS2 is a human protein, it has motifs and homologies 3J. Colicelli, personal communication. that suggest relatedness to previously described suppressors of a Gα null allele in yeast (14Spain B.H. Koo D. Ramakrishnan M. Dzudzor B. Colicelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25435-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric Gα,β,γ proteins participate in yeast pheromone-regulated metabolism. In principle, loss of Gα manifests as lethality resulting from unchecked signaling through Gβ,γ. We asked whether GPS2 plays a role in regulating this signaling cascade in yeast, with the thought that a positive finding would lead us to explore an analogous function for this protein in mammalian cascade(s). In Fig.3 A, we expressed full-length GPS2 protein (GPS2 (1–327)) from an ADH1 promoter on a high copy plasmid in yeasts that have a constitutively lethalSTE4 Hpl mutation. Yeasts transformed with vector alone showed poor viability (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, GPS2 expression increased yeast viability (GPS2 (1–327); Fig.3 A) by more than 12-fold over that seen with vector alone. Deletion analyses narrowed the portion necessary for suppressive activity to be within residues 23–223 (Fig. 3 A). How this domain functions remains to be clarified; however, one limited interpretation of STE4 Hpl suppression is that GPS2 interrupts signaling at a step downstream of the Ste4-encoded Gβ molecule. The above finding suggests that GPS2 can interdict a cascade in yeast that leads to activation of pheromone-responsive genes. To test this hypothesis directly, expression of a pheromone-responsive gene,FUS2, was measured in the presence or absence of GPS2 (Fig.3 B). Yeasts were first transformed with either FUS2-LacZ reporter plasmid (pEB39) alone or the pEB39 reporter together with GPS2 and then treated with α-factor. Induction of LacZ was monitored (Fig.3 B) over time. Compared with control, GPS2 significantly inhibited pheromone-dependent expression of FUS2. This supports that GPS2 functions at a step in the cascade between pheromone receptor and pheromone-responsive genes. (Since this work was completed and first submitted, these findings have been independently confirmed by Colicelli and colleagues; Ref. 35Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A. Staub S. Koo D. Chang C.Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Yeast heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and mammalian MAPK pathways are closely conserved (9Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The observations on GPS2 in yeast suggest that this human protein might serve a related, and perhaps more authentic, function in primate cells (i.e. a general role in a conserved signal transduction pathway). To check this hypothesis, we first wished to verify that GPS2 mRNA and protein are indeed generally expressed in human tissues and cells. In Fig.4, mRNAs from 16 different human tissues and 8 different established human cell lines were analyzed using a GPS2-specific probe. We found that GPS2 mRNA was expressed abundantly in all the tested tissues and cells (Fig. 4 A). A smaller survey of primate and murine cell lines showed that the GPS2 protein expression profile is consistent with its observed RNA pattern (Fig. 4 B). On Western blotting, we noted that a GPS2-specific 37-kDa band is commonly present in human (Fig.4 B, lanes 3, 4, and 6, Jurkat, C81, HeLa) and monkey (Fig. 4 B, lane 1,COS) cells. (Interestingly, at this exposure, GPS2-specific signal was not identified in mouse cells (Fig. 4 B,lanes 2 and 5, F9, NIH 3T3). However, in other experiments a more weakly reactive band of 43 kDa was seen in murine cells using the rabbit antisera raised against human GPS2 (data not shown), suggesting that a nonidentical, but related, protein is conserved in mouse cells.) We did find that transfection of a GPS2 expression plasmid into HeLa cells could enforce overexpression of protein (Fig. 4 C). The ubiquitous and relatively abundant expression of GPS2 in primate tissues/cells is compatible with its serving a general function in a conserved signal transduction (i.e. MAPK) pathway. Previously, it was shown that Tax induces the expression (17Semmes O.J. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fuji M. Niki T. Mori T. Matsuda M. Matsui N.

Furthermore, it is well established that one of the mammalian MAPK pathways that regulates c-Jun activity is mediated through JNK1 (37Miden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

These facts, coupled with the suggested role for GPS2 in MAPK signaling and its ability to bind Tax (Figs. 1and 2), provided clues that logically directed us to explore a link between the HTLV-I oncoprotein and JNK1. The ability of Tax to activate JNK1 was checked using a transient transfection in vitrokinase assay (Fig. 5). We co-introduced into HeLa cells an expression plasmid for a hemagglutinin epitope-tagged JNK1 protein (HA-JNK1) and pUC19 carrier (Fig.5 A, lane 1), a GPS2 expression plasmid (Fig.5 A, lane 2), a Tax expression plasmid (Fig.5 A, lane 3), a plasmid encoding a constitutively activated MEKK1 mutant protein (Fig. 5 A, lane 4MEKKΔ; Ref. 31Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), or pMEKKΔ + GPS2 (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). We checked for activation of HA-JNK1 by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope followed by assaying for GST-cJun1–79-phosphorylating activity in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A). After normalizing for protein recovery by Western blotting for HA-JNK1 (Fig. 5 A,bottom panel), we verified that expression of MEKKΔ, as expected (31Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), elevated JNK1 activity by approximately 16-fold over basal (average from three assays; compare Fig. 5 A,lane 4 with lane 1). In comparison, Tax-activated JNK1 in HeLa cells by 4- to 5-fold (Fig. 5 A, comparelane 3 with lane 1; see also Fig. 5 B). Base-line JNK1 activity in these assays was low (Fig. 5 A,lane 1). In this setting, GPS2 overexpression had no inhibitory effects on the basal HA-JNK1 function (Fig. 5 A,lane 2), even upon deliberate overexposures of film. GPS2 overexpression also failed to affect the activity of MEKKΔ (Fig.5 A, lane 5). One interpretation consistent with the latter observation is that GPS2 functions at a step upstream of MEKK1. Because HTLV-I is a human T-cell virus, in principle a more physiological test for Tax-JNK1 activation would be one performed in human Jurkat T-cells. Hence, we repeated the experiment coelectroporating HA-JNK1 with effector plasmids into Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 B). In Jurkat cells, the magnitude of JNK1 activation by MEKKΔ (Fig. 5 B, lane 4) and by Tax (Fig.5 B, lane 2) was similar to that in HeLa cells. Notably, we observed that simultaneous overexpression of GPS2 reproducibly suppressed Tax activation of JNK1 (Fig. 5 B; compare lane 3 with lane 2). A similar finding has also been documented for adherent cells"

At low, mitogenic concentrations (<10 ng/ml), EGF treatment induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and promoted the formation of a Cas-adapter protein Crk complex in intact cells. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas paralleled an increase in the cellular content of actin stress fibers and occurred via a pathway that depended on the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Further, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activity was found to be required for the EGF-stimulated Cas phosphorylation and actin polymerization. At high concentrations (>30 ng/ml), EGF treatment resulted in the tyrosine dephosphorylation of Cas in a time-dependent manner with a concomitant decrease in the length and number of actin stress fibers. Thus, Cas exhibits an unusual bell-shaped dose-response curve in response to EGF stimulation. These results demonstrate a novel signaling role for EGF in inducing changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Cas-Crk complex formation and suggest that Cas could be a signaling component in EGF-mediated signal transduction.

The binding of growth factors to their receptors results in receptor dimerization and subsequent transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors. The phosphorylated residues in turn serve as attachment sites for cellular Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; Cas, p130 Crk-associated substrate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TRITC, carboxytetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. domain-containing signaling proteins; formation of these signal transduction complexes coordinates the multiple intracellular programs that initiate various changes in cell proliferation and differentiation (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). In addition to the mitogenic effects, many growth factors have been reported to induce changes in cell morphology. Upon stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin, the cells exhibit rapid membrane ruffling; this is brought about by a reorganization of the actin microfilament system, which includes extensive local actin polymerization in the cell cortex (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). A cascade of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family has been implicated in mitogen-stimulated changes in the actin cytoskeleton. In particular, Rac1 is responsible for membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation, whereas activation of RhoA mediates the assembly of focal adhesions and stress fibers at a later time point following growth factor stimulation (2Ridley A.J.

The mitogen-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton are accompanied by dramatic changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins present in focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are regions of a cell in direct contact with the extracellular matrix, providing anchorage sites for actin stress fibers and forming a link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton via the integrin family of cell surface receptors (10Burridge K.

These data have established a novel role for PDGF and insulin in modulating the signaling molecules residing in the focal adhesions. p130Cas (Cas, Crk-associatedsubstrate) is a novel, 130-kDa focal adhesion protein that was originally identified as a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src- and v-Crk-transformed cells. Molecular cloning of Cas revealed a docking protein that contains an SH3 domain, proline-rich regions, and a cluster of 15 putative SH2-binding motifs (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S.

The unique structure of Cas suggests a role in assembling multiprotein signaling complexes. Indeed, Cas has been reported to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a number of different stimuli, many of which affect the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers.

Previous studies have demonstrated that stimulation of cells with EGF results in dramatic changes in cell morphology (28Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); in the present study, we report that stimulation of cells with EGF induces changes in actin cytoskeleton with a concomitant modulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Similar to the PDGF response (14Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we found that the phosphorylation of Cas exhibits an unusual bell-shaped dose-response curve upon EGF stimulation and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by low concentrations of EGF requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and PI 3-kinase activity. Furthermore, low concentrations of EGF promote the formation of a Cas-Crk complex in intact cells. These results identify a novel signaling role for EGF and support the notion that Cas could play a role in mitogen-mediated signal transduction.

Polyclonal anti-Crk antibody was from Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were acquired from Sigma. Rat-1 cells expressing human EGF receptor (RatER cells; Ref. 29Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), A431 cells, and wild-type Rat-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown into 90% confluency as monolayers and serum-starved for 36 h prior to stimulation with or without EGF in the presence or absence of various inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Following stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin A). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblot analysis were carried out as described earlier (21Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of RatER cells following treatments indicated in the figure legends were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and extracted with a solution of −20 °C acetone for 3 min. Immunofluorescent labeling of filamentous actin was carried out by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 0.1 mg/ml of carboxytetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin (Sigma). Following incubation with the fluorochrome-conjugated phalloidin, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS, and the samples were mounted for microscopy. Cells (105/well) were seeded in a 96-well plate and made quiescent by starvation for 36 h. The quiescent cells were stimulated with various concentrations of EGF as indicated, and 16 h after EGF addition, the cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products, 1 μCi/well) for 4 h. Incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting as described (30Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that a recently identified focal adhesion protein Cas provides an important integration site for various extracellular signals including integrin receptor family members, G-protein coupled receptors, and both receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (see the Introduction). These signals appear to increase Cas tyrosine phosphorylation and enhance actin polymerization. Stimulation of cells with EGF results in dramatic changes in cell morphology and reorganization of the actin microfilament system (28Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To investigate the putative role of EGF in the regulation of Cas-mediated signaling, we examined the effect of EGF on tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in various EGF-responsive cell lines. Unless otherwise indicated, the results shown in the figures are those obtained with RatER cells (2.5 × 105receptors/cell; Ref. 29Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L. Martin G.S. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8622-8626Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells (>106 receptors/cell; Ref. 28Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. Hage W.J. de Laat S.W. Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and wild-type Rat-1 cells were studied, and similar results were obtained. Quiescent cultures of RatER cells were incubated with various concentrations of EGF for 5 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cas antibody. This antibody recognizes the extreme C terminus of Cas and does not cross-react with Efs/Sin or HEF-1/Cas-L, which are proteins closely related to Cas (31Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 32Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 33Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B.

Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Compared with the unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 1), there was a detectable increase in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with low concentrations of EGF (0.5–5 ng/ml,lanes 2–5). In contrast, the phosphorylation content of Cas decreased sharply at high concentrations of EGF. Maximal reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation took place at 60 ng/ml of EGF and was not further affected by treatment with higher concentrations of EGF (lanes 9–11). The changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas occurred with no alteration in the amount of Cas protein immunoprecipitated under these conditions (Fig. 1 A,lower panel). As a comparison, we studied tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ and p120 Ras-GAP, which are two previously identified substrates for the EGF receptor kinase (35Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 36Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to EGF stimulation, with no bell-shaped dose response curve; results for p120 Ras-GAP are shown in Fig. 1 C. To further characterize the effect of EGF on tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, we examined the time dependence of Cas phosphorylation status following EGF treatment. Low concentrations of EGF stimulated a very rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas; an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas could be detected as early as 30–60 s after the addition of 2 ng/ml of EGF, reaching a maximum at 1–5 min. Thereafter, Cas tyrosine phosphorylation declined and remained above or at base-line levels for >4 h (Fig.2 A, top). At high EGF concentrations (80 ng/ml), Cas tyrosine dephosphorylation was initially detected by 1 min (Fig. 2 B, top). There was a progressive decline in Cas phosphorylation that reached a maximum at 5–10 min of EGF treatment. The EGF-mediated decrease in Cas phosphorylation was transient and began to recover 30 min subsequent to the addition of 80 ng/ml EGF. Following 60 min of EGF treatment, the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Cas was similar to that observed for the unstimulated control cells (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 7). During the periods of EGF treatment, there was no significant alteration in the amount of immunoprecipitated Cas (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom parts). It has been well documented that the formation of actin stress fibers parallels focal adhesion formation and is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (for a review, see Ref. 37Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in response to insulin treatment in turn parallels a decrease in the cellular content of actin stress fibers (18Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of low and high concentrations of EGF on the organization of actin in quiescent cultures of RatER cells. The cells were treated with either 2 or 80 ng/ml of EGF for 5 min and then fixed and stained with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin. Treatment of cells with a low concentration of EGF (2 ng/ml) resulted in a characteristic membrane ruffling (Fig.3 B) and increased polymerization of actin (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, treatment with a high concentration of EGF (80 ng/ml) for 5 min caused a dramatic disruption of actin stress fibers (Fig. 3 D). Maximum effects on the actin cytoskeleton by low and high concentrations of EGF were observed after 5 min of EGF exposure. The changes in the number and length of actin stress fibers were followed by a recovery to normal levels in a time-dependent manner; restoration of the actin stress fiber network (as in Fig. 3 A) was apparent within 30–60 min (not shown). Immunostaining for vinculin, which is a marker of focal adhesions, indicated the presence of focal adhesion plaques in cells treated with a low concentration of EGF. In contrast, a high concentration of EGF stimulated the disruption of vinculin-containing focal adhesions (not shown). These results indicate that at low concentrations EGF stimulates actin polymerization and Cas phosphorylation. High concentrations of EGF in turn cause disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions; these pronounced effects on the actin cytoskeleton are accompanied by a reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Given the close correlation between actin polymerization and Cas phosphorylation upon cell stimulation with low concentrations of EGF, we next examined whether disruption of the actin cytoskeleton could interfere with the increase in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF. Experiments were performed using cells pretreated for 2 h with various concentrations of cytochalasin D. Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D prevented Cas phosphorylation on tyrosine in response to 2 ng/ml of EGF in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A); tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was completely blocked using a concentration of cytochalasin D (2.0 μm) found to depolymerize the network of actin filaments in RatER cells (Fig. 3 E). Cytochalasin D treatment had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 Ras-GAP at any of the EGF concentrations that stimulated p120 Ras-GAP phosphorylation; the effect on 20 ng/ml of EGF is shown in Fig. 4 B. Thus, EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, but not of the previously identified EGF receptor kinase substrate p120 Ras-GAP, is critically dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. It has recently been shown that activation of PI 3-kinase is required for PDGF-stimulated membrane ruffling and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (6Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase is known to become activated upon EGF treatment (38Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined the potential role of PI 3-kinase in EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in RatER cells. Quiescent cells were preincubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of LY294002, which has been identified as a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase with an IC50 of 1–10 μm (39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the pretreatment, the cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml of EGF for 5 min. As shown in Fig. 4 C, pretreatment with LY294002 inhibited Cas tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximum inhibition was achieved with 20 μm of LY294002; at the same concentration, LY294002 inhibited actin cytoskeleton reorganization in EGF-treated RatER cells (Fig. 3 F). To substantiate the results obtained with LY294002, we examined a structurally unrelated compound, wortmannin, which inhibits PI 3-kinase by a distinct mechanism. Wortmannin is highly specific for PI 3-kinase, although at concentrations above 1 μm it has been reported to inhibit myosin light chain kinase (40Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nakanishi S. Kakita S. Takahashi I. Kawahara K. Tsukuda E. Sano T. Yamada K. Yoshida M. Kase H. Matsuda Y. Hashimoto Y. Nonomura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2157-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin also induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in response to 2 ng/ml EGF. At 50 nm, wortmannin inhibited EGF-stimulated Cas phosphorylation by >90% (not shown). Together, these results suggest that PI 3-kinase lies upstream in the signal transduction pathway linking the EGF receptor to tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. Cas has a cluster of 15 potential SH2-binding motifs, nine of which conform to the expected binding site for the SH2-domain of the adapter protein Crk (19Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that a number of agonists that induce Cas phosphorylation also induce Cas-Crk complex formation (14Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined whether EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas could lead to the formation of a complex between Cas and Crk in intact RatER cells. Immunoblotting of anti-Cas immunoprecipitates revealed that low concentrations of EGF (2 ng/ml) stimulated an association of Cas with Crk (Fig.5). Similarly, coimmunoprecipitation of Cas with Crk was detected when immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Crk antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-Cas antibodies (not shown). To assess whether the complex formation between Cas and Crk depended on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, quiescent RatER cells were pretreated for 2 h with 2.0 μmcytochalasin D and then stimulated with 2 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Fig. 5shows that treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, at a concentration shown in Fig. 4 A to inhibit Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, prevented the association of Cas with Crk induced by EGF. As could be expected, high concentrations of EGF (80 ng/ml), which stimulate dephosphorylation of Cas on tyrosine (Figs. 1 and 2), did not induce Cas-Crk interaction (Fig. 5). In parallel with the analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Cas-Crk complex formation, RatER cells were exposed to various concentrations of EGF and used to assess DNA synthesis (Fig. 6). Maximum [3H]thymidine incorporation was achieved at an EGF concentration of 40–80 ng/ml with a half-maximal effect at 5–10 ng/ml. Similar results have been previously reported by others using different cell lines (42Honegger A. Dull T.J. Bellot F. Van Obberghen E. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Rüden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similar to earlier observations (42Honegger A. Dull T.J. Bellot F. Van Obberghen E. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3045-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,43Redemann N. Holzmann B. von Rüden T. Wagner E.F. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), high EGF concentrations (160 ng/ml) resulted in lower levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation, as indicated by the decline in the dose-response curve. We observed a clear induction in [3H]thymidine incorporation at EGF concentrations as low as 1.25 ng/ml. Tyrosine phosphorylatio"

Isolation and characterization of salt-sensitive mutants of the moderate halophile Halomonas elongata and cloning of the ectoine synthesis genes.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 273Issue 19PreviewIn the period from the submission to the publication of this work, a study on the characterization of genes from the biosynthetic pathway of ectoine in Marinococcus halophilus was reported by Louis and Galinski (Louis, P., and Galinski, E. A. (1997) Microbiology 143, 1141–1149). To follow the same nomenclature, the provisional designations that have been used in our paper for the loci encoding the three enzymes of ectoine synthesis should be changed as follows: ectA(instead of ectB) encoding the diaminobutyric acid acetyltransferase, ectB (instead of ectA) encoding l-diaminobutyric acid transaminase, andectC for the gene encoding the ectoine synthase. Full-Text PDF Open Access Halomonas elongata is a moderately halophilic bacterium that can grow over a wide range of salinity, from ∼0.1 to ∼4m NaCl (1Vreeland R.H. Litchfield C.D. Martin E.L. Elliot E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1980; 30: 485-495Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 2Ventosa A. Priest F.G. Ramos-Cormenzana A. Tindall B.J. Bacterial Diversity and Systematics. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 231-242Crossref Google Scholar). This property makes this halophile an excellent model to study the osmoregulatory mechanisms in this group of extremophilic organisms. Moreover, H. elongata has recently received considerable interest because of its potential for use in biotechnology. Thus, it is a good source for halophilic enzymes as well as the compatible solutes ectoine and hydroxyectoine that can be used as protecting agents for enzymes and whole cells (3Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. World J. Microbiol. & Biotechnol. 1995; 11: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although genetic tools for moderate halophiles have been developed recently (4Fernández-Castillo R.

Fernández-Castillo R. Cánovas D. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the genetic basis of the osmoregulatory mechanisms in these bacteria remains unclear. As most other bacteria, moderate halophiles maintain their internal osmolality and generates turgor in media of high salinity by accumulating organic compatible solutes (8Kushner D.J. Kamekura M. Rodrı́guez-Valera F. Halophilic Bacteria. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 109-140Google Scholar). When grown in media lacking osmoprotectants, H. elongata synthesizes ectoine (1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4-pyrimidine carboxylate) as its major compatible solute (9Galinski E.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 273-328Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It can also accumulate glycine betaine and related osmoprotectants by transport from the medium (9Galinski E.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 273-328Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Cánovas D. Vargas C. Csonka L.N. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine betaine has been shown to suppress the accumulation of ectoine partially or completely in H. elongata, depending on the NaCl concentration and the strain (9Galinski E.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 273-328Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 10Cánovas D. Vargas C. Csonka L.N. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although H. elongata is typical among bacteria in that it accumulates glycine betaine in response to high salinity stress, the biochemical basis for its unusual NaCl tolerance is not clear.Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, which served as model organisms for the elucidation of basic principles of osmoregulation, also use glycine betaine as the preferred osmoprotectant (11Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, although glycine betaine can elicit dramatic stimulation of growth in media of inhibitory osmolality in these organisms, it can support growth of the latter organisms only to about 1.2 m NaCl, considerably less that the maximum salinity that can be tolerated by H. elongata. Ectoine has been discovered as a compatible solute in the extremely halophilic bacteria Ectothiorhodospira halochloris (12Galinski E.A. Pfeiffer H.-P. Trüper H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown in H. elongata (13Peters P. Galinski E.A. Truper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 157-162Crossref Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of this compound is shown in Fig.1 (13Peters P. Galinski E.A. Truper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 157-162Crossref Google Scholar). Because the organisms that can synthesize ectoine are generally halophilic or marine bacteria (14Severin J. Wohlfarth A. Galinski E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1629-1638Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that high salinity tolerance could be connected with the ability to synthesize this compatible solute. To test whether there is such a causal connection between halotolerance and the synthesis of ectoine and to identify the ectoine biosynthetic genes, we isolated mutants of H. elongata DSM 3043 that are blocked in the synthesis of this compound. This work describes the isolation and characterization of these mutants as well as the isolation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of ectoine in H. elongata. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. H. elongata strains were routinely grown in SW-10 medium, which contained 10% (w/v) total salts (15Nieto J.J. Fernández-Castillo R. Márquez M.C. Ventosa A. Ruiz-Berraquero F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 2385-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco). Salt-sensitive mutants were isolated on a modified version of this medium, which contained 2% total salts (designated SW-2 medium). The complex LB medium was used for the growth of E. coli (16Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar). M63 (17Cohen G.N. Rickenberg R.H. Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1956; 91: 693-720PubMed Google Scholar), containing 20 mm glucose as the sole carbon source, was used as the minimal medium. The osmotic strength of M63 was increased by the addition of 0.5 to 4 m final concentrations of NaCl. When used, glycine betaine (Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Solid medium contained 20 g/liter Bacto-agar (Difco). When used, filter-sterilized antibiotics were at the following final concentrations (μg/ml): Ap, 1The abbreviations used are: Ap, ampicillin; Km, kanamycin; NADA, N-γ-acetyldiaminobutyric acid; DA, diaminobutyric acid; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 100; chloramphenicol, 25; Km, 75; rifampicin, 25; tetracycline, 15.

Matings were carried out by mixing the donor and recipient cultures at a ratio of 1:4 (100 μl of donor, 400 μl of recipient). The mixed cultures were washed with sterile SW-2 medium to eliminate the antibiotics. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of SW-2 and placed on a 0.45-μm pore filter on SW-2 solid media (which allows the growth of E. coli and the putative salt-sensitive mutants of H. elongata). After overnight incubation at 30 °C, cells were resuspended in 20% (v/v) sterile glycerol and, after appropriate dilutions, inoculated on SW-2 + rifampicin + Km plates at a density resulting in about 100–200 colonies per plate. Colonies from these master plates were transferred with sterile toothpicks to duplicate M63 plates, one contained 2.7m NaCl and the other contained 0.5 m NaCl. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and inspected for colonies that had grown at 0.5 m but not at 2.7 m NaCl. Chromosomal DNA from H. elongata was isolated as described by Ausubel et al.(20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.R. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli with the alkaline lysis method (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme digestion and ligations were performed as recommended by the manufacturers. Probes used for plasmid, genomic DNA, and colony hybridization were generated by using the non-radioactive digoxigenin DNA labeling and detection kit from Boehringer Mannheim. For genomic DNA hybridization, genomic DNA was isolated from the wild-type strain and salt-sensitive mutants of H. elongata, digested with restriction enzymes, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon filters (Amersham Corp.) as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An internal 1-kb HindIII fragment of the transposon Tn1732was used as a probe. For colony hybridization, 3,000 single colonies of the H. elongata genomic library were allowed to grow 12 h at 37 °C on LB + Km plates. After growth, plates were chilled for 1 h at 4 °C and transferred to nylon filters, as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For colony hybridization, cellular debris was removed before hybridization to avoid background. Hybridization was in 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS with shaking for 2 h at 68 °C. Hybridization, washes, and detection were done according to the instructions of the kit provided by Boehringer Mannheim. To clone the DNA region flanking the Tn1732 insertion in mutant CHR63, genomic DNA of CHR63 was digested with BglII, ligated toBamHI-digested pKS−, and transformed into DH5α. Transformants were selected on LB + Km + Ap. From one KmrApr colony, the plasmid pDE1, containing a 23-kbBglII fragment from CHR63 DNA, was isolated. An 8.6-kbSalI fragment of pDE1 was subcloned in pKS−, giving pDE3. AH. elongata gene bank was constructed in the broad host range cosmid pVK102 (22Knauf V.C. Nester E.W. Plasmid. 1982; 8: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), a low copy number cosmid that can replicate in both E. coli and Halomonas (23Vargas C. Coronado M.J. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 20: 173-181Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). H. elongata DNA was partially digested with SalI, and DNA fragments in the size range of 23–30 kb were separated in sucrose gradients and cloned into the pVK102 vector, which had been linearized with SalI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mix was packed in vitro into bacteriophage lambda heads by using a kit from Amersham Corp. and transduced into E. coli HB101. Out of 3,000 Kmr transductants, 30 colonies were analyzed, and all proved to have inserts of an average size of 27 kb, which guarantees a 99.8% probability of finding a given sequence in the bank (24Clark L. Carbon J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To isolate the genes responsible for the synthesis of ectoine, a total of 3,000 colonies of the H. elongata genomic library were screened by using as a probe a 370-bp EcoRI fragment from the 1.9-kb region carried in pDE3. This fragment, gel-isolated after EcoRI digestion of pDE3, was selected because it is adjacent to the Tn1732insertion in mutant CHR63. In fact, one of the EcoRI sites used to generate the probe lies in the right inverted repeat of Tn1732 (see Fig. 7 B). Therefore, the 370-bpEcoRI region should contain part of the H. elongata ectoine synthase gene (ectC). Plasmids isolated after library screening were conjugated from E. coli to H. elongata by triparental matings on SW-2 by using pRK600 as helper plasmid. Wild-type and salt-sensitive mutants of H. elongata were grown in M63 containing the maximal NaCl concentration that they could tolerate. At mid-exponential phase, cells were harvested and washed twice with the growth medium without any carbon source. To extract the cytoplasmic solutes, cells were resuspended in 10 ml of double distilled water and incubated for 5 h at room temperature. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.65-μm pore membrane filter. Cell extracts were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.5 ml of D2O. Natural abundance 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Brucker ac200 spectrometer at 50 MHz with probe temperature of 20–22 °C. Signals due to glutamate, glutamine, and diaminobutyrate were identified by comparison with the spectra of each of these pure compounds. Signals generated by N-acetyldiaminobutyrate were deduced from the spectrum of DA signals. Ectoine was identified by comparison of chemical shifts with published values (25Fernández-Linares L. Faure R. Bertrand J.C. Gauthier M. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 169-172Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 26Wohlfarth A. Severin J. Galinski E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 705-712Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutants CHR63 and CHR62 were grown in 1-liter cultures of M63 plus the maximal NaCl that they can tolerate toA 600 of 1.8, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively, and extracted in 20 ml of distilled H2O, as described above. To 3-ml samples, 250 nmol of internal standards, α-amino-n-butyrate and α-aminoadipic acid, were added. Samples were applied to 3.5 × 1-cm columns of Dowex-1-acetate (100–200 mesh), equilibrated with H2O, and washed with 5 ml of H2O. The acidic amino acids, glutamate and aspartate, retained on this column were eluted with 6 ml of 2 m acetic acid. The water wash that contained the neutral and basic amino acids was applied to 3.5 × 1-cm columns of Dowex-50W-H+(100–200 mesh) equilibrated with H2O. The latter columns were washed with 8 ml of H2O, and neutral and basic amino acids were eluted with 8 ml of 6 m NH4OH. Fractions were evaporated to dryness under a stream of air and redissolved in 0.8 ml of 30% methanol, and aliquots were analyzed by TLC on Whatman Silica Gel AL-SIL-G (aluminum-backed) plates (20 × 20-cm; 250-μm layer), developed in n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (60:20:20, v/v/v). After development and drying, the plates were sprayed with ninhydrin (0.15% w/v in ethanol) and amino acids visualized by heating in a drying oven (140 °C for 1–2 min). The above protocol was first tested with an aqueous extract from mutant CHR63, without internal standards; analyses of the acidic and neutral + basic amino acid fractions by GC-MS (below) revealed that these extracts were devoid of α-amino-n-butyrate and α-aminoadipic acid, hence the choice of these compounds as internal standards for the neutral + basic and acidic amino acid fractions, respectively. NADA was purified free of DA from the neutral amino acid fraction obtained from extracts of the mutant CHR63 by the following procedure. Aqueous extract was applied to a 4 × 1.5-cm column of Dowex-1-acetate, equilibrated with H2O, to first remove acidic amino acids. Columns were washed with 10 ml of H2O, and the water wash was applied to 4 × 1.5-cm columns of Dowex-50W-NH4+ (100–200 mesh) equilibrated with H2O. This effectively removed basic amino acids, including DA. The water wash from the latter column, containing neutral amino acids, was then applied to 4 × 1.5-cm columns of Dowex-50-W-H+ (100–200 mesh), washed with 24 ml of H2O, and the neutral amino acids eluted with 18 ml of 6m NH4OH. The basic amino acids were eluted from the Dowex-50W-NH4+ with 18 ml of 6m NH4OH. Fractions containing the desired amino acids were evaporated to dryness under a stream of air. The neutral amino acid fraction was dissolved in a small volume of 60% methanol and applied to the origin of a preparative 20 × 20-cm Whatman Silica Gel 150A glass-backed TLC plate (100-μm layer). The plate was developed in n-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (60:20:20, v/v/v). After development and drying, the central portion of the TLC plate was covered with a glass plate, and the plate edges were sprayed with ninhydrin (0.15% w/v in ethanol) and amino acids visualized by heating the edges of the plate with a hot air gun. The zone corresponding to NADA (the most abundant amino acid in the neutral fraction of mutant CHR63) was scraped from the central portion of the plate, and the NADA was then eluted from the silica gel with water. A small aliquot (2 μl) of this material was then re-analyzed by analytical TLC (above) before and after acid hydrolysis (1.25n HCl, 110 °C, 2 h). Amino acids purified by ion exchange chromatography and preparative TLC were derivatized toN(O,S)-heptafluorobutyryl (N-HFBI) amino acid derivatives, essentially as described by Rhodes et al. (27Rhodes D. Hogan A.L. Deal L. Jamieson G.C. Haworth P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 84: 775-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this procedure entails reaction of the dried amino acid sample with 200 μl of freshly prepared isobutyl alcohol/acetyl chloride (5:1, v/v) at 120 °C for 20 min, evaporation to dryness, followed by reaction with 100 μl of heptafluorobutyric anhydride at 120 °C for 10 min, and evaporation to incipient dryness. The samples are finally redissolved in 100 μl of ethyl acetate/acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) for GC-MS analysis (see below). Authentic ectoine did not produce a volatile derivative in this procedure, as determined by GC-MS. An authentic standard of NADA was not available. However, tests with authenticN-acetylornithine indicated that substantial hydrolysis to ornithine occurred during derivatization, suggesting that hydrolysis of NADA to DA is likely to occur in this protocol. Electron ionization and chemical ionization GC-MS of the amino acid derivatives were performed as described previously (27Rhodes D. Hogan A.L. Deal L. Jamieson G.C. Haworth P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1987; 84: 775-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the column used was a DB-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0. 25 mm inner diameter) and the oven temperature program was 100 °C for 4 min to 280 °C at 12 °C/min. H. elongata DSM 3043, formerly named strain 1H11 (1Vreeland R.H. Litchfield C.D. Martin E.L. Elliot E. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1980; 30: 485-495Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar), has a broad salinity range in M63 minimal medium, being able to grow from 0.5 to 3 m NaCl (10Cánovas D. Vargas C. Csonka L.N. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7221-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The type strain of H. elongata ATCC 33173 has been shown to synthesize both ectoine and hydroxyectoine as compatible solutes in response to osmotic stress (26Wohlfarth A. Severin J. Galinski E.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 705-712Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test whether this is also true forH. elongata DSM 3043, the latter organism was grown in M63 plus 3 m NaCl, and the composition of its internal solutes was analyzed by 13C NMR. Major signals corresponded to ectoine and hydroxyectoine, and glutamate and glutamine were also detectable at lower levels (Fig. 2). Salt-sensitive mutants of H. elongata were isolated by transposon mutagenesis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Putative salt-sensitive mutants were identified as those that were unable to grow on M63 plus 2.7 m NaCl plates but still able to grow on M63 containing 0.5 m NaCl. Out of ∼4,000 Kmr colonies screened, four showed this phenotype (Table II). Each was able to grow on M63 + 2.7 m NaCl + 1 mm betaine. This result indicated that the mutations did not cause a general NaCl sensitivity and suggested that the mutants might be defective in the synthesis of a compatible solute. Strain CHR63 could not grow above 1.5 mNaCl in the absence of betaine. Strain CHR62 was affected more severely, being unable to grow above 0.75 m NaCl without betaine. Strains CHR64 and CHR65 could not grow above 2.0 mNaCl. We showed (see below) that strains CHR62 and CHR63 were blocked in the synthesis of ectoine; these two strains have been designated as Ect−. The target site of the mutations in the other two strains, CHR64 and CHR65, has not yet been identified.Table IIGrowth of H. elongata salt-sensitive mutants in M63 with different NaCl concentrationsMutant strainNaCl0.50.7511.522.72.7 + betaine2-aGrowth in M63 + 2.7 m NaCl + 1 mm betaine.mCHR62++−−−−+CHR63++++−−+CHR64+++++−+CHR65+++++−+2-a Growth in M63 + 2.7 m NaCl + 1 mm betaine. Open table in a new tab The phenotypes of the highly NaCl-sensitive mutants CHR62 and CHR63 were characterized more extensively in liquid cultures. Fig.3 shows the growth rates of these mutants in M63 with different salinities, in the presence or absence of exogenous betaine. Both grew more slowly than the wild-type at any salinity. Partial growth at high salinity was restored by betaine for both mutants, although this osmoprotectant could not restore wild-type growth rate at ≥2.5 m for CHR63 or at ≥1.5 mfor CHR62. To check that the mutant phenotype was due to a single transposition event in each of the mutants, hybridization analysis was performed with an internal fragment of the transposon Tn1732 as a probe against genomic DNA of the mutants digested with the restriction enzymes SalI or BglII, which do not have any recognition site in Tn1732. As shown in Fig.4, unique hybridization signals were detected in the mutant DNAs, confirming that the salt-sensitive phenotype was due to single insertions of the transposon. Mutants CHR62 and CHR63 were grown in M63 glucose minimal medium containing the maximal NaCl concentration that they could tolerate (0.75 mfor CHR62 and 1.5 m for CHR63), and their major cytoplasmic solutes were analyzed by 13C NMR (Fig.5). Signals corresponding to ectoine were absent from the extracts of both mutants, indicating that they were defective in the synthesis of this compatible solute. Hydroxyectoine could not be detected either, suggesting a common biosynthetic pathway for both solutes. Signals corresponding to DA at 29, 37, 51, and 174 ppm were found in the CHR62 extract (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that this mutant accumulated this compound. The spectrum of the CHR63 extract showed major signals around 25, 32, 37, 53, 174, and 175 ppm (Fig. 5 B). A comparison with the chemical shifts of DA data suggested that those signals could correspond to a derivative of DA. Signals at 174 and 175 ppm could be attributed to the carbonylic moiety of the carboxylic and acetyl groups, and a signal at 25 ppm was typical of the methyl moiety of an acetyl group. These data were consistent with those expected for NADA and suggested the accumulation of this compound by CHR63. Electron ionization and chemical ionization GC-MS analyses of N-HFBI amino acid derivatives confirmed that the major amino acid constituents of mutant CHR62 was DA (HFBI derivative molecular weight = 566 (Fig.6); CI protonated molecular ion =m/z 567; major EI fragment ions =m/z 252 and 240), whereas that of mutant CHR63 was NADA (HFBI derivative molecular weight = 412; CI protonated molecular ion = m/z 413; major EI fragment ions = m/z 269 and 311) (Fig. 6). Initial analyses of the neutral + basic amino acid fraction of mutant CHR63 revealed high levels of DA in addition to NADA. However, the vast majority of this DA probably originated from hydrolysis of NADA during derivatization. This was confirmed by purifying NADA free of DA from extracts of CHR63 by ion exchange chromatography and preparative TLC. Approximately 80% of the purified NADA was converted"

Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase has been shown to be required in this process. Insulin is thought to activate this enzyme by stimulating its association with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, Grb2-associated binder-1, and pp60. To study the role of these endogenous substrates in glucose transport, we analyzed adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice that we previously generated (Tamemoto, H., Kadowaki, T., Tobe, K., Yagi, T., Sakura, H., Hayakawa, T., Terauchi, Y., Ueki, K., Kaburagi, Y., Satoh, S., Sekihara, H., Yoshioka, S., Horikoshi, H., Furuta, Y., Ikawa, Y., Kasuga, M., Yazaki Y., and Aizawa S. (1994) Nature 372, 182–186). In adipocytes from these mice, we showed that: 1) insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity in the antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was 54% of wild-type; 2) pp60 was the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that associated with PI 3-kinase, whereas tyrosine phosphorylaion of IRS-2 as well as its association with this enzyme was almost undetectable; and 3) glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation at maximal insulin stimulation were decreased to 52 and 68% of those from wild-type. These data suggest that both IRS-1 and pp60 play a major role in insulin-induced glucose transport in adipocytes, and that pp60 is predominantly involved in regulating this process in the absence of IRS-1.

Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) analyzing these mice showed that insulin signaling and biological actions such as PI 3-kinase activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and glucose transport are impaired in muscles from IRS-1 null mice, which was in contrast to the grossly normal signaling and actions in livers from these mice. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in livers from these mice was enhanced to almost the same degree as that of IRS-1 in livers from wild-type mice, whereas in muscles, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 from these mice was much less (20–30%) than that of IRS-1 in muscles from wild-type. Thus, the difference in the degree of insulin resistance in these two major insulin targets from IRS-1 null mice appeared to depend on the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (27Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Different from that in muscles and livers, in adipocytes there exists another major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, pp60 (13Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in these cells the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 can be readily examined. We therefore analyzed adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice and showed that insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity, which was approximately 50% of that from wild-type, appeared to be principally mediated by pp60 but not by IRS-2, and that more than 50% of insulin-induced glucose transport as well as GLUT4 translocation was preserved in these cells. These data imply that not only IRS-1 but also pp60 plays a major role in mediating insulin actions in adipocytes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice to clarify the role of IRS-1 and other endogenous substrates in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, we clarified that the decrease in glucose transport was due to the defect in GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, we demonstrated that PI 3-kinase activated by insulin was decreased by 50% (Fig. 1). From these data, we estimated that IRS-1 played a role in mediating at least 30–50% of these insulin actions in adipocytes from wild-type mice. On the other hand, there should be other substrates that mediate the residual insulin actions in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. In fact, our data demonstrated that the 60-kDa protein was the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice (Fig. 2). Recently, a variety of 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified (13Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since 1) a major part of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 60-kDa protein was coimmunoprecipitated with αp85 (Fig. 3, and data not shown), and 2) this protein was detected in adipocytes but not in livers or muscles from wild-type and IRS-1 null mice (Figs. 2 and 3) (27Yamauchi T.

Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2 in adipocytes was very low (Figs. 2 and 3) (40Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.-M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that pp60 but not IRS-2 is the major substrate that principally associates with PI 3-kinase in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. We can presume from these data that the pp60·PI 3-kinase complex regulates the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. Interestingly, the amount of pp60 tyrosine phosphorylation does not appear to increase in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice (Fig. 2), which also suggests that IRS-1 and pp60 are additively involved in mediating insulin actions in adipocytes. This is in contrast with the livers and muscles in which tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 is enhanced by the lack of IRS-1 (27Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24670-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), indicating that IRS-1 but not IRS-2 is preferentially phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in wild-type mice.As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of the cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin abolished insulin-sensitive glucose transport in both cell types, which suggested that PI 3-kinase activity is also essential for this IRS-1-alternative pathway that appears to be regulated by pp60 (Figs. 3 and 5). However, in this study we found that when PI 3-kinase activity was compared with glucose transport, glucose transport was not strictly correlated with the extent of PI 3-kinase activation because 1) insulin stimulated more PI 3-kinase activity at 10−7m in IRS-1 null mice than it did at 10−9m in wild-type mice, but glucose transport activity at 10−7m insulin in IRS-1 null mice was only about 50% of that at 10−9m insulin in wild-type; and 2) even though 10−9m insulin in IRS-1 null mice stimulated less than 50% of the glucose transport activity it did in wild-type mice, at this concentration of insulin there was no significant difference in PI 3-kinase activity between these mouse types (Figs. 1and 4). Therefore, these data also indicate that glucose transport does not simply parallel PI 3-kinase activity although PI 3-kinase is essential for this process. These discrepancies may be due to the existence of signaling deficits other than PI 3-kinase activation in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice, which may potentially reflect the lower efficiency of pp60 to target PI 3-kinase to GLUT4-containing vesicles or the presence of other additional signaling molecules interacting with IRS-1 but not pp60.Comparing the extent of GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane with that of glucose transport activity, the impairment of GLUT4 translocation at 10−7m insulin in these cells appeared to be unexpectedly small as compared with that of glucose transport activity (Figs. 4 and 6). In contrast, at 10−9m insulin, which caused half-maximal activation of glucose transport in these cells, the degree of impairment of GLUT4 translocation to PM was in parallel with the extent of decrease in glucose transport activity. As the discrepancy between glucose transport activity and GLUT4 translocation is likely to be due to the presence of glucose transporters that are catalytically inactive or partially occluded in plasma membrane (5Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17820-17829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Vannucci S.J. Nishimura H. Satoh S. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. Simpson I.A. Biochemical J. 1992; 288: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the present data may indicate that the IRS-1-mediated pathway is also involved in the activation of these glucose transporters. However, it is also possible that the plasma membrane is contaminated by other membrane fractions that may cause this discrepancy.After submitting this paper, Lavan et al. (42Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of the cDNA of pp60 which was designated as IRS-3. The predicted amino acid sequence of IRS-3 contains an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a phosphotyrosine-binding domain and a group of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, four of which are in the YXXM motif that binds to the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase. Although the tissue distribution of IRS-3 or the functions of this protein in insulin-induced signal transduction have not been demonstrated, its structure indicates that IRS-3 may interact with the activated insulin receptor and associate via its phosphorylated tyrosine residues with SH2-containing proteins such as PI 3-kinase (42Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that pp60 plays a role in insulin-induced glucose transport in adipocytes.Taken together, the analysis of adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice showed that 1) at least 30–50% of insulin-induced PI 3-kinase activity, glucose transport, and GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes from wild-type mice appears to be regulated by IRS-1; 2) insulin-induced PI 3-kinase, glucose transport, and GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice, which are approximately 50% of that from wild-type, may be principally mediated by pp60 but not by IRS-2 or other endogenous substrates; and 3) not only IRS-1 but also pp60 may play a major role in mediating insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes. In fat and muscle tissues, the major targets of insulin-induced glucose uptake, it is known that glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 translocates from a large intracellular pool to the cell surface in response to insulin (1Bell G.I.

Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Brunung J.C. Haag III, B.J. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 26Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H.

Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) analyzing these mice showed that insulin signaling and biological actions such as PI 3-kinase activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and glucose transport are impaired in muscles from IRS-1 null mice, which was in contrast to the grossly normal signaling and actions in livers from these mice. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in livers from these mice was enhanced to almost the same degree as that of IRS-1 in livers from wild-type mice, whereas in muscles, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 from these mice was much less (20–30%) than that of IRS-1 in muscles from wild-type. Thus, the difference in the degree of insulin resistance in these two major insulin targets from IRS-1 null mice appeared to depend on the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 (27Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Different from that in muscles and livers, in adipocytes there exists another major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, pp60 (13Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5921-5928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in these cells the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 can be readily examined. We therefore analyzed adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice and showed that insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity, which was approximately 50% of that from wild-type, appeared to be principally mediated by pp60 but not by IRS-2, and that more than 50% of insulin-induced glucose transport as well as GLUT4 translocation was preserved in these cells. These data imply that not only IRS-1 but also pp60 plays a major role in mediating insulin actions in adipocytes. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we analyzed adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice to clarify the role of IRS-1 and other endogenous substrates in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, we clarified that the decrease in glucose transport was due to the defect in GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, we demonstrated that PI 3-kinase activated by insulin was decreased by 50% (Fig. 1). From these data, we estimated that IRS-1 played a role in mediating at least 30–50% of these insulin actions in adipocytes from wild-type mice. On the other hand, there should be other substrates that mediate the residual insulin actions in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. In fact, our data demonstrated that the 60-kDa protein was the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice (Fig. 2). Recently, a variety of 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified (13Lavan B.E. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Thus, we conclude that pp60 but not IRS-2 is the major substrate that principally associates with PI 3-kinase in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. We can presume from these data that the pp60·PI 3-kinase complex regulates the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice. Interestingly, the amount of pp60 tyrosine phosphorylation does not appear to increase in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice (Fig. 2), which also suggests that IRS-1 and pp60 are additively involved in mediating insulin actions in adipocytes. This is in contrast with the livers and muscles in which tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 is enhanced by the lack of IRS-1 (27Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R.

However, in this study we found that when PI 3-kinase activity was compared with glucose transport, glucose transport was not strictly correlated with the extent of PI 3-kinase activation because 1) insulin stimulated more PI 3-kinase activity at 10−7m in IRS-1 null mice than it did at 10−9m in wild-type mice, but glucose transport activity at 10−7m insulin in IRS-1 null mice was only about 50% of that at 10−9m insulin in wild-type; and 2) even though 10−9m insulin in IRS-1 null mice stimulated less than 50% of the glucose transport activity it did in wild-type mice, at this concentration of insulin there was no significant difference in PI 3-kinase activity between these mouse types (Figs. 1and 4). Therefore, these data also indicate that glucose transport does not simply parallel PI 3-kinase activity although PI 3-kinase is essential for this process. These discrepancies may be due to the existence of signaling deficits other than PI 3-kinase activation in adipocytes from IRS-1 null mice, which may potentially reflect the lower efficiency of pp60 to target PI 3-kinase to GLUT4-containing vesicles or the presence of other additional signaling molecules interacting with IRS-1 but not pp60.Comparing the extent of GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane with that of glucose transport activity, the impairment of GLUT4 translocation at 10−7m insulin in these cells appeared to be unexpectedly small as compared with that of glucose transport activity (Figs. 4 and 6). In contrast, at 10−9m insulin, which caused half-maximal activation of glucose transport in these cells, the degree of impairment of GLUT4 translocation to PM was in parallel with the extent of decrease in glucose transport activity. As the discrepancy between glucose transport activity and GLUT4 translocation is likely to be due to the presence of glucose transporters that are catalytically inactive or partially occluded in plasma membrane (5Satoh S.

The predicted amino acid sequence of IRS-3 contains an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a phosphotyrosine-binding domain and a group of potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, four of which are in the YXXM motif that binds to the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase. Although the tissue distribution of IRS-3 or the functions of this protein in insulin-induced signal transduction have not been demonstrated, its structure indicates that IRS-3 may interact with the activated insulin receptor and associate via its phosphorylated tyrosine residues with SH2-containing proteins such as PI 3-kinase (42Lavan B.E.

The receptors exist in a variety of functionally distinct subtypes that are determined by their subunit structures. The subunits are encoded by 11 genes, α2–α9 and β2–β4. Three of the genes, α3, α5, and β4, are tightly clustered, and their encoded proteins make up the predominant receptor subtype in the peripheral nervous system. The tight linkage of the genes suggests there may be a common regulatory mechanism underlying their expression. However, although their expression patterns significantly overlap, they are not identical, indicating that independent regulatory mechanisms must also exist. Our studies have focused upon the gene encoding the β4 subunit for which we have identified several transcriptional regulatory elements. One of these elements, E2, specifically interacts with the general transcription factor Sp1. Here we show that another member of the Sp family of factors, Sp3, can specifically interact with E2 whereas two other members, Sp2 and Sp4, cannot. Co-transfection experiments indicate that Sp3 can transactivate a β4 promoter/reporter gene construct and, furthermore, that Sp1 and Sp3 can transactivate the β4 reporter construct synergistically. The transactivation is dependent upon an intact E2 and may involve direct interactions between Sp1 and Sp3.

Consequently, our laboratory has focused upon characterizing the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of a cluster of receptor subunit genes, those encoding the α3, α5, and β4 subunits. This cluster of genes spans approximately 60 kilobase pairs of the rat genome (20Boulter J. O'Shea-Greefield A. Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D. Ballivet M. Deneris E.S. McKinnon D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4472-4482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the α3, α5, and β4 subunits make up the predominant nACh receptor subtype expressed in the peripheral nervous system (21Conroy W.G. Berg D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4424-4431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the clustering of their genes raises interesting possibilities regarding regulation of their expression. One possibility is that they are coordinately expressed via a common regulatory mechanism. However, although the genes exhibit overlapping expression patterns, the expression patterns are not completely identical (5McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 22Wada E. Wada K. Boulter J. Deneris E. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Swanson L.W. J. Comp.

Brain Res. 1992; 16: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggesting that in addition to a possible common regulatory mechanism, these genes are most likely subject to independent regulatory mechanisms as well. As an initial approach to understanding the regulation of the clustered receptor subunit genes, we have focused upon the gene encoding the β4 subunit. We previously reported the identification of several regulatory elements within the promoter region of the β4 gene and demonstrated that these elements specifically interact with nuclear proteins present in extracts prepared from brain tissue and a cholinergic (used here to describe cells that either synthesize and release acetylcholine and/or are cholinoceptive) cell line (11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One of these elements, E1, was shown to interact with the transcriptional regulatory factor Purα, as well as three other, unidentified, DNA-binding proteins that we refer to as neuronal acetylcholine receptor promoter-binding proteins (Ref. 28Du Q. Tomkinson A.E. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14990-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another element, E2, was shown to interact with the general transcription factor, Sp1 (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated, via transient transfection analyses, that Sp1 is capable of transactivating a β4 promoter/reporter gene construct (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results, and others, led us to hypothesize that the E1-binding proteins facilitate or strengthen interactions between E2 and Sp1 leading ultimately to β4 gene expression (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sp1 was originally identified as a cellular transcription factor required for SV40 gene expression (29Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 30Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Sp1 was shown to activate transcription of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (30Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 31Courey A.J. Tjian R.

More recently, a family of Sp1-related factors has been identified and includes Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (34Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 36Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 recognize GC and CACCC boxes with similar specificities and affinities, which is reflected in the high degree of conservation between their DNA-binding domains (34Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sp2 binds GC boxes with a significantly lower affinity than the other Sp family members, pointing to the complexity of gene regulation by the Sp family (36Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This complexity is further illustrated by the demonstration that Sp1 and Sp4 function as transcriptional activators, whereas Sp3 functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending upon the gene in question (35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 38Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Given the interaction between E2 of the β4 subunit gene and Sp1, we investigated whether other Sp family members interact with E2. In this report, we show that Sp3 can interact specifically with E2, that in co-transfection experiments Sp3 can transactivate a β4 promoter/reporter gene construct, and that Sp1 and Sp3 can transactivate a β4 promoter/reporter gene construct in a synergistic manner. In addition, we demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 are expressed in cholinergic cells. Finally, we present data suggesting that the transactivation by Sp1 and Sp3 is a consequence of the two factors interacting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed as described (11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide was incubated in the presence of nuclear extract, prepared from either SN17 cells (39Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or adult rat brains, in the presence of 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI·dC). The oligonucleotide corresponded to either a β4 regulatory region (sequence shown in Fig. 1) or the consensus Sp1 binding site (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′). Following the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide, the reactions were incubated on ice for 45 min. The reactions were then separated through 6.0% polyacrylamide gels (prerun at 100 V for 30 min) in 0.5 × TBE buffer (150 V for approximately 4 h). For mobility supershift experiments, specific antiserum against Sp1 (α-PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Sp2 (K-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Sp3 (D-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or Sp4 (V-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was preincubated with nuclear extract for 45 min followed by the addition of the oligonucleotide. DrosophilaSchneider SL2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained at room temperature in modified Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 per 60-mm culture dish immediately prior to transfection. DNAs were introduced into the cells by liposome-mediated transfection using 9 μl of Cellfectin/per sample (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2.0 μg of target DNA (pX1B4FHwt or pX1B4FHmut4; see Fig. 1) in the absence or presence of 5 or 10 fmol of effector DNA per dish. The effector DNA was either an Sp1 expression construct (pActSp1; the kind gift of Ed Seto (University of South Florida)) containing Sp1 cDNA inserted downstream of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter (40Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and/or an Sp3 expression construct (pPacUSp3; the kind gift of Guntram Suske (Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany)) containing the Sp3 coding sequence inserted downstream of the actin 5C promoter (35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The target DNA constructs were also transfected with the vectors pAct and pPacU devoid of Sp1 and Sp3 coding sequences as negative controls for luciferase expression. Cellfectin complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 5 h. Following the incubation period, the cells were overlaid with 0.5 ml of medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. The following day, 2 ml of complete medium were added. The cells were harvested and luciferase assays were performed 48 h following the addition of complete medium. Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase expression as driven by a Rous sarcoma viral promoter (RSV-βGal). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a commercially available kit (Tropix). SN17 cells were maintained as described previously (11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transient transfections in SN17 cells were performed using Pfx-6 lipid from the PerFect Lipids kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, approximately 24 h prior to transfection, SN17 cells were plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 2.75 × 105 cells per dish. The cells received 2 μg of the β4 reporter plasmid pX1B4FHwt and 2 μg of RSV-βGal, in the absence or presence of 670 fmol of effector DNA per dish. The effector DNA was either an Sp1 expression construct (pCGNSp1; the kind gift of Tom Shenk (Princeton University)) containing Sp1 cDNA under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (45Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and/or an Sp3 expression construct (pRc/CMV/Sp3; another kind gift of Guntram Suske) containing Sp3 cDNA under control of the CMV promoter (35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Parental vectors, pCGN and pRc/CMV, were co-transfected with the target DNAs as negative controls for luciferase expression. Lipid-DNA complexes were added to the cells, and following a 4-h incubation, cells were refed with growth medium. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and the luciferase activity was assayed using a commercially available kit (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase expression as described above. SN17 cells were grown as described above. Untransfected SN17 cells were harvested at 70% confluency and Sp1- and Sp3-transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped in PBS, and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (150 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 130 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 130 μmleupeptin, 13 μm pepstatin and pyronin Y) and boiled for 5 min. Cell debris and chromosomal DNA were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were stored at −20 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were boiled for 5 min. The cell lysates (2, 5, and 10 μl) were electrophoresed through SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). In the case of rat brain (Fig. 2 C), nuclear extracts were used as protein sources. Gels were electroblotted onto pure nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.037% SDS) for 1 h at 100 mV. Membranes were blocked in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. Western blotting with anti-Sp1, anti-Sp2, and anti-Sp3 was performed using the SuperSignal Substrate Western blotting System (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-Sp1, anti-Sp2, and anti-Sp3 antibodies were used at concentrations of 1, 5, and 5 μg/ml, respectively, in Blotto solution. SN17 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes and harvested at 70% confluency. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described previously (41Miyamoto A. Cui X. Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2394-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped in PBS, and pelleted. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS) and lysed on ice for 30 min. Nuclei were lysed by passage through a 21-gauge needle 5 times, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations of cell extracts were performed for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rolling with 5 μg of either preimmune, anti-Sp1, or anti-Sp3 polyclonal rabbit antisera. Immune complexes were recovered on protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rolling. The beads were pelleted, washed 4 times with 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli SDS loading buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were boiled for 5 min, and 10 μl of each sample were electrophoresed through SDS-12% PAGE. Western blot analysis with either anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibody was performed as described above. Expression constructs containing Sp1 or Sp3 coding sequences were transcribed and translated in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine using the TNT-Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins translated in vitro(20 μl) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 rabbit polyclonal antibody in 150 μl of cell lysis buffer (see above). Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described in the preceding paragraph. Following electrophoresis, gels were treated with Enhance (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. We previously identified two adjacent regulatory elements, E1 and E2, in the rat β4 subunit gene (see Fig. 1; Ref. 16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We showed that Sp1 can specifically bind to E2 and can transactivate the β4 promoter (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether the other Sp family members, Sp2–4, interact with the same regulatory region of the β4 gene, mobility supershift experiments were carried out using antisera specific for each protein. Standard EMSA binding reactions were carried out in the presence of specific antisera and nuclear extracts prepared from either a cholinergic cell line, SN17 (39Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or adult rat brain. Consistent with our previously reported EMSA data (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), incubation of radiolabeled E1/E2 oligonucleotide with nuclear extract alone led to the formation of two protein-DNA complexes (Fig.2 A, complexes B and C). Incubation of the binding reactions with either anti-Sp2 or anti-Sp4 antibodies did not affect the EMSA pattern (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3, 5, 9, and 11), whereas incubation with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies led to the appearance of at least one additional complex (complex A) having a lower mobility than either complex B or C (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2, 4, 8, and 10). Interestingly, incubation of anti-Sp1 with the binding reaction led to a greater decrease in complex B as compared with complex C, whereas incubation of anti-Sp3 in the reaction had the opposite effect, there being a greater decrease in complex C as compared with complex B. Incubation of the binding reaction with both antisera simultaneously led to an almost complete absence of both complexes B and C with a concomitant increase in complex A (i.e. it appeared to have a synergistic effect; Fig.2 A, lanes 6 and 12). The negative results obtained with the anti-Sp2 and anti-Sp4 antibodies raise the question as to whether the two factors are present within the samples tested and, if so, whether the antibodies can recognize them. To address this question, mobility supershift experiments were carried out using a consensus Sp1-binding site as the probe and the same anti-Sp2 and anti-Sp4 antibodies used in the experiments with the E1/E2 oligonucleotide. Incubation of the radiolabeled consensus Sp1-binding site with nuclear extract alone led to the formation of two protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 2 B, complexes B and C). Incubation of the binding reactions with anti-Sp4 antibody led to the appearance of an additional complex having a lower mobility than either complex B or C (Fig. 2 B, complex A, lanes 3 and 6). Incubation of the binding reaction with anti-Sp2 antibody did not affect the EMSA pattern (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and 5). Although these data indicate that Sp4 is present in the SN17 and rat brain extracts and that the anti-Sp4 antibody can recognize it, the question remains regarding the presence of Sp2. To investigate whether Sp2 is present in SN17 cells and rat brain, Western blot analysis was carried out using extracts from SN17 cells and rat brain. As shown in Fig. 2 C, two bands of approximately 85 and 80 kDa were observed when the blot was incubated with the anti-Sp2 antibody, consistent with the published size of Sp2 (36Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and indicating that Sp2 is present in the extracts at a concentration sufficient for detection by the antibody. These results are consistent with previously published data which suggest that the DNA binding specificity of Sp2 is different from those of the other Sp factors (36Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Sp1 and Sp3 or antigenically related proteins, but not Sp2 or Sp4, can interact with the β4 regulatory region. Given the results of the mobility supershift experiment, the functional relevance of Sp1 and Sp3 was tested.Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells (which have been reported to lack Sp activity; Refs. 31Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 32Courey A.J. Holtzaman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, and 42Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) were transfected with a wild type β4 promoter/luciferase expression construct (pX1B4FHwt; see Fig. 1) and an expression construct for either Sp1 (pActSp1; Ref. 40Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) or Sp3 (pPacUSp3; Ref. 35Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To confirm that Sp1 or Sp3 expression was involved in transactivation, the target DNA was also transfected with the pAct and pPacU vectors alone (devoid of Sp1 and Sp3 coding sequences). As we previously reported (16Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Sp1 is capable of transactivating the wild type β4 promoter/luciferase construct approximately 10-fold when 5 fmol of the Sp1 expression construct are used (Fig. 3). Interestingly, despite their similar binding specificities and affinities, Sp3 at the same concentration had a much greater effect than Sp1, resulting in an approximately 100-fold activation of the same β4 promoter/luciferase construct (Fig. 3). When Sp1 and Sp3 were both co-transfected with the β4 promoter/luciferase construct, an approximately 200-fold increase in transcriptional activity was seen, indicating a synergistic effect of the two regulatory factors (Fig. 3). In addition, transactivation of the β4 promoter/luciferase construct by Sp1 and Sp3 occurs in a dose-dependent manner. When 10 fmol of each Sp expression construct were used, Sp1 transactivated the β4 promoter approximately 30-fold while Sp3 transactivated the promoter approximately 200-fold (Fig. 3). Ten fmol of both Sp expression constructs co-transfected with the wild type β4 promoter led to an approximately 280-fold activation (Fig. 3). To determine the dependence of the transactivations on an intact E2, similar transfection experiments were carried out using a β4 promoter/luciferase construct in which E2 is mutated at three nucleotide positions (pX1B4FHmut4; see Fig. 1). The effects of the Sp factors on the transcriptional activity of the mutated β4 promoter were significantly less than those on the wild type promoter, there being only an approximately 60-fold activation when 10 fmol of both Sp expression constructs were used (Fig. 3). The residual activation seen with the mutated promoter may be a consequence of the Sp factors binding to other sites within the promoter (see “Discussion”). To determine whether the Sp factors had any effect on β4 promoter activity in a more physiological context, a series of experiments was carried out using the SN17 cholinergic cell line. Firs"

We introduced the 5′-upstream sequence of ABO genes into the promoterless reporter vector and characterized the promoter activity of deletion constructs using transient transfection assays with gastric cancer cell line KATO III cells. The sequence just upstream of the transcription start site (cap site), and an enhancer element, which is located further upstream (between −3899 and −3618 base pairs (bp) from the transcription initiation site) and contains 4 tandem copies of a 43-bp repeat unit, were shown in gastric cancer cells to be responsible for the transcriptional activity of the ABO genes. DNA binding studies have demonstrated that a transcription factor, CBF/NF-Y, bound to the 43-bp repeat unit in the minisatellite. Functional importance of these CBF/NF-Y-binding sites in enhancer activity was confirmed by transfection experiments using reporter plasmids with mutated binding sites. Thus, transcriptional regulation of the human ABO genes is dependent upon binding of CBF/NF-Y to the minisatellite.

Thus, transcriptional regulation of the human ABO genes is dependent upon binding of CBF/NF-Y to the minisatellite. Histo-blood group ABH(O) antigens, the major alloantigens in humans (1Landsteiner K. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1900; 27: 357-363Google Scholar), have been characterized as defined trisaccharide determinants GalNAcα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R, Galα1→3(Fucα1→2)Galβ1→R, and disaccharide determinant Fucα1→2Galβ1→R for A, B, and H, respectively (2Morgan W.T.J. Watkins W.M. Br. Med. Bull. 1969; 25: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Kabat E.A. Isbell H. Carbohydrates in Solution (Advanced Chemistry Society 117). American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1973: 334-361Google Scholar). These structures represent the secondary gene products which are synthesized from the precursor H substrate by α1→3GalNAc (A transferase) and α1→3Gal transferase (B transferase), the primary gene products coded by the functional alleles at the ABO locus (4Watkins W.M. Harris H. Hirschhorn K. Advances in Human Genetics. 10. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1980: 1-136Google Scholar, 5Ginsburg V. Adv. Enzymol. 1972; 36: 131-149PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular genetic studies of the ABO genotypes have identified two critical single-base substitutions between A and B genes, the resultant 2-amino acid substitutions being responsible for the different donor nucleotide-sugar substrate specificity between A and B transferases. A single base deletion, which shifts the codon reading frame and abolishes the function of A transferase, has been identified in O allelic cDNAs (6Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 7Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ABH antigens are known to undergo drastic changes during development, differentiation, and maturation. Studies of these antigens in stratified squamous epithelia provided one of the clearest examples of differential expression during cell maturation (8Dabelsteen E. Vedtofte P. Hakomori S. Young W.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelia, the immature cells in the basal layers are characterized by the expression of sialylated or unsubstituted precursor peripheral cores, while differentiated and mature cells in the upper layers sequentially express α1→2-fucosylated H structures, and A and B antigens depending on the ABO genotype of the individual. This sequential expression of carbohydrate antigens is associated with the differentiation pattern of the epithelium. An interesting question is how these changes are controlled during cell differentiation. Since keratinocytes are known to greatly change their gene expression during terminal cell differentiation (9Teumer J. Zezulak K. Green H. Leigh I.M. Lane E.B. Watt F.M. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 235-242Google Scholar), the switch-on of the ABO genes during the maturation may be governed by the same factor(s). To fill in the gap between the expression of the ABO genes and the appearance of the ABO phenotypes in the terminal differentiation of epithelial cells, it is essential to understand the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the ABO genes. In addition to the normal cell differentiation process, the changes of ABH antigen expression have also been documented in abnormal processes such as tumorigenesis. Reduction or complete deletion of A/B antigen expression in primary lung, bladder, and colorectal carcinomas have been reported. This phenotypic change was well correlated with the invasive and metastatic potentials of the tumors, and with 5- or 10-year mortality rates of the patients (10Lee J.S. Ro J.Y. Sahin A.A. Hong W.K. Brown B.W. Mountain C.F. Hittelman W.N. N. Eng. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Matsumoto H. Muramatsu H. Shimotakahara T. Yanagi M. Nishijima H. Mitani N. Baba K. Muramatsu T. Shimazu H. Cancer. 1993; 72: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression of H/Ley, the A/B precursor, was inversely correlated with the survival rate of the patients with lung carcinoma after surgery (12Miyake M. Taki T. Hitomi S. Hakomori S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Disappearance of A/B antigens was ascribed to the absence of A or B transferase gene expression rather than the loss of these genes in human bladder tumors (13Ørntoft T.F. Meldgaard P. Pedersen B. Wolf H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1031-1036PubMed Google Scholar). Delineation of transcriptional regulation of the ABO genes, therefore, may provide clues as to the underlying mechanisms resulting in A/B antigen disappearance in cancer cells with invasive and metastatic potentials. In an initial attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the human ABO genes, we have previously isolated five overlapping genomic clones to cover the entire coding sequence as well as some 5′-upstream and 3′-downstream sequences (14Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the identification of a DNA cis-element and trans-activating protein which accounts for the expression of the ABO genes in cells from gastrointestinal origin. A human gastric cancer cell line, KATO III (JCRB0611), was grown in 45% RPMI 1640 with 45% minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, the cells were inoculated at 3 × 105/ml 16–24 h prior to transfection. They were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice with RPMI 1640 without fetal bovine serum andl-glutamine, and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640. An aliquot (0.8 ml) of cell suspension was placed into a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). Fourteen micrograms of supercoiled plasmid DNA was added to the cell suspension. Cells were incubated with DNA for 5 min at room temperature and then electroporated for 960 microfarads at 250 V. Immediately after transfection, the cuvettes were transferred to an ice bath and kept for 15 min. The cells were then transferred to 10 ml of RPMI 1640 plus minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine, incubated for 48 h, and harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocols using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Light emission was measured in a model 1253 luminometer (BioOrbit), and the values were obtained in relative light units. The amount of cell lysate used for each luciferase assay was adjusted so that the observable light emission would fall within the linear range of titration curves (light emission observed versus amount of luciferase protein). Variations in transfection efficiency were corrected by normalizing the activities of β-galactosidase expressed from the co-transfected RSV LTR/β-galactosidase plasmid DNA. β-Galactosidase activities were measured as described elsewhere (15Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Relative activity of each construct in different experiments was obtained by arbitrarily assigning the activity of the pGL3-promoter vector containing the SV40 promoter to be 1.0. A DNA fragment containing the 5′-upstream sequence of the human ABO gene was subcloned from the genomic clone HG-1 (14Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) into luciferase reporter vectors, pGL3-basic vector (Promega), pGL3-promoter vector (Promega), pGL2-control vector (Promega), and pTK-luc (16McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The SmaI site of the pGL3-basic vector was converted to the EcoRI site to facilitate the subcloning of the EcoRI/NcoI genomic fragment into the polylinker site just upstream of the luciferase gene. This construct was then used for the generation of several progressive series of upstream end deletion constructs. Since an NcoI site is present at the translation initiation codon in both ABO and luciferase genes, the linkage between the upstream region and translated region of the ABO gene was conserved in the reporter plasmids containing the progressive series of upstream end deletions. The pGL3-promoter vector contains the SV40 viral promoter, while pTK-luc contains a thymidine kinase promoter. The pGL2-control vector contains both the SV40 promoter and enhancer. The SmaI site of the pGL3-promoter vector was converted to the EcoRI site to facilitate the subcloning of the genomic fragments or PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase pair(s). -amplified fragments into the polylinker site just upstream of the SV40 promoter. Nomenclature of the various ABO gene constructs is based on the nature of the inserted fragment. Letter symbols reflect the restriction enzyme cleavage sites used for the construction of these plasmids, while numerals indicate the end points of the primers used for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For example, EN construct contains the EcoRI-NcoI fragment (between −4661 and +31), and −3899H construct contains the fragment bordered with PCR primer sequence starting at −3899 on one end and HindIII site on the other. All the DNA fragments were generated by either restriction endonuclease digestion or PCR. Construct −3899:−3618Δ/SN was produced by overlapping PCR mutagenesis. The genomic DNA fragment between the XmnI site at −3252 and the PstI site at −2371 was inserted downstream of the SV40 enhancer in the pGL2-control vector, in the same orientation as in the ABO genes. pGL3-control vector (Promega), containing the SV40 promoter and enhancer, was used in promoter assays. The −3899 to −3618 fragment containing 4 tandem copies of a 43-bp repeat unit was introduced into the upstream of promoter sequence in some constructs (−3899:−3618 (→)/SN, −3899:−3618 (→)/TK, and −3899:−3618 (→)/SV), and into the downstream of the luciferase gene in other constructs (SN/−3899:−3618 (→), SN/−3899:−3618 (←), SV/−3899:−3618 (→), and SV/−3899:−3618 (←)). Arrows to the right indicate that the fragment was inserted in the same orientation as it appears in the ABO gene; the fragment was cloned in the same orientation as the luciferase genes in the reporter plasmids are transcribed. The fragment (−3899:−3618) was PCR-amplified and cloned first into pCRII (Invitrogen) to generate construct pCR−3899:−3618. The plasmids −3899:−3618 (→)/SV and −3899:−3618 (→)/TK were prepared by digesting pCR−3899:−3618 with EcoRI, modifying both ends with SalI linker, and directionally ligating the fragment into the XhoI-digested pGL3-promoter vector and SalI-digested TK-luc, respectively. A fragment containing the −3899 to −3618 sequence was obtained by cleaving the plasmid −3899:−3618 (→)/SV with SmaI and BglII. One end of the SmaI/BglII fragment was modified toSalI site whereas the other end was blunted in either orientation. These fragments were then directionally ligated into the SalI/BamHI sites of pGL3-promoter vector and SN to construct four plasmids, SV/−3899:−3618 (→), SV/−3899:−3618 (←), SN/−3899:−3618 (→), and SN/−3899:−3618 (←). The plasmid −3899:−3618 (→)/SN was prepared by digesting −3899:−3618 (→)/SV with BglII, modifying the end to EcoRI site, cleaving with NheI, and directionally ligating the fragment with NheI-,EcoRI-digested SN. The double-stranded oligonucleotides, TR23 and mTR23, were inserted into the BamHI site of pT7T3U18 sequencing vector (Stratagene). To prepare the plasmids 4 × 23/SV and 4 × m23/SV, the EcoRI-XbaI fragments containing the above inserted oligonucleotide sequences were cleaved, and ligated to the EcoRI/BglII site upstream of the SV40 promoter in the modified pGL3-promoter vector. Plasmid DNA was purified by applying alkaline lysed samples onto two successive CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients. Orientation, and the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the insert of all the constructs used in this study were verified by detailed restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequence analysis using Cycle Sequencing Kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer). For all the constructs containing PCR-amplified fragments, sequencing was performed over the entire region of the amplified sequences. Nuclear extracts and probes were prepared as previously reported (17Kominato Y. Galson D.L. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 58-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shirakawa F. Saito K. Bonagura C.A. Galson D.L. Fenton M.J. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 × 108 to 3 × 108 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 5 min in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg per ml each of protease inhibitors, antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A with protease inhibitors and then Dounce homogenized. The homogenate was microcentrifuged for 30 s. Nuclei were resuspended in 0.8 ml of buffer B (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mmMgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with protease inhibitors, and gently rocked on a platform at 4 °C for 30 min. After 30 min of microcentrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 × volumes of buffer D (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C overnight. After 30 min of microcentrifugation at 4 °C, aliquots of the supernatant were frozen at −70 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. We have employed two separate protocols for EMSAs. Results shown in Fig. 4, A and B, were obtained by the protocol previously described by Shirakawa et al. (18Shirakawa F. Saito K. Bonagura C.A. Galson D.L. Fenton M.J. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TAE buffer (6.67 mmTris, pH 7.5, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmEDTA). Binding reactions were performed in 15 μl of a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol) containing 32P-labeled probe (0.2 ng, 5,000–20,000 cpm), 0.4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 15 min. The gels were electrophoresed at room temperature. The EMSAs performed in Fig. 5, A and B, followed the protocol described by Coustry et al. (19Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA). Binding reactions were performed in 15 μl of a buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing32P-labeled probe (0.2 ng, 5,000–20,000 cpm), 0.4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5 μg of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 15 min. The gels were electrophoresed at room temperature. One hundred-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitors over the labeled probe were used for competition analyses except for those shown in Fig.5 A (see legend). For supershift experiments, 2 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-NF-Y A subunit antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), 2 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-Egr-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) raised against a C-terminal Egr-1 peptide, or 2 μl of normal rabbit serum was added to the nuclear extract, and preincubated for 15 min on ice prior to addition of radiolabeled probes.Figure 5CBF/NF-Y specifically binds to the 43-bp repeat unit of the minisatellite. A, oligonucleotide TR23 binds a nuclear protein which is effectively competed for by unlabeled oligonucleotide Eα-23 containing the strong CBF/NF-Y-binding site in Y boxes of MHC class II gene. EMSA was performed with nuclear extract from KATO III cells. Radiolabeled probes used are TR23 oligonucleotide (lanes 1–5), oligo mTR23, a mutated version of oligo TR23 (lanes 6), and oligo Eα-23 (lanes 7–11). Unlabeled competitors indicated above each lane were used in a 100-fold molar excess. B, anti-NF-Y antibody supershifts the DNA-protein complex. The nuclear extracts prepared from KATO III cells were preincubated with anti-NF-Y A-subunit antibody (lanes 4, 5, 10, and 11) or anti-Egr-1 antibody (lanes 6 and 12). Radiolabeled probes used are TR23 oligonucleotide (lanes 1–6) and oligo Eα-23 (lanes 7–12).

The Eα-23 oligonucleotide sequence corresponds to nucleotides −66 to −45 in the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter (Eα-promoter) (20Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1985; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The NF-I oligonucleotide contains NF-I consensus sequence as described by Chodosh et al. (21Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 53: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The underlines in the mTR23 oligonucleotide indicate the sites of specific mutations designed to abrogate the transcriptional factor CBF/NF-Y binding. We substituted the nucleotide sequences following Dorn et al.(20Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1985; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated several genomic clones of the human ABO genes (14Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A genomic clone, designated as HG-1, was shown by restriction enzyme analysis and Southern hybridization to contain the 5′-upstream sequence of the coding region. A 7.8-kb EcoRI/EcoRI fragment, which encompassed 4.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region and the first exon as well as the first intron, was subcloned from this clone and sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region has been deposited to GeneBankTM (accession number U22302). Two possible transcription initiation sites were mapped by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique using human pancreatic cDNA as a template. Sequence analysis of the proximal region to these sites demonstrates the presence of several GC boxes just upstream of these possible transcription initiation sites, whereas neither TATA nor CAAT boxes are found close to these sites (14Yamamoto F. McNill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a minisatellite in the 5′ farther upstream region. This minisatellite sequence is composed of 4 tandem copies of a 43-bp repeat unit, and is located at positions −3843 to −3672 relative to the upstream transcription start site. Minisatellite sequences have been shown to serve as regulatory regions for cellular transcription in certain genes (22Cohen J.B. Walter M.V. Levinson A.D. J. Cell.

Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence between −3950 and −3470 of the human ABO gene is shown in Fig.1. In this region around the minisatellite, several potential transcription factor-binding site motifs were identified. Therefore, it seemed important and interesting to assess the functional roles of this minisatellite sequence in the transcription of ABO genes. As a means to examine the promoter/enhancer activity of the 5′-upstream sequences of the human ABO gene, we have employed reporter and transfection systems. We first obtained the EN construct by introducing the 4.7-kb EcoRI-NcoI genomic fragment 5′-flanking the coding sequence of the human ABO gene into the promoterless pGL3-basic vector at the upstream of the luciferase coding sequence (see Fig. 2). This plasmid was transiently transfected into the human gastric cancer cell line KATO III. This cell line was derived from the tumor of a blood group B individual. 2T. Kuroki, personal communication. We have observed large amounts of B antigens on its cell surface, as well as high activity of B transferase in cell extracts (1.28 nmol/mg/h). Therefore, we have chosen these cells as candidates for recipients of DNA transfection assuming that enough amounts of trans-activating factors are present to support the expression of the introduced reporter constructs. We have used the electroporation method to obtain the higher transfection efficiency with the KATO III cells. pGL3-promoter vector containing the SV40 promoter, which exhibits strong activity in mammalian cells, and pGL3-basic vector without the promoter sequence were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activities in cell extracts were determined. The promoter activity of EN construct was at least 20-fold higher than that of pGL3-basic vector, and 3-fold lower than that of pGL3-promoter vector, which demonstrated the promoter activity of the 5′-upstream region of the human ABO genes (Fig. 2). To better locate the sequences essential for the transcription, we have constructed a series of the human ABO promoter-luciferase chimeric plasmids in which 5′-flanking regions of the ABO gene of different lengths were fused with the coding sequence of the luciferase gene. Theleft panel of Fig. 2 depicts the 5′-flanking region of the human ABO gene and various restriction enzyme cleavage sites used to generate the fragments subcloned into the promoterless luciferase vector. Deletion of the human ABO gene upstream region from position −3950 to −3252, −2984, −2109, −1685, −1493, or −666 resulted in a large decrease in luciferase activity, demonstrating that the important sequences for the ABO gene transcription were contained within the deleted regions. The strongest decreasing effect appeared to be related to the deletion of the sequence between −3950 and −3252 containing 4 tandem copies of a 43-bp repeat unit. Surprisingly, however, deletion of the sequence from −3252 to either −202 or −117 resulted in an increase in the luciferase activity, suggesting that negative element(s) for the ABO gene transcription were present within this deleted region (−666 to −117). Furthermore, deletion of the sequence from −117 to −35 resulted in a large decrease in luciferase activity, showing the importance of promoter sequences immediately upstream of the transcription start site (cap site) in ABO gene expression. Sequence inspection of the region proximal to the cap site revealed potential binding sites for the regulatory protein Sp1. Taken together, two regions (−3950 to −3253 and −117 to +31) appear to function as positive regulatory cis-elements for the transcription of ABO genes in KATO III cells, whereas negative elements seem to exist in the region between −3252 and −118. To further examine the promoter activity of the region between −3950 and +31, an internal deletion downstream of the XmnI site at −3252 was introduced. The −3950 upstream terminus was chosen, because the maximum reporter activity was observed with the construct PN containing the region between the PflMI site at −3950 and the NcoI site at +31 as shown in Fig. 2. An internal deletion located between the XmnI site at −3251 and the SacII site at −118 (construct PXm/SN) was constructed by introducing the PflMI/XmnI fragment in SN construct. Transfection of construct PXm/SN into KATO III cells showed a 21-fold higher luciferase activity than did that of construct PN (Fig. 3). This result with the internal deletion seemed consistent with those obtained with upstream end deletions confirming the presence of positive elements for transcription in the PflMI/XmnI fragment. The sequence immediately upstream of the cap site (−666 to −117) seemed to be sufficient for the repression of the ABO cap site-proximal promoter activity in constructs XhN and KN. To examine whether additional regions are involved in the repression of the ABO cap site-proximal promoter activity in the construct XmN, the fragment between the XmnI site at −3252 and the PstI site at −2371 was inserted into downstream of the SV40 enhancer in construct SV/SV-XmPst. Addition of this fragment resulted in a loss of 30% in luciferase activity (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that other negative cis-element(s) are present in the region between the XmnI and the SacII sites. We have obtained another result to support the presence of positive enhancer elements within the −3950 to −3252 sequence. When the PflMI-to-XmnI (PXm) fragment was separated from the ABO promoter-proximal sequence and linked directly to the SV40 promoter of pGL3-promoter vector (PXm/SV construct in Fig. 3), this construct expressed an 18-fold increase in luciferase activity when compared with the original vector without this fragment. Several additional constructs were prepared from the PXm/SV plasmid and used for the further characterization of the ABO enhancer region. The sequence located between −3899 and −3618 appeared to be a significant functional component. Presence of additional sequence between −3617 and −3470 in construct −3899H/SV yielded a reduced activity, which implicated the presence of a negative regulatory element in the sequence. In agreem"
https://openalex.org/W2148692401,"Kvβ subunits have been shown to affect kinetic properties of voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1α subunits and increase the number of cell surface dendrotoxin-binding sites when coexpressed with Kv1.2. Here, we show that Kvβ1.2 alters both current expression and gating of Kvα1 channels and that each effect is mediated by a distinct Kvβ1.2 domain. The Kvβ1.2 N terminus or Kvα1-blocking domain introduced steady state current block, an apparent negative shift in steady state activation, and a slowing of deactivation along with a dramatic reduction in single channel open probability. N-terminal deletions of Kvβ1.2 no longer altered channel kinetics but promoted dramatic increases in Kv1.2 current. The conserved Kvβ1 C terminus or Kvα1 expression domain alone was sufficient to increase the number of functional channels. The same effect was observed with the normally noninactivating subunit, Kvβ2. By contrast, Kv1.5 currents were reduced when coexpressed with either the Kvβ1 C terminus or Kvβ2, indicating that the Kvα1 expression domain has Kvα1 isoform-specific effects. Our results demonstrate that Kvβ subunits consist of two domains that are separable on the basis of both primary structure and functional modulation of voltage-gated K+ channels. Kvβ subunits have been shown to affect kinetic properties of voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1α subunits and increase the number of cell surface dendrotoxin-binding sites when coexpressed with Kv1.2. Here, we show that Kvβ1.2 alters both current expression and gating of Kvα1 channels and that each effect is mediated by a distinct Kvβ1.2 domain.

Our results demonstrate that Kvβ subunits consist of two domains that are separable on the basis of both primary structure and functional modulation of voltage-gated K+ channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels consist of pore-forming α-subunits (Kvα) complexed with modulatory Kvβ subunits. For channels in the Kv1 subfamily, a number of related Kvβ subunits have been cloned and shown to specifically modulate currents generated by Kvα1 subunits in heterologous expression systems. A variety of Kvβ subunits have been cloned from brain (1Scott V.E.S. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All Kvβ subunits are predicted to be cytoplasmic proteins and can be separated into two domains: N terminus and C terminus. The homology among subfamilies resides in the C terminus, which constitutes the majority of the protein and is responsible for binding to the Kvα1 N terminus (8Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol.

These subunits share conserved C-terminal domains of 329 amino acids attached to unique N-terminal domains ranging from 72 to 91 residues. Kvβ subunits have dual effects on Kvα1 subunit currents. The three Kvβ1 isoforms, as well as Kvβ3, introduce inactivation into Kvα1 subunit currents but with variable potency (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 3Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z.

The Kvβ1 N termini are thought to produce inactivation by acting like a ball peptide to mimic N-type inactivation (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of Kvβ1.2 with Kv1.5 has also been shown to shift the activation curve to more negative voltages and to increase the time constant of deactivation (6England S.K. Uebele V.N. Shear H. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6309-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), although these effects may be secondary to open channel block (11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Kvβ2 subunits do not alter the inactivation or deactivation properties of coexpressed Kvα1 subunits but do shift activation kinetics of Kv1.5 to more negative voltages (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 12Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.-R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. 1996; 493.3: 625-633Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recently, Kvβ subunits were shown to increase the surface expression of Kv1.2 as measured by an increase in dendrotoxin-binding sites at the plasma membrane of transfected cells (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this increase as well as the Kvβ subunit domain responsible for this effect have not been determined. TheDrosophila Kvβ subunit encoded by the hyperkinetic locus has also been shown to alter both the kinetics and current amplitude of Shaker Kvα subunits (14Chouinard S.W. Wilson G.F. Schlimgen A.K. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6763-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the increase results from alterations in intrinsic inactivation or functional expression. Interestingly, a recent report found that Kvβ2 did not increase the surface expression of Shaker channels, although the two proteins were found to associate in the endoplasmic reticulum (15Nagaya N. Papazian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have examined the functional consequences of Kvβ1 assembly with Kvα1 channels and determined the Kvβ1 domains responsible. We show that the Kvβ1.2 C terminus (Kvβ1-C) as well as Kvβ2 produce dramatic increases in Kv1.2 currents when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. This increase in functional expression is due to an increase in the number of functional channels and not by alterations in single channel properties. In contrast, Kv1.5 currents show a dramatic decrease upon coexpression with Kvβ1-C, indicating that the nature of the expression effect is Kvα1 isoform-dependent. All kinetic effects of Kvβ1.2 can be explained by open channel block of Kv1.2 by the Kvβ N terminus. Thus, our studies of noninactivating Kvα1 channels have demonstrated that Kvβ1.2 consists of two functional domains: a Kvα1-blocking domain located in the first 20 amino acids of the N terminus and a Kvα1 expression domain consisting of the entire C terminus. The Kv1.2 cDNA was a gift from O. Pongs. HERG cDNA was kindly provided by M. Keating. Kvβ1.2 was cloned as described previously (4Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Kvβ2 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR 1The abbreviation used is: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. from rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. Protein-protein interactions were monitored with the yeast GAL-4 Matchmaker Two-hybrid System fromCLONTECH. In-frame EcoRI and SalI sites were incorporated into the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the coding sequences of Kvβ1.2 (amino acids 1–408), Kvβ2 (amino acids 1–367), Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 (amino acids 21–408), and Kvβ1.2-C terminus (amino acids 81–408) by PCR for cloning into the yeast shuttle vectors, pGBT9 and pGAD424. Constructs generating fusion proteins with the N terminus of Kv1.2 (Kv1.2-N; amino acids 1–124) were also made. The PCR-amplified constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame for the yeast fusions and check that no unwanted PCR mutations were introduced. Protein-protein interactions were tested in the yeast host strainY190 by cotransformation with pairs of pGBT9 and pGAD424 fusion constructs. Cotransformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan (trp−) and leucine (leu −) after growth for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Representative colonies from these transformations were replated ontrp−/leu− medium to allow direct comparison of individual colonies. Transcription of the reporter gene, lacZ, was tested by a β-galactosidase filter assay. Kv1.2, Kv1.5, and Kv1.4-ΔN2–146 cRNAs were prepared as described previously (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ2 were subcloned into pSP64 (Promega) for cRNA synthesis. The Kvβ1.2-C terminus was subcloned into a modified version of pCRII, A+-pCRII, which we had previously altered to include a poly(A)+ tail (16Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Caporaso R. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 264: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For oocyte expression, the Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 construct was removed from the yeast vector, pGBT9, by digestion with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into a modified version of pSP64. The modified pSP64 vector was constructed as follows: an adaptor containing a Kozak concensus sequence for initiation of translation followed by an ATG start codon and anEcoRI site was ligated into the HindIII and PstI sites of the multiple cloning region of pSP64. TheHindIII site was destroyed in this ligation. In addition, the EcoRI site following the poly(A)+ tail in pSP64 was deleted, and a HindIII site was inserted by ligation of an adaptor. The EcoRI/SalI insert from the yeast vector was then subcloned into the new EcoRI site and the downstream SalI site. As a result, the Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 construct for oocyte expression has three amino acids, Met, Glu, and Phe, preceding amino acid number 21 of Kvβ1.2 sequence. Constructs in the pSP64 and A+-pCRII vectors were linearized with EcoRI and BamHI, respectively, and transcribed into cRNA with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) using SP6 or T7 polymerase as required. cRNA concentrations were estimated on denaturing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide by comparison with RNA standards. RNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes as described previously (4Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Measurement of Xenopus oocyte currents were performed using the standard two microelectrode voltage clamp technique. For comparison of whole cell current amplitudes, all measurements were done 3 days post-injection. 2–4 days after injection, single channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration using pipettes pulled from hard borosilicate glass with resistances of 5–10 MΩ. Pipettes were coated with Sylgard and fire-polished immediately before use. The seal resistance was 50–500 GΩ. Xenopus oocytes were always patched on the dark hemisphere. Two microelectrode voltage clamp measurements of Xenopusoocytes were performed in a low K+ solution containing (in mmol/liter): 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3) or a high K+solution containing 50 KOH, 72.5 NMDG, 122.5 MES and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). The pipette solution for the single channel recordings had the low K+ composition. The bath solution in all single channel measurements contained (in mmol/liter): 100 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). All measurements were done at room temperature (20 °C). Data were low pass filtered at 2 kHz (−3dB, 4-pole Bessel filter) before digitalization at 10 kHz. PClamp software (Axon Instruments) was used for generation of the voltage-pulse protocols and for data acquisition. All single channel measurements were leak subtracted in Fetchan and analyzed using TRANSIT software (17VanDongen A.M.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This produced histograms for the open time, ensemble current traces, and values of open probability. The maximum likelihood method is utilized by TRANSIT to determine time constants from open time histograms. The data for open time from TRANSIT are presented on a log scale as described previously (17VanDongen A.M.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Single channel parameters were given as the means ± S.D. After forming a giga-seal, single channel I-V protocols were performed to ensure that the investigated channel had the expected activation threshold and reversal potential (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Measurements with only one channel in the patch were used for further investigation. From a holding potential of −80 mV, we measured 1000 test pulses to a potential of 70 mV at a frequency of 2 per second. Leak subtraction was done by averaging 10 null records and subtracting it from each trace as described previously (18Kiehn J. Lacerda A.E. Wible B. Brown A.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of distinct Kvβ subunit domains on Kv1 channels, we constructed noninactivating forms of Kvβ1.2 by deleting either 20 or 79 amino acids from the N terminus. In the deletion lacking the first 20 amino acids (Kvβ1.2-NΔ20), one of two stretches in the N terminus suggested previously to contain a “ball” peptide sequence was deleted (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of 79 amino acids removed the entire N terminus, leaving the conserved Kvβ1-C terminus. These deletions did not affect the ability of Kvβ1.2 to bind to the Kv1.2 N terminus as assessed with the yeast two hybrid system (Fig. 1). Kvβ2, which has a C-terminal domain highly homologous to Kvβ1, also interacted with the N terminus of Kv1.2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Because the C terminus of Kvβ subunits confers the ability to interact with the N terminus of Kvα1 subunits, we examined the functional consequences of the interaction between truncated Kvβ subunits and Kv1.2 channels. The properties of whole cell Kv1.2 currents were examined upon coexpression with full-length Kvβ1.2 and N-terminal deletion mutants in Xenopus oocytes. Kv1.2 alone produced noninactivating currents (Fig. 2 A). Co-expression of Kv1.2 cRNA with saturating amounts of Kvβ1.2 cRNA resulted in currents exhibiting partial inactivation (Fig.2 B) as described previously (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As predicted, coexpression of Kv1.2 with saturating amounts of Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 produced noninactivating currents (Fig. 2 C). In addition, we observed a dramatic increase in the amplitude of Kv1.2 currents with the truncated Kvβ subunit. When Kv1.2 was coexpressed with Kvβ1.2-NΔ20, the current amplitude increased by a factor of 6.4 ± 2.6 (n = 4–11 eggs in each group in five injection series) compared with Kv1.2 alone (Fig. 2 C). Fig.2 D shows the summary of steady state current amplitudes obtained in one series of measurements (n = 5–11 eggs in each group). Because the amount of Kv1.2 cRNA injected remained constant in each case, it appeared that the truncated Kvβ subunit increased the functional expression of Kv1.2 channels. This effect was largely masked with the wild-type Kvβ1.2 subunit because of the open channel block conferred by the Kvβ1.2 N terminus. To determine whether this property could be further localized on the Kvβ subunit, we tested the effects of the Kvβ1 C terminus on Kv1.2 currents. The Kvβ1 C terminus did not alter the inactivation properties of Kv1.2 (not shown) but did result in a significant increase (about 5-fold) in the amplitude of Kv1.2 currents when cRNAs were coinjected in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.3). Yeast two-hybrid experiments showing the binding of Kvβ1-C to the N terminus of Kv1.2 strongly suggest that the dramatic increase in functional surface expression of this channel is due to the direct interaction of these subunits. Coexpression of Kv1.2 with either Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 or Kvβ1-C increased current amplitudes to similar extents, by factors of 4.19 and 4.18, respectively (n = 4–5 oocytes in one injection series). This indicates that the Kvα1 expression domain consists of the Kvβ C terminus alone. Coinjection of saturating amounts of a normally noninactivating Kvβ subunit, Kvβ2, produced similar results (Fig. 3). The high degree of homology between the C-terminal domains of Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 subunits is reflected in the similar amplitude increases elicited by the two subunits. The increase in current amplitude occurred in both low K+(5 mm) and high K+ (50 mm) solutions ruling out external K+ as the major cause of the increase in the maximal conductance. As a test for specificity, we coexpressed Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 with HERG, the K+channel responsible for the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current in human heart. In two injection series, we found no significant changes in kinetics or current amplitude when HERG was coexpressed with Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 (data not shown). To determine the mechanism by which the Kvβ1 C terminus increased functional expression, we compared the single channel properties of Kv1.2 alone and in the presence of Kvβ1.2 or the noninactivating Kvβ1.2-NΔ20. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the properties of single Kv1.2 channels are altered by Kvβ1.2 (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These were confirmed here at a test potential of +70 mV and compared with single channel measurements of Kv1.2 and Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 to see whether the mutant Kvβ altered single channel properties. Kv1.2 cRNA injected alone produced single channels with openings in the outward direction, short closures, and a mean amplitude of 1.49 ± 0.10 pA (n = 7). The channels were open and showed no apparent inactivation (Fig. 4 A). The open time distribution was fitted with a single exponential to give an open time of 4.1 ms (Fig. 4 D). The open probability (P o) distribution gave a mean of 0.81 and showed virtually no inactivation as well (Fig. 4 G). From seven patches, the mean open time (t) was 3.91 ± 0.23 ms, and the P o was 0.80 ± 0.03. Expression of Kv1.2 with Kvβ1.2 resulted in single channels with completely different kinetics as described previously. Channels opened frequently in the beginning of the trace followed by long closures before reopening (Fig. 4 B). The amplitude of the openings was reduced to 1.13 ± 0.14 pA (n = 8), presumably because blocking events happened very fast, preventing the channels from reaching full amplitude under our recording conditions. Subsequently, the mean open time decreased to 0.59 ms, and the mean open probability was reduced dramatically to 0.05 (Fig. 4, E and H). The mean of eight patches gave the following values:t = 0.66 ± 0.08 and P o = 0.08 ± 0.02. When Kv1.2 was coexpressed with Kvβ1.2-NΔ20, we observed single channels with similar properties to Kv1.2 alone (Fig. 4, compareC and A). The amplitude was 1.52 ± 0.13 (n = 6). Also, the open time distribution (t = 4.1 ms) and mean open probability (0.82) were very similar. For six patches, the values were: t = 3.85 ± 0.30 ms and P o = 0.82 ± 0.02. Because of the similarity in single channel parameters, we conclude that the increase in functional expression of Kv1.2 by Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 must be due to an increase in the number of functional channels. The deletion experiments indicated that inactivation of Kv1.2 currents by Kvβ1.2 was due to residues within the first 20 amino acids of Kvβ1.2. These 20 amino acids constitute a putative ball in the proposed ”ball and chain“ model of inactivation of Kvα1 subunits by Kvβ1 subunits (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 4Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Modeling studies have suggested that the open channel blocking action of Kvβ1.2 is responsible for the observed negative shift in steady state activation and the slowing of deactivation of Kv1.5 (11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, removal of the ball from Kvβ1.2 would be expected to eliminate alterations in activation and deactivation as well as inactivation. To test this, activation curves of Kv1.2 were generated in the absence and the presence of inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits (Fig.5 A). In the presence of Kvβ1.2, Kv1.2 currents exhibited a leftward shift of almost 12 mV in the activation curve compared with Kv1.2 expressed alone (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, neither of the noninactivating Kvβ fragments, the Kvβ1 C terminus nor Kvβ2, produced any significant changes in the activation curve of Kv1.2. Similarly, deactivation of Kv1.2 was significantly slowed in the presence of Kvβ1.2 but neither the Kvβ1 C terminus nor Kvβ2 produced large changes in deactivation compared with Kv1.2 alone (Fig.5 B). Furthermore, neither the Kvβ1 C terminus nor Kvβ2 produced any significant changes in the activation time constants of Kv1.2 (data not shown). Therefore, the kinetic changes in Kv1.2 currents that have been observed in the presence of Kvβ1.2 are due to the presence of a functional ball peptide on the Kvβ N terminus plugging the Kv1.2 pore. When the Kvβ1.2 N terminus is removed or when the normally noninactivating Kvβ2 subunit is tested, the kinetics of Kv1.2 are unaltered even though the current amplitudes are dramatically increased (see Fig. 3). Thus, there is a clear separation in functional effects between the structurally distinct Kvβ1.2 N- and C-terminal domains. To quantify the block by the Kvβ1.2 N terminus, we initially considered fractional block or inactivation as the difference between peak current and steady state current divided by the peak current as done previously (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar). The fractional block is plotted as a function of Kvβ1.2 concentration in Fig. 6 A. A maximal peak to steady state inactivation of 0.66 was determined similar to results reported previously (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A problem with this method is that it implies that 34% of the total current remained unblocked. This is clearly not consistent with single channel measurements, which show that the open probability was reduced to 0.08 in the presence of Kvβ1.2. We assumed that this inconsistency was due to a reduction in the peak current, masked by the dramatic concomitant increase produced by Kvβ1-C, thereby overestimating the amount of sustained outward current. A more accurate measure of the blocking effect of Kvβ1.2 was determined from the steady state currents to eliminate bias of current block due to normalization with the peak current. First, we measured the steady state current levels as a function of Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 and Kvβ1.2 cRNA concentrations (Fig. 6 B). We then assumed that the steady state current in the presence of Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 reflected the current amplitude that would be measured in the presence of Kvβ1.2 if there were no block. The amount of steady state current block at each concentration of RNA was then calculated in the following way, I ss current block = (meanI ss Kvβ1.2NΔ20 − meanI ss Kvβ1.2)/mean I ssKvβ1.2NΔ20, where I ss is the steady state current amplitude. The relation of steady state current blockversus concentration is shown in Fig. 6 C. The maximum fractional current block determined in this way was 0.94. This is much greater than the maximum block of 0.66 estimated from the ratio of peak to steady state in Fig. 6 A. The maximal fractional current block determined by both methods saturates at 100 ng/μl. The saturation point is not affected by normalization with the peak. The single channel studies support the large reduction in current produced by Kvβ1.2 determined above. The maximal block of Kv1.2 by the N-terminal domain of Kvβ1.2 can be calculated from the change in open probability from 0.8, in the presence of the noninactivating Kvβ1.2-NΔ20, to 0.08, in the presence of Kvβ1.2 as follows, maximum block = fractional change in open probability = (0.8 − 0.08)/0.8 = 0.90. This value is much higher than was predicted by previous macroscopic current data, which suggested a maximal block of only 60–70% based on peak to steady state current (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the value of 0.90 is very close to the value of 0.94 determined from fractional steady state current block (Fig.6 C, shown above). The single channel and macroscopic data confirm that the N-terminal domain of Kvβ1.2 is able to block much more available outward current than previously suspected and significantly reduce the peak current as suggested previously (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This also implies that even small amounts of an inactivating Kvβ subunit like Kvβ1.2 in channel complexes could result in significant reductions in open probability and outward current. We have demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains of Kvβ1.2 produce distinct effects on Kv1.2. Previous studies have shown that Kvβ1 subunits, by virtue of their N-terminal domains, produce various kinetic alterations in expressed Kv1.5 currents similar to those we found with Kv1.2 (4Majumder K.

We asked whether Kvβ1-C would also enhance Kv1.5 expression as observed with Kv1.2. Surprisingly, Kv1.5 currents were significantly decreased upon coexpression with Kvβ1-C as shown in Fig.7 A, where comparisons were made directly with Kv1.2. In four injection series, average Kv1.5 current levels decreased from 9.31 ± 0.94 μA (n= 31) to 3.24 ± 0.32 μA (n = 31) when expressed with the Kvβ1-C terminus. A decrease in Kv1.5 current levels was also noted upon coexpression with Kvβ2 (Fig. 7 B). These data show that the Kvα1 expression domain of Kvβ1 can produce different and even opposite effects on different Kvα1 subunits. This differs from the Kvα1-blocking domain, which effectively blocks Kvα1 subunit currents, although the potency with which different N-terminal domains introduce block may vary (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Kvβ subunits have multiple effects on voltage-gated channels of the Kv1 subfamily. Our results show that Kvβ1.2 can be divided into two structural and functional domains, one of which, the N terminus, acts as the Kvα1-blocking domain by producing inactivation. Here we have shown that the Kvβ1 C terminus alone is able to bind to the Kvα1 subunit and promote the alteration of current expression. Thus, the Kvβ1-C terminus acts as the Kvα1 expression domain. Coexpression of N-terminal Kvβ1.2 deletion mutants with Kv1.2 resulted in noninactivating currents and increased current amplitude (up to 14-fold). Single channel amplitude and open probability were not affected by coexpression of Kv1.2 with the deletion mutant Kvβ1.2-NΔ20. Therefore, the observed increase in whole cell current amplitude was due to an increased number of functional channels in the membrane. An increase in the number of functional Kv1.2 channels must occur because the single channel open probability of Kv1.2 determined here and previously (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is approximately 0.8, yet the increase in Kv1.2 currents by noninactivating Kvβ1.2 deletions was at least 4-fold. This increase is in agreement with experiments in mammalian cells showing enhanced transport of Kv1.2 channels to the membrane in the presence of Kvβ subunits (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid interaction data presented here and previously (8Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggest that the increase in current results from a direct interaction between the subunits and have shown that the regions critical for interaction are located in the N terminus of Kvα1 subunits and the Kvβ subunit C terminus. This is in agreement with coimmunoprecipitation studies indicating that the interaction of Kvβ subunits with Kv1α subunits does not require the Kvβ N-terminal domain (19Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7084-7089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Macroscopic and single channel data have shown that the first 20 amino acids of the N terminus of Kvβ1.2 contain the β-ball peptide. This domain introduces current block (inactivation) as originally proposed based on homology with Kvβ1.1 (4Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, the deletion of 34 amino acids from the N terminus of Kvβ1.1, a subunit that normally confers inactivation upon noninactivating K+ channels, resulted in a loss of inactivation (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Previous experiments suggested that Kvβ1.2 not only introduces inactivation but shifts activation kinetics to more negative voltages and increases deactivation time constants of Kv1.1 and Kv1.5 (7England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar, 12Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.-R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. 1996; 493.3: 625-633Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Modeling studies have suggested that the changes in activation and deactivation of Kv1.5 currents, like inactivation, are a result of the open channel block of Kvβ1.2 (11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar). Our data with Kv1.2 are consistent with this interpretation because the removal of 20 or more amino acids from the N terminus of Kvβ1.2 not only removed inactivation completely but also eliminated changes in activation and deactivation kinetics. We found the true maximal fractional current block of Kv1.2 by Kvβ1.2 to be 0.94, much greater than 0.66, which was determined from the ratio of steady state to peak current (also called “inactivation”; see 2, 9). The discrepancy between these values can be explained by a rapid open channel block (9Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Accili E.A. Wible B.A. Fedida D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 41): H2932-H2941PubMed Google Scholar), which reduces the peak current leading to an underestimation of current block produced by Kvβ1.2 when calculated as a fraction of the peak current. Significant fractional block, as estimated from the ratio of steady state currents, can occur in the absence of any apparent inactivation as estimated from the ratio of steady state to peak current. Hence, the ratio of steady state to peak current is not a reliable indication of current block. Kvβ2, a noninactivating Kvβ subunit, resembles the Kvβ1 C terminus with respect to functional modifications of Kvα1 currents. As for Kvβ1-C, we observed large increases in current expression and little change in the kinetic parameters of Kv1.2 channels with Kvβ2. Kvβ2 also promoted dramatic decreases in Kv1.5 current expression. In yeast two-hybrid assays, Kvβ2 was also shown to interact with the N termini of Kv1.2 and Kv1.5. These results were not unexpected because there is extensive homology in the C-terminal domains of all Kvβ subunits. A recent report showing that Kvβ2 and Kvβ1 bind to the same region on the Shaker N terminus emphasizes the similarity in the two subunits (20Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the Kvβ1 subfamily, a function for the Kvβ2 N terminus has not been described. Surprisingly, the C terminus of Kvβ1 produced a significant decrease in Kv1.5 current levels in contrast to the dramatic increase observed with Kv1.2. Thus, the action of the Kvα1 expression domain apparently differs depending upon the particular Kvα1 subunit it is complexed with. The origin of these differences are presently unknown. Surface expression of Kv1.1, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6, in addition to Kv1.2, were all shown to increase upon coexpression with Kvβ2 but to a lesser extent than Kv1.2 (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In contrast, the rate of maturation of Shaker channels actually decreased when coexpressed with Kvβ2 (15Nagaya N. Papazian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, Shakersubunits are fully glycosylated and transferred to the Golgi apparatus in the absence of Kvβ subunits (21Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) unlike Kv1.2, which is poorly glycosylated and found predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Taken together, this would suggest that Kv1.2, Kv1.1, Kv1.3, and Kv1.6 subunits exist predominantly in an immature form in the absence of Kvβ subunits compared with Kv1.5 and Shaker. Kvβ subunits would then promote transit of the former group to the cell surface resulting in increased expression. This hypothesis would not, however, explain the decrease in Kv1.5 expression we observed or the decrease in maturation of Shaker channels in the presence of Kvβ2 (15Nagaya N. Papazian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The decrease in functional expression of Kv1.5 may be due to a nonspecific competition for factors required for expression between Kv1.5 and Kvβ as suggested for Shaker (15Nagaya N. Papazian D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or may be due to other mechanisms specific to Kv1.5-Kvβ interactions. Quantitative differences in Kvα-Kvβ interactions may also exist that contribute to the functional differences described. For example, Nakahira et al. (19Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7084-7089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that significantly less Kv1.5 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with anti Kvβ subunit antibodies compared with Kv1.2, possibly because of a lower affinity between Kvβ and Kv1.5 subunits. In summary, cytoplasmic Kvβ subunits affect Kvα1 channels in two ways through distinct protein domains. The Kvβ C terminus, which is highly conserved among all subfamilies of Kvβ subunits thus far described, acts as a Kvα1 expression domain, and in the case of Kv1.2, increases the number of functional channels at the cell surface. Further experiments will be required to determine the origin of the decrease in Kv1.5 expression mediated by this domain. For Kv1.2, all of the apparent kinetic alterations can be attributed to the variable Kvβ1 N-terminal domains. Because all Kvβ subunits share similar C-terminal regions, it is tempting to speculate that their original association with ion channels served to modulate K+currents through alteration of expression. Kvβ2, for example, promotes alterations in expression, but the N terminus apparently does not alter channel kinetics. Distinct Kvβ isoforms with unique N-terminal domains might then have evolved to fine tune channel function. Together, these considerations suggest that the relative levels of distinct Kvα1 and Kvβ subunits within a cell will have profound consequences on the composition and properties of native K+ channel complexes.

Here, we show the biochemical isolation of two forms of core subassemblies, one containing Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11 and the other containing Rpb10 in addition to these three core subunits. We also show DNA binding activity for free Rpb1 and the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 complex in aqueous solution. Plasmid pBS-rpb1H-ura4 (see Fig. 1 A) was used to construct a His-taggedrpb1 strain of S. pombe.

Oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction were synthesized to generate a NheI site and anApaI site at codons 1556–1557 and 1559–1560, respectively, and a HindIII site 287 base pairs downstream of the termination codon. By ligating three polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments, each corresponding to the KpnI-ApaI, ApaI-HindIII, orHindIII-PstI region, a 1.5-kbKpnI-PstI fragment covering the rpb1C-terminal portion and 3′-noncoding region was generated and introduced into pBluescript KS+.

Finally, a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex with the sequence corresponding to the 10-histidine codon sequence was inserted between the NheI and ApaI sites. pUC-rpb3H-ura4 (see Fig. 1 B) was the plasmid used to make a His-tagged rpb3 strain.

Two polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments, each corresponding to the KpnI-ApaI or ApaI-EcoRI region, were ligated, and the resultant 1.3-kbKpnI-EcoRI fragment covering the 5′-noncoding region and the N-terminal portion of rpb3 was introduced into pUC18. Three fragments, a 0.5-kb PstI-KpnI fragment covering the rpb3 5′-noncoding region, a 0.5-kbEcoRI-EcoRV fragment covering the rpb3C-terminal portion and 3′-noncoding region with a linker sequence at the EcoRV terminus, and aHindIII-HindIII ura4 fragment, were inserted stepwise into the resultant plasmid. Finally, a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex with the 10-histidine codon sequence was inserted between the NheI and ApaI sites. The His-tagged rpb1 strain was constructed by one-step gene replacement. The plasmid pBS-rpb1H-ura4 (see Fig. 1 A) was digested with KpnI and PstI and then introduced into strain JY741 (h − ade6-M216 ura4-D18 leu1). ura4 + transformants were isolated and examined for the presence of the His tag sequence by polymerase chain reaction and for the absence of an extra copy of rpb1by Southern blotting. The His-tagged rpb3 strain was constructed by a two-step method. The plasmid pUC-rpb3H-ura4 (see Fig.1 B) was digested with KpnI and introduced into JY741. The resulting ura4 + transformant was plated onto a 5-fluoroorotic acid plate. 5-Fluoroorotic acid-resistant colonies were confirmed for the presence of the His tag sequence and for the absence of an extra copy of rpb3. The strains constructed as described above were grown at 30 °C in YE (plus Ade and Ura) medium to 5 × 107 cells/ml and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in a 2 × cell volume of 1.5 × buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 0.25 μg/ml antipain) and disrupted with Mini Lab high-pressure homogenizer (Rannie Inc.). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 0.01 volume of 10% polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2m (NH4)2SO4. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by 60% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in TGM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and loaded onto a Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with a 20 × column volume of TGM buffer containing 0.3 m(NH4)2SO4 and 20 mmimidazole and successively with a 4 × column volume of TGM buffer containing 0.3 m(NH4)2SO4 and 50 mmimidazole. The proteins were eluted with TGM buffer containing 0.3m (NH4)2SO4 and 100 mm imidazole and, after dilution with TGM buffer to reduce the (NH4)2SO4 concentration to 0.1m, loaded onto a Protein-Pak G-DEAE high performance liquid chromatography column (Waters) equilibrated with TGM buffer containing 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6 m(NH4)2SO4 in the same buffer. Fractions containing pol II were stored at −80 °C. Ten μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was added to the purified pol II fraction containing 20 μg of proteins and mixed gently at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 1 min and washed with TGM buffer containing 0.15 m(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmimidazole, and increasing concentrations of urea or guanidium hydrochloride. The resin was suspended in the respective buffer containing the same concentration of denaturants as used for washing, incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed with the same buffer twice and successively twice with TGM buffer containing 0.15m (NH4)2SO4 and 20 mm imidazole. The proteins remaining bound to the resin were eluted with TGM buffer containing 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4 and 150 mmimidazole and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The assay of nonspecific DNA-dependent RNA synthesis activity was carried out as described previously (22Azuma Y. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3749-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Rpb2 to Rpb12 were raised in rabbits immunized with each of the full-length recombinant proteins. 3A. Ishiguro, M. Kimura, and A. Ishihama, manuscript in preparation. To detect Rpb1, the anti-carboxyl-terminal domain monoclonal antibody 8WG16 was used. Western blotting was carried out and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Partially dissociated pol II complexes were applied onto a Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 column at a flow rate of 40 μl/min in buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA at 4 °C using Smart System (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fractions of 50 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HaeIII-digested salmon testis DNA was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of less than stoichiometric amounts of [γ-32P]ATP, and purified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column. One μg of the labeled DNA and appropriate amounts of pol II or the subassembly were mixed in the assay buffer for RNA polymerase activity and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. In the competition assay, 5 μg of unlabeled DNA was included in addition to the labeled DNA. The mixture was filtrated through a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP00024) presoaked in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA using a vacuum apparatus and washed with the same buffer. Radioactivity on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. To isolate not only fully assembled pol II, but also its subassemblies from S. pombe, we introduced a histidine cluster tag sequence into the chromosomalrpb1 or rpb3 gene. In the case of rpb1, the tag was inserted immediately upstream of the carboxyl-terminal domain (Fig.1 A) because a proteinase cleavage sequence can be inserted in this position of S. cerevisiae RPB1 (27Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2362-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of rpb3, the tag sequence was inserted to fuse the His tag at the N terminus of Rpb3 (Fig. 1 B), the site where the hemagglutinin tag could be inserted in S. cerevisiae RPB3 (12Kolodziej P.A. Woychik N. Liao S.-M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). From both of the S. pombe variants carrying the modified rpb1 or rpb3 gene, pol II was effectively purified by a combination of Ni2+ affinity chromatography and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). In agreement with our previous purification by a conventional method, purified pol II consists of 10 species of subunit lacking two components corresponding to S. cerevisiae RPB4 and RPB9 (Fig.2). Purified pol II was refixed on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, and the complexes were treated with increasing concentrations of urea or guanidium hydrochloride. After washing with the same dissociation buffer followed by soaking with the buffer without denaturants, the proteins retained on the resin were eluted with imidazole and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). The nature of subunits in the eluted fractions was identified by Western blotting using specific antibodies against each subunit (Fig.2 B). Upon treatment with 2 m urea buffer, both pol II preparations remained intact without release of any subunit, and the enzymes eluted from the resin were as active as the control enzyme similarly treated with urea-free buffer. After treatment of Rpb1-tagged pol II with 4 m urea buffer, virtually all the subunits, except Rpb1 and a small amount of Rpb8, were dissociated (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, when pol II was fixed through His-tagged Rpb3, three core subunits (Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11) and a reduced level of Rpb10 remained bound to the Ni2+-resin even after treatment with 4 m urea. Rpb10 was clearly detected when the gel was stained with silver (Fig. 2 A,lower right panel), although it was hardly detected by Western blotting owing to the low reactivity of the anti-Rpb10 antiserum used (Fig. 2 B). Since Rpb1, Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb12, were partially retained on the pol II complex after treatment with 3 m urea buffer (data not shown), 3m is the critical concentration of urea for the dissociation of these subunits from the core assemblies. After treatment with 6 m urea buffer, Rpb10 was completely dissociated, but both Rpb2 and Rpb11 still remained bound to Rpb3. Dissociation of pol II was also examined using other protein denaturants. The same core subassembly forms were obtained by treatment with 1 m guanidium hydrochloride, 2 m KSCN, or high pH (12.5) (data not shown), indicating that the core subunit complex is resistant to a variety of denaturants. However, Rpb2 and Rpb11 were dissociated from His-tagged Rpb3 by treatment with 4m guanidium hydrochloride buffer. Purified pol II from both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe probably contains two molecules of Rpb3 (12Kolodziej P.A. Woychik N. Liao S.-M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Azuma Y. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3749-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although there is a controversy as to its stoichiometry (28Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12824-12830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of Rpb11 was estimated to be 1 as determined from the band intensity of the stained gels. Assuming the stoichiometry of Rpb3 to be 2 in S. pombe RNA polymerase II, three possibilities exist as to the molecular composition of the minimum core subassembly: (i) a single species of complex consisting of Rpb2, Rpb11, and two Rpb3 molecules; (ii) a mixture of Rpb2-Rpb3 and Rpb3-Rpb11 complexes; and (iii) a ternary complex consisting of one molecule each of the three subunits plus a free Rpb3 molecule. To identify the nature of the core assembly, the Ni2+-resin fraction was subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3). All three core subunits eluted together in high molecular mass fractions, forming a peak at fractions 10–12 with a mean molecular mass of ∼300 kDa as estimated from the elution positions of 440- and 232-kDa markers. The subassembly eluted broadly because it forms various levels of aggregates and/or it interacts weakly with the gel matrix. The apparently broader distribution of the Rpb2 subunit is due to the high staining intensity of this large protein compared with the small subunits. None of the three core subunits eluted, however, in fractions expected for the unassembled free forms. This indicates that the core subassembly is the Rpb2-(Rpb3)2-Rpb11 complex, of which the calculated molecular mass is 220 kDa. As an attempt to identify the function(s) retained in the core subassembly, we tested DNA binding activity. The isolated Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 complex and the free Rpb1 or Rpb3 subunit were subjected to a filter binding assay (Fig.4). Various amounts of tagged pol II, the subassembly, or the free subunits were incubated with radioactive double-stranded DNA fragments, and the DNA-protein complexes formed were recovered by filtration through filters. As shown in Fig.4 A, free Rpb1 and Rpb1-tagged pol II, both prepared as described for the experiment in Fig. 2, exhibited strong DNA binding activity, although the affinity of free Rpb1 was a little lower than that of pol II. The addition of unlabeled DNA to the mixture inhibited the filter binding of the labeled DNA, indicating that the observed binding is specific. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 complex exhibited DNA binding activity, even though the activity of the complex was much weaker than that of pol II containing His-tagged Rpb3. In contrast, the free Rpb3 subunit showed virtually no DNA binding. We conclude that both Rpb1 and the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 subassembly have lower levels of DNA binding activity compared with pol II. Previously, we showed subunit-subunit contact between Rpb1 and Rpb3, Rpb1 and Rpb5, Rpb2 and Rpb3, Rpb2 and Rpb5, and Rpb3 and Rpb5 by far Western blot analysis (23Miyao T. Yasui K. Sakurai H. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this work, we proved directly that three subunits (Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11) form a core subassembly that cannot be dissociated even after treatment with high concentrations of urea. The previously identified Rpb1-Rpb3, Rpb1-Rpb5, and Rpb3-Rpb5 interactions seem to be weaker than the interactions among Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11 because Rpb1 and Rpb5 were dissociated with 4 murea buffer. Likewise, small subunits except Rpb10 and Rpb11 were dissociated even though their interactions with both or either Rpb1 or Rpb2 were detected by far Western blotting or cross-linking. 4K. Yasui and A. Ishiguro, unpublished results. This core subassembly with the composition of Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 is reminiscent of the α2β complex of E. coli RNA polymerase, which is an intermediate subassembly in the following pathway: α → α2 → α2β → α2ββ′ (reviewed in Ref. 29Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys. 1981; 14: 1-35PubMed Google Scholar). The first step of the assembly is dimerization of the α subunit, and the dimeric form of the α subunit plays an important role in the subsequent pathway of β and β′ subunit assembly (30Kimura M. Fujita N. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Kimura M. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 710-718Crossref Google Scholar, 32Kimura M.

This finding is in good agreement with the sequence similarities between the β and Rpb2 subunits and between the α and Rpb3 subunits. Rpb11 also carries a sequence similar to part of the α subunit (14Woychik N.A. McKune K. Lane W.S. Young R.A. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 77-82PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ulmasov T. Larkin R.M. Guilfoyle T.J.

These findings agree with the observation that the RPB2-RPB3 complex is formed in vivo in S. cerevisiae (13Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4669-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Besides this form of core subassembly, we also isolated a complex consisting of Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb11, and Rpb10, although the stoichiometry was <1 for Rpb10. The association of Rpb10 with the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 complex is consistent with the genetic study indicating interaction among the AC40, AC19, and ABC10β subunits in S. cerevisiae (17Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The AC40 and AC19 subunits are shared between pol I and pol III and have sequence similarities to Rpb3 and Rpb11, respectively, whereas ABC10β is identical to RPB10. In this study, we also found that both the free Rpb1 subunit and the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 complex exhibit DNA binding activity, albeit at low affinity. Again, this agrees with the case of E. coli RNA polymerase. Both the free β′ subunit and the α2β complex exhibit DNA binding activity, even though free α and β subunits are virtually inactive in DNA binding (reviewed in Ref. 29Ishihama A. Adv. Biophys. 1981; 14: 1-35PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-binding component within the core subassembly may well be Rpb2 because DNA could be cross-linked to this subunit within assembled pol II (1Gundelfinger E.D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of individual subunits has so far been mapped by cross-linking or antibody inhibition using assembled pol II or by Southwestern blotting against subunits separated by PAGE (1Gundelfinger E.D. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Horikoshi M. Tamura H.O. Sekimizu K. Obinata M. Natori S. J. Biochem.

Here, we succeeded in observing the direct binding of the isolated Rpb1 protein and of the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 subassembly to DNA in aqueous solution, and thus, we could compare the DNA binding affinity among free Rpb1, the subassembly, and the pol II enzyme. As a result, it is clear that the affinity for DNA is weaker for both the Rpb1 subunit and the Rpb2-Rpb3-Rpb11 subassembly than for intact pol II, suggesting that both the Rpb1 and Rpb2 subunits in intact pol II participate in the high affinity binding of pol II to DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1972329913,"The regulation of conventional protein kinase Cs by Ca2+ was examined by determining how this cation affects the enzyme's 1) membrane binding and catalytic function and 2) conformation. In the first part, we show that significantly lower concentrations of Ca2+ are required to effect half-maximal membrane binding than to half-maximally activate the enzyme. The disparity between binding and activation kinetics is most striking for protein kinase C βII, where the concentration of Ca2+promoting half-maximal membrane binding is approximately 40-fold higher than the apparent Km for Ca2+ for activation. In addition, the Ca2+ requirement for activation of protein kinase C βII is an order of magnitude greater than that for the alternatively spliced protein kinase C βI; these isozymes differ only in 50 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, revealing that residues in the carboxyl terminus influence the enzyme's Ca2+ regulation. In the second part, we use proteases as conformational probes to show that Ca2+dependent membrane binding and Ca2+-dependent activation involve two distinct sets of structural changes in protein kinase C βII. Three separate domains spanning the entire protein participate in these conformational changes, suggesting significant interdomain interactions. A highly localized hinge motion between the regulatory and catalytic halves of the protein accompanies membrane binding; release of the carboxyl terminus accompanies the low affinity membrane binding mediated by concentrations of Ca2+ too low to promote catalysis; and exposure of the amino-terminal pseudosubstrate and masking of the carboxyl terminus accompany catalysis. In summary, these data reveal that structural determinants unique to each isozyme of protein kinase C dictate the enzyme's Ca2+-dependent affinity for acidic membranes and show that, surprisingly, some of these determinants are in the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme, distal from the Ca2+-binding site in the amino-terminal regulatory domain.

Protein kinase C is a multi-domain family of enzymes that transduces the myriad of signals resulting in phospholipid hydrolysis (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal regulatory half of the conventional isozymes comprises three functionally distinct domains as follows: 1) an intramolecular inhibitory domain, the pseudosubstrate, that occupies the active site when the enzyme is inactive; 2) two cysteine-rich domains (C1) that are each capable of binding diacylglycerol or phorbol esters; and 3) the C2 domain that binds Ca2+ and acidic phospholipids. The C1 and C2 domains function as discrete membrane-targeting motifs (4Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); binding of ligand to either domain alone can promote protein kinase C translocation to membranes, but both domains must be membrane-bound for the high affinity interaction resulting in maximal activation (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal half of the protein comprises the conserved kinase core, followed by a carboxyl-terminal region whose sequence varies among isozymes. Understanding the mechanism by which Ca2+ first recruits protein kinase C to membranes and then activates its kinase activity is essential to understanding how calcium mobilization regulates the function of protein kinase C in vivo. Although the relationship between Ca2+ effects on binding and activity has not been established, much progress has been made toward describing the effects of the cation on protein kinase C activation. Since the initial reports that lipid-stimulated activation of protein kinase C requires Ca2+ (5Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Iwasa Y. Kawahara Y. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3692-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), biochemical analyses from several laboratories have established that Ca2+ decreases the concentration of negatively charged phospholipids required for maximal activation (6Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7184-7190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or membrane binding (8Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is also well established that the Ca2+-mediated increase in affinity for acidic membranes is considerably more pronounced in the presence of diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (10Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Kikkawa U. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1218-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism for this synergy was recently found to result not from allosteric interactions between the binding sites for these two ligands but rather because each cofactor, by separate mechanisms, increases protein kinase C's affinity for phosphatidylserine (9Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol.

Thus, considerably less diacylglycerol is required to activate protein kinase C as the Ca2+ concentration is raised, and vice versa, because both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol cause tighter binding to phosphatidylserine (and it is this tight binding that results in release of the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate from the active site (13Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The dissociation constant of Ca2+ from protein kinase C has recently been estimated to be 3 mm in the absence of lipid and 0.7 μm from the protein kinase C-lipid complex (11Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme's membrane affinity has been shown to vary linearly with Ca2+ concentration from the low micromolar to the submillimolar concentration range of this cation (11Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the protein kinase C-Ca2+ complex has been reported to be 1 (11Mosior M. Epand R.M.

Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) or Sm3+ (17Grobler J.A. Essen L.-O. Williams R. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) indicate that the Ca2+-binding pocket coordinates two metal ions for the C2 domains studied; the actual affinities for each cation and whether both are bound in the presence of lipid remains to be established. Despite great advances in elucidating how Ca2+ is accommodated in the protein kinase C structure, understanding how this cation affects the function of protein kinase C awaits further biochemical characterization. This contribution examines the role of Ca2+ in regulating the membrane binding and catalytic function of protein kinase C and how these functional changes correlate with structural changes. Specifically, we show that 1) membrane binding and activation of conventional protein kinase Cs display different Ca2+requirements, with activation requiring higher concentrations of the cation than membrane binding, and 2) distinct conformational changes accompany Ca2+-dependent membrane binding and Ca2+-dependent activation. In addition, we show that determinants in the carboxyl terminus modulate protein kinase C's affinity for Ca2+.

[3H]l-α-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (30–60 Ci mmol−1) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1) were from NEN Life Science Products. Triton X-100 (10%, w/v, aqueous solution) was from Pierce.sn-1,2-Dioleoylglycerol, trypsin from bovine pancreas (1.22 × 104 BAEE units mg−1), HEPES, dithiothreitol (DTT), EGTA, trypsin inhibitor (soybean), and protamine sulfate were supplied by Sigma. Thermolysin, elastase, chymotrypsin, endoproteinases Arg-C, Asp-N, Glu-C, and Lys-C, bovine serum albumin, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) was from Midwest Scientific. Calcium chloride (analytical grade) was purchased from J. T. Baker, Inc. A protein kinase C-selective peptide substrate (Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2; (18Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)) was synthesized by the Indiana University Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 22 °C (HEPES buffer). Protein sequencing was performed by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Polyclonal antibodies against bacterially expressed catalytic domain and bacterially expressed regulatory domain of protein kinase C βII were a gift of Drs. Andrew Flint and Daniel Koshland, Jr.; a polyclonal antibody against a peptide comprising residues 645–673 of protein kinase C βII was generously provided by Lilly, and one against residues 19–32 of protein kinase C βII was from the laboratory of Dr. David S. Williams. Protein kinase C α, βI, or βII were expressed in Sf21 insect cells (Invitrogen) by infection with recombinant baculovirus (generous gifts from Robert Bell, Peter Parker, and Daniel Koshland Jr., respectively) and purified to homogeneity as described (13Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes were stored at −20 °C in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, and 50% glycerol. Sucrose-loaded vesicles (40 mol % POPS, 55 mol % POPC, and 5 mol % diacylglycerol) were prepared as described (19Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Triton X-100:lipid mixed micelles of composition 0–15 mol % brain phosphatidylserine and 5 mol % diacylglycerol were prepared as described by Newton and Koshland (20Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations in chloroform were determined by assay for phosphate concentration (21Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were diluted 10-fold into the assay mixture corresponding to 0.1% Triton X-100 and approximately 100–300 μm lipid for assays using micelles or 100 μm lipid for assays using vesicles. Protein kinase C (typically 3 nm) activity was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm; 3000 Ci mmol−1) into saturating amounts of a protein kinase C-selective peptide (50 μg ml−1) or protamine sulfate (0.2 mg ml−1) as described (13Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 6 min at 30 °C. The concentrations of CaCl2and lipid present in the assays are indicated in the figure legends. Protein kinase C (3–30 nm) was incubated with sucrose-loaded vesicles (100 μm lipid; 40 mol % POPS, 5 mol % diacylglycerol, 55 mol % POPC) and various Ca2+ concentrations in the presence of 20 mmHEPES buffer, 0.8 mm DTT, 0.3 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 500 μm EGTA, 60 mm KCl, and in the presence or absence of 5 mm MgCl2. Membrane binding was measured by determining the fraction of protein kinase C bound to sucrose-loaded vesicles after centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, 22 °C. The amount of protein kinase C in the supernatant or associated with the vesicles was measured either by assaying kinase activity toward protamine sulfate as described above or by Western blot analysis of supernatant and pellet samples. This assay takes advantage of the large increase in trypsin sensitivity of protein kinase C's hinge region that accompanies membrane binding (22Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For comparison of the two binding assay methods, protein kinase C (30 nm) was incubated under conditions described above for the centrifugation assay. Samples were treated with trypsin (0.12 units ml−1; 10 min at 30 °C), and proteolysis was quenched by addition of 0.25 volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide) followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting with protein kinase C antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of βII. Quantitative analysis of proteolysis was carried out by densitometric scanning of the intact protein kinase C bands with a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Percent of protein kinase C bound to membranes was correlated to the amount of proteolyzed protein as described (22Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C (approximately 30 nm) was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of HEPES, DTT (1 mm final concentration), CaCl2 (1 nm to 5 mm final concentration), Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v final concentration) mixed micelles containing 15 mol % brain phosphatidylserine and 5 mol % diacylglycerol and proteases (concentrations and incubation times as indicated in the figure legends). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7 or 9% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining, or in some cases, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and labeled with antibodies to protein kinase C via incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgG and detection by the formation of the insoluble product of 5-bromo-4-chloroindoyl phosphate hydrolysis. The dependence of protein kinase C binding or activity on the lipid composition of vesicles (or micelles) or the Ca2+ concentration was analyzed by a nonlinear least-squares fit to a modified Hill equation as described (20Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent association constant, K a, for binding of protein kinase C to vesicles was calculated as the fraction of protein kinase C bound to membranes divided by the product of the fraction of protein kinase C remaining in the supernatant and the total lipid concentration (19Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Concentrations of free Ca2+ were calculated using a computer program kindly provided by Dr. Claude Klee (23Jean T. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that takes into account pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, EGTA, EDTA, and ATP concentrations. Binding constants used in this program were those given by Fabiato and Fabiato (24Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence for the binding of protein kinase C βII to large unilamellar vesicles (100 μm lipid) containing phosphatidylserine (40 mol %) and diacylglycerol (5 mol %) is presented in Fig.1. Binding was detected three ways, using two independent assays, to ensure that the measured kinetics reflected properties of the protein-cofactor interaction rather than the assay system. One assay was conformation-based (○); it detects the marked increase in proteolytic sensitivity of protein kinase C's hinge region that accompanies membrane binding (approximately 100-fold increase for protein kinase C βII) (22Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second assay involved physical separation of membrane-bound protein kinase C from free protein kinase C by centrifugation (19Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the latter, the amount of membrane-bound protein kinase C was determined either from Western blot analysis (□) or activity assays using the cofactor-independent substrate protamine (▵). The only compositional difference between the two assays was the presence of trypsin in the conformation-based assay. The centrifugation assay has the advantage of being a direct measure of the membrane association, whereas the conformation-based assay has the advantage of not involving separation of free enzyme from vesicles and thus avoids potential perturbation of the equilibrium between the bound and free enzyme. Importantly, the centrifugation assay (□, ▵) and conformation-based assay (○) yielded similar results; under the conditions of the experiment, half-maximal binding to vesicles was mediated by approximately 300 nm Ca2+. At this free Ca2+ concentration, the enzyme's apparent membrane affinity was 104m−1. This affinity is comparable to that reported for the interaction of protein kinase C from rat brain with vesicles containing slightly more phosphatidylserine (50 mol %) but less diacylglycerol (1 mol %) in the presence of 1 μm Ca2+ (11Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 A compares the Ca2+ dependence for membrane binding of three conventional protein kinase Cs as follows: α (○), βII (□), and the alternatively spliced βI (▵) which differs from βII in the last 50 residues at the carboxyl terminus. The Ca2+ requirement for membrane binding differed modestly for these three isozymes; under the conditions of the assay, the concentrations of Ca2+mediating half-maximal binding ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 μmfor the three isozymes (Table I). Note that the concentration of Ca2+ resulting in half-maximal membrane binding for βII was approximately 3-fold higher in Fig.2 A (and Table I) than that in Fig. 1; this resulted from the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ in the assay in Fig. 2, which decreases the membrane surface potential and hence protein kinase C's membrane affinity (19Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Importantly, the apparent Ca2+affinity of protein kinase C βI was 3-fold higher than the apparent Ca2+ affinity of protein kinase C βII, despite the two having identical Ca2+-binding sites in the C2 domain. Furthermore, protein kinase C βI displayed a significantly higher level of Ca2+-independent membrane binding than the other two isozymes: 40% of the protein kinase C βI associated with vesicles in the absence of Ca2+, compared with 15 and 10% for protein kinase C α and βII, respectively. These results reveal that the very carboxyl-terminal residues of protein kinase C influence its Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction.Table IComparison of Ca2+ requirements for various protein kinase C isozymesIsozymeBindingActivityμmμmα0.8 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.4βII1.0 ± 0.238 ± 14βI0.31 ± 0.024.4 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab The Ca2+ requirement for activation differed significantly among isozymes, and, for two isozymes, this requirement was markedly different from the Ca2+ requirement for membrane binding (Fig. 2 B). The Ca2+ dependence for both activation and binding was similar for protein kinase C α; however, both protein kinase Cs' βI and βII required over an order of magnitude higher concentrations of Ca2+ for half-maximal activation compared with that required for half-maximal membrane binding (Table I). Conditions for the membrane binding and activity assays were identical except that bovine serum albumin (0.3 mg ml−1) was included in the binding assay (its presence in activity assays did not affect results (data not shown)) and ATP and peptide substrate were present in the activity assay (their presence in binding assays does not significantly affect protein kinase Cs' interaction with vesicles 2M. Mosior and A. C. Newton, unpublished results. ). Most strikingly, the alternatively spliced β isozymes displayed a difference in their Ca2+ requirements for activation that was even greater than the difference in their requirements for membrane binding; the apparent Km for Ca2+(for activity) was approximately 10 × higher for protein kinase C βII compared with protein kinase C βI. The Ca2+ dependence for activation was found to be sensitive to the total lipid concentration. Analysis of the data in Fig. 3 revealed that increasing the lipid concentration 10-fold resulted in a 10-fold drop in the apparentKm (from approximately 30 μm in the presence of 100 μm lipid to approximately 3 μm in the presence of 1 mm lipid). This is consistent with binding studies by Mosior and Epand (19Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showing that the interaction of protein kinase C with membranes obeys the mass action law; altering either the total lipid concentration or the total enzyme concentration affects the amount of protein kinase C that partitions with the membrane. Thus, reported Kmvalues for Ca2+ for protein kinase C are specific to particular assay conditions. The finding that protein kinase C requires different Ca2+concentrations for membrane binding and activation led us to explore whether distinct conformational changes accompany the Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction and the Ca2+-dependent activation. In a first set of experiments, we examined whether the proteolytic sensitivity of protein kinase C βII was altered with increasing Ca2+concentrations when in solution or when membrane-bound. Fig.4 shows that the trypsin sensitivity of protein kinase C βII, in the absence of lipid cofactors, was the same in the presence of 100 nm to 5 mmCa2+. Under the conditions of the assay, the enzyme was partially proteolyzed to generate the catalytic domain (approximately 45 kDa) and regulatory half (approximately 35 kDa; does not stain well by silver) (lanes 2–9). The similar degree of cleavage in lanes 2–9 reveals that the intrinsic activity of trypsin is not affected by altering the Ca2+ concentration between 100 nm and 5 mm Ca2+ (also established using BAEE as substrate, not shown). In contrast to the cleavage in the absence of lipid, incubation of protein kinase C βII with phosphatidylserine:diacylglycerol mixed micelles resulted in pronounced differences in the enzyme's proteolytic sensitivity as the Ca2+ concentration was raised. Two sets of changes in proteolytic rates or proteolytic fragments produced were observed. First, at Ca2+concentrations sufficient to effect membrane binding, but not activation, the enzyme was markedly more sensitive to proteolysis at the hinge region as assessed by the increased generation of the catalytic domain (compare lane 11 (100 nmCa2+; no binding) with lanes 12 and 13 (1 and 10 μm Ca2+; under the conditions of this assay, half-maximal binding required 1 μm Ca2+)). In the presence of Ca2+ concentrations too low to effect membrane binding (100 nm Ca2+), the enzyme was proteolyzed at a similar rate as in the absence of lipid (note that the trypsin concentration in lanes 11–18 (plus lipid) was 10-fold lower than in lanes 2–9 (no lipid)). This change in proteolytic sensitivity is the well-characterized exposure of the hinge region upon membrane binding (22Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel 70-kDa intermediate (asterisk) became more pronounced in lanes where protein kinase C was bound to lipid but not active (e.g. lanes 12 and 13); a slightly faster migrating band (68 kDa) was barely visible below this band. A second set of changes in proteolytic sensitivity occurred as the Ca2+ concentration was raised to activating levels (e.g. above 500 μmCa2+); the 70-kDa intermediate became less apparent and a 78-kDa intermediate (arrow) became apparent. Qualitatively similar results were obtained whether protein kinase C was incubated with mixed micelles (Fig. 4) or vesicles (data not shown). To better understand the Ca2+-induced changes in protein kinase C's structure, a series of polyclonal antibodies generated against different determinants on protein kinase C were used to identify proteolytic fragments. Fig.5 A characterizes the epitope of each antibody. Protein kinase C βII was proteolyzed so that the native protein (80 kDa) and 78- (arrow), 70- (asterisk), and 68-kDa intermediates were trapped (the 78- and 68-kDa forms are more apparent when endoproteinase Arg-C is used; all these fragments co-migrate with the bands generated by trypsin cleavage). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver (panel 1) or labeled with four antibodies (panels 2–5). The 78-kDa fragment (arrow) has been previously characterized and results from activation-dependent cleavage at Arg-19 in the pseudosubstrate of protein kinase C βII (13Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was recognized by all antibodies except one generated against the bacterially expressed regulatory domain of protein kinase C: thus, the epitope for this antibody (anti-regulatory) lies in the first 18 residues of protein kinase C βII. The 70-kDa intermediate (asterisk) was recognized by all antibodies except an antibody generated against the carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C βII (residues 645–673); this revealed that the 70-kDa form was proteolyzed at the carboxyl terminus. Antibodies generated against bacterially expressed catalytic domain (anti-catalytic) and the peptide sequence from the pseudosubstrate of protein kinase C βII (residues 19–32; anti-pseudosubstrate) recognized native and amino- or carboxyl-terminally cleaved protein kinase C equally well. Neither the anti-regulatory or anti-carboxyl-terminal domain antibodies labeled the 68-kDa fragment, indicating that it was truncated at both termini. Thus, one antibody recognized the first 18 residues of protein kinase C βII (anti-regulatory), one recognized the pseudosubstrate of protein kinase C (anti-pseudosubstrate), one recognized the catalytic domain (anti-catalytic), and one recognized the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein (anti-carboxyl terminus). The four antibodies, with epitopes spanning the length of protein kinase C, were used to characterize the tryptic fragments described in Fig. 4. Protein kinase C was partially proteolyzed by trypsin under three conditions, shown in Fig.5 B, when it was 1) soluble (lane 2), 2) bound to phosphati"
https://openalex.org/W1978923083,"Dynamins comprise a family of GTPases that participate in the early stages of endocytosis. The GTPase activity of neuronal specific dynamin I is stimulated by microtubules, negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, and Src homology 3-containing proteins, including Grb2. These activators were previously shown to bind to a proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD) in the carboxyl-terminal region of the enzyme. Dynamin II, which is ubiquitously expressed, had not been purified or characterized previously. In this study, the enzymatic properties of rat dynamin II and of D746, a dynamin II truncation mutant lacking the PRD, have been characterized. Dynamin II has a higher basal activity than dynamin I, but the two types of dynamin are stimulated similarly by microtubules, Grb2, and phospholipids. D746 is not activated by microtubules or Grb2, highlighting the significance of the PRD for these interactions, but it is activated by phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports, the PRD appears not to be required for phospholipid-stimulated self-assembly of dynamin, which is a key element in the regulation of its activity. Similar results were obtained with bovine brain dynamin I that had been subjected to limited proteolytic digestion to remove the PRD.

Our data highlight the potential involvement of dynamin pleckstrin homology domains in the regulation of GTPase activity by phospholipids. Dynamins constitute a family of GTPases that carry out an essential function in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (for recent reviews, see 1–4). Although the precise role of dynamin is still uncertain, it has been proposed to couple the energy released from GTP hydrolysis to the generation of mechanical force for membrane fission during coated vesicle budding (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Three forms of dynamin have been identified in vertebrates. Dynamin I, found only in neurons, has been implicated in the process of presynaptic vesicle recycling. Dynamin II, which is ubiquitously expressed, is thought to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin III is most abundant in testes, but its function is unknown. Of these three forms, only dynamin I has been purified and characterized. However, amino acid sequence analysis reveals that dynamins I, II, and III have a similar organization of functional domains. A GTP binding catalytic domain is located in the amino-terminal region (residues 1–300); a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology domain; PRD proline/arginine-rich domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology domain; PRD proline/arginine-rich domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. domain spans residues 510–620; and a proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD) extends over 100 residues from amino acid 750 to the carboxyl terminus (residues 864 in rat dynamin I and 871 in rat dynamin II). Because of its very basic nature (pI ∼12.5) and the presence of multiple Src homology 3 binding motifs, the PRD can interact with numerous macromolecules. Some of these, including microtubules (5Shpetner H. Vallee R. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol.

However, based on kinetic data showing a dependence of activity on enzyme concentration (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), dynamin self-association appears to be a key element of the activation process. It has been proposed that the two most potent activators of dynamin I, microtubules and phosphatidylserine (PS) vesicles, stimulate activity by facilitating dynamin self-assembly (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They do so by providing multivalent negatively charged surfaces that bind to the highly basic PRDs of dynamin molecules. The ionic nature of these interactions is evident by their marked sensitivity to ionic strength; both microtubule- and PS-stimulated activities are nearly abolished at physiological salt concentrations (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other activators of dynamin GTPase, including Grb2 and a subset of anti-dynamin antibodies (11Herskovits J. Shpetner H. Burgess C. Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Warnock D.E. Terlecky L. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were also found to interact with the PRD. These proteins stimulate dynamin I GTPase to only about 20% of the maximal activities obtained in the presence of microtubules or PS vesicles. However, it is believed that the underlying mechanism of their activation is similar, i.e.stimulation of GTPase occurs as a consequence of dynamin cross-linking by anti-PRD antibodies or Grb2.Rat dynamins I and II have an overall sequence identity of ∼80%, but their PRDs are less than 50% identical (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In view of this difference and of the apparent significance of the PRD in the regulation of dynamin I, we undertook an investigation of the activation properties of dynamin II. Because dynamin II has not been purified from cells or tissues, we expressed rat dynamin II in Sf9 cells in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis. We found that dynamin II has a 10-fold higher basal activity than dynamin I. However, despite the differences in amino acid sequence of their PRDs, the two forms of dynamin interact in a similar manner with microtubules, Grb2, and phospholipid vesicles. To reinvestigate the role of the PRD in GTPase activation, a dynamin II truncation mutant (termed D746) which lacks this domain was expressed and purified. As expected from previous studies of proteolyzed dynamin I lacking the PRD (7Tuma P. Stachniak M. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herskovits J. Shpetner H. Burgess C. Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), D746 failed to be activated by microtubules or Grb2. Surprisingly, the PRD was not required for expression of phospholipid-stimulated activity or for cooperative GTPase activation because of dynamin self-association. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-stimulated GTPase activity was undiminished at physiological ionic strength. This behavior was also observed using papain-cleaved dynamin I fragments that lack the PRD, indicating that both dynamins can be activated in the absence of that domain.The PH domain of dynamin I has been expressed and characterized (14Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1994; 79: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,15Zheng J. Cahill S.M. Lemmon M.A. Fushman D. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Like many other PH domains, it was found to bind phospholipids, with phosphoinositides having the highest affinity. Moreover, deletion of the PH domain resulted in the loss of PI(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase of mutant expressed dynamin I (16Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, the question of whether the PRD is also required for this activation was not addressed. The results presented in the paper suggest that dynamins are subject to multiple modes of regulation, some involving interactions with the PRD, others with the PH domain.DISCUSSIONMany characteristics of the regulation of dynamin activity have been described. The general features of this regulation, as they are currently understood, include a low basal GTPase of the unassembled enzyme, the ability to self-associate on an appropriate matrix, and cooperative autoactivation as a consequence of suitable alignment on the matrix. The PRD has been thought to account for interactions with GTPase regulators and for mediating self-assembly and autoactivation through these interactions. Instead, our findings indicate that the PRD is not required for all of the regulatory properties listed above: (i) Removal of the dynamin I PRD by limited proteolysis results in a 10-fold increase in its basal GTPase activity; (ii) dynamin lacking the PRD is activated by phospholipids; and (iii) the PRD is not required for the cooperative increase in GTPase activity when activated by PI(4,5)P2. If increases in specific activity reflect dynamin self-association, then it appears that the PRD is not required for PIP2-driven polymerization. In the presence of PI(4,5)P2, stimulation of GTPase activities of intact dynamin and dynamin lacking the PRD is not affected by physiological ionic strength. In contrast, two of the PRD-mediated interactions,i.e. those with microtubules and PS vesicles, occur only at low ionic strength. The interaction between the PRD and Grb2 is resistant to physiological salt concentration, but Grb2-stimulated GTPase activity is relatively low compared with maximal microtubule- or lipid-stimulated activities. Salim et al. (16Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that activation of dynamin I GTPase by phosphoinositides involves regions of dynamin outside the PRD. They showed that dynamin I mutants with deleted PH domains expressed Grb2-stimulated GTPase activity but were not activable by PI(4,5)P2. Our observation that D746 and papain digests of dynamin I can be activated by phospholipids despite their lack of PRDs suggests that interactions with the PH domains are both necessary and sufficient for enzyme activation. Although the mechanism of GTPase activation remains to be established, it is likely that dynamin self-association, promoted by phospholipid binding to the PH domains, is involved. However, a more direct effect of phospholipids on catalysis cannot be ruled out.Rat dynamins I and II have an overall sequence identity of 79%, but their PRDs are only 46% identical (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the PRDs of the two forms of dynamin have nearly the same isoelectric point (∼12.5) and percentage of prolines (∼30%). This similarity of composition most likely accounts for the almost identical interactions of dynamins I and II with their PRD-binding activators, Grb2 and microtubules. The PH domains of the two dynamins have 84% sequence identity, explaining the similar activation properties observed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, which may interact with both the PH domains and the PRDs. Aside from the approximately 10-fold higher basal activity of dynamin II, the only other physical difference we detected between dynamins I and II is the greater tendency of dynamin II to aggregate in the absence of activators (not shown). However, it should be noted that dynamin I was purified from bovine brain, whereas dynamin II is a recombinant protein with a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus. Native dynamin II has not yet been isolated from cells or tissues.Removal of the dynamin I PRD by papain cleavage results in a 10-fold increase in basal GTPase activity. This finding, which disagrees with an earlier observation (11Herskovits J. Shpetner H. Burgess C. Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggests that the PRD is inhibitory in native dynamin, perhaps being displaced in the presence of PRD-binding activators like Grb2. We note that the maximal activity obtained by proteolytic cleavage of dynamin I is approximately 25 min−1, close to the values of about 50 min−1for Grb2-stimulated GTPase and for GTPase stimulated by antibodies raised against the PRD (12Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, activators that promote dynamin alignment (e.g. microtubules or phospholipid vesicles), stimulate GTPase activity to more than 200 min−1.It is widely believed that the authentic in vivo regulators of dynamin GTPase activity remain to be identified (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As stated above, microtubules and PS vesicles, the first molecules shown to stimulate dynamin activity in vitro, do not interact with dynamin at physiological ionic strength (7Tuma P. Stachniak M. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, dynamin does not colocalize with microtubules in cells (27Scaife R. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3023-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), nor are the early steps of endocytosis believed to involve microtubule-dependent motors (1Vallee R.B. Okamoto P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L.

Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although Grb2 binds to dynamin at high ionic strength (Fig. 6 A), it is a relatively poor activator of GTPase activity, only slightly better than anti-dynamin antibodies (13Warnock D.E. Terlecky L. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 vesicles are potent stimulators of dynamin GTPase activity, even at physiological ionic strength. Because phosphoinositides are subject to multiple modifications by kinases and phosphatases, they represent versatile binding partners for proteins, such as dynamin, which have been implicated in membrane trafficking (28DeCamilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, phospholipids alone probably cannot account for specific targeting of dynamin to the coated pits, a function more suitable for dynamin-binding proteins such as Grb2 (29Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), amphiphysin (30David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), or AP2 (31Wang L.-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that dynamin is recruited to the coated pit by these proteins, many of which interact with the PRD, and that GTPase activity at the coated pit is stimulated by phosphoinositides, primarily via interactions with the PH domain. The validity of this model is currently being investigated in our laboratory. Dynamins constitute a family of GTPases that carry out an essential function in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (for recent reviews, see 1–4). Although the precise role of dynamin is still uncertain, it has been proposed to couple the energy released from GTP hydrolysis to the generation of mechanical force for membrane fission during coated vesicle budding (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Three forms of dynamin have been identified in vertebrates. Dynamin I, found only in neurons, has been implicated in the process of presynaptic vesicle recycling. Dynamin II, which is ubiquitously expressed, is thought to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin III is most abundant in testes, but its function is unknown. Of these three forms, only dynamin I has been purified and characterized. However, amino acid sequence analysis reveals that dynamins I, II, and III have a similar organization of functional domains. A GTP binding catalytic domain is located in the amino-terminal region (residues 1–300); a pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology domain; PRD proline/arginine-rich domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology domain; PRD proline/arginine-rich domain; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PC, phosphatidylcholine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. domain spans residues 510–620; and a proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD) extends over 100 residues from amino acid 750 to the carboxyl terminus (residues 864 in rat dynamin I and 871 in rat dynamin II). Because of its very basic nature (pI ∼12.5) and the presence of multiple Src homology 3 binding motifs, the PRD can interact with numerous macromolecules. Some of these, including microtubules (5Shpetner H. Vallee R. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol.

The mechanism of GTPase activation is poorly understood. However, based on kinetic data showing a dependence of activity on enzyme concentration (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), dynamin self-association appears to be a key element of the activation process. It has been proposed that the two most potent activators of dynamin I, microtubules and phosphatidylserine (PS) vesicles, stimulate activity by facilitating dynamin self-assembly (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They do so by providing multivalent negatively charged surfaces that bind to the highly basic PRDs of dynamin molecules. The ionic nature of these interactions is evident by their marked sensitivity to ionic strength; both microtubule- and PS-stimulated activities are nearly abolished at physiological salt concentrations (8Tuma P. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other activators of dynamin GTPase, including Grb2 and a subset of anti-dynamin antibodies (11Herskovits J. Shpetner H. Burgess C. Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Warnock D.E. Terlecky L. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were also found to interact with the PRD. These proteins stimulate dynamin I GTPase to only about 20% of the maximal activities obtained in the presence of microtubules or PS vesicles. However, it is believed that the underlying mechanism of their activation is similar, i.e.stimulation of GTPase occurs as a consequence of dynamin cross-linking by anti-PRD antibodies or Grb2. Rat dynamins I and II have an overall sequence identity of ∼80%, but their PRDs are less than 50% identical (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In view of this difference and of the apparent significance of the PRD in the regulation of dynamin I, we undertook an investigation of the activation properties of dynamin II. Because dynamin II has not been purified from cells or tissues, we expressed rat dynamin II in Sf9 cells in sufficient quantities for biochemical analysis. We found that dynamin II has a 10-fold higher basal activity than dynamin I.

The PH domain of dynamin I has been expressed and characterized (14Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Cowburn D.

Moreover, deletion of the PH domain resulted in the loss of PI(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase of mutant expressed dynamin I (16Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R.

Salim et al. (16Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.E. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that activation of dynamin I GTPase by phosphoinositides involves regions of dynamin outside the PRD. They showed that dynamin I mutants with deleted PH domains expressed Grb2-stimulated GTPase activity but were not activable by PI(4,5)P2. Our observation that D746 and papain digests of dynamin I can be activated by phospholipids despite their lack of PRDs suggests that interactions with the PH domains are both necessary and sufficient for enzyme activation. Although the mechanism of GTPase activation remains to be established, it is likely that dynamin self-association, promoted by phospholipid binding to the PH domains, is involved. However, a more direct effect of phospholipids on catalysis cannot be ruled out. Rat dynamins I and II have an overall sequence identity of 79%, but their PRDs are only 46% identical (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the PRDs of the two forms of dynamin have nearly the same isoelectric point (∼12.5) and percentage of prolines (∼30%). This similarity of composition most likely accounts for the almost identical interactions of dynamins I and II with their PRD-binding activators, Grb2 and microtubules. The PH domains of the two dynamins have 84% sequence identity, explaining the similar activation properties observed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, which may interact with both the PH domains and the PRDs. Aside from the approximately 10-fold higher basal activity of dynamin II, the only other physical difference we detected between dynamins I and II is the greater tendency of dynamin II to aggregate in the absence of activators (not shown). However, it should be noted that dynamin I was purified from bovine brain, whereas dynamin II is a recombinant protein with a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus. Native dynamin II has not yet been isolated from cells or tissues. Removal of the dynamin I PRD by papain cleavage results in a 10-fold increase in basal GTPase activity. This finding, which disagrees with an earlier observation (11Herskovits J. Shpetner H. Burgess C. Vallee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggests that the PRD is inhibitory in native dynamin, perhaps being displaced in the presence of PRD-binding activators like Grb2. We note that the maximal activity obtained by proteolytic cleavage of dynamin I is approximately 25 min−1, close to the values of about 50 min−1for Grb2-stimulated GTPase and for GTPase stimulated by antibodies raised against the PRD (12Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, activators that promote dynamin alignment (e.g. microtubules or phospholipid vesicles), stimulate GTPase activity to more than 200 min−1. It is widely believed that the authentic in vivo regulators of dynamin GTPase activity remain to be identified (2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As stated above, microtubules and PS vesicles, the first molecules shown to stimulate dynamin activity in vitro, do not interact with dynamin at physiological ionic strength (7Tuma P. Stachniak M. Collins C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, dynamin does not colocalize with microtubules in cells (27Scaife R. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3023-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), nor are the early steps of endocytosis believed to involve microtubule-dependent motors (1Vallee R.B. Okamoto P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L.

Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although Grb2 binds to dynamin at high ionic strength (Fig. 6 A), it is a relatively poor activator of GTPase activity, only slightly better than anti-dynamin antibodies (13Warnock D.E. Terlecky L. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 vesicles are potent stimulators of dynamin GTPase activity, even at physiological ionic strength. Because phosphoinositides are subject to multiple modifications by kinases and phosphatases, they represent versatile binding partners for proteins, such as dynamin, which have been implicated in membrane trafficking (28DeCamilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, phospholipids alone probably cannot account for specific targeting of dynamin to the coated pits, a function more suitable for dynamin-binding proteins such as Grb2 (29Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), amphiphysin (30David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), or AP2 (31Wang L.-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that dynamin is recruited to the coated pit by these proteins, many of which interact with the PRD, and that GTPase activity at the coated pit is stimulated by phosphoinositides, primarily via interactions with the PH domain. The validity of this model is currently being investigated in our laboratory. We thank Dr. A. G. Gilman for support and discussions throughout this project and Dr. Thomas C. Südhof for the generous gifts of the rat dynamin II clone and anti-dynamin antibodies. We also acknowledge Dr. Keng-Mean Lin for providing phospholipids.

The SRE can mediate induction of reporter expression in response to GH. For insight into the mechanism by which GH regulates transcription factors, regulation of SRE-associated proteins by GH was examined. In nuclear extracts from 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, several SRE-binding complexes were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

The two GH-stimulated complexes were supershifted by antibodies against the serum response factor (SRF), indicating that they contained SRF or an antigenically related protein. One of the GH-stimulated complexes was supershifted by antibody against Elk-1, suggesting that it contains a ternary complex factor (TCF) such as Elk-1 in addition to SRF. Induction of binding by GH was lost when the SRF binding site in the SRE was mutated, and mutation of either the SRF or TCF binding site altered the pattern of protein binding to the SRE. Mutation of the SRF or TCF binding site in SRE-luciferase plasmids inhibited the ability of GH to stimulate reporter expression, supporting a role for both SRF and TCF in GH-induced transcription of c-fos via the SRE. The TCF family member Elk-1 is capable of mediating GH-stimulated transcription, since GH-stimulated reporter expression was mediated by the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1. Consistent with this stimulation, GH rapidly and transiently stimulated the serine phosphorylation of Elk-1. The increase was evident within 10 min and subsided after 30 min.

Transcription of the proto-oncogene c-fos is rapidly stimulated by GH (1Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Gurland G. Ashcom G. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Multiple upstream sequences appear to participate in the regulation of c-fos by GH based on deletion analysis (3Chen C.M. Clarkson R.W. Xie Y. Hume D.A. Waters M.J. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4505-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Among these, GH-stimulated transcription of reporter constructs has been demonstrated via the serum response element (SRE) (4Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the Sis-inducible element (SIE) (5Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The c-fos SIE binds signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 1 and Stat 3, and a trimer of the SIE can mediate GH-stimulated transcriptional activation when Stat 3 is overexpressed (5Sotiropoulos A.

The SRE is a stronger enhancer, since as a single copy it efficiently mediates transcriptional activation in response to GH (4Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although many proteins have been identified that bind to the c-fos SRE (6Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), their regulation by GH has not been explored. Transcriptional activation of c-fos in response to serum and several growth factors requires binding of the serum response factor (SRF) to the core SRE as a dimer. While SRF binds constitutively to the SRE (7Herrera R. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Konig H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3607-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), binding to the SRE has been shown to be rapidly and transiently increased by several growth factors including epidermal growth factor and insulin (9Benson B.A. Jonsen M.

The phosphorylation of SRF on multiple serines and threonines is reported to be regulated and to influence DNA binding kinetics (12Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Eur. J.

Members of the transcription factor family of ternary complex factors (TCF), including Elk-1, SAP-1, and SAP-2/ERP/Net, also bind to the c-fos SRE but only in association with SRF (17Price M.A. Rogers A.E.

Elk-1 is able to mediate transcription via the SRE if SRF is present and if Elk-1 is phosphorylated on serine 383 in its C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (19Gille H. Sharrocks A.D.

The present study investigates whether and how GH regulates SRF and/or TCFs associated with the SRE by examining the ability of GH to promote: 1) the binding of SRF and TCFs to DNA, 2) the ability of SRF and TCF to mediate expression of reporter constructs, and 3) the phosphorylation of Elk-1. Both SRF and TCF were found to be essential for GH-stimulated transcriptional activation via the SRE. In addition, GH was found to stimulate Elk-1-mediated transcriptional activation and the serine phosphorylation of Elk-1. These findings identify transcription factors that contribute to GH-promoted transcription of c-fos and support a role for serine phosphorylation of a TCF such as Elk-1 in GH-promoted transcriptional activation mediated by the SRE. 3T3-F442A cells were kindly provided by Dr. H. Green (Harvard University, Boston, MA) and Dr. M. Sonenberg (Sloan-Kettering, NY). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO cells expressing full-length rat GH receptor (GHR1–638) or GHR lacking the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain (GHR1–454) were provided by Dr. Gunnar Norstedt (Karolinska Inst., Stockholm, Sweden). Recombinant human GH was provided by Eli Lilly. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal sequence (amino acids 46–245) of human SRF (αSRF) and corresponding nonimmune serum were generous gifts from Dr. M.

Affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (100 μg/ml) against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 407–426 of Elk-1 (α-Elk-1(sc)) used for supershifting was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic phospho-serine 383 peptide corresponding to residues 379–392 of Elk-1 (α-P-Elk-1), and polyclonal antibodies against the corresponding nonphosphorylated Elk-1 peptide (αElk-1) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Lipofectamine was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., luciferin from Promega, and β-galactosidase chemiluminescence reagents from Tropix. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was purchased from Amersham. Leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, bovine serum albumin (CRG7) from Intergen, and radioisotopes from NEN Life Science Products. 3T3-F442A preadipocyte fibroblasts were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 8% calf serum in an atmosphere of 10% CO2, 90% air. CHO cells and CHO cells expressing GHR were grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 90% air. All media were supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. Prior to treatment, cells were deprived of serum overnight in the appropriate medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin instead of serum unless indicated otherwise. Cells were then incubated with GH at 500 ng/ml (22 nm). Binding to the c-fos SRE was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using oligonucleotides containing the following wild type and mutated sequences (54Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where changes from wild type are underlined: Wild typec-fos SRE (SREw), 5′-gatcGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′; mutation of the SRF binding site (mSRF), 5′-gatcGGATGTAAATATTATTACATC-3′; mutation of the TCF binding site (mTCF), 5′-gatcAAATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′. To study transcriptional activation, the oligonucleotides were inserted into the BamHI and NheI sites of TK-Luc, to generate plasmids SREw/Luc, mSRF/Luc, and mTCF/Luc. The reporter plasmid TK-Luc (from Dr. J. Pessin, University of Iowa) contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene (24Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Each plasmid contained a single copy of the wild type or mutated SRE sequence in the correct orientation. The plasmids Gal4/ElkC (25Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R.

Uhler (University of Michigan) and RSV-neo by Dr. Nils Billestrup (Hagedorn Lab, Gentofte, Denmark). The cDNA for Elk-1 was provided by Dr. R. Treisman (Imperial Cancer Res. Fund, London, United Kingdom), and the plasmid CMV-Elk-1 was provided by Dr. Kun-liang Guan (University of Michigan). 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were plated at 104 cells/cm2 on 100-mm plates and stably transfected the next day using lipofectamine, 8 μg/plate of plasmid SREw/Luc, mSRF/Luc, or mTCF/Luc, and RSV-neo (2 μg/plate). Pooled clones were maintained in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml G418. Relative levels of expression of the three SRE/Luc plasmids were comparable. CHO cells expressing GHR1–638 were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (27Chen D. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) with 2.5 μg of TK-Luc, SREw/Luc, mSRF/Luc, or mTCF/Luc plasmid DNA/35-mm well. In a separate series of experiments, CHO cells expressing GHR1–638 (2 × 105 cells/35-mm well) were co-transfected with 5 μg/well of Gal4/ElkC and Gal/Luc DNA and 1 μg RSV β-galactosidase DNA using calcium phosphate (4Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CMV-Elk-1 or the vector pcDNA3 (10 μg/100-mm plate) were transfected into CHO cells expressing GHR1–638 or GHR1–454 using calcium phosphate. Since GH induces c-fos mRNA and stimulates transcriptional activation via the SRE to comparable extents in the CHO cells expressing GHR1–638 or GHR1–454, 2T.-W. L. Gong, D.J. Meyer, J. Liao, C.L.

Unless indicated otherwise, 36 h posttransfection, the cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 12 h and then incubated in medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 h prior to treatment as indicated. EMSAs were performed as described previously (28Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Cochran B.H. Argetsinger L.S. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4701-4704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were deprived of serum overnight and incubated for the indicated times with hormone, serum, or vehicle at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described (28Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Cochran B.H. Argetsinger L.S. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4701-4704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and were analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. In some experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with αSRF (1:10) or corresponding rabbit nonimmune serum (NI, 1:10), or with α-Elk-1(sc) (1:10). Cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and luciferase or β-galactosidase activity was measured using an Autolumat Luminometer. The luciferase values from experiments evaluating transcriptional activation via Elk-1 were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data are expressed as percentage of values in untreated controls ± S.E. for five independent experiments. Variability in controls was less than 1% among triplicates in each experiment. Analysis of variance with factorical Scheffe F-test was used to analyze data from individual experiments. CHO-GHR cells in 100-mm plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (5Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol.

To reprobe blots, the membranes were submerged in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and incubated at 50 °C for 30 min while shaking. The membranes were then reprobed with αElk-1 (1:1000). The apparent molecular weights indicated are based on prestained molecular weight standards (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether such stimulation is accompanied by changes in the binding of nuclear proteins to the c-fos SRE, binding was examined by EMSA using nuclear extracts from 3T3-F442A fibroblasts incubated with or without GH (Fig. 1). Several SRE binding complexes were identified in all 3T3-F442A cell extracts tested. They included two slower migrating bands (A and B) and a diffuse faster migrating complex (C). Bands A and B migrate similarly to bands identified by others as the SRE-SRF complex (band A), and the ternary complex (band B) composed of SRE, SRF, and Elk-1 or another TCF (18Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 32Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A.

The identity of band C is not known; its intensity varies with cell type (see Fig. 2). Band D shows migration of free probe. Complexes A, B, and C were not evident when excess oligonucleotide was present during incubation with nuclear extracts, indicating specificity of binding (data not shown). The presence of SRF in bands A and B is supported by the disappearance of bands A and B and the appearance of a more slowly migrating band when anti-SRF serum (αSRF) is added to nuclear extracts and by co-migration of band A with in vitro translated SRF bound to the SRE probe and supershift of that complex with αSRF (data not shown).Figure 2GH-induced binding to the SRE occurs in several cell types. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (lanes 1 and 2), CHO-GHR1–638 cells (GHR,lanes 3 and 4) or nontransfected CHO cells (CHO, lanes 5 and 6) were incubated for 5 min with vehicle (C, lanes 1, 3, and 5) or GH (lanes 2, 4, and 6). Nuclear extracts were used for EMSA with the SREw probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the effect of GH treatment on binding was examined after 30 min, binding of the SRF-containing bands to the SRE was not detectably different from that in untreated cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 4 versus 3, bands A and B). Since changes in binding could precede GH-induced c-fos expression, which is evident as early as 15 min, the effect of GH on nuclear protein binding to the SRE was examined at earlier times. A 5 min incubation of cells with GH increased binding of the SRF-containing complexes to the SRE (Fig.1 A, lane 2, bands A and B). Similar increases in binding were also observed in extracts incubated with GH for 2 or 10 min (data not shown). By 30 min, the GH-stimulated binding subsided to control levels (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). The intensity of band C generally appeared to increase with GH treatment. These findings indicate that GH rapidly stimulates the binding of several complexes to the SRE and that the stimulation of binding of SRF-containing complexes to the SRE is transient and subsides to control levels within 30 min. To determine whether GH-induced binding to the SRE is evident in cells other than 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, binding was examined in CHO cells stably expressing full-length GHR (GHR1–638), in which GH induces c-fos expression.2 In CHO-GHR cells, GH was found to stimulate binding to the SRE in 5 min (Fig. 2, lane 4), whereas the parental CHO cells lacking endogenous GHR failed to respond to GH (lane 6). In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, in which GH can also induce c-fos (4Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Sumantran V.N. Tsai M.-L. Schwartz J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2016-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), an increase in binding was also observed after 5 min of GH treatment (data not shown). Band C was greatly reduced in CHO and NIH-3T3 cells compared with 3T3-F442A cells but still appeared to increase in CHO-GHR cells with GH treatment. Identification of bands A and B and their regulation by GH was further investigated by examining the effect of mutations in the SRF or TCF binding sites (see “Experimental Procedures”) on GH-induced binding. Mutation of the TCF site (Fig.3, lanes 9–12) prevented formation of band B, but binding of the SRE-SRF complex (band A) appeared intact. Mutation of the SRF site eliminated bands A, B, and C (Fig. 3, lanes 5–8). Rather, an intermediate band (D) consistently appeared that was not stimulated by GH (lane 7 versus lane 5). These results provide further support that band A is a complex of the SRE and SRF, and that band B is composed of the complex of the SRE, SRF, and a TCF. In the absence of TCF, SRF binding to the SRE still increased in a GH-dependent fashion (lane 11 versus 9). However, in the absence of SRF, the GH-dependent increase in binding of both SRF and TCF was lost (lane 7). Consistent with bands A and B containing SRF, the complexes bound to SREw or mTCF were supershifted when nuclear extracts were incubated with αSRF (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 4, 10, and 12). With mSRF, the newly present band D was not supershifted by αSRF (lanes 6 and 8), consistent with the mSRF sequence being unable to bind SRF. These observations provide further support for the presence of SRF in the GH-inducible bands A and B. To determine whether SRF or TCF are required for induction of c-fos via the SRE in response to GH, reporter expression in response to GH was tested in 3T3-F442A cells transfected stably with wild type or mutated SRE-luciferase plasmids. The wild type SRE alone mediated GH-stimulated luciferase expression that was three times higher than control (Fig.4 A) consistent with previous reports using a nonheterologous reporter (4Meyer D.J. Stephenson E.W. Johnson L. Cochran B.H. Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid alone (TK) consistently failed to respond to GH. Mutation of either the SRF or TCF binding site blocked the ability of GH to stimulate reporter expression. The contribution of SRF and TCF in the GH response was not restricted to 3T3-F442A cells, since similar inhibition of GH-stimulated luciferase expression by mutation of SRF or TCF binding sites was observed in CHO cells expressing GHR1–638 upon transient transfection of wild type or mutated SRE/Luc (Fig.4 B). These findings show that the binding of SRF and TCF are essential for GH-stimulated transcriptional activation via the SRE. For insight into the TCF family member regulated by GH, anti-Elk-1 antibodies were used in EMSA to examine whether Elk-1 was present in the GH-stimulated ternary complex. The endogenous ternary complex in 3T3-F442A cells was found to contain Elk-1 or a related protein, since α-Elk-1 reduced band B in untreated (Fig. 5, lane 2) and GH-stimulated cells (lane 4). The stimulation of Elk-1 binding by GH was further demonstrated by overexpression of Elk-l in CHO cells expressing GHR. Upon EMSA of nuclear extracts from these cells, GH treatment increased the amount of band B (lane 7 versus lane 5) as it had in 3T3-F442A cells. The presence of Elk-1 in band B in control and GH-treated cells was substantiated by reduction of band B upon addition of antibody against Elk-1 (Fig. 5, lane 6 versus lane 5 and lane 8 versus lane 7). A small amount of residual band B in GH-treated cells (lane 8) most likely reflects incomplete reaction of α-Elk-1 with the greater amount of Elk-1 bound to the SRE. In the GH-treated cells, the presence of α-Elk-1 also led to appearance of an additional, more slowly migrating band (lane 8), consistent with the presence of Elk-1 in the GH-stimulated complex in the CHO-GHR cells. The supershift is visible when Elk-1 is over-expressed, compared with the substantially lower levels of endogenous Elk-1 in 3T3-F442A cells (lane 4). Immunoblotting confirmed the expression of comparable amounts of Elk-1 in transfected CHO-GHR cells (data not shown). Since a TCF is required for GH-promoted reporter expression via the SRE, and since Elk-1 is present in the GH-stimulated ternary complex bound to the SRE, the ability of Elk-1 to mediate GH-stimulated gene expression was examined. CHO-GHR cells were transiently co-transfected with the Elk-Gal expression plasmid Gal4/ElkC encoding the transcriptional activation domain of Elk-1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (25Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and a Gal-Luc reporter plasmid (5X Gal/Luc) containing 5 consensus Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene (26Cox A.D.

GH produced a consistent stimulation of luciferase expression mediated via the Elk-1 transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 6), indicating that GH increases the transcriptional activation capabilities of Elk-1. The phosphorylation of Elk-1 on serine 383 in its C-terminal transactivation domain is required for Elk-1 mediated transcriptional activation in response to growth factors (19Gille H. Sharrocks A.D.

While confirming the importance of residues predicted to be involved directly in function by the crystal structure, the analysis led to several striking results. Aspartate 34, which contacts the central base pair of the PvuII site (5′-CAGCTG-3′) through the minor groove, plays a critical role in binding specificity. A D34G mutant binds with high affinity to any of the sequences in the set CANNTG, although its low level of cleavage activity acts only on the wild-type site. In addition, a His to Ala mutation at the residue that contacts the central G and is predicted to be blocked by PvuII methylation still requires the PvuII methylase to be maintained in vivo, arguing against this hypothesis as the only mechanism for methylation protection. Finally, four of the five mutations that reduce cleavage activity while still exhibiting binding in the gel shift assay are at residues that form DNA- or subunit-subunit contacts rather than in the catalytic center. This provides further evidence for a strong linkage between specific binding and catalysis.

The endonucleases that produce 5′-overhanging ends, EcoRI and BamHI, approach the DNA from the major groove, where most of their base-specific contacts are made. The endonucleases that produce blunt-ended DNA products, EcoRV and PvuII, approach the DNA from the minor groove side and establish contacts in the major groove by wrapping around the DNA.

These studies have focused on the identification and analysis of residues involved in catalysis, testing alternative mechanisms of catalysis, and understanding how a specific DNA sequence is recognized. Attempts to alter the sequence specificity have proven to be difficult, with successful examples limited to mutants showing relaxed specificity (10Heitman J. Model P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Flores H. Osuna J. Heitman J. Soberon X. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Wenz C.

Oelgeschlager T. Wolfes H. Maass G. Pingoud A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Jeltsch A. Wenz C. Wende W. Selent U. Pingoud A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 235-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One explanation for this difficulty is that a change in specificity not only requires recognition of a different DNA sequence, but also requires that the linkage between recognition and catalysis be retained. A class of mutations that might illuminate this linkage is the catalytic mutations, where specific DNA binding is retained but catalysis is reduced (26Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Xu S. Schildkraut I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4425-4429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, mutants in this class that are outside the catalytic center might be deficient in the linkage between recognition and catalysis (28Wenz C. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5565-5573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).PvuII endonuclease (hereafter referred to as PvuII) from Proteus vulgaris is a type II restriction endonuclease that cleaves DNA between the central GC base pair of its recognition sequence (5′-CAGCTG-3′) in a Mg2+-dependent reaction, generating blunt-ended products (31Gingeras T.R. Greenough L. Schildkraut I. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4525-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PvuII approaches DNA from the minor groove side, with the DNA-binding domain reaching around the sides of the DNA and contacting base pairs in the major groove. These contacts are made by residues present in a pair of antiparallel β-strands (see Fig. 1) (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The recognition region includes a His triplet (His83-His84-His85), an Asn doublet (Asn140-Asn141), and Ser81. Another major region of DNA contact is the loop between the first two α-helices. Residues in this loop (Gln33, Asp34, and Asn35), which constitute the floor of the DNA-binding cleft, face the minor groove and make direct contacts with backbone phosphates and the central GC base pair. Two negatively charged residues and one positively charged residue on a short β-sheet near the scissile phosphate are predicted to form the catalytic center. PvuII is a good candidate for structure-function studies and protein engineering since it is one of the smallest restriction enzymes (32Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and has a limited number of protein-DNA interactions predicted from its crystal structure (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The work reported here was designed to test the predictions of the crystal structure and to begin to probe the mechanism of catalysis and its linkage to DNA binding, with the ultimate goal of changing the specificity of the endonuclease.DISCUSSIONThis work describes the isolation of random and site-directed mutants in the PvuII endonuclease and their analysis using a number of in vivo and in vitro tests. In principle, the combination of site-directed and random mutagenesis allows both a direct test of residues that are indicated as central by the PvuII crystal structure and an unbiased probe for additional important residues. In this case, the random mutagenesis was too limited to be comprehensive, and most of the residues that were identified from the random mutagenesis were coincidentally implicated by the crystal structure. Additional mutations were recovered that produced unstable proteins, occurred as double mutants along with an implicated residue, or produced bulky substitutions of residues adjacent to identified motifs. The use of the dinD::lac fusion helped to facilitate isolation of a range of different classes of mutations, but the level of SOS induction has not yet been correlated with an in vitroactivity of the mutant proteins.To characterize the DNA binding of the mutants, in vivo and in vitro assays of DNA binding were employed. A variation of the transcriptional interference assay of Elledge and Davis (39Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), where repression of an antisense transcript by a DNA-binding protein leads to the expression of spectinomycin resistance, was used to assess in vivo binding. This assay has the advantage of probing for DNA binding under physiological conditions, but comparing the results with the in vitro data indicates that binding to the antisense promoter may not be sufficient to give spectinomycin resistance. In particular, mutants that produced a growth defect or retained low levels of endonuclease activity failed to exhibit spectinomycin resistance, even when in vitro data indicated binding. In these cases, the growth defect may have had a pleiotropic effect on the expression of spectinomycin resistance. On the other hand, this assay showed the binding of two mutants, D34G and H85A, in the presence of in vivo levels of Mg2+. This increases the confidence in the correlation of the in vitro binding (see below).The in vitro DNA binding was assayed by devising a gel shift assay in the presence of Ca2+. This assay is nearly identical to the one used for the structurally related enzyme EcoRV (41Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), except that a 15% acrylamide gel was necessary to trap the protein-DNA complex under the conditions used here. A recent report indicates that EcoRV can bind to DNA in the absence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ under different conditions (44Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Yee C. McVerry B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2870-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); attempts to visualize a gel shift for PvuII in the absence of metal ions or in the presence of Mg2+ for the catalytically inactive mutants have thus far been unsuccessful.Similar mutagenesis studies have been done on EcoRI (10Heitman J.

These studies have anticipated or confirmed the predicted roles of residues identified as central from the crystal structures of the respective enzymes. The crystal structures have been used to identify three domains: the subunit interface domain, the DNA recognition domain, and the catalytic domain. The previous work has allowed the identification of the charged residues in the active sites of these nucleases, while the crystal structures show how the corresponding residues line up in similar positions relative to the scissile phosphate in all three enzymes: for EcoRI, Asp91, Glu111, and Lys113; for BamHI, Asp94, Glu111, and Glu113; and for EcoRV, Glu73, Asp90, and Lys92. The identity of the residues that compose the PvuII active site has been proposed based on sequence and structural homologies with EcoRV and EcoRI (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The data presented in this work support the assignment of Asp58, Glu68, and Lys70 as the key residues of the PvuII active site. Alanine substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis have shown that these three residues are essential for endonuclease activity. The wild-type characteristics of the E55A mutant also indicate that glutamate 55 is not part of the catalytic center and is not involved in the coordination of metal ions (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The K70A mutant binds DNA but fails to cleave, similar to mutations at EcoRV Lys92and EcoRI Lys113. The fact that, unlike their counterparts in EcoRV, EcoRI, and BamHI, the D58A and E68A mutants do not bind DNA in the gel shift assay used probably reflects the fact that the assay requires Ca2+ since these residues are thought to bind the metal ion.In PvuII, substitutions at residues that interact with the external bases of the canonical sequence, Ser81, Asn140, or Asn141, abolished the enzyme activity and impaired the formation of the protein-DNA complexes. The functional relevance of these residues is brought out by the fact that these mutants were obtained by random mutagenesis, without relying on knowledge of the enzyme structure. The mutant proteins also could not bind to PvuII sites symmetrically altered at the outside bases (CAGCTG). Additional mutagenesis of these three residues needs to be done to test if substitutions of smaller neutral side chains would be able to support some level of binding or endonuclease activity at canonical or mutant DNA sequences. In particular, the profound effect of the S81L substitution is remarkable. Recognition of the outermost guanine is established by simultaneous contact with asparagine 141 and serine 81 (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In view of the close proximity of Asn141, the removal of the interaction supported by Ser81 in the S81L mutant might be expected to have a smaller effect than mutations at Asn141. It is possible that the larger leucine side chain substituted in this mutant created steric constraints that preclude binding. In addition, the fact that the structure has been solved in the absence of Mg2+means that conformational changes not yet observed might accompany binding of the metal cofactor and could alter the interactions with the DNA.Histidine 84 and aspartate 34 establish contact with the central base pair GC (7Cheng X. Balendiran K. Schildkraut I. Anderson J.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3927-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). While His84 contacts the guanine on the major groove side, Asp34 interacts with the minor groove side. H84A had a much smaller defect in cleavage activity than D34G and retained specific binding of the DNA. Despite predictions based on the crystal structure, methylation of the central cytosine still protected DNA from cleavage by the H84A mutant. On the other hand, Asp34 played a crucial role in the discrimination of the central base pair. Substitution of glycine for aspartate decreased enzyme activity by a factor of 104, but allowed the enzyme to bind DNA regardless of the bases present at the central positions. More elements must be involved in the process of recognizing the central pair since the residual activity of the D34G mutant enzyme only hydrolyzed the canonical PvuII sequence. These data are consistent with several possible mechanisms of recognition of the central bases. His84 and Asp34 could be acting synergistically, with either one of them being sufficient for maintaining cleavage specificity. If this is the case, Asp34, approaching the DNA through the minor groove, must be the principal residue because the removal of its side chain produces the most dramatic changes in the enzyme's binding properties. Alternatively, recognition of the central base pair could be an example of indirect readout (28Wenz C. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5565-5573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), i.e. the position adopted by the scissile bond in the catalytic center and other nonspecific contacts may be the major discriminating factors, while the base-specific contacts made by His84 and Asp34 play only a secondary role. Analysis of the double mutant D34G,H84A might help to explain questions about the recognition of the central base pair.Of the three contiguous histidine residues present in the DNA recognition region, the most sensitive to substitution was histidine 85. Mutants of His85 bound DNA with high affinity, but their catalytic activity was seriously compromised (H85L) or totally abolished (H85A). Substitutions at this position produced another example of separation between binding to the target sequence and catalysis. The different behavior of the leucine and alanine substitutions suggested that a hydrophobic contact between leucine side chains could partially replace the His–His hydrogen bond present in the wild-type protein.Although there is wide acceptance that DNA recognition and cleavage by restriction endonucleases are strongly linked, most of the mutagenesis studies have outlined how residues in the DNA recognition domain abolish binding and mutations in the catalytic domain abolish cleavage, usually leaving specific binding intact (11Flores H. Osuna J. Heitman J. Soberon X. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 157: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Grabowski G. Jeltsch A. Wolfes H. Maass G. Alves J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There is a relative paucity of mutations described similar to, for example, T37A of EcoRV (28Wenz C. Jeltsch A. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5565-5573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that are located outside the catalytic domain and bind DNA specifically but are defective in cleavage. In one case where catalytic mutations of BamHI were selected directly using the transcriptional interference method, all the mutations found were in catalytic domain residues (26Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This rarity may be due to how the mutations were made and analyzed rather than a reflection of their abundance in nature. At any rate, the analysis in this study yielded a relatively large number of mutations that are located at residues outside the catalytic domain and bind DNA specifically but have a substantial cleavage defect. These mutants have the potential to illuminate how residues outside the catalytic center can be involved in positioning the reactive side chains and the scissile phosphate for catalysis by changing the conformation of the protein-DNA complex.

The endonucleases that produce 5′-overhanging ends, EcoRI and BamHI, approach the DNA from the major groove, where most of their base-specific contacts are made. The endonucleases that produce blunt-ended DNA products, EcoRV and PvuII, approach the DNA from the minor groove side and establish contacts in the major groove by wrapping around the DNA. Structure-function studies have been limited to a small number of type II enzymes. Years of studies have produced an extensive amount of information about EcoRI (10Heitman J. Model P.

These studies have focused on the identification and analysis of residues involved in catalysis, testing alternative mechanisms of catalysis, and understanding how a specific DNA sequence is recognized. Attempts to alter the sequence specificity have proven to be difficult, with successful examples limited to mutants showing relaxed specificity (10Heitman J. Model P.

Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 235-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One explanation for this difficulty is that a change in specificity not only requires recognition of a different DNA sequence, but also requires that the linkage between recognition and catalysis be retained. A class of mutations that might illuminate this linkage is the catalytic mutations, where specific DNA binding is retained but catalysis is reduced (26Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I.

https://openalex.org/W2108336370,"The in vivo activity of the 27-kDa heat shock protein, a barbed-end microfilament capping protein, may be localized to the plasma membrane. To investigate this putative association, bovine endothelial cells expressing the human wild type or a mutant nonphosphorylatable 27-kDa heat shock protein were subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis. The 25-kDa endogenous bovine homolog and both exogenous gene products partitioned with cytosolic or plasma membrane components, indicating that phosphorylation is not required for membrane association. Phorbol ester treatment resulted in phosphorylation of only membrane-associated 25-kDa and wild type 27-kDa heat shock protein and did not induce redistribution. In a second fractionation protocol, streptavidin-agarose precipitation of extracts prepared from cells biotinylated at either the apical or basal surface localized membrane 25- and 27-kDa heat shock protein exclusively to the basolateral surface. Stimulation of transfectants expressing the wild type 27-kDa heat shock protein resulted in its phosphorylation and a doubling in the amount of membrane-associated F-actin precipitated, whereas the mutant protein decreased the amount of F-actin precipitated. These data suggest that membrane-associated 25- and 27-kDa heat shock proteins inhibit the generation of basolateral microfilaments and that phosphorylation releases this inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2088615332,"Human HEK 293 cells present a simple and tractable system to directly test the hypothesis that the G protein γ subunits contribute to the specificity of receptor signaling pathwaysin vivo. To begin to elucidate the functions of the individual γ subunits in these cells, a ribozyme strategy was used to specifically inactivate the mRNA encoding the γ7subunit. A phosphorothioated DNA-RNA chimeric hammerhead ribozyme was constructed and analyzed for specificity toward the targeted γ7 subunit. In vitro cleavage analysis of this ribozyme revealed a highly efficient cleavage activity directed exclusively toward the γ7 RNA transcript. In particular, this ribozyme did not result in cleavage of the γ12 RNA transcript, which is 75% identical to the γ7 RNA transcript. Using a transient transfection assay, in vivoanalysis of this ribozyme showed a specific reduction in both the mRNA and protein expression of the γ7 subunit in HEK 293 cells. Coincident with this loss in γ7 subunit, there was a specific reduction in the protein expression of the β1 subunit, suggesting that the β1 and γ7 subunits may functionally interact to form a βγ dimer in vivo. Functional analysis of the consequences of ribozyme-mediated suppression of the γ7 subunit expression indicated that it was associated with significant attenuation of isoproterenol-, but not prostaglandin E1-, stimulated adenylylcyclase activity. Suppression of the γ7 subunit expression had no effect on carbachol- and ATP-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover. Taken together, these results not only indicate the feasibility of using the ribozyme technology to determine the roles of individual γ subunits in receptor-G protein-effector pathways in vivo, but they point to a specific role of the γ7 subunit in the regulation of adenylylcyclase activity in response to isoproterenol.

While the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in signal transduction is well established, a central question that remains to be resolved is how the specificity of signal transduction from receptor to G protein to effector is encoded in the protein-protein interactions between an expanding number of signaling partners. Perhaps the simplest way to encode the specificity of signal transduction would be for each type of receptor to interact with a specific G protein α and βγ subunit combination to converge on one or more types of effectors. In this scenario, the specific combination of G protein α and βγ subunits would provide the level of selectivity that is needed to interact with the different types of receptors. That βγ subunits, as well as α subunits, contribute to the selectivity of interaction with receptor is supported by several studies. Reconstitution of receptors with G proteins consisting of common α subunits but distinct βγ subunits shows a range of differences in coupling (1Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Figler R. Graber S. Lindorfer M. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J. Mol.

Moreover, the differences in coupling are attributable to the γ component, with both the prenyl group and the structure of the γ subunit tail being specific determinants of receptor-G protein interaction (4Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). While these reconstitution studies have begun to provide invaluable information on the ability of specific G protein α or βγ subunits to interact with particular receptors, the results indicate and probably overestimate the potential interactions that actually occur in native membranes or cellular systems. In fact, it appears that the βγ subunits do not readily substitute for one another in vivo. Antisense oligonucleotide blockage of expression of different βγ subunits in GH3 pituitary cells has been shown to selectively disrupt signaling through either the muscarinic or somatostatin receptor pathways, both of which couple to inhibition of the same Ca2+ current. These results clearly suggest that the muscarinic and somatostatin receptor pathways involve distinct βγ dimers (6Kleuss C. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 7Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Presumably, this requirement for particular βγ subunits reflects a specificity at the receptor-G protein interface that does not allow their substitution. Taken together, these and other findings strongly support a major role for the G-protein βγ subunits in receptor recognition and, hence, a role in the assembly of physiologically appropriate receptor signaling pathways. Since the βγ subunits exist as a tightly associated complex under physiological conditions and function as a single entity, the relative contributions of the individual β and γ components in receptor recognition have been difficult to investigate. The complexity of this task is reflected by the diversity and variety of potential interactions of the β and γ subunits that have been described (8Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,9Blumer K.J. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To begin to assign specific βγ subunits to various receptor-G protein-effector pathwaysin vivo, we have been developing a reverse genetics approach to specifically inactivate G protein γ subunits at the mRNA level. In this study, we have described the use of the ribozyme technology to specifically inactivate the mRNA encoding the γ7 subunit in HEK 293 cells to directly test the hypothesis that the particular subtype of γ subunit present in a heterotrimeric G protein is a determinant of the specificity of receptor signaling pathways. The results presented in this paper demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of using the newly described ribozyme technology to determine the roles of individual γ subunits in receptor-G protein-effector pathways in vivo. A chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeted against the G protein γ7 subunit mRNA was chemically synthesized in 1-μmol scale on a model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Division of Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA). Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by sulfurization with 3H-1,2-benzodithiole-3-one-1,1-dioxide. The ribozyme was autocleaved on the synthesizer using ammonium hydroxide/ethanol (3:1) for 2 h, and exocyclic amine protecting groups were removed by heating at 65 °C for 3 h. The ribozyme was desilylated with neat triethylamine trihydrofluoride and desalted by precipitation in n-butyl alcohol according to a published procedure (14Mullah B. Andrus A. Nucleosides and Nucleotides. 1996; 15: 419-430Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The sequence of this ribozyme is shown, with the ribonucleotides designated by lowercase letters and the deoxyribonucleotides bycapital letters (Fig. 1). To generate an in vitro γ7 RNA transcript, a pBSK plasmid containing the γ7 subunit cDNA was linearized as template, and the transcription reaction was carried out with T3 RNA polymerase as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). The γ7 RNA transcript was labeled by including 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in the reaction. To perform the in vitro cleavage experiment, the ribozyme and RNA transcript were denatured in separate tubes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 85 °C for 1 min. The contents of the two tubes were then mixed together in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. The ratio of ribozyme to target RNA (50 nm) was varied over a 1000-fold range. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of stop solution consisting of 95% formamide and 60 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.0. The resulting cleavage products were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated and grown in either 100-mm dishes (for analysis of protein suppression) or six-well plates (for analysis of mRNA suppression) and transfected at approximately 80% confluency. Prior to transfection, the cells were preincubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. Cells were then transfected for 5 h at 37 °C with fresh serum-free media containing premixed ribozyme (2 μm) and the cationic lipid, LipofectAMINE (15 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). At 5 h post-transfection, heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 6%. Subsequently, at 5, 24, 30, and 48 h after transfection, the dishes were supplemented with additional 0.5 μm ribozyme such that the total concentration of added ribozyme at 48 h was equivalent to 4 μm. Control cells were treated identically but without added ribozyme. To determine the effect of ribozyme exposure on γ mRNA levels, a 3-mg aliquot of total RNA was slot-blotted and hybridized with γ subunit gene-specific probes. Total RNA was prepared from the transiently transfected cultured cells using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen Inc., as recommended by the manufacturer. The specificity of γ subunit probes was tested by Southern slot blot analysis against different γ cDNAs, including γ2, γ3, γ5, γ7, γ10, γ11, and γ12. The sequences of the probes that were used in this study were as follows: γ7, 5′-TGGGCTATGTTGTTAGTGGC-3′; γ12, 5′-GTCCTGACAATACGGAATGCC-3′; elongation factor 1a (EF1a), 1The abbreviations used are: EF1a, elongation factor 1a; RZ, ribozyme; Thio RZ, phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme; PGE1, prostaglandin E1. 5′-CGTTGAAGCCTACATTGTCC-3′. The probes were 3′-end-labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) and [α-32P]dATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The membrane was prehybridized with QuikHyb hybridization solution from Stratagene for 15 min at 30 °C and then hybridized with labeled probe for another 2 h at 30 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then washed once with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 38 °C. The hybridization signal was analyzed and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI. Values shown throughout this study are expressed as the mean ± S.E., unless otherwise noted. Cell membranes were prepared from control and γ7ribozyme-transfected cells, and the G proteins were extracted with 1% sodium cholate as described previously (15Robishaw J.D. Kalman V.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The G protein γ subunits were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide and transferred to Nitro-plus nitrocellulose (0.45-μm pore size, Micron Separations Inc.) using a high temperature transfer procedure described previously (16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the blots were probed with anti-peptide G protein subunit-specific antibodies, as described previously (16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Cali J.J.

Briefly, the nitrocellulose blots were blocked for 1 h in high detergent blotto (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% nonfat powdered milk, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% SDS) and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate primary anti-peptide antibody in high detergent blotto. The antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200 for A-67 (γ7), a dilution of 1:500 for B-69 (β1), a dilution of 1:300 for A-54 (αi2) and A56 (αi1, 3), a dilution of 1:5000 for β common antibody (SW/1 from NEN Life Science Products). After three successive 10-min washes with high detergent blotto, the nitrocellulose blots were incubated for 1 h with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment in high detergent blotto (1 × 105 dpm/ml, NEN Life Science Products). After three successive 10-min washes with high detergent blotto, the nitrocellulose blots were washed twice for 10 min each with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl, and 2 mmCaCl2. The blots were then subjected to autoradiography by exposure to Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the intensities of the immunodetectable bands were quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI. Approximately 1.4 × 106 HEK 293 cells were plated into six-well plates and transfected with γ7 ribozyme as described above. At 72 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with a variety of hormonal stimuli and then were analyzed for cAMP accumulation as described previously (20Krupinski J. Lehman T.C. Frankenfield C.D. Zwaagstra J.C. Watson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24858-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection with the γ7 ribozyme for 55 h, HEK 293 cells were labeled for 17 h with myo-[3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were subsequently stimulated with a variety of hormonal stimuli in the presence of 10 mm LiCl for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated cellular proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were extracted three times with 2 volumes of diethylether. Total [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was determined by retention and elution from Dowex AG1-X8 (100–200 mesh, formate form) columns using a standard procedure (21Berridge M.J. Dawson R. Downes P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Human HEK 293 cells are an excellent model cell system for studying the role of heterotrimeric G protein subunits in signal transduction. They contain a variety of endogenous receptor-G protein-effector signaling pathways. Of particular interest, we have found that they express multiple receptors that regulate either adenylylcyclase or phospholipase C activity, thereby allowing us to test the hypothesis that receptors that converge on a common effector may utilize G proteins composed of the same α subunit but distinct βγ subunits. Furthermore, consistent with the variety of endogenous receptor-G protein-effector signaling pathways, we have identified a number of G protein γ subunits that are expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in these cells. As shown in TableI, 7 of the 11 known γ subunits have been detected at the RNA level, with 6 of the γ subunits also being detected at the protein level. This varied complement of γ subunits allows us to directly test the hypothesis that the γ subunits contribute to the specificity of signaling pathways in vivo. To begin to elucidate the functions of the individual γ subunits in these cells, we have initially focused on the γ7 subunit for two reasons. First, the γ7 subunit is widely expressed in a number of tissues, thereby suggesting a possible role of this protein in a common receptor-effector pathway. Second, the γ7 subunit is readily detected at both the RNA and protein levels in these cells, thereby allowing its fate to be easily followed.Table IG protein γ composition of 293 cellsγ subunitRNAProteinγ2YesYesγ3NoNoγ4YesNoγ5YesYesγ7YesYesγ10YesYesγ11YesYesγ12YesYes Open table in a new tab To determine the functional role of the γ7 subunit, we designed and utilized a hammerhead ribozyme that was targeted to the GUC sequence at positions +3 to +5 in relation to the transcription start site of the mRNA encoding the γ7 subunit. Since this study was ultimately aimed at using the ribozyme in vivo, the ribozyme was chemically synthesized as a chimeric DNA-RNA construct to improve resistance to endonucleases. As shown in Fig. 1, the constructed chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme consisted of a catalytic core containing ribonucleotides (inlowercase letters) and flanking sequences containing deoxyribonucleotides (in capital letters), which hybridize to the γ7 mRNA transcript by Watson-Crick base pairing. In addition, we examined the effect of adding two phosphorothioate linkages to the 3′-end of the chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme on improving the stability and cellular delivery of the ribozyme in vivo. To confirm that the ribozyme was capable of cleaving the targeted γ7 RNA, the catalytic activity of the γ7ribozyme was examined using an in vitro synthesized γ7 RNA transcript. As shown in Fig.2 A, the RNA transcript synthesized from the γ7 cDNA generated a product of 418 bases that includes 21 bases of the multicloning site, 172 bases of 5′-untranslated sequence, 203 bases of translated sequence, and 22 bases of 3′-untranslated sequence. Upon addition of the ribozyme to the γ7 RNA transcript, two fragments of 220 and 198 bases were produced, corresponding to the predicted fragment sizes for cleavage at the targeted GUC site at positions +3 to +5 (Fig.2 A). This result indicated that ribozyme-mediated cleavage of the γ7 RNA transcript was site-specific. Since the ratio of ribozyme to template has previously been shown to influence the efficiency of cleavage (22Bertrand E. Rossi J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2904-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Chang P. Cantin E. Zaia J. Ladne P. Stephens D. Sarver N. Rossi J. Clin. Biotechnol. 1990; 2: 23-31Google Scholar, 24Sargueil B. Pecchia D. Burke J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7739-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we next varied the ratio of ribozyme to template over a 1000-fold range to optimize conditions for cleavage by the γ7 ribozyme. As shown in Fig.2 A, over 95% of the template was converted to cleavage products with a 10-fold or higher excess of ribozyme to template. Accordingly, the time course of cleavage was examined at a ribozyme:template ratio of 20:1. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the majority of the template was cleaved within 15 min of exposure to ribozyme, with essentially complete cleavage within 1 h. Taken together, these results confirm that the designed γ7 ribozyme elicited the expected catalytic activity. Since the γ7 subunit is a member of a large, multigene family, it was necessary to validate that the γ7 ribozyme cleaved the γ7 RNA transcript in a gene-specific manner. Therefore, we evaluated the specificity of the γ7ribozyme cleavage against in vitro synthesized γ2, γ3, γ5, γ7, γ10, γ11, and γ12 RNA transcripts. (The in vitro synthesized γ1, γ8, and γ9 RNA transcripts were not examined, since their corresponding mRNAs are not expressed in HEK 293 cells.) As shown in Fig. 3, the sizes of the full-length RNA transcripts varied from 418 to 1632 bases. No cleavage of the RNA transcripts occurred in the absence of the γ7 ribozyme (Fig. 3, Control panel). Upon addition of the γ7 ribozyme, cleavage of the γ7 RNA transcript into fragments of the expected sizes was observed (indicated by arrows in the right panel labeled γ7 RZ). Of particular importance, no cleavage of the γ2, γ3, γ5, γ10, γ11, and γ12 RNA transcripts occurred in the presence of the γ7 ribozyme. These data demonstrate that the γ7 ribozyme specifically cleaved its own template in a gene-specific manner. To examine its activityin vivo, the γ7 ribozyme was introduced into HEK 293 cells by transient transfection with LipofectAMINE. At 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted from cells, and the level of γ7 RNA was determined by Northern slot blotting analysis. Since ribozymes have been shown to be rapidly degraded in vivo (25Heidenreich O. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1904-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two modifications were made to try to improve the stability of the γ7 ribozyme. The first modification was to design the ribozyme as a chimeric DNA-RNA molecule (26Gu J. Veerapanane D. Rossi J. Natarajan R. Thomas L. Nadler J. Circulation Res. 1995; 77: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), while the second modification was to add two phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′-end of the chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme (27Shimayama T. Nishikawa F. Nishidawa S. Taira K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2605-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that the degree of RNA suppression achieved by the γ7 ribozyme was highly dependent on this latter modification. As shown in panel A, the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme (Thio RZ) was much more efficacious in suppressing the level of γ7 RNA than the γ7 ribozyme alone (RZ). The greatest reduction with the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme was observed at 48 h after transfection, where the level of the γ7 RNA was reduced to 40 ± 9% (n = 3) of its control level. Taken together, these results demonstrate the superior efficacy of the phosphorothioate-modified γ7ribozyme over the γ7 ribozyme alone in suppressing the level of the γ7 RNA in vivo. Accordingly, the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme was used in all of the subsequent experiments. To establish that the specificity of RNA cleavage was maintained uponin vivo delivery of the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme, we examined the effect of transfection with the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme on the levels of other RNAs that do not contain the predicted cleavage site. EF1a is expressed in a wide variety of cells at a relatively constant level. As shown in Fig. 4 B, transfection of cells with the γ7 ribozyme did not reduce the level of the EF1a RNA (112 ± 18%). As a more important control for the specificity of the γ7 ribozyme, we also examined the effect of the γ7 ribozyme on the expression of the γ12subunit at the RNA level. Of the 11 γ subunits cloned to date, the γ7 and γ12 subunits show the greatest homology, exhibiting 75% identity within the coding region at the nucleotide level. 2J. D. Robishaw, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 4 B, transfection of cells with the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme had no effect on the level of the γ12 RNA (115 ± 16%,n = 3), although in these same cells the level of the γ7 RNA was reduced to 40% of its control value. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that the effect of the phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme was highly specific for the targeted γ7 RNA when delivered in vivo. Next, we investigated whether the suppression in γ7 RNA was paralleled by a reduction in the amount of γ7 protein in cells transfected with the γ7 ribozyme. For this purpose, cells were transfected with either no ribozyme (Control) or phosphorothioate-modified γ7 ribozyme (Thio RZ). At 48 or 72 h after transfection, membranes were prepared from these cells and evaluated by immunoblotting with various antibodies. Because the greatest suppression of γ7protein was seen at 72 h after transfection (data not shown), cells were routinely harvested at 72 h after transfection in the experiments described below. Fig.5 A shows representative immunoblots where the nitrocellulose was cut along the 30-kDa marker, where the lower molecular weight portion of the blot was probed with an antibody (A-67) previously shown to specifically recognize the γ7 subunit (16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and where the higher molecular portion of the blot was probed with antibodies (A-54 and A-56) previously shown to detect the αi1,2,3 subunits (17Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the γ7 antibody detected a distinct band of 6.5 kDa in control cells that was noticeably reduced in the cells transfected with the phosphorothioate-modified γ7ribozyme. Identification of this band as the γ7 subunit is based on the findings that it has the same electrophoretic mobility as the recombinantly expressed γ7 subunit and is specifically recognized by an antibody shown previously to detect the γ7 subunit, but not the γ1, γ2/6, γ3, γ4, γ5, γ10, or γ11 subunits (16Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).2 Fig. 5 B shows the quantitation of these results in which the relative amounts of the γ7 protein were quantitated and then expressed as a percentage of the control level. Based on this analysis, the level of the γ7protein was suppressed to 15 ± 5% (n = 3) in ribozyme-treated cells compared with control cells. The specific action of the phosphorothioate-modified γ7ribozyme to suppress the level of the γ7 protein was further demonstrated by examining the effect of ribozyme on the levels of other G protein γ and α subunits. Recently, we identified a second band of approximately 7 kDa that is detected by the γ7 antibody (A-67) in HEK 293 cells. 3J. D. Robishaw, unpublished observation. The identity of this cross-reacting band is not known, but by process of elimination, it is likely to represent an alternatively spliced form of the human γ7 subunit, the newly identified human γ12subunit,3 or a novel γ subunit that has not been previously cloned. Of particular interest, this band of 7 kDa, designated γ7-like, was only marginally reduced in γ7 ribozyme-treated cells to 73 ± 14% (n = 3) of its control value (Fig. 5, A and B). Likewise, bands of 41 kDa that were detected with antibodies previously shown to be specific for the αi1,3, and αi2 subunits were present at roughly similar levels (97 ± 7%, n = 3) in cells transfected with or without the γ7 ribozyme (Fig. 5, A and B). Taken together, these results attest to both the efficacy and specificity of the γ7 ribozyme in suppressing the expression of γ7 subunit protein in vivo. Under physiological conditions, the G protein βγ subunits exist in a tightly associated complex, with some studies suggesting that the expression of the β and γ subunits may be linked (28Garritson A. van Galen P.J.M. Simonds W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Higgins J.B. Casey P.J. J.

Other yeast genes have been identified that are required for V-ATPase assembly but whose protein products do not co-purify with the enzyme complex. One such gene,VMA12, encodes a 25-kDa protein (Vma12p) that is predicted to contain two membrane-spanning domains. Biochemical analysis has revealed that Vma12p behaves as an integral membrane protein with both the N and C termini oriented toward the cytosol, and this protein immunolocalizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cells lacking Vma12p (vma12Δ), the 100-kDa subunit of the V0 complex (which contains six to eight putative membrane-spanning domains) was rapidly degraded (t½ ∼ 30 min). Protease protection assays revealed that the 100-kDa subunit was inserted/translocated correctly into the ER membrane of vma12Δ cells. These data indicate that Vma12p functions in the ER after the insertion of V0subunits into the ER membrane. We propose that Vma12p functions directly in the assembly of the V0 subunits into a complex in the ER, and that assembly is required for the stability of the V0 subunits and their transport as a complex out of this compartment.

Vma21p and Vma22p are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins required for V-ATPase function, yet these polypeptides are not part of the V-ATPase complex (24Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol.

Vma12p, Vma21p, and Vma22p may function as an assembly complex at the level of the ER, but we presently cannot rule out an earlier function for these proteins, such as translocation or insertion of V0polypeptides into the ER membrane. In the analysis reported here, Vma12p has been found to be an integral membrane protein that resides in the ER. Yeast cells lacking Vma12p (vma12Δ) rapidly degrade the 100-kDa V0subunit (Vph1p) at a rate that is independent of vacuolar proteases or secretory traffic exiting the ER. Vph1p is localized to the ER membrane in vma12Δ cells, where it is translocated and inserted normally. These results indicate that Vma12p functions in assembly of the V0 membrane complex after V0 subunits are inserted into the ER membrane. TableI lists the strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used in this study. All strains were grown as described previously (11Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol.

These strains were mated to create DJY60, which was transformed with a galactose-inducible HO plasmid to effect mating type switching. A halo assay was performed (28Sprague G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to identify a/a and α/α diploids (DJY71 and DJY72), which were mated to form the tetraploid VMA12::HA3 strain (DJY70). SF838-1D was gene converted to VMA12::HA1by loop-in of MunI-linearized pDJ17 and loop-out of VMA12 by passage over 5-FOA to create DJY68. To construct a vma12Δ sec12–4 ts strain, yeast strain MBY10–7A (sec12–4 ts) was first transformed with pRSY679 (URA3 SEC12; Ref. 29Barlowe C. Schekman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). VMA12 was then disrupted as described above. The SEC12 plasmid was removed by passage over 5-FOA to create DJY91 (vma12Δ sec12–4). Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table II. A 1.2-kilobase pairKpnI-SacI fragment encoding VMA12 was cloned into pRS316 (30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YEp352 (31Hill J.E. Meyers A.M.

Open table in a new tab See “Experimental Procedures” for complete description of the plasmids. Epitope tags were introduced into VMA12 by a two-step process. First, unique BglII sites were introduced into the VMA12 coding region of pDJ1 by making conservative base changes via site-directed mutagenesis (32Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) at base pair 644 and 386, creating pDJ5 and pDJ7. A 123-base pair BglII fragment encoding three 9-amino acid epitopes of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein HA1 (33Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Conolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) was cloned from pBJ7122 into pDJ5 and pDJ7 to create pDJ10 (VMA12::HA1) and pDJ12 (VMA12::HA3). High copy and integrating vectors of the VMA12::HA alleles were constructed by cloning the 1.3-kilobase pair KpnI-SacI fragments from pDJ10 and pDJ12 into YEp352 and pRS306 (30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, to create pDJ14 and pDJ16, and pDJ17 and pDJ19. Protein extracts were generated and quantitated as described previously (11Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed as described previously (34Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized using either alkaline phosphate-conjugated (Promega) or horse radish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham) secondary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies used in this study were as follows. Antibodies 10D7 and 7B1, used interchangeably or in combination, were used at 1:1000 to detect Vph1p as described previously (18Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody 13D11 was used at 1:1000 to detect Vma2p as described previously (18Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody to Dpm1p (clone 5C5-A7) that was generated against a TrpE-Dpm1p fusion protein provided by Peter Orlean (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) was used at 1:500. Monoclonal antibodies specific for Vph1p (10D7-A7-B2), Vma2p (13D11-B2), and Dpm1p (5C5-A7) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibodies used in this study were as follows. Affinity-purified antibodies against Vma12p, the HA epitope, phosphoglycerol kinase, Kar2p, Sec63p, and Vph1p were used at 1:1000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, 1:20,000, 1:5000, and 1:5,000, respectively (12Hirata R.

Vacuolar membranes were prepared and V-ATPase activity assays performed as described previously (18Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes were treated with either 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.5, or 0.5 m NaCl essentially as described by Bauerle et al. (11Bauerle C. Ho M.N. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12749-12757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were spheroplasted and lysed according to Feldheim et al. (37Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), except that instead of homogenization, cells were allowed to lyse osmotically on ice for 20 min before the removal of unlysed cells. Lysates were then subjected to subcellular fractionation as described in Horazdovsky and Emr (38Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions after centrifugation at 13,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 ×g to generate pellet and supernatant fractions. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (39Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies recognizing Vph1p and Eug1p were used at 1:20 and 1:50, respectively. Mouse antibody 12CA5 recognizing the HA epitope (Babco, Inc., Berkeley, CA) was preadsorbed to SF838-1D cells and used at 1:20 dilution. Cells were spheroplasted and lysed as described for subcellular fractionation (37Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Microsomes were collected at 30,000 × g and proteolyzed using either 0.1 mg/ml trypsin plus 0.1 mg/ml protease K as described previously (36Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.-O. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 0.004 mg/ml subtilisin Carlsberg. -EXPRE35S35S label was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled Vph1p and CPY was performed as described previously (24Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, after radiolabeling, spheroplasted cells were lysed in 0.6% SDS plus protease inhibitors and denatured for 5 min at 62 °C (Vph1p) or at 100 °C (CPY) before dilution and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-Vph1p sera or monoclonal anti-CPY sera. A Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot of Vma12p predicts two membrane-spanning domains for this protein (22Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ho M.N. Ohya Y. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 961-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this prediction, vacuolar membranes from wild type cells were treated on ice with chaotropic agents that solubilize membrane proteins to variable degrees. Treatment with 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, selectively solubilizes peripheral membrane proteins. NaCl (0.5 m) does not appreciably solubilize membrane proteins (40Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). By contrast, 0.5% Triton X-100 extensively solubilizes membrane proteins. After treatment with chaotropic agents, samples were separated into pellet and supernatant fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 30 min. Pellet and supernatant fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for the presence of marker proteins and Vma12p. Vph1p and Vma2p, an integral membrane and a peripheral membrane protein, respectively, fractionated as expected for the nature of their membrane association (Fig. 1). Vma12p fractionated with the membrane pellet when incubated in alkaline Na2CO3 and was completely solubilized in Triton X-100, indicating that Vma12p behaves biochemically like an integral membrane protein. Although low levels of Vma12p were found previously to fractionate with vacuolar membranes (22Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ho M.N. Ohya Y. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 961-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was unclear whether this resulted from the presence of contaminating membranes. To determine whether Vma12p is a vacuolar membrane protein, the extent of enrichment of Vma12p in vacuolar membranes was quantified (Fig.2). Proteins from crude extracts and vacuolar membranes were analyzed by quantitative Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, the V-ATPase subunit Vph1p was enriched 20–40-fold in vacuolar membranes relative to crude extracts, a level of enrichment typical of other known vacuolar integral membrane proteins tested (data not shown; 39). Vma12p was only enriched 2-fold in the vacuolar membrane fraction compared with crude extract, suggesting that it is probably not a vacuolar membrane protein. The ER resident protein Dpm1p (41Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17499-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also exhibited a 2-fold enrichment in the vacuolar fraction (Fig. 2). Thus, based on the low level of enrichment, Vma12p is likely to be present in membranes that contaminate the vacuolar membrane fraction. VMA12 cells were subjected to differential centrifugation to determine the subcellular location of Vma12p. The fractionation method of Horazdovsky and Emr (38Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) separates Golgi (P100), endosomal (P100), and cytosolic (S100) proteins from ER, vacuolar, and plasma membrane (P13) proteins. In this assay, the cytosolic protein phosphoglycerate kinase was found in the S100 fraction as expected (Fig.3). The ER membrane protein Dpm1p was found exclusively in the P13 fraction as expected. Vma12p was also found exclusively in the P13 fraction, suggesting that, inasmuch as Vma12p was not enriched in vacuolar membranes, it resides either in the ER or plasma membrane. Vma12p was next immunolocalized by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (39Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Initial attempts at IIF using anti-Vma12p antibodies were unsuccessful due to low levels of Vma12p expression. To immunolocalize Vma12p, we introduced the hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA) (33Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Conolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) at two different positions in Vma12p to create VMA12::HA1 and VMA12::HA3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Plasmid-borne VMA12::HA1 and VMA12::HA3 fully complemented the growth defects of the vma12Δ mutation, and vacuolar membranes isolated from these strains showed wild type levels of vacuolar ATPase activity (data not shown). When IIF experiments were performed with either plasmid-borne or integrated versions of VMA12-HA, staining of neither Vma12p-HA1 nor Vma12p-HA3 was sufficient to immunolocalize Vma12p. A tetraploid VMA12::HA3 strain was then constructed (DJY70), because increasing the ploidy of the strain had allowed Antebi and Fink (42Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) to immunolocalize Pmr1p-HA to Golgi membranes. In DJY70 cells, Vma12p-HA3 exhibited a perinuclear staining pattern typical of ER proteins, as revealed by staining DNA with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig.4 A). In the same cells, Eug1p, a known ER protein (43Tachibana C. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), also exhibited perinuclear immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that Vma12p is an ER membrane protein. It had been shown previously that Vma12p was required for the membrane association of the hydrophilic ER membrane protein Vma22p (25Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22329-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the absence of Vma12p, Vma22p is found in the cytosol, suggesting that a portion of Vma12p is exposed to the cytosol and responsible for Vma22p's membrane association. The Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot for Vma12p predicts that the N-terminal ∼60% and the C-terminal ∼20% are hydrophilic. To identify cytosolic portions of Vma12p with which Vma22p might interact, microsomes from yeast cells expressing either Vma12p-HA1 or Vma12p-HA3 (tagged in the C- and N-terminal domains, respectively) were subjected to partial proteolysis (36Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.-O. Schekman R. Kepes F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion products were generated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed for marker proteins and Vma12p-HA. Kar2p, a soluble lumenal protein of the ER (44Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), was not digested under these conditions (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–4), demonstrating that the membranes remained intact throughout the incubation (37Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Sec63p, an integral membrane protein of the ER, was cleaved on its cytosolic C-terminal tail to a slightly faster migrating species (Fig. 5 A, lanes 5–8), indicating that proteins found in the microsomal membranes were both accessible to proteases and in their proper orientation (37Feldheim D. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3288-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (193)"
https://openalex.org/W1972130106,"We investigated which features of the substrate specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase could be assigned to the central domain of the 288-residue HIV-1 integrase protein, composed of amino acids 50–212. This domain contains the active site and shares structural homology with a large family of polynucleotidyl transferases. Using model substrates with defined alterations in critical features we found that this domain alone is sufficient for recognition of: 1) the phylogenetically conserved CA/TG base pairs near the viral DNA end; 2) the 5′-terminal dinucleotide that is left unpaired after end processing; and 3) target DNA flanking the site of joining. Future efforts aimed at identifying specific amino acids involved in recognition of these key substrate features can now be targeted at this domain.

Future efforts aimed at identifying specific amino acids involved in recognition of these key substrate features can now be targeted at this domain. Integration of a double-stranded DNA copy of the retroviral genome into a host cell chromosome is essential for viral replication. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that retroviralintegration requires two viral components, integrase and the U3 and U5 att sites, which are phylogenetically conserved sequences at the ends of viral DNA. Analysis in vivo and in vitrohas revealed that integrase processively catalyzes two chemical steps. In 3′-end processing, integrase cleaves two nucleotides from the 3′-ends of the double-stranded viral DNA, leaving a phylogenetically invariant CA dinucleotide sequence at the 3′-termini of the recessed viral DNA ends. In the second chemical step, integrase catalyzes the joining of the two 3′-recessed viral DNA ends to sites on opposite strands of a target DNA, separated by 5 base pairs (bps) 1The abbreviations used are: bp(s), base pair(s); HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. in the case of HIV-1. The gaps that flank this product of the joining reaction are repaired by a pathway that remains uncharacterized. The chemical reactions catalyzed by integrase can be studied in vitro using model oligonucleotide substrates and purified recombinant protein. We evaluated the specificity of the isolated core domain of HIV-1 integrase. A minimal catalytically active peptide has been identified by deletion analysis, comprised of amino acids 50–186 (1Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To ensure reasonable dynamic range in our assays, we used a slightly larger, more active polypeptide, consisting of amino acids 50–212 (1Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of this domain has been solved, and it reveals striking structural homology to a larger family of polynucleotidyl transferases (2Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). This domain contains the phylogenetically conserved DD35E motif that defines the active site (3Bujacz G. Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

Using model substrates with defined alterations in features known to be critical for the catalytic specificity of full-length integrase, we assessed the ability of the isolated core domain to distinguish between altered and wild-type substrates. Integrase can carry out a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction, termed disintegration, on a model substrate that mimics the product of integration of a single viral DNA end, yielding a free cleaved viral DNA end and a ligated target DNA strand (9Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A divalent metal ion is required for catalysis of disintegration as well as for end processing and joining (9Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O.

The disintegration substrate allows one to analyze the catalytic properties of mutant derivatives of integrase, such as the core domain, which have defects in requirements for the forward reaction. The orientation of viral and target DNA with respect to the active site is similar for disintegration and joining.2 Therefore, specificity observed in the context of a disintegration substrate is likely to follow the same rules that govern specificity in the integration reaction; indeed, similar catalytic specificity for disintegration and joining has been observed (12Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3896-3907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7869-7878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We monitored the sensitivity of the core domain to alterations in the following substrate features: the phylogenetically conserved CA/TG bps located immediately internal to the processing site at the viral DNA end, the 5′-dinucleotide left unpaired at the viral DNA end after 3′-end processing, and target DNA flanking the joining site. The infectivity of retroviruses containing mutations in the CA/TG bps is reduced 10−5 in vivo (15Roth M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Goff S.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 47-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); mutations in these bps can also seriously compromise activity of model substrates in vitro (11Craigie R. Fujiwara T.

The 5′-terminal dinucleotide on the unprocessed strand increases the stability of integrase-viral DNA end complexes formed in vitro and enhances processivity between the end processing and joining steps (23Ellison V. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although most sites can be used at some level as integration targets, HIV-1 integrase has target site preferences; these preferences are determined both by DNA structure (24Pryciak P.M. Varmus H.E.

A. 1995; 92: 10334-10338Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Domain swaps among integrases from different retroviral species indicate that the core domain, in large part, determines target site preferences as well as specificity for the species-specific features of the viral DNA end (28Katzman M. Sudol M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pahl A. Flugel R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8361-8369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These experiments, however, do not allow the identification of the integrase domain that recognizes the conserved features of the viral DNA end. The crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 integrase has been solved to 2.5 Å (2Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Crystallization was made possible by the discovery of a mutation, F185K, which enhances solubility but does not affect the in vitro biochemical properties of integrase, except to lower the K d of the constitutive dimer formed in vitro (31Jenkins T.M. Hickman A.B. Dyda F. Ghirlando R. Davies D.R. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6057-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reveals an extensive hydrophobic interface between two monomers. The results presented here on substrate specificity, together with the biophysical and structural information available for the core domain, place new constraints on models of integrase-substrate interactions within the multimeric complex that catalyzes end processing and joining. Full-length HIV-1 integrase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 polymerase promoter system and purified as described previously (14Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A deletion construct containing amino acids 50–212 of HIV-1 integrase in the expression strain BL21 was a gift from Tim Jenkins. The gene contains a mutation, F185K, which increases the solubility of the protein. In vitro characterization of full-length integrase containing this mutation has demonstrated that its biochemical properties are virtually indistinguishable from the wild-type protein, with the exception that the mutation appears to allow the core domain protein to form a tighter dimer in solution (31Jenkins T.M. Hickman A.B. Dyda F. Ghirlando R. Davies D.R. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6057-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The construct encoding the core domain also codes for six histidines appended to the amino terminus. The hexahistidine-tagged 50–212 (F185K) polypeptide was expressed in the same manner as full-length integrase but purified using Ni-affinity chromatography. The thawed bacterial pellet from a 2-liter culture grown in Luria broth (LB) was washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, then resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, and 2 mg/ml lysozyme. After 30 min on ice, the solution was sonicated with five 30-s pulses. After sonication, the cells were centrifuged at 18,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 45 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (TNM) containing 5 mm imidazole, then processed 30 times in a Dounce homogenizer. This high salt extract was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h, then centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded by gravity onto a 1-ml column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Ni-NTA resin, Qiagen) equilibrated in TNM containing 5 mm imidazole. The column was then washed with 20 column volumes of TNM containing 5 mm imidazole, then 20 column volumes of TNM containing 40 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted using a gradient of 40–600 mm imidazole in TNM. Fractions were pooled based on the Bradford assay and catalytic activity in disintegration assays. The pooled fractions were passed over a second 1-ml Ni-NTA column to eliminate contaminating nucleases. The pooled fractions were diluted 1:1 with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm CHAPS and incubated with thrombin at a concentration of 40 NIH units/mg integrase protein for 3 h at 16 °C, to cleave off the amino-terminal hexahistidine tag. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added to 1 μg/ml to inactivate the thrombin. The thrombin-digested material was loaded onto a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column. This column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer (HCDG) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CHAPS, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol with 100 mm NaCl. One ml each of HCDG containing 250 mm NaCl, 500 mm NaCl, 750 mm NaCl, or 1 m NaCl was added sequentially, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The 50–212 (F185K) polypeptide eluted in the 500, 750, and 1,000 mm NaCl steps. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. The fraction eluting with 750 mm NaCl was used for all experiments. The disintegration substrates used were either of the “dumbbell” type or the “Y-mer” type. Both have a branched structure, mimicking one viral end joined to target DNA (9Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The standard Y-mer-type substrate is composed of four oligonucleotides annealed together. The resulting structure has 19 bps representing viral DNA and 30 bps representing target DNA. Dumbbell refers to substrates in which one oligonucleotide folds upon itself to form the branched structure. The standard dumbbell substrate is a 40-mer (dby4), which folds to produce a substrate that contains 5 bps representing viral DNA, joined to 10 bps representing target DNA. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Emeryville, CA) and were purified by electrophoresis through a 10 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel before use in the construction of substrates for activity assays. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, 3,000 Ci/mmol). Unincorporated radioactive nucleotides were removed from the labeled oligonucleotide by centrifugation through 1-ml columns of Sephadex G-15 (Sigma). Preparation of the Y-mer substrate and structurally related substrates for disintegration assays was done as follows. The 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was added to a 3-fold molar excess of the other three oligonucleotides composing the Y-mer. Oligonucleotides in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl (TEN) were heated to 90 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Ficoll loading buffer was added to achieve a final concentration of 2% Ficoll 400, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol, and the sample was then electrophoresed on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel 16 h at 250 volts. The wet gel was autoradiographed, and the band corresponding to the completely annealed substrate was excised and eluted overnight in 0.5m ammonium acetate and 10 mm magnesium acetate. The supernatant fluid was concentrated in a Centricon-10 (Amicon) by centrifugation at 4 °C in an SS-34 rotor at 6,500 rpm. After concentration of the eluate from the gel slice, 2.5 ml of TEN was added, and the Centricon-10 was centrifuged another 2 h. The concentration of substrate was calculated based on the specific activity of the labeled oligonucleotide. The dumbbell and its related counterparts were prepared by heating the oligonucleotide in TEN to 90 °C and then slowly cooling to room temperature. Oligonucleotide sequences used to make the U5 viral DNA end Y-mer substrates were described in Chow et al. (9Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).

All disintegration reactions were performed in solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10–20 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The NaCl concentration was kept at or below 10 mmexcept where noted in the figure legend. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). Reactions were heated to 90 °C for 2–3 min before loading onto a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Quantitation of products was carried out with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. All reactions (except turnover experiments) were performed with 150 nm integrase and 20 nm substrate and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For turnover experiments, 100 or 200 nm integrase was incubated with 1,000 nm Y-mer at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at the indicated time intervals and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer. The concentrations of integrase cited throughout this report refer to protomers. Y-mer disintegration substrates with altered viral DNA portions were constructed to investigate the sensitivity of the HIV-1 catalytic core domain to gross structural alterations in the viral DNA. Alterations made to disintegration substrates included: 1) replacement of the viral DNA portion with single-stranded viral DNA (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9); 2) replacement of the viral DNA with a single adenosine nucleotide (Fig.1, lanes 4–6); 3) changing the phylogenetically conserved CA/TG bps of the viral DNA end to TC/GA (Fig. 1, lanes 10–12). A substrate in which the CA/TG bps were instead changed to GT/AC was also tested, and the results were qualitatively similar to those obtained for the CA/TG to TC/GA variant (data not shown). The core domain was clearly able to distinguish these grossly altered viral DNA ends from a wild-type viral DNA end (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). Under these reaction conditions, the core domain was more sensitive to these gross changes in the viral DNA end than was full-length integrase. To determine whether the core domain could specifically recognize the conserved CA/TG bps of the viral DNA end, we measured the catalytic activity of the core domain on Y-mer disintegration substrates with base substitutions in the phylogenetically conserved A/T bp (Fig.2 A) or C/G bp (Fig.2 B). Each substrate contained one of three types of alterations: 1) two complementary mutant bases substituted for the wild-type bp; 2) two noncomplementary mutant bases substituted for the wild-type bp; or 3) one mutant base mispaired with one wild-type base substituted for the wild-type bp. This approach allowed the effects of structure (matched or mismatched) to be distinguished from the effects of specific base substitutions. The amounts of product formed in reactions with wild-type substrate are shown in the two far right lanes in Fig. 2, indicated by A/T in panel A and C/G in panel B. The pair of bases substituted for the A/T bp (panel A) or the C/G bp (panel B) is specified below the column. For this analysis, 150 nmintegrase and 20 nm substrate were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At least two nucleotide changes were tested at each of the four positions in the viral CA/TG bps. Changing the wild-type A/T bp to the complementary mutant bp G/C or T/A resulted in a 21- or 14-fold decrease, respectively, in product formed from a disintegration substrate by the core domain. Similarly, changing the C/G bp to G/C or T/A led to a 20- or 15-fold reduction, respectively, in product formed from a disintegration substrate by the core domain. Thus, the core domain can recognize these conserved bases in the viral DNA end. Indeed, the core domain was more sensitive to alterations of these bps than was full-length integrase, which produced roughly 2-fold less product from substrates with the wild-type A/T bp changed to G/C or T/A and roughly 3-fold less product from disintegration substrates in which the wild-type C/G bp was changed to G/C or T/A. Similar reductions in the disintegration activity of the core domain were observed when these bps were replaced by noncomplementary alternative base pairs. Replacing the wild-type A/T bp with T/C or G/A resulted in a 4- or 20-fold reduction, respectively, in product formed from a disintegration substrate. Replacing the wild-type C/G bp with G/A or T/C led to a 50-fold and 6-fold reduction, respectively, in product formed from a disintegration substrate by the core domain. Although full-length integrase also showed reduced activity on these mutant substrates, the effect of the mutations was less severe (2–3-fold less product than on a wild-type substrate). Substrates in which a wild-type base was paired with a noncomplementary base, generating a mismatch, were, in general, worse substrates than the wild-type substrate for both full-length integrase and the core domain. Once again, the viral DNA end mutations had a more severe effect on the activity of the core domain than on full-length integrase. The core domain produced 4–100-fold less product from mismatched substrates in which the A, C, or G bases were altered and mispaired with a wild-type base (the A/T bp was changed to G/T and T/T, the C/G bp was changed to G/G, T/G, C/C, and C/A) than on a wild-type substrate. For full-length integrase, identical mutations in the substrate resulted in up to an 8-fold decrease in product. One subset of mismatched mutant substrates actually proved to be slightly better substrates than wild-type substrates. The core domain and full-length integrase both generated slightly more product from substrates containing a wild-type A base mispaired with a C (panel A,A/C) or A base (panel A, A/A) than from a wild-type substrate (panel A, A/T). It has been demonstrated previously that incorporating mismatches at the A/T position in a viral DNA end substrate can facilitate end processing in vitro, strongly suggesting that fraying of the terminal bps of the viral DNA precedes cleavage (22Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mismatches at this position resulting from substitutions for the thymine residue in disintegration substrates lower the energetic barrier to fraying, enhancing disintegration of these substrates by both the core domain and full-length integrase. In contrast, mismatches at the A/T bp caused by substitutions for the adenosine residue did not enhance disintegration. Presumably, the favorable effect of the fraying did not outweigh the deleterious effect of the lack of base-specific interactions with the adenosine residue. In all cases (with the exception of substrates containing a wild-type A base mispaired with a mutant base), the mutant disintegration substrates were poorer substrates than the wild-type substrate for the core domain protein, indicating that features of integrase capable of recognizing the phylogenetically invariant CA/TG bps are contained in the core domain. Furthermore, the core domain was more sensitive to alterations in the conserved A/T and C/G bps than was full-length integrase, despite their similar activity on wild-type substrates (either a U5 or U3 viral DNA end; data shown for the U5 end only). The hypersensitivity of the core domain to mutations in these bps may be a result of the loss of the nonspecific DNA binding activity of the COOH terminus (33Engelman A. Hickman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Puras-Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 35Vink C. Oude Groeneger A.M.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), making the core domain more dependent on the remaining specific contacts with the CA/TG bps. The disintegration activity of the core domain of HIV-1 integrase has been reported to be lower than that of full-length integrase (1Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We attribute this discrepancy with our results to the different reaction conditions used. NaCl and MnCl2 titrations revealed that the isolated core domain was extremely sensitive to the ionic milieu of the reaction. Concentrations of NaCl or MnCl2 above 10 mm caused a precipitous drop in the activity of the core domain (data not shown). Full-length HIV-1 integrase, in contrast, could catalyze disintegration under reaction conditions containing up to 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm MnCl2. Electrostatic interactions thus appear to play a critical role in the residual DNA binding activity of the core domain. When disintegration reactions were carried out in solutions containing 10 mm NaCl or less, the core domain often produced slightly more product than full-length integrase, under standard conditions of enzyme excess. This observation prompted the comparison of turnover in disintegration reactions catalyzed by the two proteins. The core domain can turn over faster than full-length integrase in reactions using a wild-type Y-mer disintegration substrate (Fig.3); the k cat of the core domain was 1.5 h−1, whereas the k cat of full-length integrase was 0.26 h−1, under reaction conditions favorable to the activity of the core domain. Aliquots were taken at indicated time intervals from reactions containing 1,000 nm wild-type disintegration substrate and 200 nm protein. Each point plotted in Figs. 3and 4 represents the average of two independent determinations. The apparent difference in activity may be an underestimate because the concentration of NaCl in these reactions (16 mm) was sufficient to inhibit partially the activity of the core domain but not that of full-length integrase. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in a similar experiment carried out with 100 nm protein and 1,000 nm substrate (data not shown). (The disintegration substrate was stored in 50 mmNaCl to prevent dissociation of the strands; the large volume of substrate added in these reactions resulted in the relatively “high” concentration of NaCl.)Figure 4Turnover rate in disintegration reactions catalyzed by full-length HIV-1 integrase or the core domain is increased in the absence of the 5′-dinucleotide of the viral DNA end. 1,000 nm Y-mer disintegration substrate was incubated with 200 nm core domain or full-length integrase at 37 °C.

Screens for in vivo recombination and repressor cleavage activities show Gln194 to be intolerant of all substitutions. Analyses of three mutant proteins (Q194N, Q194E, and Q194A) show that although basal enzyme function is maintained, each protein no longer displays an ATP-induced increase in DNA binding affinity. High salt activation of RecA function is also disrupted by these mutations. In contrast, ATP-induced changes in the oligomeric structure of RecA are maintained in the mutant proteins. These results demonstrate that Gln194 is a critical “allosteric switch” for ATP-induced activation of RecA function but is not the exclusive mediator of ATP-induced changes in RecA.

The Escherichia coli RecA protein is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a central role in the processes of recombinational DNA repair, homologous genetic recombination, and the cellular SOS response to DNA damage (1West S.C.

The binding of RecA to ssDNA is regulated in a classic allosteric fashion, whereby the binding of ATP induces a high affinity DNA binding state of the protein (7Silver M.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6066-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the presence of ADP, or in the absence of cofactor, RecA exhibits a low affinity (>20 μm) for ssDNA (7Silver M.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6066-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the helical RecA protein filament has been solved in both the absence and presence of ADP (9Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 10Story R.M. Steitz T.A.

Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 189-197Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite this, the ATP binding site shows a remarkable conservation of structure compared with several other nucleotide-binding proteins (e.g. p21ras, EF-Tu, and adenylate kinase), and Story and Steitz (10Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) were able to model specific determinants of both ATP binding and hydrolysis in the RecA structure. In addition, the structure provided valuable insight into a possible allosteric mechanism for ATP-induced high affinity binding to ssDNA. The carboxyamide side chain of Gln194 extends into the ATP binding site and would be in very close proximity to the γ-phosphate of bound ATP (Fig. 1). Gln194immediately precedes one of two disordered loops in the structure (L2, residues 195–209) that were proposed to be part of the DNA binding sites (9Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Recent work has, in fact, provided strong evidence that L2 comprises all or a large part of the ssDNA binding site within RecA (12Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Malkov V.A. Camerini-Otero R.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) proposed that upon ATP binding Gln194 interacts with the nucleotide γ-phosphate thereby causing L2 to assume a conformation with high affinity for ssDNA. Upon ATP hydrolysis this interaction would be lost, returning L2 to a low affinity DNA binding conformation. In this study, we show that mutations at Gln194 prohibit the formation of a high affinity ssDNA binding state when ATP is bound. In addition, mutations at Gln194 block the high salt activation of RecA function. These results indicate that Gln194 is an important “on-off” switch required for the general activation of RecA function. Labeled NTPs and dNTPs were from NEN Life Science Products. PEI-cellulose chromatography plates were from J. T. Baker Inc. Single-stranded RV-1 DNA, an M13 derivative, was used for in vitro ATPase and repressor cleavage assays and was purified as described (15Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 27: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An 86-base oligonucleotide used in the ssDNA binding assays and mutagenic oligonucleotides were made with an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) used in both the ATPase and dsDNA binding assays was NcoI-linearized pTRecA220 (≈5, 500 base pairs (16Skiba M.C. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). LexA protein was a generous gift from Dr. John Little and Donald Shepley (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Arizona). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Klenow DNA polymerase I large fragment were from New England Biolabs. Sequenase version 2.0 was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher and Schuell. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and mitomycin C were from Sigma. Mutations were introduced at position 194 using a modification of a previously described cassette mutagenesis procedure (17Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two 81-base oligonucleotides corresponding to the top and bottom strands encoding residues Thr186 to Asn213 were synthesized such that codon 194 read NN(G/C) and all other bases were the wild type recA sequence. Oligonucleotides were annealed, and the resulting cassette was ligated into AflIII/MluI-digested pTRecA332, a derivative of pTRecA322 (18Nastri H.G. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a unique AflIII site at position 187 and a unique MluI site at position 214. Plasmids were transformed into a ΔrecA strain, DE1663′ (18Nastri H.G. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and colonies were selected on LB-ampicillin plates. Amino acid substitutions were determined by DNA sequence analysis. The recombinational DNA repair activity of each mutant protein was determined using two genetic screens as described previously (18Nastri H.G. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell survival in the presence of mitomycin C and cell survival following exposure to different doses of UV light. The oligomeric distribution of wild type and mutant RecA proteins was determined using gel filtration chromatography as described previously (19Logan K.M. Skiba M.C. Eldin S. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant proteins (Q194A, Q194E, and Q194N) were purified using a previously described method (20Konola J.T. Nastri H.G. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8411-8419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and were determined to be >95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained gels. Proteins were quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and by optical density, using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 0.59 mg−1·ml (21Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No exonuclease activity was detected in any of these preparations, even at elevated concentrations of RecA (50 μm) in the nuclease assay. None of these mutations has any deleterious effect on the overall folded structure or thermal stability of the protein. Wild type RecA and each mutant protein showed identical circular dichroism profiles and measurements of θ222 nm as a function of temperature (5–90 °C) gave aT m = 53 ± 1 °C for all 4 proteins (data not shown). RecA-mediated cleavage of the LexA repressor was measured in vivo using strain DE1663′ as described previously (18Nastri H.G. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of purified wild type and mutant RecA proteins to mediate the autocleavage of the LexA repressorin vitro was assessed in the presence of ssDNA as described previously (20Konola J.T.

Ruigrok R.W.H. Timmins P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reaction buffer contained 50 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.6 m NaOAc, 5 mm ATPγS, 5% glycerol and was brought to a final pH of 7.0. Reactions (60 μl) were performed at 37 °C and contained RecA protein (0.5 mg/ml) which had been preincubated with 5 mmATPγS. LexA protein was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. During the time course samples (8 μl) were removed and EDTA was added to 100 mm. Intact LexA and cleavage products were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and quantitated using scanning densitometry (20Konola J.T. Nastri H.G. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8411-8419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP was measured under 3 different conditions, in the presence of ssDNA, dsDNA, or 1.8m NaCl. The ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity was measured as described previously (20Konola J.T.

Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity was measured essentially as described (23Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 20 mm sodium maleate (pH 6.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, 25 μm dsDNA (concentration of bases), 0.5 mm [α-32P]ATP (150 μCi/ml), and 2 μm purified RecA protein. These were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and 1-μl aliquots were spotted onto PEI cellulose. High salt activation of ATP hydrolysis was measured essentially as described (24Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 17.5 mmMg(OAc)2, 5 mm ATP (150 μCi/ml), 1.8m NaCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5 μm purified RecA protein. These were incubated at 37 °C, and 1-μl samples were diluted 1:10 in water prior to spotting onto PEI-cellulose. PEI plates were chromatographed in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid, and percent ATP hydrolysis was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (v5.6). Units of V i/E are mol of ADP·min−1·mol of RecA monomer−1. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed using a variation of a described procedure (25McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8835-8844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an apparatus similar to that described by Wong and Lohman (26Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Filters were prepared by soaking in 0.4 m KOH for 10 min followed by several washes with double distilled H20 until the pH approximated 7.0. Filters were equilibrated in binding buffer for at least 1 h prior to use. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl), 40 μm 5′-end-labeled ssDNA (concentration of bases), and where indicated, 0.5 mmATPγS. Reactions were started with the addition of the indicated amounts of protein and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were applied to the filter under suction, and the filters were washed with 2.0 ml of binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Filters were air-dried, and bound DNA was quantitated by analyzing air-dried filters with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (v5.6). Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed using a variation of a previously described procedure (25McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8835-8844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mmsodium maleate (pH 6.2), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA) for at least 1 h. Reaction mixtures contained 20 μm end-labeled dsDNA (concentration of bases), purified RecA protein, and where indicated, 0.5 mm ATPγS. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 15 min, and samples were applied to the filter under suction and washed with 2.0 ml of binding buffer. Double-stranded DNA binding was quantitated by analyzing air-dried filters with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (v5.6). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 μm purified RecA protein, and the indicated amounts of [α-32P]ATP (200 μCi/mmol). Mixtures were placed on ice, 4 cm from an 8-watt mercury vapor lamp (Sylvania G8T5), and irradiated for 45 min. Crosslinked products were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (v5.6). We obtained 16 of 19 possible substitutions at Gln194, including a conservative Asn, an isosteric Glu, and an Ala. 2The following substitutions were obtained at position 194: Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe Pro, Ser, Trp, Val. In vivo screens for recombinational DNA repair and LexA cleavage showed that these activities are completely dependent on the wild type Gln residue (data not shown). Each of the 16 mutants showed no survival greater than the ΔrecA control in the presence of mitomycin C or following exposure to UV, even under low dose conditions (0.3 μg/ml mitomycin C or 0.67 J/m2/s UV light). In addition, the LexA coprotease activity of each mutant was completely inhibited, a result which was confirmed by in vitro LexA cleavage assays (see below). RecA exhibits two distinct binding affinities for ssDNA, a low affinity in the absence of any nucleotide cofactor or the presence of ADP, and a high affinity in the presence of cofactor (7Silver M.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6066-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We show that in the absence of nucleotide wild type RecA protein binds to ssDNA with an apparent K d ≈20 μm (Fig. 2 A). Each mutant protein tested, Q194A, Q194E, and Q194N, exhibits a comparable apparent affinity, although the Q194N protein appears to have a slightly reduced binding capacity (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of ATPγS, however, a dramatic increase is seen in the affinity of wild type RecA for ssDNA compared with the mutant proteins (Fig. 2 B). Wild type RecA now binds the ssDNA substrate with an apparent K d ≈1 μm, whereas none of the 3 mutant proteins shows any change in affinity for ssDNA. These results indicate that the mutations at position 194 render the proteins unable to undergo the ATP-induced transition required for high affinity ssDNA binding. An essential control was to test the ability of the mutant proteins to bind ATP. Using a UV crosslinking procedure we show that ATP binding by each of the 3 mutant proteins (Q194A, Q194E, and Q194N) is very similar to that of wild type RecA (Fig.3). Proteins that had been heat-denatured prior to UV exposure show no crosslinking. These results show that the inability of the mutant proteins to assume a high affinity ssDNA binding state is not due simply to a defect in ATP binding. In solution RecA protein exists as a heterogeneous population of oligomers, ranging in size from monomers, dimers, and hexamer-sized rings to larger filaments and bundles of filaments (27Brenner S.L. Zlotnik A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Heuser J. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Wilson D.H. Benight A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7351-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ruigrok R.W.H. DiCapua E. Biochemie. 1991; 73: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP this distribution is shifted such that bundles of filaments are disrupted and the average filament length is shorter (27Brenner S.L. Zlotnik A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Heuser J. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Wilson D.H. Benight A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7351-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a recently developed gel filtration assay (19Logan K.M. Skiba M.C. Eldin S. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to assess any effect that mutations at position 194 may have on the oligomeric properties of RecA, as well as the effect of ATP on the oligomeric distribution. Our results show that substitution of Gln194 with Ala, Glu, or Asn has no effect on the oligomeric distribution of RecA and importantly, that each mutant protein shows an ATP-induced shift in this distribution identical to that observed for wild type RecA (Fig.4). Addition of ATPγS shifts the peak representing long RecA filaments and bundles to a smaller size (Fig. 4and Ref. 19Logan K.M. Skiba M.C. Eldin S. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results again show that each mutant RecA protein is capable of binding ATP and that conformational changes associated with the ATP-induced shift in the distribution of RecA oligomers are maintained and therefore not transmitted through Gln194. The ATPase activity of RecA protein is stimulated upon binding to either ssDNA or dsDNA (23Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA wild type RecA exhibits a low level ATPase activity at pH 7.5 (V i/E = 0.2) whereas in the presence of a ssDNA cofactor activity increases significantly (V i/E = 17.4; Fig.5). While the basal rate of ATP turnover for the mutant proteins is similar to that of wild type RecA (V i/E ≈0.2; Fig. 5 A), no ssDNA-dependent increase in activity is observed (Fig.5 B). At pH 6.2 the catalytic efficiency of RecA increases approximately 30-fold in the presence of dsDNA (23Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the Gln194mutant proteins maintains a wild-type level of DNA-independent ATPase activity at pH 6.2 (V i/E = 0.5). However, an increase in the presence of dsDNA was seen only with wild type RecA (data not shown). Control experiments showed that wild type and mutant proteins bound equivalent low levels of dsDNA in the absence of ATPγS, yet only wild type RecA displayed a significant ATP-dependent increase in dsDNA binding (data not shown). These results demonstrate that mutations at Gln194 block the DNA-dependent activation of ATPase activity but do not affect the basal level of DNA-independent ATP turnover. In the presence of both nucleotide and ssDNA cofactors RecA mediates the autoproteolysis of the LexA repressor (5Little J.W. Edmiston S.H. Pacelli L.Z. Mount D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). While wild type RecA catalyzes a significant level of LexA autoproteolysis (95% cleaved/40 min) this activity is completely lacking in each of the 3 mutant proteins (data not shown). In the absence of any DNA cofactor, but in presence of high salt, wild type RecA protein is activated for both ATP hydrolysis (24Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and LexA cleavage (22DiCapua E. Ruigrok R.W.H. Timmins P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because mutations at Gln194 prohibit high affinity DNA binding required for both of these activities we determined whether the Q194A, Q194E, and Q194N mutations also affected high salt activation of RecA function. We found that although the ATPase activity of wild type RecA was greatly stimulated in the presence of 1.8 m NaCl (V i/E = 23) the 3 mutant proteins showed only very low activity under these conditions (Fig.6). Similarly, in the presence of 0.6m NaOAc wild type RecA catalyzed a significant level of LexA autoproteolysis (50% cleaved/40 min), yet this activity was lacking in each mutant protein (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the wild type Gln194 side chain is necessary for the general activation of RecA function and supports the suggestion by Pugh and Cox (24Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that salt activation of RecA is “functionally mimicking the ionic interaction of the protein with DNA.” In the presence of ATP and elevated salt concentrations, if 3 to 4 anions bind to the same sites within RecA as do phosphate groups on the DNA backbone (24Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 76-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Leahy M.C. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6954-6960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our data show that Gln194 mediates the ATP-induced occupancy of these sites giving rise to an activated RecA-ATP-DNA (or RecA-ATP-salt) complex. In future studies it would be interesting to determine the ion occupancy of the Gln194 mutant proteins. NTP-induced conformational change is a common theme for activation of enzyme function.

Nature. 1997; 387: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) have identified specific protein-nucleotide interactions which mediate conformational changes leading to activation of protein function. Additionally, the position of residues in the ATP binding site of the PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilusshows a striking similarity to those in RecA (39Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For example, in addition to residues proposed to be involved in Mg2+binding (Asp223 in PcrA, Asp144 in RecA) and the catalysis of ATP hydrolysis (Glu224 in PcrA, Glu96 in RecA), Gln254 occupies a position in PcrA very similar to Gln194 in RecA. Subramanya et al. (39Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) propose that ATP-induced effects on the DNA binding affinity by neighboring regions are mediated by Gln254. Our data identify Gln194 as a NTP-binding site “γ-phosphate sensor” in that mutations at this residue disrupt only the ATP-induced increase in RecA activities and not the basal level functions or properties of the protein. For example, the low level DNA-independent ATP hydrolysis seen with wild type RecA is maintained for each of the Gln194 mutant proteins indicating that Gln194 is not an important component of the intrinsic RecA ATPase catalytic mechanism. In addition, Gln194 appears not to be an important determinant of ATP binding because Asn, Glu, and Ala mutations show binding profiles similar to wild type RecA. We also show that each of the 3 mutant proteins maintains a low affinity binding to ssDNA in the absence of ATP similar to wild type RecA, and therefore, Gln194 is not a determinant of this DNA binding property. We cannot necessarily exclude the possibility that Gln194 interacts with DNA in the activated RecA-ATP-DNA complex. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 193–212, which include the entire L2 region, Voloshin et al. (14Voloshin O.N. Wang L. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1996; 272: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) identified position 203 as an important determinant of DNA binding. Studies using peptides with substitutions at Gln194 could assist in defining a potential role for this residue in DNA binding. Although our data demonstrate the importance of Gln194 in transmitting allosteric information within the RecA protein structure it certainly does not exclude other residues, perhaps within the L2 DNA binding region, as also participating in ATP-induced allosteric effects. We note that specific ATP-induced changes in the oligomeric structure of RecA are not blocked by mutations at Gln194(Fig. 4). Therefore, other residues must play important roles in mediating nucleotide-induced changes in RecA structure and/or function as the protein progresses through the catalytic cycle. We thank Drs. Reid Gilmore and Carlos Hirschberg for the use of their fast protein liquid chromatography system, Karen Logan for technical assistance, and Drs. Wali Karzai and Robert Sauer for the use of their Aziz CD spectropolarimeter."
https://openalex.org/W2002466618,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) functions as the master regulator of the heat shock response in eukaryotes. We have previously shown that, in addition to its role as a transcription factor, HSF1 stimulates the activity of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK is composed of two components: a 460-kDa catalytic subunit and a 70- and 86-kDa heterodimeric regulatory component, also known as the Ku protein. We report here that HSF1 binds specifically to each of the two components of DNA-PK. Binding occurs in the absence of DNA. The complex with the Ku protein is stable and forms at a stoichiometry close to unity between the Ku protein heterodimer and the active HSF1 trimer. The binding is blocked by antibodies against HSF1. Our results show that HSF1 also binds directly, but more weakly, to the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. Both interactions are dependent on a specific region within the HSF1 regulatory domain. This sequence is necessary but not sufficient for HSF1 stimulation of DNA-PK activity. The ability of HSF1 to interact with both components of DNA-PK provides a potential mechanism for the activation of DNA-PK in response to heat and other forms of stress."
https://openalex.org/W2012916047,"Prolonged exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin or angiotensin II induces hypertrophy and increases expression of muscle-specific genes including smooth muscle α-actin (SM-α-actin). These vasoconstrictors signal through G-proteins, including members of the Gq family. To further investigate the role of Gq family members, VSMC were transfected with a constitutively active mutant of a Gq family member, Gα16(Gα16Q212L). Stable expression of Gα16Q212L persistently stimulated phospholipase C, resulting in increased basal levels of inositol phosphates. These cells were hypertrophied and expressed elevated levels of SM-α-actin compared with wild-type VSMC or cells transfected with a control plasmid (Neo). SM-α-actin promoter activity was markedly increased in cells stably or transiently expressing Gα16Q212L. Basal c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity was increased 3–9-fold in cells stably expressing Gα16Q212L, while basal activity of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERKs) was unaffected. Transient expression of a kinase inactive JNK kinase partially inhibited induction of SM-α-actin promoter activity in response to vasoconstrictors or expression of Gα16Q212L. These results indicate that expression of constitutively active Gα16 in VSMC mimics the effects of vasoconstrictors on hypertrophy and muscle-specific gene expression, and activation of JNK may play a role in these responses.

Stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), which signal through tyrosine kinase receptors, results in cell proliferation (1Kariya K. Kawahara Y. Tsuda T. Fukuzaki H. Takai Y. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 251-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) while stimulation by vasoconstrictors such as arginine vasopressin (AVP) or angiotensin II (AII) as sole agents results in hypertrophy of cells with no significant increase in cell number (2Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 3Geisterfer A.A.T. Owens G.K.

These two classes of agents have also been shown to have opposing effects on the expression of muscle-specific genes including the smooth muscle isoform of α-actin (SM-α-actin). Vasoconstrictors increase both steady-state protein and mRNA levels for SM-α-actin, whereas PDGF decreases expression of SM-α-actin and suppresses the vasoconstrictor-induced increases (5Turla M.B. Thompson M.M. Corjay M.H. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that these effects are mediated through regulation of the SM-α-actin promoter, involving two CArG elements (6Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AVP and AII signal through “seven-membrane spanning” receptors coupled to G-proteins. In VSMC, both AVP and AII, acting through a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, probably Gq, cause activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cβ, (7Thibonnier M. Regul. Pept. 1992; 38: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), leading to the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). This increase in intracellular Ca2+ is likely to be responsible for the acute constrictor effects of these agents. The G-proteins and effector pathways involved in mediating the longer term effects of vasoconstrictors on induction of cellular hypertrophy and smooth muscle gene expression are much less well understood. Indeed, G-protein coupled receptors have been shown to couple to multiple G-proteins in the same cell type, and it is conceivable that the longer-term effects of AVP and AII involve G-proteins distinct from those involved in the acute contractile responses. Vasoconstrictors have been shown to stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) members of the family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family in VSMC (8Kribben A. Li X. Wieder E.D. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERK pathway has been implicated in mitogenesis in other cell types (9Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar) and thus is an obvious candidate for mediating the growth-promoting actions of vasoconstrictors on VSMC. Other members of the MAP kinase family, the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs)/stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are strongly activated by G-protein-coupled receptors in other cell types (10Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar); however, their role in VSMC is not well described. Both ERKs and JNKs are regulated in a parallel fashion involving distinct dual-specificity protein kinases, MEK for the ERKs, and JNKK or MKKs for the JNKs (11Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the effects of expressing constitutively active forms of members of the Gαq family in rat aortic VSMC. Our results indicate that activation of this family of G-proteins is sufficient to mimic the effects of vasoconstrictors on hypertrophy and induction of SM-α-actin expression and suggest that the JNK/SAPK pathway participates in this process.

The Bradford protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). Rat aortic VSMC were isolated and subcultured as described previously (12Li X. Tsai P. Wieder E.D. Kribben A. Van Putten V.

Helfrich B. Mitchell F.M. Bunn Jr., P.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Constructs were transfected into GP + E-86 cells, which produce a retrovirus specific for cells of rodent origin. Media from the GP + E-86 cells containing retrovirus were incubated for 24 h in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/ml) with early passage VSMC. The infected cells were then plated in fresh media containing 500 μg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for selection. Stable populations of G-418-resistant VSMC lines were then subcloned. Three clones representative of more than 20 examined were chosen for further characterization (α16-43, α16-54, and α16-77). The LNCX vector lacking a cDNA insert was packaged identically to pLNCX-α16Q212L and used as a control (Neo). Transfected cells up to passage 8 were used, and Neo controls of the same passage were employed in each experiment. For transient transfection experiments, cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of LNCX-α16Q212L or LNCX lacking an insert (Neo) as described below. Confluent α16Q212l-transfected VSMC grown on 35-mm plates were incubated overnight with 1 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]inositol in media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The labeled medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and once with media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mmLiCl2. Cells were then pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm LiCl2. AVP (10−7m) or AII (10−7m) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. Treated cells were placed on ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold MeOH:HCl (100:1) was added followed by 2 ml of CHCl3. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm, and total inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase were separated by anion-exchange chromatography (AG1-X8, Bio-Rad) as described previously (15Gupta S.K. Diez E. Heasley L.E. Osawa S. Johnson G.L. Science. 1990; 249: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips for 3 days and incubated in serum-free media overnight prior to the experiment. Changes in single cell intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were measured with the Ca2+-indicator Fura-2 using video imaging as described previously (8Kribben A. Li X. Wieder E.D. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal ratio was measured after addition of 10 μm ionomycin, and the minimal ratio was measured after subsequent addition of 10 mm Tris-EGTA. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the formula of Grynkiewicz (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Individual fields containing 10–20 cells were used for each determination. For determination of ERK activity, confluent cells on 35-mm plates were incubated in serum-free media for 1 day prior to experiments. Cells were stimulated by AVP (10−7m), AII (10−7m), PMA (10−6m), EGF (10−8m), or PDGF (20 ng/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. Following stimulation, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Supernatants were assayed for ERK activity by phosphorylation of MBP using a modified method described previously (8Kribben A. Li X. Wieder E.D. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed for 15 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 40 μl containing (final concentration) 12.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μg/ml protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 1 mg/ml MBP, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Twenty-five μl of the acidified reaction mixture were spotted on 1.5 × 1.5 cm phosphocellulose paper (Whatman-P81). After three washes in 75 mm phosphoric acid and one wash in acetone,32P-labeled protein was counted by liquid scintillation counting. ERK activity was expressed as pmol of 32P/min/mg of protein. In some experiments extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-ERK-1 and 1 μg of anti-ERK-2, and then for an additional hour with 100 μl of a 10% suspension of formalin-fixed S. aureus bacteria (Sigma). Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended, and assayed for ERK activity as described above. JNK activity was determined essentially as described previously (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated for 15 min and lysed in ERK lysis buffer. Following a 5-min microcentrifugation (10,000 × g), aliquots of the soluble extracts containing 400 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) adsorbed to glutathione-agarose (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The GST-c-Jun-(1–79) beads were washed four times by repetitive centrifugation in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (25,000 cpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE. The GST-c-Jun-(1–79) polypeptides were identified in Coomassie-stained gels, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter. Protein kinase C activity was determined using a permeabilized cell assay and a synthetic substrate (VRRRTLRRL) as described previously (18Heasley L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently co-transfected with 15 μg of the full-length pCAT-α-actin construct containing 713 base pairs of 5′ region previously described (6Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (pCATACT-(−713/52)), the pCAT-Basic vector (promoterless negative control), or the pCAT control vector (constitutively active positive control, Promega) together with 5 μg of a CMV-β-galactosidase vector (CLONTECH) by electroporation using a geneZAPPER (IBI). The cells were then plated overnight in culture medium containing 10% FCS for 18 h. Cells were then placed in Eagles MEM containing 0.2% FCS and exposed to AVP or PDGF for 72 h. Following exposure to agonists, cells were harvested by trypsinization and cell pellets frozen at −20 °C. The CAT activity of the cell lysates was measured using a modification of the thin layer chromatographic method as described by Gorman et al. (19Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity (20Carroll S.L. Bergsma D.J. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) present in the same sample to correct for transfection efficiency and was calculated as pmol chloramphenicol acetylated/h/milliunit of β-galactosidase. In experiments examining the effect of JNK, 10 μg of JNKK(K116R)) was added to the pCAT-α-actin and CMV-β-galactosidase vectors. For transient expression of α16, 5 μg of LNCX-α16Q212L or empty vector was added to the transfection mix, and cells were incubated as described above. To examine the role of members of the Gq family in the growth and differentiation of VSMC, rat aortic VSMC were initially transfected with constitutively active Gαq(α16Q209L). Multiple transfections using selection in media containing G-418 failed to isolate cells expressing functional αqQ209L, suggesting that expression of constitutively active Gαq may be cytotoxic to these cells. We therefore repeated these experiments using another member of the Gqfamily, Gα16(α16Q212L) (21Qian N.-X. Russel M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By examination of amino acid sequence, Gα16 has 57% identity with Gαq, and also has been shown to couple to phospholipase C (22Kozasa T. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9176-9180Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). G-418-resistant clones were screened by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for the α16 polypeptide. Cells transfected with a plasmid lacking an insert (Neo) had undetectable levels of α16 as expression is normally restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin (23Amatruda T.T.I. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). By phase contrast microscopy, cells expressing α16Q212L appeared elongated and enlarged compared with Neo or wild-type (WT) VSMC and formed networks or aggregates. This effect appeared to be specific for α16since stable expression of constitutively active αi2 or αo resulted in cells that were indistinguishable in morphology from Neo or wild-type cells (data not shown). Three representative clones (43, 54, and 77), having high levels of α16Q212L expression were selected for detailed study. Since members of the Gq family couple to phospholipase C, production of inositol phosphates was examined in the transfected cells. WT and Neo control VSMC had low basal levels of inositol phosphates, which were stimulated 12–20-fold by exposure of the cells to AVP or AII (Fig. 1). In three independent clones expressing α16Q212L, basal inositol phosphates were markedly increased and were comparable to agonist-stimulated levels in WT and Neo cells. Stimulation of the transfected cells by vasoconstrictors caused no further increase in inositol phosphate production. These results indicate that α16Q212L protein stably expressed in VSMC is functionally active. Resting intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) levels were not significantly higher in cells expressing α16Q212L than in Neo or WT cells, averaging 150–200 nm. Increases in [Ca2+]i in response to either AVP (data not shown) or AII were blunted compared with Neo controls (Fig.2). Similar desensitization of agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization has been reported in Swiss-3T3 cells and small lung cancer cells expressing α16Q212L (14Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Helfrich B.

Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and small cell lung cancer cells (14Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Helfrich B. Mitchell F.M. Bunn Jr., P.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At 7 days after plating, the protein content/cell, a measure of hypertrophy was determined. In four individual clones expressing α16Q212L, protein content/cell was increased 75% compared with Neo control cells (Neo, 20.4 ± 2.1 μg/105 cells; α16Q212L, 35.1 ± 0.5 μg/105 cells; p < 0.01). These results indicate that expression of α16Q212L in VSMC is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. Again, this effect was specific for α16 since stable expression of constitutively active forms of αi2, α0, or αs did not induce hypertrophy (data not shown). Expression of α16Q212L resulted in a marked elevation of steady-state SM-α-actin protein levels compared with Neo control cells, which was not significantly increased by exposure to AVP (Fig.3 A). To determine whether expression of α16Q212L affected promoter activity, VSMC stably expressing α16Q212L were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding the SM-α-actin promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (pCATACT-(−713/52)). Cells were then exposed to AVP or PDGF for 72 h. AVP stimulated CAT activity approximately 5–6-fold in Neo cells similarly to what has previously been observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3 B). In two independent clones expressing α16Q212L, basal CAT activity was dramatically enhanced (>50-fold), and stimulation of these clones with AVP only slightly increased CAT activity in one of the clones. Exposure to PDGF suppressed CAT activity in cells expressing α16Q212L although activity was still much higher than in Neo control cells. Three additional α16Q212L-expressing clones have been examined, all of which exhibited elevated levels of SM-α-actin protein and promoter activity (data not shown). To eliminate the effects of compensatory mechanisms on the regulation of SM-α-actin expression, transient co-transfection of α16Q212L together with pCATACT was also carried out. Transient expression of α16Q212L also markedly increased SM-α-actin promoter activity (see Fig.6 B), indicating that the action of α16Q212L represents a direct effect of the GTPase-deficient α subunit on the promoter.Figure 6Inhibition of SM-α-actin promoter activity by JNKK(K116R). A, WT-VSMC were transiently transfected by electroporation with full-length pCAT-α-actin, a CMV-β-galactosidase vector, and 5 μg of pCDNA-3 or vector encoding JNKK(K116R). After incubation overnight in full media, cells were exposed for three days to 0.2% FCS (Basal) or 0.2% FCS + AVP. Extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity as in Fig. 3 B.

B, identical cells were transiently transfected as above, with the addition of 5 μg of LNCX-α16Q212L or pCDNA-3 (Mock) in the presence or absence of JNKK(K116R). After incubation overnight in full media, cells were incubated for three days in 0.2% FCS. Extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT activity. Results represent the mean of four experiments performed in duplicate. *, p < 0.05 versus pCDNA; **, p < 0.05versus α16Q212L alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since expression of α16Q212L mimicked the effects of vasoconstrictors on growth and induction of SM-α-actin, signaling pathways known to be activated by vasoconstrictors were examined. Fig.4 shows ERK activity in Neo and three independent clones expressing α16Q212L. No significant difference in basal ERK activity was observed among the cell lines. However, stimulation of ERKs by AVP, AII, or PMA was decreased in all of the clones expressing α16Q212L. This was not a result of a generalized desensitization of the ERK pathway since EGF and PDGF stimulation was comparable with that observed in Neo cells. These data were confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK antibodies and assay of kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). In contrast to stimulation by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, vasoconstrictor stimulation of ERKs in VSMC has been shown to require activation of protein kinase C (8Kribben A. Li X. Wieder E.D. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the inability of vasoconstrictors to stimulate ERKs was due to impairment in PKC activation, PKC activation in response to PMA was measured using a permeabilized cell assay. PMA stimulated PKC 2.3 ± 0.1-fold in Neo cells, comparable with what has been seen in other cell types (18Heasley L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In three clones expressing α16Q212L, PMA stimulated PKC activity 2.6 ± 0.2 (clone 54), 2.5 ± 0.2 (clone 43), and 1.9 ± 0.4 (clone 77), respectively. Thus, the inability of vasoconstrictors and phorbol esters to stimulate ERKs in these cells must be due to changes in steps distal to PKC. Increased cAMP levels have been shown to inhibit activation of ERKs in several cell types including VSMC (25Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, basal cAMP levels in cells expressing α16Q212L were not significantly different from Neo or WT cells (data not shown). Activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway has been shown in response to cytokines, UV light (26Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 27Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar), as well as factors that signal through receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled receptors (28Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The ability of vasoconstrictors to stimulate JNK activity in VSMC was therefore examined. JNK activity was assayed by binding and phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) coupled to glutathione-agarose, as described previously (17Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). In wild-type VSMC, AVP and AII both stimulated JNK activity 5–7-fold (Fig.5 A). Maximal activation was observed at 15 min of stimulation, with values returning to basal by 3 h. PMA failed to significantly activate JNK activity at any time up to 3 h, although slight stimulation was observed in some experiments. This is consistent with the general inability of phorbol ester-regulated PKC isoforms to integrate into the JNK pathway (10Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the three α16Q212L-expressing VSMC clones, basal JNK activity was elevated 3–9-fold compared with Neo (Fig. 5 B). Addition of AII stimulated activity in Neo cells, as occurs in wild-type cells, but did not further stimulate JNK activity in cells expressing α16Q212L. Thus, basal activity of the JNKs but not the related ERKs was markedly and consistently elevated in α16Q212L-expressing VSMC. The correlation of increased JNK activity with induction of SM-α-actin promoter activity suggests a role for this signaling pathway in promoting muscle-specific gene expression in VSMC. To further test this putative role of JNKs, WT-VSMC were co-transfected with or without a catalytically inactive JNK kinase, JNKK(K116R), along with the SM-α-actin promoter construct and then exposed to media containing or lacking AVP for 3 days. As shown in Fig.6 A, co-transfection with JNKK(K116R) inhibited the induction of SM-α-actin promoter activity by AVP by approximately 50% while co-transfection with a control plasmid (pCDNA-3) had no effect. In three independent α16Q212L clones, expression of JNKK(K116R) inhibited basal CAT activity by 49 ± 6% (clone 43), 41 ± 11% (clone 54), and 79 ± 5% (clone 77), respectively. Finally, stimulation of SM-α-actin promoter activity induced by transient expression of α16Q212L was also blunted by co-transfection with JNKK(K116R) (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the JNK pathway is responsible at least in part for vasoconstrictor and α16-induced SM-α-actin gene expression. The rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in VSMC by vasoconstrictors has been shown to be mediated through activation of members of the Gq family. However, it has not been established whether these G-proteins mediate the longer term effects of AVP and AII on hypertrophy and induction of smooth muscle gene expression. Transfection of VSMC with constitutively active Gαq failed to generate clones expressing this protein, suggesting that it may be cytotoxic to VSMC. We therefore employed a constitutively active mutant of another member of the Gqfamily, Gα16(α16Q212L). Stable expression of α16Q212L reproduced the physiologic effects of chronic exposure to AVP or AII, as the stably transfected cells were hypertrophied, had similar morphology, and contained elevated levels of SM-α-actin protein compared with Neo controls or wild-type cells. Induction of SM-α-actin expression was mediated through constitutive activation of the SM-α-actin promoter. In fact, both steady-state protein levels and promoter activity were more strongly activated by constitutively active Gα16 than by the transient G-protein activation achieved by vasoconstrictors. Correspondingly, PDGF, which completely suppressed SM-α-actin expression in WT and Neo cells, only partially inhibited promoter activity in cells expressing α16Q212L, resulting in no significant decreases in steady-state protein. Both effects were specific for Gqfamily members and were not observed with cells expressing other G-protein α-chains (αi2, αo, or αs) or H-Ras. 2X. Li, V. van Putten, F. Zarinetchi, L. E. Heasley, and R. A. Nemenoff, submitted for publication. To begin to identify the downstream effectors of α16, we examined alterations in signaling pathways in cells expressing α16Q212L. Basal inositol phosphate production was elevated in the transfected cells, indicating that α16Q212L was functionally mimicking the effects of Gq. However, as in other cell types (24Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Zamarripa J. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this did not result in elevated levels of [Ca2+]i compared with Neo controls, and in fact the ability of vasoconstrictors to mobilize [Ca2+]i was inhibited, suggesting activation of compensatory mechanisms desensitizing the Ca2+ response. It therefore appears unlikely that activation of phospholipase Cβ plays an important role in mediating the effects of α16Q212L on hypertrophy and SM-α-actin induction. Expression of α16Q212L had differential effects on members of the MAP kinase family. Basal ERK activity was not affected by expression of α16Q212L. However, ERK stimulation in response to vasoconstrictors was blunted, while PDGF stimulation was unaffected. The inability of vasoconstrictors to activate these kinases is likely due in part to down-regulation of the receptors for both AVP and AII. Scatchard analysis of radiolabeled hormone binding indicated that both AVP and AII receptor number was decreased by approximately 60% in α16Q212L clones compared with Neo or WT cells, without significant changes in K d (data not shown). 3X. Li, L. E. Heasley, and R. A. Nemenoff, unpublished observations. However, PMA-induced stimulation of ERK activity was also blunted in cells expressing α16Q212L, suggesting effects of α16Q212L distal to PKC activation. This selective inhibition of ERK activation reflects the multiple pathways operative in VSMC. PDGF and EGF signal through the well described pathway involving Ras and Raf (28Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 29Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 30Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vasoconstrictors, however, signal through a PKC-dependent pathway that only minimally activates Ras and Raf (8Kribben A. Li X. Wieder E.D. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C939-C945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support a role for JNK as a mediator of SM-α-actin induction. In contrast to ERKs, basal JNK activity was elevated in cells expressing α16Q212L, and the level of JNK activation in individual clones correlated well with the ability to induce SM-α-actin expression (compare Fig. 5 B with Fig.3 B). In particular, clone 77 expressed the highest level of JNK activity and the greatest induction of SM-α-actin. This was not due to increased levels of α16Q212L expression compared with the other clones and may reflect differences in the activation of compensatory mechanisms. Importantly, expression of a dominant-negative JNKK construct partially blocked the induction of SM-α-actin promoter activity by AVP in WT cells, as well as that induced by either stable or transient expression of α16Q212L. Two JNK kinases, designated MKK3 and MKK4, have recently been described (11Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). MKK4 appears to be the human homologue of SEK1(31Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The partial inhibition of SM-α-actin promoter activity may therefore be a result of only partially inhibiting JNK activity or of inhibiting one of multiple JNKKs activated by vasoconstrictors. These results also do not preclude the involvement of other signaling pathways that converge on the SM-α-actin promoter. The region of the SM-α-actin promoter required for vasoconstrictor stimulation contains two CArG elements (6Van Putten V. Li X. Maselli J. Nemenoff R.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which are homologous to the core region of the serum-response element (SRE) found in the promoter of intermediate early response genes such as c-fos (32Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 14: 5037-5047Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation at the SRE has been shown to involve binding of two proteins: serum response factor and members of the ets family including elk-1 (33Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1994; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Significantly, this latter class of proteins has been shown to be phosphorylated by the ERKs (33Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1994; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), as well as the JNKs (34Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). While the proteins binding to the SM-α-actin promoter have not been well defined, it is conceivable that constitutive activation of JNKs will result in persistent phosphorylation of specific transcriptional factors leading to enhanced promoter activity. Expression of constitutively active Gα16 has recently been described in PC12 cells (24Heasley L.E. Storey B. Fanger G.R. Zamarripa J. Maue R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 648-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was associated with neurite outgrowth and differentiation of these cells into neuronal phenotype. As observed in our study, these cells demonstrated constitutive activation of JNK activity, with no increase in ERK activity. Since elevated expression of SM-α-actin has been used as a marker for the contractile phenotype of VSMC (35Thyberg J. Hedin U. Sjolund M. Palmberg L. Bottger B.A. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 966-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 36Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar), our data support an emerging role for the JNK family of protein kinases in cell differentiation."

The selective degradation of proteins is an important means of regulating gene expression and is found increasingly to play a role in the control of various cellular events. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation is the main non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway in the cell, and a number of important regulatory proteins are degraded in this way, including mitotic cyclins, p53, c-Mos, c-Myc, and the Matα2 repressor (1Ciechanover A.

Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Denatured and abnormally folded proteins are also degraded by this pathway. Proteins are targeted for degradation by the addition of ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among eukaryotes (5Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Further ubiquitin moieties are added to form a polyubiquitin protein conjugate that is recognized as a substrate by a proteolytic complex known as the 26 S protease or proteasome (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 7Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem.

This is a large multisubunit complex composed of two distinct particles, the 20 S catalytic core and the 19 S regulatory cap (9Lupas A. Koster A.J. Baumeister W.

Enzyme & Protein. 1993; 47: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The 20 S sub-complex is a cylindrical particle consisting of 14 different subunits of 21–32 kDa. The subunits are arranged in four seven-membered rings, the inner two contain the proteolytic activities (12Grziwa A. Baumeister W. Dahlmann B. Kopp F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Puhler G. Weinkauf S. Bachmann L. Muller S. Engel A. Hegerl R. Baumeister W.

Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The genes encoding all of the 20 S subunits have been cloned from a number of species and are found to comprise a family of homologous proteins that are greatly conserved between eukaryotes (15Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,16Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each 26 S protease consists of two 19 S caps positioned at either end of one 20 S core particle (9Lupas A. Koster A.J. Baumeister W.

Enzyme & Protein. 1993; 47: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of the 20 S core is tightly regulated by the 19 S cap such that degradation is dependent upon ATP and largely, but not exclusively, upon the presence of polyubiquitinated substrates (7Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol.

These subunits are named according to their position as determined by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ts, temperature-sensitive; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MBC, methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamylate; APC, anaphase promoting complex; ts, temperature-sensitive. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ts, temperature-sensitive; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MBC, methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamylate; APC, anaphase promoting complex; ts, temperature-sensitive.analysis with S1 being the largest (18Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Recently a number of subunits of the 19 S cap have been identified and fall into two classes. First, at least six subunits are members of a family of ATPases (18Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Fujiwara T.

Their exact role is unclear but could involve hydrolyzing ATP to provide energy for the assembly of the 26 S protease and also for the unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 20 S core. The lethality associated with mutations in various ATPases, in both fission and budding yeast, indicates that these subunits are essential for the function of the 26 S protease (20Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 333: 355-357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Ghislain M. Udvardy A. Mann C. Nature. 1993; 366: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).The second class of 19 S subunits has been termed the non-ATPases (11Tanahashi N. Tsurumi C. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Enzyme & Protein. 1993; 47: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,18Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol.

Their functions are also unknown; however, possible roles could include the capture and unfolding of substrates, the release and recycling of ubiquitin chains, activation of the 20 S core, and the general maintenance of the 26 S protease structure. One non-ATPase subunit S5a has been shown to bind polyubiquitin chains in vitro (23Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the finding that MCB1, which encodes S5a in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not an essential gene suggests that there are other factors involved in substrate selection. Once again, the importance of this class of subunits is demonstrated by the isolation of mutations in yeast non-ATPases that are lethal (26Kominami K. DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A.

Genetic interactions have been identified between some of the yeast 19 S cap subunits implying that these proteins might interact in vivo. For example, a mutation in fission yeast S4, an ATPase, can be rescued by overexpression of another ATPase, S7 (20Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 333: 355-357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mutations in the S. cerevisiaegenes encoding S1 and S14, both non-ATPases, were found to be synthetically lethal, and furthermore, overexpression of S1 was found to suppress the ts allele in the gene encoding S14 (28Yokota K. Kagawa S. Shimizu Y. Akioka H. Tsurumi C. Noda C. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Ohba M. Yamasaki M. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 853-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To date, however, there have been no published reports of interactions between an ATPase and a non-ATPase in the 26 S protease.Previously, we have isolated two conditional lethal mutants mts2-1 and mts3-1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (20Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 333: 355-357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The corresponding genes mts2 + and mts3 + were found to encode subunit 4 and subunit 14, respectively, of the 19 S cap of the 26 S protease. At the restrictive temperature, both mutants were found to arrest in mitosis, at metaphase, implying that the 26 S protease is essential for the metaphase to anaphase transition. Mts2 is a protein that belongs to the ATPase family of regulatory subunits, whereas Mts3 is one of the non-ATPase components. In this paper, we describe another conditional mutant, mts4-1, which was isolated in the same screen. The mts4 + gene encodes a protein with homology to S2 of the human and S. cerevisiae 26 S protease. In contrast to mts2-1 and mts3-1, the mts4-1 mutant does not have a clear cell cycle phenotype. A null allele of mts4, however, is lethal and results in a clear cell cycle defect with cells arrested in metaphase. This lethality can be rescued by the gene encoding human S2. Consistent with the sequence and functional similarities between Mts4 and human S2, we have purified the 26 S protease from fission yeast and find that Mts4 co-purifies with known components of this complex. Therefore we conclude that Mts4 is S2 of the 26 S protease in S. pombe and that this subunit is essential for mitosis. Furthermore, we provide both genetic and physical evidence to suggest that Mts4 and Mts2 interact. This is the first report of interactions between an ATPase and a non-ATPase subunit in the 19 S regulatory cap of the 26 S protease.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of the mts4 + gene and show that it encodes a protein with homology to S2 of both the human and S. cerevisiae 26 S protease complex. The mts4 + gene is essential, but the lethality associated with the null allele can be rescued by the human gene encoding S2, p97 demonstrating a strong functional as well as sequence similarity between Mts4 and p97. Furthermore, we have shown that the Mts4 protein co-purifies with other components of the fission yeast 26 S protease. Therefore we conclude that Mts4 is S2 of the 26 S protease in fission yeast.The gene encoding human S2 was previously identified in screens to isolate proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of type 1 TNF receptor (42Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Wallach D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Zhang Y.X. Guo D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The significance of this finding is currently unclear, but perhaps the 26 S protease regulates the TNF signaling pathway in mammalian cells and this regulation is mediated through S2. TNF is a cytokine associated with a variety of functions including the induction of cell death, the modulation of differentiation patterns, and the activation of certain immune processes (44Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 45Old L.J. Sci. Am. 1988; 258: 41-49Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 46Vilcek J. Lee T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7313-7316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling of apoptosis is mediated by a specific region in the C terminus of the TNF receptor, namely the death domain. The human S2 protein was found to associate with a region of the TNF receptor that is distinct from this death domain (42Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Wallach D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that S2 is involved in mediating TNF signaling pathways other than apoptosis.One possible function of the non-ATPase subunits is that they each recognize different subsets of substrates. Previously, S5a has been shown to bind polyubiquitin chains in vitro and is thought to play a role in substrate selection (23Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, S. cerevisiae cells deleted for the MCB1 gene, which encodes S5a, are viable and only partially defective in degrading polyubiquitinated proteins indicating that other factors are involved in ubiquitin-dependent substrate recognition by the 26 S protease (25van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view is genetic evidence from studies on a number of mutations in other non-ATPases in yeast. For example, a mutation in the S. cerevisiae gene SEN3 (S1) causes an increase in the levels of a protein involved in tRNA splicing (29DeMarini D.J. Papa F.R. Swaminathan S. Ursic D. Rasmussen T.P. Culbertson M.R. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6311-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A mutation in the S. cerevisiae gene NIN1 (S14) results in the failure to activate Cdc28 kinase activity (26Kominami K. DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Shimbara N. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Hisamatsu H. Tanahashi N. Shimizu Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and a mutation in the fission yeast gene mts3 (S14) causes cells to re-replicate their DNA at the restrictive temperature (27Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, the S. cerevisiae gene encoding S2 was identified in a screen to select for mutants that are deficient in the degradation of an isozyme of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (47Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Such a finding could indicate that S2 is involved in selecting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase for degradation. Further analysis of such 19 S cap mutants should help elucidate the role of the non-ATPases within the 26 S protease and their possible role in substrate selection.Previous analyses of the S. cerevisiae S2 gene have shown that it is an essential gene (30Tsurumi C. Shimizu Y. Saeki M. Kato S. DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Fujimoro M. Yokosawa H. Yamasaki M. Hendl K.B. Toh-e A. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 912-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 47Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In our study, however, we have demonstrated not only that S. pombe S2 is essential but also that it is required for the metaphase to anaphase transition in the mitotic cell cycle. It was not possible to identify a cell cycle phenotype associated with the ts allele of mts4-1 at the restrictive temperature, probably due to the mutation being somewhat leaky. In contrast, the null allele of mts4 was found to arrest in metaphase with condensed DNA and a short mitotic spindle. This phenotype is also found with disruptions of the fission yeast genes mts2 and mts3, which encode S4 and S14 of the 26 S protease, respectively (20Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 333: 355-357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the mts4null spores do eventually disassemble their spindle, this is also seen in the other mts alleles and with other mutations where the corresponding genes are required for the metaphase to anaphase transition, namely mts2, mts3, nuc2,cut4, and cut9. The nuc2,cut4, and cut9 mutants (59Yamashita Y.M. Nakaseko Y. Samejima I. Kumada K. Yamada H. Michaelson D. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 384: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), like the mts2-1, mts3-1, and mts4-1 alleles, arrest at the metaphase to anaphase transition; the corresponding Nuc2, Cut4, and Cut9 proteins are known to be part of the anaphase promoting complex (APC, 59). A number of other proteins have also been identified in yeast and frogs that form the APC. This multi-subunit particle catalyzes the addition of polyubiquitin chains onto cyclins to target them for degradation by the 26 S protease (53King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 54Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol.

It is believed that ubiquitin degradation mediated by the APC and 26 S protease are also required to trigger the onset of anaphase. The lack of this function as seen in the mts null alleles and mutants in the APC complex results in cells arresting in metaphase. It is therefore clear that 26 S protease function is required for completion of the cell cycle, although as shown for S5a, not all subunits of the 19 S cap are required for this process to occur (25van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These findings imply that certain substrates have to be degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated pathway for the metaphase to anaphase transition to occur. Originally it was thought that cyclin B degradation was required for cells to proceed to anaphase, but subsequent work showed that this proteolytic event was in fact required for cells to exit mitosis (48Holloway S.L. Glotzer M. King R.W. Murray A.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 1393-1402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 49Surana U. Amon A. Dowzer C. McGrew J. Byers B. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It is thought, however, that many components involved in cyclin proteolysis are also required to degrade factors whose levels have to decrease for the onset of anaphase to occur (50Irniger S. Piatti S. Michaelis C. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1995; 81: 269-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Certain genes have been identified that encode potential candidates for these substrates, cut2in fission yeast (51Funabiki H. Yamano H. Kumada K. Nagao K. Hunt T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 381: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and PDS1 in budding yeast (52Yamamoto A. Guacci V. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).The mutations in the mts2, mts3, and mts4 genes were isolated in a screen to identify mutations that caused resistance to the mitotic poison MBC. It is not apparent why such a screen should be specific for subunits of the 19 S cap of the 26 S protease; however, work is currently in progress to try and elucidate the mechanism of this resistance.In this study we have also shown that mts4 interacts both genetically and physically with mts2. The mts4-1 and mts2-1 alleles were found to be synthetically lethal, and furthermore, the mts2 + cDNA was isolated from a screen designed to identify multicopy suppressors of the mts4-1 allele. As mentioned above, Mts2 is one of the ATPase subunits in the 19 S regulatory cap, whereas Mts4 is a non-ATPase subunit. Therefore it is unlikely that the ability of mts2 + to rescue mts4-1 at 31 °C is due to functional complementation. A more likely scenario is that these two subunits bind to each other in the complex and that overexpression of the Mts2 protein can compensate for the defective Mts4 protein by forcing the physical interaction between these two subunits to occur. If the formation of a subcomplex of Mts2 and Mts4 proteins was a rate-limiting step in the 19 S cap assembly process, then overexpression of Mts2 could push the equilibrium between free Mts2/Mts4 and the Mts2-Mts4 subcomplex, thus enforcing assembly of the 19 S cap complex. In support of this hypothesis is the fact that overexpression of Mts2 is unable to rescue the mts4 null strain (data not shown) indicating that the mutant Mts4 protein has to be present for the suppression to occur. The lack of genetic interactions between mts4 and mts3 indicates that it is unlikely that these two subunits bind to one another in the 19 S cap. A direct physical interaction between Mts4 and Mts2 was demonstrated by an in vitro binding assay. Taken together the genetic and physical data provide strong evidence for an in vivo association between Mts4 and Mts2 in the 26 S protease complex. This is the first demonstration of such interactions between an ATPase and a non-ATPase within the 26 S protease. Previous reports have described interactions between some of the ATPase components of the 19 S cap, for example between Tbp1 and Tbp7 (56Ohana B. Moore P.A. Ruben S.M. Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Rosen C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and between Mts2 and Mss1 (20Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 333: 355-357Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that these pairs of ATPase subunits interact in vivo. It has been suggested that these ATPases could form a six-membered ring-shaped structure (18Dubiel W. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) similar to that formed by the p97 ATPase monomers in Xenopus (57Peters J.-M. Walsh M.J. Franke W.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, as described earlier, there is genetic evidence to suggest that certain pairs of non-ATPase subunits interact with one another. Given these findings, together with the first description of a non-ATPase interacting with an ATPase subunit as we have detailed in this report, we are beginning to get an idea about the spatial organization of the subunits of the 19 S cap of the 26 protease. The selective degradation of proteins is an important means of regulating gene expression and is found increasingly to play a role in the control of various cellular events. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation is the main non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway in the cell, and a number of important regulatory proteins are degraded in this way, including mitotic cyclins, p53, c-Mos, c-Myc, and the Matα2 repressor (1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 2Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Denatured and abnormally folded proteins are also degraded by this pathway. Proteins are targeted for degradation by the addition of ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid protein that is highly conserved among eukaryotes (5Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Further ubiquitin moieties are added to form a polyubiquitin protein conjugate that is recognized as a substrate by a proteolytic complex known as the 26 S protease or proteasome (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 7Peters J.-M. Trends Biochem.

This is a large multisubunit complex composed of two distinct particles, the 20 S catalytic core and the 19 S regulatory cap (9Lupas A. Koster A.J. Baumeister W.

The subunits are arranged in four seven-membered rings, the inner two contain the proteolytic activities (12Grziwa A. Baumeister W. Dahlmann B. Kopp F.

Specific activity of Lyn at the basal state was decreased in Csk-expressing cells, and further decreased in mCsk-expressing cells.

In mCsk(−)-expressing cells, Lyn activation was rapid and quite long lasting.

The cytoplasmic tails of the β and the γ subunits possess characteristic tyrosine-based amino acid sequence motifs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)) (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Miller L. Jelsema C.L. Varin-Blank N. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22613-22620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most notably, recent heterologous expression studies have demonstrated that Lyn expression is required for the efficient phosphorylation of the β and the γ subunits as well as phosphorylation and activation of Syk (15Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,22Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), another cytoplasmic PTK. The kinase activity of Src family PTKs has been shown to be regulated by the phosphorylation level of the C-terminal tyrosine conserved among the family members (23Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 24Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). It is postulated that the phosphorylated tyrosine associates with the intramolecular SH2 domain (23Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and that the “closed” conformation (25Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) prevents the catalytic domain from interacting with external kinase substrates. Disruption of the intramolecular interaction, presumably through the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine or through the replacement of the phosphorylated C-terminal tyrosine with high affinity protein ligands (23Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), results in augmented kinase activity (“open” conformation). In hematopoietic cells, C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and CD45 tyrosine phosphatase are implicated in the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine, respectively (4Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 23Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Csk, first purified as a PTK that specifically phosphorylates the regulatory tyrosine (26Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has structural similarities with Src family PTKs but is devoid of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and the N-terminal myristylation signal required for membrane localization (26Okada M.

Creation of Csk-deficient mice, which could not survive embryonic stages, has revealed that Src family PTKs are commonly activated in Csknull cells, thereby indicating that Csk is one of major negative regulators of the basal activity of Src family PTKs (29Nada S.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Negative impacts of Csk on receptor-mediated dynamic signaling have also been noted in T lymphocytes: overexpression of Csk, and mutant forms of Csk possessing membrane-attachment signals more effectively, suppress TCR-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and lymphokine production (31Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 32Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As an attempt to explore the roles of Csk in FcεRI signaling, and to further assess the functional significance of Src family PTKs in the context of mast cells, we variously modulated Csk activity in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) 2H3 cell line, a widely used model system for analyzing FcεRI functions (14Kihara H.

Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We generated RBL2H3 sublines overexpressing Csk, a membrane-targeted form of Csk (mCsk) (31Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 32Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and a kinase-defective form of mCsk (mCsk(−)) that functioned as a dominant negative molecule. By using these cell lines, we show herein that (i) Csk is involved in the initiation and the termination of FcεRI-mediated Lyn activation, (ii) the initiations of the series of events leading to granule release followed Lyn activation, and (iii) the termination of the signals are regulated by both Lyn-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Csk- and Csk(−) chimeras possessing N-terminal 16 amino acids of rat c-Src (c-Src tag: (M)GSNKSKPKDASQRRR), harboring a myristylation signal (28Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 31Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. Two N-terminal overhanging primers (primers 1 and 2) and a C-terminal primer (primer 3) were designed. These were: primer 1, 5′-AGC-AAG-CCC-AAG-GAC-GCC-AGC-CAG-CGG-CGC-CGC-TCG-GCT-ATA-CAG-GCC-TCC-TGG-3′, coding for the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the c-Src tag and the N-terminal 7 amino acids of rat Csk without first ATG; primer 2, 5′-CT-CGG-TAC-CCG-TCG-ACC-ACC-ATG-GGC-AGC-AAC-AAG-AGC-AAG-CCC-AAG-GAC-GCC-AGC-3′, possessing 5′ KpnI and XhoI sites and coding for N-terminal 12 amino acids of the c-Src Tag; and primer 3, 5′-CTG-AAG-CTG-CTA-CAG-ACA-ATA-GG-3′, corresponding to the antisense sequence (nucleotides 623–601) of the coding region of rat Csk. Csk cDNA was first amplified using primers 1 and 3, and the fragment was further amplified using primers 2 and 3. The resultant fragment was digested with KpnI (in the primer 2) and with ApaI (nucleotide 586 in the coding region of Csk). The digested fragment was ligated at the ApaI site with the C-terminal segment of Csk, or Csk(−), thus forming a c-Src-Csk chimera (mCsk) and mCsk(−). Clones without misincorporation of nucleotides were chosen, and the entire coding regions of the cDNAs excised with XhoI were inserted into a mammalian expression vector pCXN2 (35Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) at SalI site. RBL2H3 cells, routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin, were freshly subcloned by limiting dilution and used for transfection. RBL2H3 cells (106 cells in a 6-cm dish) were transfected by lipofection with 30 μl of Transfectum® (Promega) and 10 μg of the expression vectors. Geneticin-resistant clones were selected in the medium containing 1.2 μg/ml Geneticin, and clones overexpressing Csk and Csk mutants were screened by immunoblotting with anti-Csk polyclonal antibody. Multiple independent clones overexpressing Csk (Csk 1 to 9), mCsk (mCsk 1 to 7), and mCsk(−) (mCsk(−) 1 to 4) were obtained. Of these, we mainly used Csk 5 and 9, mCsk 1 and 3, and mCsk(−) 1 and 3, with similar expression levels of these molecules. The data described below were reproducible in the two sets of clones for each cDNA. 106cells in 6-cm dishes were cultured for 36 h and then starved for serum for another 24 h. Cells were sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (a final concentration of 1 μg/ml) for 1 h in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2. Cells were stimulated with the indicated concentration of DNP-BSA for varying periods. Medium was aspirated, and cells were quickly frozen by floating the dishes on liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed on ice with 400 μl/dish lysis buffer (buffer A: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as cell lysate. Cell lysate was incubated with first antibodies, and the immunecomplex was collected with protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed twice with buffer A. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting or to kinase reaction. In the immunecomplex kinase assay of Lyn, beads were washed once with a kinase buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in the same buffer. Kinase reaction was conducted in 25 μl of the kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 25 μl) and 1 μg of acid-treated enolase for 2 min at 25 °C. Under the reaction conditions,32P incorporation into enolase was linear with time for 5 min. Cell lysates or the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were probed with first antibodies and then reacted with horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting system, Amersham Corp.) or by the color development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium, as described (33Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 24 h, starved for serum for another 24 h, and simultaneously sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (a final concentration of 1 μg/ml) and loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, cells were washed twice with HEPES-Tyrode buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4) containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and incubated in the same buffer. Cells were stimulated with DNP-BSA (a final concentration of 100 ng/ml) at ambient temperature (20–25 °C). Fluorometric cell images were recorded with ICCD camera/image analysis system (ARGUS-50, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), ratio images (340/380 nm) were sequentially collected, and the ratio images were represented as a color gradient according to a Ca2+ calibration curve (36Mori M. Aihara M. Kume K. Hamanoue M. Kohsaka S. Shimizu T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3590-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 106 cells in 6-cm dishes were cultured for 36 h, starved for serum for 24 h, and sensitized with anti-DNP IgE (a final concentration of 1 μg/ml) for 1 h in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice, incubated in HEPES-Tyrode buffer containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and stimulated with various concentrations of DNP-BSA. Aliquots of the supernatant were sequentially collected, and histamine contents were measured with an automated histamine analyzer as described (37Morita Y. Asakawa M. Hirai K. Takaishi T. Miyamoto T. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1989; 88: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TCR signaling is inhibited by Csk and almost completely blocked by Csk chimeras possessing myristylation or isoprenylation signals (31Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 32Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The augmented functions caused by the membrane targeting are presumed to be due to close positioning of these Csk mutants to Src family PTKs (31Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,32Cloutier J.F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We, therefore, prepared a membrane-targeted Csk in which the N-terminal myristylation signal of rat c-Src (28Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was fused to the entire coding sequence of rat Csk (mCsk). A kinase defective mCsk (mCsk(−)) was also created. Wild-type Csk, mCsk, and mCsk(−) cDNAs were stably expressed in a freshly subcloned line of RBL2H3. An immunoblot with anti-Csk antibody of two independent clones expressing these Csk-based molecules is shown in Fig.1, lane Csk:blot. Because of the additional 14 amino acids, mCsk and mCsk(−) exhibited a slightly retarded electrophoretic mobility compared with wild-type Csk. To explore the effects of the overexpression of these Csk-based molecules on the basal activity of Lyn, protein levels of Lyn were first compared. Cells at quiescence were solubilized with the buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% deoxycholate, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Lyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 (lane Lyn:blot), the amount of Lyn was reproducibly decreased in mCsk(−) cells as compared with that in parent cells. Lyn was immunoprecipitated from each volume of the cell lysate containing an equal amount of Lyn, and the relative specific activity of Lyn toward enolase was compared. As shown in Fig. 1 (lane Lyn:spec), the specific activity of Lyn was decreased in Csk cells and further decreased in mCsk cells while it was increased in mCsk(−) cells. Decreased abundance of Src family PTKs as seen in mCsk(−) cells has also been noted in Csknull cells (29Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 38Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine in Src PTKs are underphosphorylated. Although precise mechanisms of the altered Lyn levels in mCsk(−) cells remain to be elucidated, it could be ascribed to the shortened half-lives of Src family PTKs whose C-terminal tyrosine is dephosphorylated (39Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40Iba H. Cross F.R. Garber E.A. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The decreased protein level, along with the increased specific activity of Lyn in mCsk(−) cells, strongly indicated that mCsk(−) interfered with intrinsic Csk activity as a dominant negative molecule. As an initial experiment, these cell lines were sensitized with a saturating concentration of anti-DNP IgE (1 μg/ml) (41Wilson B.S. Kapp N. Lee R.J. Pfeiffer J.R. Martinez A.M. Platt Y. Letourneur F. Oliver J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4013-4022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), stimulated with various concentrations of DNP-BSA (1–1,000 ng/ml) for 30 min, and released histamine was measured. Contrary to the expectation that Csk and mCsk might inhibit histamine release, all the clones responded well to these concentrations of antigen after the long incubation periods, with an optimal concentration of 100 ng/ml (not shown, and see Fig. 6 B). These findings suggest that Csk or mCsk does not substantially suppress the overall cell activation. To further assess the influence of these molecules, we followed the temporal patterns of FcεRI-mediated signaling under the optimal stimulation conditions (1 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE, and 100 ng/ml DNP-BSA). FcεRI-mediated changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins are shown in Fig. 2 A. Under the quiescent conditions, two sets of doublets with molecular masses of around 55 kDa (identified as two isoforms of Lyn (not shown)) and 180 kDa (not identified in this study) were already tyrosyl phosphorylated in all the clones, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of other proteins was minimal. After the triggering of FcεRI, multiple proteins were tyrosyl phosphorylated in all the clones, but their temporal patterns were different. Among the tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins, those around 70 kDa (indicated by arrows) gave strongest signals in all the clones. In the wild-type cells, the signal became rapidly detectable within 30 s, peaked at around 5 min, and then declined. The time span of the signal was delayed in Csk-expressing cells (peaked at around 10–20 min) and was further delayed in mCSK-expressing cells (peaked at around 30–60 min) (Fig.2 A). In mCsk(−)-expressing cells, it was as rapidly detectable as in the wild-type cells, and, intriguingly, its duration was markedly prolonged (Fig. 2 A). The time-dependent changes in the intensity of the 70-kDa phosphoproteins were densitometrically determined in the two sets of clones (WT, Csk 5 and 9, mCsk 1 and 3, and mCsk(−) 1 and 3), and the average was depicted in the graph (Fig. 2 B). The stepwisely delayed responses in Csk- and mCsk-expressing cells and the rapid response in mCsk(−)-expressing cells clearly indicated that Csk negatively regulates the initiation of FcεRI-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity. In addition, the prolonged response in mCsk(−)-expressing cells suggested that the dominant negative Csk delayed the termination of the signal. To examine if the Csk-based molecules altered cell signaling by directly affecting Lyn activation, time-dependent changes in the Lyn activity were followed.

Using this recombinant baculovirus and cultured Sf9 cells, rVMAT2 has been expressed to high levels and purified to >95% homogeneity using immobilized Ni2+-affinity chromatography followed by lectin (concanavalin A) chromatography. Purified transporter was photolabeled using [125I]-7-azido-8-iodoketanserin ([125I]AZIK) and [125I]2-N-[(3′-iodo-4′-azidophenyl)propionyl]tetrabenazine ([125I]TBZ-AIPP). Both [125I]AZIK and [125I]TBZ-AIPP photoaffinity labeling of purified rVMAT2 were protectable by 10 μm tetrabenazine (TBZ), 10 μm 7-aminoketanserin, and 1 mm concentrations of the transporter substrates dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Radiolabeled peptides were generated using enzymatic and chemical methods, purified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and NH2-terminal microsequenced. Radiosequencing of [125I]AZIK-labeled rVMAT2 indicated derivatization of Lys-20 in the NH2 terminus, just prior to putative transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1). [125I]TBZ-AIPP derivatized a segment of rVMAT2 between Gly-408 and Cys-431 in TMD10 and 11. These data implicate juxtaposition of TMD1 and 10/11."
https://openalex.org/W1983753601,"Abstract The INS-r3-GK27 insulinoma cells are endowed with artificially inducible glucokinase under control of the reverse tetracycline-dependent transcriptional activator. Moderate induction of glucokinase has been shown to result in proportionate increases in glycolytic flux and in potentiation of glucose effects on insulin secretion and pyruvate kinase gene expression. In cells with 20-fold overexpression of glucokinase, however, glucose activation of secretion and gene expression was severely impaired. Measurements of the glycolytic flux in cells with 7- and 21-fold increases in glucokinase activity and determination of the flux control coefficient of this enzyme showed that control of glycolysis at the glucokinase step was lost in the cells at the higher level of overexpression. Challenging the cells with glucose above 6 mmresulted in massive accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate and caused a rapid and sustained depletion of cellular ATP, in contrast with the glucose-induced rise in ATP in cells with wild-type glucokinase levels. Loss of cell viability ensued upon prolonged culture in high glucose. In summary, in insulinoma beta cells strongly overexpressing glucokinase, an imbalance between glucose phosphorylation and turnover of glucose 6-phosphate resulted in acute glucose intolerance due to trapping of cellular orthophosphate in dead-end product and severe paralysis of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1976285351,"The catalytic subunit (L-μCANP) of human calpain I (μCANP, the high Ca2+ affinity form) and two of its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli or using the baculovirus Sf9 system. The mutants lacked domain III (L-μCANPΔ3) and the calmodulin-like domain IV (L-μCANPΔ4), respectively. The bacterially expressed proteins were solubilized from the inclusion bodies and refolded with polyethylene glycol. In Sf9 cells, co-expression of the inhibitor calpastatin was necessary to prevent autolysis of L-μCANP, whereas co-expression of the regulatory subunit enhanced it.

While the apparentKm(Ca2+) of freshly isolated human erythrocyte μCANP was about 60 μm, the recombinant monomeric forms L-μCANP and L-μCANPΔ3 required 65–215 and 400–530 μm Ca2+, respectively. Bacterially expressed L-μCANPΔ4 was Ca2+-independent; the presence of inhibitors during its renaturation was necessary to prevent its autolysis. A chimeric form (L-μmCANP) composed by domains I–III of μCANP and domain IV of calpain II (mCANP, the low Ca2+affinity form) was also expressed in Sf9 cells.

Calpains have also been proposed to play a role in various pathological processes associated with altered protein metabolism and/or altered calcium homeostasis (8Johnson P. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Two major isoforms of the protease are known, μCANP (or calpain I) and mCANP (or calpain II), which require about 50 and 300 μm Ca2+ for half-maximal activityin vitro, respectively (10Croall D.E.

More recently, a third calpain isoform, termed p94, which is specific for skeletal muscle and appears to be partly located in the cell nucleus, has also been identified (12Sorimachi H. Saido T.C.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The large subunit of CANP is composed of four domains (I–IV) as follows: domain I probably acts as a “repressor” of the catalytic activity and is cleaved at its N-terminal portion during the autolytic activation of the protease (3Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Avilés F.X. Innovation in Proteases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York1993: 197-214Google Scholar, 14Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H.

Sci. 1987; 12: 103-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar); the role of domain III, which has no obvious sequence homology to other proteins, is still obscure; domain IV is a calmodulin-like domain that contains four putative Ca2+-binding sites corresponding to the helix-loop-helix Ca2+-binding motif typical of calmodulin-like proteins (15Suzuki K.

Nature. 1984; 312: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The small subunit consists of an N-terminal glycine-rich hydrophobic domain V and of a calmodulin-like domain IV′ that is homologous to domain IV of the catalytic subunit. The association of the two subunits to form the heterodimer results from the interaction of domains IV and IV′ (8Johnson P. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The function of the 30-kDa subunit is not established, but Ca2+ appears to dissociate it from the catalytic subunit, activating it (18Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also promotes the autoproteolysis of the enzyme, cleaving amino acids from both subunits (11Cottin P. Poussard S. Desmazes J.P. Georgescauld D. Ducastaing A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Hathaway D.R. Werth D.K. Haeberle J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9072-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autoproteolytic processing is linked to the activation of CANP (two degradation products of about 78 and 76 kDa are produced seconds after the incubation of the enzyme with Ca2+), but recent work has shown that non-autoproteolyzed μCANP may also be active (20Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27992-27995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Reports have appeared describing the purification of both heterodimeric CANP isoforms from several tissues, e.g. muscle, liver, and kidney (2Croall D.E. De Martino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 3: 813-847Crossref Scopus (779) Google Scholar), but the isolation of large amounts of pure and active protein is laborious. cDNAs for the large and small subunits of calpains I and II have been cloned (21Ma H.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30457-30460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been achieved in Escherichia coli. Domain IV of the large subunit of calpain I has also been expressed (21Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a recent publication the expression of active human calpain I using the baculovirus system has been described (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The work described in this contribution reports the expression of the catalytic subunit of calpain I (L-μCANP) and of two mutants lacking domains III or IV (L-μCANPΔ3 and L-μCANPΔ4) in E. coli and using the baculovirus expression system. A chimeric form (L-μmCANP), in which domain IV of μCANP was replaced by that of mCANP, was also expressed to study the role of domain IV in the Ca2+ requirement for the activation of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONThis study describes the expression and properties of the recombinant catalytic subunit (L-μCANP) of μ-calpain, of two mutants lacking domain III (L-μCANPΔ3) or domain IV (L-μCANPΔ4), and of a chimeric form of the μ- and m-calpain (L-μmCANP). When expressed in E. coli, the proteins were always produced as inactive aggregates in the inclusion bodies, possibly a useful device to prevent cell damage, especially in the case of the Ca2+-independent L-μCANPΔ4. Co-expression of the large CANP subunit with the regulatory subunit was also attempted in E. coli to improve the production of soluble and active catalytic subunit (24Graham-Siegenthaler K. Gauthier S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30457-30460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The attempt was unsuccessful,i.e. the small subunit was expressed in soluble form but failed to prevent the aggregation of L-μCANP and did not improve its expression.The recently reported successful expression of biologically active and stable monomeric and heterodimeric human μ-calpains in eukaryotic cells (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) prompted the extension of the work to the baculovirus Sf9 cell expression system. However, the truncated mutant L-μCANPΔ4 could not be expressed in Sf9 cells, and baculovirus particles for this mutant were not produced. The mRNA for this mutant was present after transfection of the insect cells, but its amount was much lower than that for L-μCANP or L-μCANPΔ3. The reasons for the very low level of transcription of L-μCANPΔ4 is not understood at the moment, except that one could speculate that the production of constitutively active L-μCANPΔ4 could be lethal to eukaryotic cells. Possibly, insect cells activate a down-regulating system to prevent the formation of dangerous viral DNA.The autoproteolytic process leading to the production of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of expressed L-μCANP was enhanced in the baculovirus system by co-expressing the 21-kDa subunit. At variance with Meyeret al. (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who observed increased accumulation of the 80-kDa protein upon co-expression with the small subunit, in the present work the 21-kDa subunit was found to improve the solubility of the catalytic subunit but not its stability. In fact, in co-expressing cells, L-μCANP underwent more pronounced autolysis with the appearance of significant amounts of the 76-kDa form. On the contrary, co-expression with calpastatin prevented the autoproteolytic process.The chimeric variant L-μmCANP underwent an autoproteolytic pattern similar to that of L-μCANP, i.e. approximately equivalent amounts of the 80-, 78-, and 76-kDa products were observed. Also the expressed chimera was less stable when co-expressed with 21 kDa; the disappearance of the 78-kDa polypeptide could be taken as an indication that the small subunit somehow destabilizes this intermediate. The presence of degradation products of L-μCANP and L-μmCANP in the insect cells could be due to the fact that the overexpressed calpain monomers, exceeding the amount of endogenous calpastatin, escape its control and therefore undergo autoproteolysis in the cytoplasm; the presence of CALST in Sf9 cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR work (not shown). The more pronounced autolysis of the large subunit, when the recombinant small subunit was co-expressed, may be caused by the small subunit-mediated translocation of the protease to membranes, where calpain activation is enhanced.When exploring favorable conditions for the refolding of the bacterially expressed proteins, the latter were allowed to interactin vitro with the 21-kDa subunit (except for L-μCANPΔ4, since the association between calpain subunits occurs via domains IV and IV′ (41Minami Y. Emori Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Although this had no significant effect on the renaturation of the proteins produced in E. coli, a slight improvement was observed for the proteins expressed using the baculovirus system. Perhaps the proteins produced in eukaryotic cells may be in a different conformational state with respect to those expressed in E. coli. In agreement with the finding of Yoshizawa et al. (31Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the large subunit alone was fully active. Therefore, the small subunit is important but not necessary for calpain activation; it could perhaps contribute to the proper folding of the catalytic subunit. Since Ca2+ activation of heterodimeric calpain is strictly correlated to subunit dissociation, one could suggest that the heterodimeric form is forced to undergo dissociation upon Ca2+ binding to produce the active monomer. The suggestion would be compatible with previously published studies (18Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Anagli J. Vilei E.M. Molinari M. Calderara S. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A recent report, however, argues for the continued association of calpain subunits in the presence of Ca2+ and during the proteolysis of substrates (42Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 890-896Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Despite the large literature on the structure and function of calpains, little is known about the roles of domains III and IV of their native 80-kDa subunits. The experiments presented in this contribution have shown that the removal of domain III did not induce significant loss of calpain activity but altered the sensitivity of the protein to Ca2+, i.e. it increased very substantially the apparent Km(Ca2+) of the mutant. It would thus be attractive to speculate that domain III mediates the Ca2+-activating signal to calpain, i.e. upon binding of Ca2+ to domain IV, domain III would amplify the activating message to the active site in domain II. Possibly a change in the tertiary structure of domain III could increase the accessibility of the active site.As for domain IV, its removal has fortified the proposal that this domain is the Ca2+ receptor in the molecule. The finding that the replacement of domain IV of μCANP with that of mCANP improved the affinity of the protein for Ca2+ was unexpected, given the considerably lower Ca2+ affinity of mCANP. This suggests that domain IV may be important in the interaction of the molecule with Ca2+ but not as the only domain in the large subunit that mediates the Ca2+ response. As for the finding that L-μCANP, L-μmCANP, and L-μCANPΔ3 were all active and Ca2+-dependent in the absence of the small subunit, it clearly indicates that Ca2+, in addition to its function in dissociating the two calpain subunits, also has other roles; it could, for example, induce conformational changes of the large subunit that may be essential for its activation.

Nature. 1984; 312: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The small subunit consists of an N-terminal glycine-rich hydrophobic domain V and of a calmodulin-like domain IV′ that is homologous to domain IV of the catalytic subunit. The association of the two subunits to form the heterodimer results from the interaction of domains IV and IV′ (8Johnson P. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The function of the 30-kDa subunit is not established, but Ca2+ appears to dissociate it from the catalytic subunit, activating it (18Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also promotes the autoproteolysis of the enzyme, cleaving amino acids from both subunits (11Cottin P. Poussard S. Desmazes J.P. Georgescauld D. Ducastaing A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Hathaway D.R. Werth D.K. Haeberle J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9072-9077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autoproteolytic processing is linked to the activation of CANP (two degradation products of about 78 and 76 kDa are produced seconds after the incubation of the enzyme with Ca2+), but recent work has shown that non-autoproteolyzed μCANP may also be active (20Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27992-27995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reports have appeared describing the purification of both heterodimeric CANP isoforms from several tissues, e.g. muscle, liver, and kidney (2Croall D.E. De Martino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 3: 813-847Crossref Scopus (779) Google Scholar), but the isolation of large amounts of pure and active protein is laborious. cDNAs for the large and small subunits of calpains I and II have been cloned (21Ma H.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30457-30460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been achieved in Escherichia coli. Domain IV of the large subunit of calpain I has also been expressed (21Ma H. Yang H.Q. Takano E. Lee W.J. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a recent publication the expression of active human calpain I using the baculovirus system has been described (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The work described in this contribution reports the expression of the catalytic subunit of calpain I (L-μCANP) and of two mutants lacking domains III or IV (L-μCANPΔ3 and L-μCANPΔ4) in E. coli and using the baculovirus expression system. A chimeric form (L-μmCANP), in which domain IV of μCANP was replaced by that of mCANP, was also expressed to study the role of domain IV in the Ca2+ requirement for the activation of the enzyme. DISCUSSIONThis study describes the expression and properties of the recombinant catalytic subunit (L-μCANP) of μ-calpain, of two mutants lacking domain III (L-μCANPΔ3) or domain IV (L-μCANPΔ4), and of a chimeric form of the μ- and m-calpain (L-μmCANP). When expressed in E. coli, the proteins were always produced as inactive aggregates in the inclusion bodies, possibly a useful device to prevent cell damage, especially in the case of the Ca2+-independent L-μCANPΔ4. Co-expression of the large CANP subunit with the regulatory subunit was also attempted in E. coli to improve the production of soluble and active catalytic subunit (24Graham-Siegenthaler K. Gauthier S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30457-30460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The attempt was unsuccessful,i.e. the small subunit was expressed in soluble form but failed to prevent the aggregation of L-μCANP and did not improve its expression.The recently reported successful expression of biologically active and stable monomeric and heterodimeric human μ-calpains in eukaryotic cells (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) prompted the extension of the work to the baculovirus Sf9 cell expression system. However, the truncated mutant L-μCANPΔ4 could not be expressed in Sf9 cells, and baculovirus particles for this mutant were not produced. The mRNA for this mutant was present after transfection of the insect cells, but its amount was much lower than that for L-μCANP or L-μCANPΔ3. The reasons for the very low level of transcription of L-μCANPΔ4 is not understood at the moment, except that one could speculate that the production of constitutively active L-μCANPΔ4 could be lethal to eukaryotic cells. Possibly, insect cells activate a down-regulating system to prevent the formation of dangerous viral DNA.The autoproteolytic process leading to the production of the 78- and 76-kDa forms of expressed L-μCANP was enhanced in the baculovirus system by co-expressing the 21-kDa subunit. At variance with Meyeret al. (25Meyer S.L. Bozyczko-Coyne D. Mallya S.K. Spais C.M. Bihovsky R. Kawooya J.K. Lang D.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who observed increased accumulation of the 80-kDa protein upon co-expression with the small subunit, in the present work the 21-kDa subunit was found to improve the solubility of the catalytic subunit but not its stability. In fact, in co-expressing cells, L-μCANP underwent more pronounced autolysis with the appearance of significant amounts of the 76-kDa form. On the contrary, co-expression with calpastatin prevented the autoproteolytic process.The chimeric variant L-μmCANP underwent an autoproteolytic pattern similar to that of L-μCANP, i.e. approximately equivalent amounts of the 80-, 78-, and 76-kDa products were observed. Also the expressed chimera was less stable when co-expressed with 21 kDa; the disappearance of the 78-kDa polypeptide could be taken as an indication that the small subunit somehow destabilizes this intermediate. The presence of degradation products of L-μCANP and L-μmCANP in the insect cells could be due to the fact that the overexpressed calpain monomers, exceeding the amount of endogenous calpastatin, escape its control and therefore undergo autoproteolysis in the cytoplasm; the presence of CALST in Sf9 cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR work (not shown). The more pronounced autolysis of the large subunit, when the recombinant small subunit was co-expressed, may be caused by the small subunit-mediated translocation of the protease to membranes, where calpain activation is enhanced.When exploring favorable conditions for the refolding of the bacterially expressed proteins, the latter were allowed to interactin vitro with the 21-kDa subunit (except for L-μCANPΔ4, since the association between calpain subunits occurs via domains IV and IV′ (41Minami Y. Emori Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Although this had no significant effect on the renaturation of the proteins produced in E. coli, a slight improvement was observed for the proteins expressed using the baculovirus system. Perhaps the proteins produced in eukaryotic cells may be in a different conformational state with respect to those expressed in E. coli. In agreement with the finding of Yoshizawa et al. (31Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the large subunit alone was fully active. Therefore, the small subunit is important but not necessary for calpain activation; it could perhaps contribute to the proper folding of the catalytic subunit. Since Ca2+ activation of heterodimeric calpain is strictly correlated to subunit dissociation, one could suggest that the heterodimeric form is forced to undergo dissociation upon Ca2+ binding to produce the active monomer. The suggestion would be compatible with previously published studies (18Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Anagli J. Vilei E.M. Molinari M. Calderara S. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A recent report, however, argues for the continued association of calpain subunits in the presence of Ca2+ and during the proteolysis of substrates (42Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 890-896Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Despite the large literature on the structure and function of calpains, little is known about the roles of domains III and IV of their native 80-kDa subunits. The experiments presented in this contribution have shown that the removal of domain III did not induce significant loss of calpain activity but altered the sensitivity of the protein to Ca2+, i.e. it increased very substantially the apparent Km(Ca2+) of the mutant. It would thus be attractive to speculate that domain III mediates the Ca2+-activating signal to calpain, i.e. upon binding of Ca2+ to domain IV, domain III would amplify the activating message to the active site in domain II. Possibly a change in the tertiary structure of domain III could increase the accessibility of the active site.As for domain IV, its removal has fortified the proposal that this domain is the Ca2+ receptor in the molecule. The finding that the replacement of domain IV of μCANP with that of mCANP improved the affinity of the protein for Ca2+ was unexpected, given the considerably lower Ca2+ affinity of mCANP. This suggests that domain IV may be important in the interaction of the molecule with Ca2+ but not as the only domain in the large subunit that mediates the Ca2+ response. As for the finding that L-μCANP, L-μmCANP, and L-μCANPΔ3 were all active and Ca2+-dependent in the absence of the small subunit, it clearly indicates that Ca2+, in addition to its function in dissociating the two calpain subunits, also has other roles; it could, for example, induce conformational changes of the large subunit that may be essential for its activation. This study describes the expression and properties of the recombinant catalytic subunit (L-μCANP) of μ-calpain, of two mutants lacking domain III (L-μCANPΔ3) or domain IV (L-μCANPΔ4), and of a chimeric form of the μ- and m-calpain (L-μmCANP).

Previously, we identified a novel cell surface HP/HS interacting protein (HIP) from human uterine epithelia and a variety of other human epithelial and endothelial cells and cell lines (Liu, S., Smith, S. E., Julian, J., Rohde, L. H., Karin, N. J., and Carson, D. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11817–11823; Rohde, L. H., Julian, J., Babaknia, A., and Carson, D. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11824–11830). In the current studies, we have purified and characterized HIP from HEC cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, as well as recombinant HIP from a bacterial expression system. HIP supports attachment of the human trophoblastic cell line, JAR, in a HS-dependent fashion. Predigestion of JAR cells with a mixture of heparitinases, but not chondroitinase AC, abolished cell attachment to HIP. In addition, JAR cell attachment to HIP is highly sensitive to HP inhibition and much more selective for HP/HS than other glycosaminoglycans. Dermatan sulfate displays partial inhibitory activity as well, consistent with the observation that chondroitinase ABC digestion partially reduces JAR cell attachment to HIP. Solid-phase binding assays indicate HIP binds [3H]HP with high affinity (apparentK D = 8 nm). Furthermore, HIP bound cell surface/extracellular matrix-associated HS, expressed by RL95 cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line. Anti-HIP antibody generated against a synthetic peptide derived from a putative HP/HS-binding motif resident within HIP inhibited about half of [3H]HP binding to HIP, indicating that this domain is a functional HP-binding domain of HIP. Similarly, this same synthetic peptide motif of HIP could block about 50% of [3H]HP binding to HIP; however, this peptide almost completely inhibited cell attachment to HIP, suggesting a critical role, in this regard. Collectively, these results suggest that HIP can function as a HP/HS-binding cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion molecule.

Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a novel HP/HSinteracting protein, HIP, has been identified and cloned from human cDNA libraries and the expression of HIP has been studied in RL95 cells and other human cell lines and tissues (10Liu S.

HIP is expressed on the cell surfaces of RL95 cells and most human epithelial and endothelial cell lines. HIP binds to HP-agarose with relatively high affinity and directly binds 125I-HP in125I-HP gel overlay assays (3Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Fuks Z. Trends Biochem.

Given these activities and its cell surface disposition, it was suggested that HIP plays a role in HP/HS-dependent cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions. In the current study, we have used HIP isolated from HEC cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, as well as bacterially-expressed recombinant HIP for characterization of cell attachment and HP/HS binding activity. Our results show that: 1) HIP from either source displays similar activities; 2) HIP supports attachment of JAR cells, a human trophoblastic cell line, in a HS-dependent fashion; 3) a synthetic peptide generated to a putative HP/HS-binding motif greatly inhibits JAR cell attachment to HIP; 4) HIP selectively binds HP with high affinity and anti-HIP antibody, generated against the same synthetic peptide that inhibits cell attachment, partially blocks [3H]HP binding to HIP; 5) HIP binds cell surface and extracellular matrix forms of HS. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HIP supports cell attachment and binds HP/HS with high affinity, indicating that it can function as a HP/HS-binding cell-cell/cell-extracellular matrix adhesion molecule. Heparin, low molecular weight heparin, bovine intestinal mucosa heparan sulfate, bovine kidney heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate C, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, heparinases I, II, and III, chondroitinases AC and ABC, BSA, and heparin-agarose were purchased from Sigma. [3H]HP (0.44 mCi/mg) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [35S]Sulfate (43 Ci/mg) and 125I-protein A (30 μCi/μg) were purchased from ICN Biochemical Inc. (Irvine, CA). Tissue culture media components were obtained from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. HEC and JAR cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (F-12) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator. Production of polyclonal anti-HIP antibodies and their affinity purification was as described before (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-HIP immunoaffinity matrix was formed by cross-linking the affinity-purified antibodies to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) following the procedures provided by the manufacturer. Confluent HEC cell cultures were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS three times and cells released from dishes with 10 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The harvested cells were disrupted, in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture solution (PICS) (5Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), by three cycles of freezing and thawing, followed by sonication on ice for 30 s. The mixture then was centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected and diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to reach the final NaCl concentration of 0.15 m. The diluted cell lysate then was mixed with heparin-agarose and incubated with constant rotary agitation at 4 °C overnight. The following day the mixture was loaded into a column and washed sequentially with 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The 1.0m eluate from the heparin-agarose column was collected and concentrated with Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated 1.0 m eluate was then diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to reach a final NaCl concentration of 0.15 m, and incubated with anti-HIP immunoaffinity matrix, in the presence of PICS at 4 °C overnight in a rotary agitator. The mixture then was loaded into a 3-ml syringe column, and the resin washed extensively first with 0.15 m, then 0.5m NaCl 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and then 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 4.0. Finally, the bound protein(s) was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, into a tube containing 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and immediately dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, overnight. The dialyzed eluate then was concentrated with Centricon-10 and stored at −80 °C until use. PCR primers were made with EcoRI adaptors to the human HIP sequence nucleotides 25–508 with an engineered mutation at position 507 G > A to make a stronger stop codon for Escherichia coli. The forward and reverse primers were: 5′-CCCGAATTCGACATGGCCAAGTC and 5′-CCGAAGTCTCATTTCTTAAGGGG, respectively (10Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amplified product containing the entire open reading frame of HIP was subcloned in-frame into the EcoRI site of the Oligo-HIS vector as described previously (12Van Dyke M.W. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; III: 99-104Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The product of this fusion added 27 N-terminal amino acids containing the oligohistidine motif. The methods used for purification by nickel affinity chromatography were identical to those previously described (12Van Dyke M.W. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; III: 99-104Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) except for two modifications described below.E. coli were grown to A 600 = 0.62 prior to induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All cell extraction and column wash buffers contained 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Detergent was removed a by a final column wash with buffer not containing Triton X-100. After elution from the nickel affinity column, column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to identify fractions containing HIP. The fractions were pooled and subsequently diluted 1:20 in 2 mm EDTA and incubated batchwise with 0.5 ml of heparin-agarose for 15 min at 4 °C. This suspension then was centrifuged at 1180 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and discarded, and the heparin-agarose pellet transferred into a 1-ml syringe fitted with glass wool. The column was washed with 5 ml of PBS and then eluted with 1 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Fractions (10 drops/fraction) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Solubilized protein samples were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed sequentially with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 100% acetone, and air-dried. The pellets were dissolved in equal volumes of sample extraction buffer: 4 murea, 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (v/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and sample buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), heated in boiling water for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 15% (w/v) acrylamide resolving gel as described previously by (14Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and detected with silver staining (15Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, the gel was rinsed briefly with transfer buffer (100 mm Tris base and 100 mm glycine, pH 9.2) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C for 5 h at 40 V in a Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The transferred blot was blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (PAT) overnight at room temperature. The blot then was incubated with primary antibody diluted in PAT plus 0.1% (w/v) BSA at room temperature for at least 6 h, rinsed with PAT three times for 5 min each, and incubated with 6 μCi of125I-protein A in 70 ml of PAT plus 0.1% (w/v) BSA at room temperature for more than 6 h. Finally, the blot was rinsed with PAT three times for 5 min each, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at −20 °C. JAR cell attachment to HIP was performed on 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY). Each well was coated with approximately 3 μg of purified HIP, fibronectin, or heat-denatured BSA and the plates were dried overnight. Each well was then rinsed with 100 μl of PBS three times and blocked with 100 μl of heat-denatured BSA (0.1% (w/v) for 1–2 h. After blocking, the wells were rinsed with PBS three times again prior to the addition of cells. JAR cells at 70–90% confluence were detached with trypsin/EDTA solution for 5–10 min at 37 °C. The detached cells were rinsed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) plus 0.1% (w/v) BSA and resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml. Then 100 ml of this cell suspension was added to each well in the presence or absence of glycosaminoglycan competitors, and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 3–4 h. At the end of each experiment, unattached cells were gently rinsed with PBS, and the relative cell attachment was determined using the hexosaminidase assay (16Landegren V. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 377-388Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). For glycosaminoglycan competition assays, 10 or 100 μg/ml HP, low molecular weight HP, bovine intestinal mucosa HS, bovine kidney HS, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate C, hyaluronic acid, or keratan sulfate were included in the incubation medium and used as competitors in the assays of JAR cell attachment to HIP. To determine if JAR cell surface HP/HS or other GAGs mediate JAR cell attachment to HIP, JAR cells were digested with 500 milliunits/ml of Hep3 (a mixture of heparinases I, II, and III), chondroitinase AC, or chondroitinase ABC, in the presence of PICS, at 37 °C for 30 min prior to addition to HIP-coated wells. [3H]HP or [35S]HS, obtained following metabolic labeling of RL95 cells with H2[35S]O4 as described (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), were used in solid-phase HIP-binding assays performed in 96-well microassay plates. Cell surface [35S]HS was prepared as described (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix from 35S-labeled RL95 cells was prepared as described previously (17Vlodavsky I. Lui G.M. Gospodarowitz D. Cell. 1980; 19: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell layers were gently rinsed with PBS twice, and then extracted with PBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mm NH4OH for 5 min at room temperature. Afterward, the dish was rinsed four times with PBS, and the residue, defined as “extracellular matrix,” was removed with a rubber policeman. Glycosaminoglycans were released by mild alkaline hydrolysis, digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the identity of the remaining high molecular weight (>10,000) material as HS was confirmed by nitrous acid digestion as described previously (9Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 μg of HIP (or heat-denatured BSA as a control) was added to each well and dried at 37 °C overnight. The next day, each well was rinsed with PBS three times, and blocked with 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) heat-denatured BSA in a 37 °C incubator for at least 1 h. Each well was then rinsed with PBS three times, and then [3H]HP or [35S]HS (typically 1.0 × 105 dpm) were added in a final volume of 50 ml in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 2 h. In some assays, the [3H]HP concentration was varied. In other assays, different amounts of HIP were used to coat wells. For glycosaminoglycan competition assays, different concentrations of glycosaminoglycans, including unlabeled HP, low molecular weight HP, bovine intestinal mucosa HS, bovine kidney HS, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate C, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid were added to the binding assays. At the end of each experiment, unbound [3H]HP (or [35S]HS) was removed by rinsing three times with PBS. Bound [3H]HP (or [35S]HS) was extracted with 100 ml of extraction buffer (4 m guanidine HCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) overnight at 37 °C. Forty ml of the extract was counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. In one type of experiment, purified HIP was preabsorbed with anti-HIP antibodies or non-immune rabbit IgG. Briefly, approximately 5 μg of HIP was dissolved in a final volume of 180 ml in PBS in the presence of 60 μg/ml affinity purified rabbit anti-HIP IgG or nonimmune rabbit IgG. Anti-HIP is directed against a synthetic peptide, as described in detail previously (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Five μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added to this solution and the mixture incubated with constant rotary agitation for 4 h at room temperature. The resin containing IgG complexes was then removed by brief centrifugation at 15,000 × g and the supernatants used for coating surfaces for binding assays. An equivalent of 1 μg of HIP was used to coat surfaces. In a second type of experiment, 1 μg of HIP was used to coat surfaces and the typical [3H]HP binding assay was performed in the presence of either 20 μg/50 μl non-immune IgG or anti-HIP peptide. Previous studies have shown that HIP binds to HP-agarose with relatively high affinity. In addition, it was observed that HEC cells, a human uterine cell line, express relatively higher amounts of HIP than other cell lines (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, HEC cells were used as a source of HIP, and HP-agarose affinity chromatography was employed as a first step of HIP purification. Stepwise elution (0.15, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m NaCl, respectively) was employed to elute HIP from HP-agarose affinity column. HIP was not eluted with either 0.15 or 0.5 m NaCl. HIP was totally released from the HP-agarose column at 1.0 m NaCl elution as detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HIP antibodies and silver staining (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 5). Thus, the 1.0 m NaCl eluate was subjected to further purification. The 1.0 m NaCl eluate from the HP-agarose affinity column was diluted to a final concentration of 0.15m NaCl, applied to an anti-HIP immunoaffinity resin, and eluted sequentially with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 mNaCl in Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and glycine-HCl, pH 4.0. None of these wash steps released HIP from the anti-HIP immunoaffinity resin (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 3 and 6) HIP bound to the anti-HIP immunoaffinity column and was released with glycine-HCl at pH 2.5. Silver staining of glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, eluate revealed two major bands, one with the M r24,000, which is identical to the size of intact HIP (10Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and was verified by Western blotting using anti-HIP antibody (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) and another with M r 14,000, which was repeatedly observed in purified HIP preparations and appears to be a degradation product of HIP. A histidine-tagged version of recombinant HIP was expressed in E. coli and isolated by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 B). Both sources of HIP were used for further studies. HIP isolated from HEC cells was used in most of the experiments shown; however, recombinant HIP displayed similar [3H]HP binding and cell attachment activities in all assays. To determine if HIP can support cell attachment, JAR cells, a human trophoblastic cell line derived from a placental choriocarcinoma (18Pattillo R.A. Gey G.O. Delfs E. Huang W.Y. Hause L. Grarancis G. Knoth M. Amatruda J. Bertino J. Friesen H.G. Mattingly R.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 172: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were used for cell attachment assays. JAR cell attachment to HIP-coated wells was HIP concentration-dependent, and time-dependent with maximum attachment at 2–4 h (data not shown). In contrast, heat-denatured BSA-coated wells did not support JAR cell attachment (Fig. 2). Similarly, cell attachment activity was observed with either HIP isolated from HEC cells or expressed in E. coli. To test HP sensitivity of JAR cell attachment to HIP, different concentrations of HP were included in the cell attachment incubation media. As shown in Fig. 2, inclusion of HP at concentrations of 10 μg/ml or more maximally inhibited JAR cell attachment to HIP. Even in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml (approximately 10 nm) HP, cell attachment was inhibited by more than 60% (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, JAR cell attachment to HIP is highly sensitive to HP. To determine the GAG selectivity of JAR cell attachment to HIP, different GAGs at concentrations of 10 or 100 μg/ml were included in the incubation media for cell attachment assays. As shown in Fig. 2 A, among the GAGs tested, dermatan sulfate, bovine intestinal mucosa heparan sulfate, and low molecular weight HP displayed a similar degree of inhibition of JAR cell attachment to HIP as HP at a concentration of 100 μg/ml; however, at a concentration of 10 μg/ml only HP maximally inhibited cell attachment (>80%). Therefore, JAR cell attachment to HIP is more selective for HP than other GAGs. To determine if HS or other JAR cell surface GAGs mediated JAR cell attachment to HIP, JAR cells were predigested with GAG lyases before performing the cell attachment assay. Previous studies have shown that JAR cells express both HS and dermatan sulfate as their major cell surface glycosaminoglycans and that the conditions used remove all detectable HS or dermatan sulfate from JAR cell surfaces (9Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that predigestion of JAR cells with heparitinases destroyed (>95%) the ability of JAR cells to attach to HIP. Predigestion with chondroitinase ABC, which degrades dermatan sulfate in addition to chondroitin sulfates A and C, partially (65%) inhibited JAR cell attachment to HIP; however, predigestion with chondroitinase AC, which degrades only chondroitin sulfates A and C, only reduced JAR cell attachment by 20%. Collectively, these results indicate that cell surface HS and, to a lesser extent, dermatan sulfate mediate JAR cell attachment to HIP. Initially, [3H]HP binding was examined as a function of the amount of HIP used to coat surfaces. A solid-phase binding assay was employed similar to that used by others to approximate various aspects of binding kinetics and specificity (19Skubitz A.P.N. McCarthy J.B. Charonis A.S. Furcht L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4861-4868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Zhao Q. Yi X.-Y. Mizkelson D.J. Klein D.J. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, [3H]HP binding to HIP was concentration-dependent and saturable. Kinetic analysis of these data revealed a class of binding sites with an apparentK D of 8 nm. Lower affinity binding (K D = 85 nm) also was observed that may result from heterogeneity of the [3H]HP preparations or more than one class of binding sites in HIP. Both HEC-derived and bacterially-expressed HIP displayed similar [3H]HP binding characteristics. To further demonstrate that HIP, as opposed to contaminants of HIP preparations, were responsible for the HP binding activity, polyclonal anti-HIP antibody generated against a putative HP/HS-binding domain (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was employed in the assays of [3H]HP binding to HIP. Preabsorption of purified HIP with anti-HIP antibody reduced [3H]HP binding ability to levels similar to that observed in unlabeled HP-blocked controls (Fig.5). In contrast, preabsorption with non-immune IgG did not show a significant inhibitory effect on its HP binding ability. Inclusion of anti-HIP peptide antibody, but not the non-immune IgG, partially inhibited [3H]HP binding to HIP (approximately 55% of inhibition). Thus, while the HIP-directed antibody efficiently removed the protein in preabsorption experiments, this peptide domain does not account for all the HP binding activity in HIP. The same peptide to which the antibody was generated was used to compete for JAR cell attachment and [3H]HP binding to HIP. As shown in Fig.6, HIP peptide inhibited JAR cell attachment to HIP in a dose-dependent fashion with approximately 90% inhibition at 100 μg/ml. In contrast, HIP peptide less effectively competed for [3H]HP binding to HIP reducing this value by approximately 50 and 65% at 100 and 1,000 μg/ml, respectively. Thus, while this HIP peptide sequence did not account for all of the HP binding activity of HIP, it appears to correspond to a motif critical for cell attachment.Figure 6HIP peptide inhibits JAR cell attachment and [3H]HP binding to purified HIP. JAR cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were added to 96-well plates coated with 3 μg/ml of the purified HIP in the presence of different concentrations of HIP peptide as indicated and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 4 h (□). At the end of the experiment, unattached cells were rinsed with PBS and cell attachment was determined by hexosaminidase assay. Data are expressed as percentages relative to controls performed in the absence of competitors. Results represent the mean ± S.D. of duplicate determinations. In parallel, [3H]HP (1.0 × 105 dpm/well) was added to 96-well plates coated with 3 μg/well of purified HIP in the absence or presence of different concentrations of HIP peptide-1 as indicated, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (○). At the end of experiment, unbound [3H]HP was rinsed with PBS and bound [3H]HP was extracted and determined by liquid scintillation counting. Data are expressed as percentages relative to controls performed in the absence peptide. Results represent the mean ± S.D. of duplicate determinations in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlabeled HP, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate C, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, bovine intestinal mucosa HS, bovine kidney HS, and low molecular weight HP were used to test the GAG selectivity of [3H]HP binding to HIP. Fig.7 shows that HP most effectively inhibited [3H]HP binding to HIP at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (90% of inhibition). Low molecular weight HP and dermatan sulfate showed a partial inhibitory effect (approximately 20%) while other GAGs did not show any significant inhibition on [3H]HP binding to HIP. Therefore, consistent with the cell adhesion assay results, HIP appeared to bind HP preferentially over other GAGs. Finally, HIP-coated wells bound HS isolated from RL95 cell surfaces or extracellular matrix-enriched fractions (Fig.8). Binding was reduced to background levels by the inclusion of excess unlabeled HP in the assay. The ability of HIP to bind surface or extracellular matrix HS further supported the notion that HIP promotes HS-dependent cell adhesion.Figure 8HIP binds cell surface/extracellular matrix-associated HS expressed by RL95 cells. Cell surface or extracellular matrix (ECM) [35S]HS fractions were added to 96-well plates (1.0 × 105 dpm/well) coated with 3 μg/well purified HIP in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml unlabeled HP and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. At the end of experiment, unbound [35S]HS was rinsed with PBS, and bound [35S]HS was extracted and determined by liquid scintillation counting. Results are mean ± S.D. of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present studies, HIP purified from a human cell line or expressed in E. coli has been used to study cell adhesion and HP/HS binding activities. Previously, it was suggested that HIP might bind HP/HS and be involved in HS-dependent cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions. This suggestion was based on the observations that HIP is expressed on cell surfaces and binds HP either in solution or in solid-phase assays (10Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The current studies demonstrate that purified HIP can support JAR cell attachment in a HS-dependent fashion and selectively bind HP/HS with high affinity. JAR cell attachment to HIP is highly sensitive to HP inhibition. Concentrations of HP as low as 0.1 μg/ml (approximately 10 nm assuming an average molecular mass of HP of 10,000 Da) inhibited cell attachment to HIP greater than 50%. JAR cell attachment to HIP also was more selective for HP than other GAGs tested. At a concentration of 10 μg/ml, HP inhibited JAR cell attachment by more than 80% while dermatan sulfate or low molecular HP showed less than 30% inhibition in this regard. Other GAGs did not show significant inhibition at this concentration. Furthermore, predigestion of JAR cells with heparitinases completely abolished attachment to HIP, demonstrating that HS is the major cell surface molecule mediating JAR cell attachment to HIP. Chondroitinase ABC, but not chondroitinase AC, predigestion of JAR cells also partially inhibited cell attachment, indicating that dermatan sulfate displayed on JAR cell surfaces may also be involved in attachment. Thus, these data suggest that, in addition to HS, dermatan sulfate expressed on JAR cell surfaces also participates in attachment to HIP. These results are consistent not only with the GAG competition studies, but also previous studies showing the presence of both HS and dermatan sulfate on JAR cell surfaces and their involvement in cell-cell adhesion between JAR and RL95 cells (9Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HIP specifically and selectively binds HP/HS with high affinity. Scatchard analysis revealed at least one class of high affinity binding sites with an apparent K D of 8 nm. These affinities are comparable to those reported for other HP/HS-binding proteins (19Skubitz A.P.N. McCarthy J.B. Charonis A.S. Furcht L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4861-4868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yabkowitz R. Lowe J.B. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strong binding displayed in these solid-phase assays as well as the tenacity of the HIP interaction in solution with HP-agarose indicate that HIP is likely to form stable complexes with HS at cell surfaces. In this regard, HS isolated from RL95 cell surfaces or extracellular matrices bound to HIP in solid-phase assays. Thus, HIP is capable of binding HS displayed at sites where cell adhesion normally occurs. Heparanase is an enzyme that partially degrades HS and is found both intracellularly as well as secreted by various normal and tumor cells and cell lines (23Vlodavsky I. Michaeli R.I. Bar-Ner M. Fridman R. Horowitz A.T. Fuks Z. Biran S. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1988; 24: 464-470PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nakajima M. Irimora T. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 36: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We have found that heparanase selectively acts on HS fractions recognized by HIP and destroys their HIP binding activities (25Marchetti D. Liu S. Carson D.D. J. Biol.

This action of enzymes like heparanase may modulate HIP-dependent interactions with cell surface and extracellular matrix forms of HS. An antibody generated against an HP-binding synthetic peptide sequence of HIP (26Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) specifically preabsorbed the [3H]HP binding activity from HIP preparations. This further demonstrated that HIP, and not a contaminant, contributed this activity. Interestingly, this same antibody also specifically inhibited [3H]HP binding to HIP by 55%, indicating that this peptide sequence corresponds to one of the major HP/HS-binding sites of HIP. Solid-phase binding assays also indicated that HIP contains more than one HP/HS-binding site. Competition assays indicated that this peptide motif competed for 50–65% of the total [3H]HP binding to HIP, consistent with the antibody inhibition results. However, this same peptide almost entirely inhibited cell attachment. Thus, this peptide motif, in particular, appears to be critical for cell attachment activity. Collectively, the current studies demonstrate that HIP directly participates in HP/HS-binding events and supports cell attachment. HS proteoglycans have been suggested to function as attachment-promoting factors at embryonic surfaces during the critical event of embryo implantation both in vitro and in vivo (5Farach M.C.

Biol. 1993; 155: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A corollary of this hypothesis is that uterine epithelial cells display complementary HS-binding sites at their cell surfaces. Previous studies have demonstrated that both mouse and human uterine epithelia display such specific, high affinity cell surface HS-binding sites (6Wilson O. Jacobs A.L. Steward S. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 143: 60-67Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of HIP coupled with its disposition at the cell surface of uterine epithelial cells and cell lines (11Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol.

Studies of HIP function in embryo implantation in mice should directly address this possibility. We thank Dr. Mary M.

https://openalex.org/W2073692166,"Unlike other trypsin-type serine proteases, zymogento-enzyme transition of conformation of factor VII apparently requires not only conversion of the zymogen to active form factor VIIa (VIIa) but also interaction of VIIa with tissue factor (TF). To determine the region of interaction that correlates with maturation of the VIIa active site, we modified intramolecular disulfide bonds in VIIa and examined the interaction of the modified VIIa with soluble TF (sTF). We found that partial reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of disulfide bonds in VIIa led to losses of amidolytic activity and the binding ability to sTF. To determine the sites of modification that associate with the loss of functions, partially S-carboxamidomethylated VIIa was separated on a column of immobilized sTF. Each of the sTF-bound and sTF-unbound fractions and native VIIa was then digested by trypsin, and the digest was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. We found that reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 in the protease domain of VIIa led to loss of the binding ability with sTF, and the modification of a disulfide bond between Cys-340 and Cys-368 of VIIa led to loss of the amidolytic activity. In the three-dimensional structures of trypsinogen and trypsin, the disulfide bonds corresponding to Cys-340–Cys-368 and Cys-310–Cys-329 of VIIa are, respectively, in and adjacent to the activation domain, which has flexible conformation in trypsinogen but not in trypsin. Furthermore, the crystal structure of human VIIa·TF complex indicates that the region next to Cys-310–Cys-329 is in contact with sTF. We speculate that a regional flexibility, reflected by the labile nature of disulfide bonds of Cys-310–Cys-329 and Cys-340–Cys-368 in the protease domain, contributes to the inability of VIIa to attain the active conformation. Interaction of TF with this flexible region may stabilize the structure in a conformation similar to that of the active state of VIIa.

Interaction of TF with this flexible region may stabilize the structure in a conformation similar to that of the active state of VIIa. Initiation of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway is mediated by a complex formation between plasma-derived factor VII/VIIa and cell-bound tissue factor (TF). 1The abbreviations used are: TF, tissue factor; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; rsBTF, recombinant bovine-soluble tissue factor; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. VII is a trypsin-type serine protease zymogen that is initially synthesized in hepatocytes and is then secreted into the blood. The complex formation between zymogen VII and TF in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids facilitates conversion of the zymogen to the active form VIIa, which is catalyzed by downstream coagulation factors or VIIa·TF complex itself. The complex formation between VIIa and TF also greatly enhances the protease activity of VIIa toward its natural substrates, factors X and IX, thus triggering the coagulation cascade (1Silverberg S.A. Nemerson Y. Zur M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8481-8488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nemerson Y. Blood. 1988; 71: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W.

Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The reciprocal activation between VII/VIIa and its downstream factors after exposure to TF may be important for triggering the cascade. Although physiological initial activator of zymogen VII is unknown, the resulting VIIa still has weak protease activity and is insensitive to plasma protease inhibitors (5Shigematsu Y. Miyata T.

Blood. 1993; 81: 734-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without forming complexes with inhibitors may provide the capacity to initiate the coagulation pathway. In vitro, formation of the active complex can be evidenced by measuring the amidolytic activity of VIIa; this activity is also enhanced in the presence of TF and Ca2+ without phospholipids (8Pedersen A.H.

On the other hand, we reported that VIIa has a Gla domain-independent site(s) interacting with TF, whereas zymogen VII does not have such a corresponding site(s) and that an α-amino group of NH2-terminal Ile-153 of VIIa heavy chain is important for the Gla domain-independent interaction with TF (17Higashi S. Nishimura H. Aita K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18891-18898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α-amino group of Ile-153 in VIIa is protected from carbamylation after complex formation with TF; hence the TF-induced conformational change occurs in this region. When the active site of VIIa is modified with transition state analogs of a substrate such as dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone or p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, the α-amino group of Ile-153 is protected from carbamylation (19Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modification of the active site of VIIa with dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone or p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride leads to a great increase in its affinity for TF. All of these data support a model where the protease domain of VIIa exists in equilibrium between minor active and dominant zymogen-like inactive conformational states, and preferential binding of TF to the active state leads to a shift in equilibrium into the active state, thereby accelerating VIIa activity. Although several sites containing residues 195–206 (20Wildgoose P. Kazim A.L. Kisiel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We now provide evidence that labile disulfide bonds in the protease domain of VIIa stabilize the conformations essential for catalytic activity and interaction with TF. The sources of materials used were as follows: S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride) from Chromogenix, Stockholm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) from Sigma; Affi-Gel 10 from Bio-Rad; 2-mercaptoethanol and iodoacetamide from Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto; Ultrasphere ODS 5U (2.0 × 150 mm) from Beckman. Bovine pancreatic trypsin treated with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone was purchased from Worthington. The ammonium sulfate fraction (40–65% saturation) of the barium citrate precipitate from bovine plasma was a gift from Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Bovine VII was highly purified, as described (25Higashi S. Kawabata S. Nishimura H. Funasaki H. Ohyama S. Miyamoto S. Funatsu A. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). VIIa was prepared from the bovine VII, as described (11Higashi S. Nishimura H. Fujii S. Takada K. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17990-17996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA encoding the extracellular domain of TF (amino acid residues 1–213, named recombinant bovine-soluble TF, rsBTF) was constructed from the cDNA of bovine TF previously isolated (26Takayenoki Y. Muta T. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in yeast and purified using the same procedures as those used for human soluble TF, also expressed in yeast (5Shigematsu Y. Miyata T. Higashi S. Miki T. Sadler J.E. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21329-21337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified rsBTF gave a single band with a M r 37,000 on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations of rsBTF, VIIa, and modified derivatives of VIIa were determined by amino acid analysis. Bovine VIIa (10 μm) was incubated with various concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% NaN3 (TBS), and 5 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for 60 min. After incubation, each of the samples was transferred to a container of ice water and further incubated with iodoacetamide; the concentration in the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.2-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol. After 2 h, the samples were dialyzed against TBS. After modification of VIIa, under various conditions the modified VIIa (20 nm) was incubated with rsBTF (600 nm) in 230 μl of TBS containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min; then 20 μl of S-2288 (10 mm) was added. The rates of change in absorbance at 405 nm were measured to determine the velocity of hydrolysis of S-2288. The rate of hydrolysis of S-2288 by the modified VIIa (400 nm) in the absence of rsBTF was also measured, as described above. The rate of hydrolysis of S-2288 without enzyme was measured as described above and subtracted from the total rate of the substrate hydrolysis. Five microliters each of 50 mm PMSF dissolved in methanol was added to 45 μl of the protein solution, which contained 0.23 nmol of partially reduced and S-carboxamidomethylated VIIa in TBS, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C. After 4 h, excess reagent was removed by extensive dialysis against TBS. VIIa (14 nm) and rsBTF (20 nm) were incubated with various concentrations of PMSF-treated derivatives of VIIa in 230 μl of TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 15 min; then 20 μl of S-2288 (10 mm) was added. The rates of change in absorbance at 405 nm were measured to determine the velocity of hydrolysis of S-2288. The rate of hydrolysis of S-2288 in the absence of rsBTF was also measured as described above and subtracted from the total rate of the substrate hydrolysis. VIIa (1.2 mg) was incubated with 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 5 ml of TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for 60 min. After incubation, the sample was transferred to an ice water container and further incubated with 18 mm iodoacetamide in the dark. After 2 h, the sample was dialyzed extensively against TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C. The preparation was then applied to an rsBTF-Affi-Gel 10 column (2.8 mg of rsBTF was coupled to 4 ml of Affi-Gel 10), and the flow-through fraction was collected. After washing the column with TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2, the adsorbed sample was eluted with TBS containing 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. The samples in flow-through and eluted fractions were collected and dialyzed against TBS, respectively. Samples were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h in 5.7 m HCl in evacuated tubes. The hydrolysates were analyzed on a Hitachi L-8500 automated analyzer (27Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1958; 30: 1190-1206Crossref Scopus (6593) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 477A gas phase sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were detected using an Applied Biosystems 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer with an on-line system, as described previously (28Takeya H. Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Yamamichi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14868-14877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VIIa was treated with various concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol, and the resulting material was S-carboxamidomethylated by treating with iodoacetamide. The S-carboxamidomethylated cysteine residues in the modified VIIa were determined as S-carboxymethylcysteine by amino acid analysis. We also measured the amidolytic activity of the modified VIIa in the presence and absence of rsBTF. As shown in Fig.1, the amidolytic activity of VIIa alone was sharply diminished with increasing concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol. The amidolytic activity of VIIa in the presence of rsBTF was similarly diminished. Fifty percent reduction of the amidolytic activity of VIIa alone was observed at 3 mmmercaptoethanol. At the 50% loss of the activity, about 1.2 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine, corresponding to a modification of 0.6 mol of disulfide bond/mol of VIIa, was estimated, suggesting an association between modification of one or few labile disulfide bonds in VIIa and loss of the amidolytic activity. To examine the rsBTF binding ability of S-carboxamidomethylated VIIa, the active site of the modified VIIa was masked by a treatment with PMSF, and the PMSF-treated derivatives were examined for their ability to inhibit the amidolytic activity of VIIa·rsBTF complex. As shown in Fig.2 A, the PMSF-treated derivatives inhibited the amidolytic activity of the VIIa·rsBTF complex with various IC50 values, where IC50represents a concentration of the PMSF-treated derivatives giving a 50% inhibition of the activity of the VIIa·rsBTF complex. The inverse values of IC50 versus concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol are plotted in Fig. 2 B. The 1/IC50 value increased until 3 mm2-mercaptoethanol and then diminished with increasing concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol. Since PMSF-treated VIIa and native VIIa have almost the same affinity for rsBTF (19Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the observed increase in 1/IC50 value at low 2-mercaptoethanol concentrations suggests a production of molecular species that have enhanced affinity for rsBTF. The rsBTF binding ability of VIIa was abolished at 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2 B). During the complete loss of the binding ability, about 5.0 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine, corresponding to a modification of 2.5 mol of disulfide bond/mol of VIIa, was estimated (Fig. 1). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” VIIa was treated with 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 18 mm iodoacetamide. This modification led to loss of >90% amidolytic activity of VIIa (Fig.1). The partially modified VIIa was then separated on an rsBTF-Affi-Gel 10 column. After the separation, rsBTF-bound and rsBTF-unbound fractions contained almost the same amount of protein (data not shown), suggesting that 50% of the modified VIIa before separation had essentially no affinity for rsBTF. As shown in TableI, 3.5 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of protein was estimated in amino acid analysis of the modified VIIa before separation. Therefore, only 1.8 mol of disulfide bond in a total of 12 mol of disulfide bond/mol of VIIa was modified and accompanied by 50% loss of the rsBTF binding ability. On the other hand, 2.4 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of protein was estimated in amino acid analysis of the rsBTF-bound fraction, whereas 4.8 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of protein was estimated for the rsBTF-unbound fraction. The difference of S-carboxymethylcysteines between the two fractions corresponds to a modification of 1.2 disulfide bonds, suggesting that modification of a single disulfide bond led to loss of rsBTF binding ability of VIIa. In the absence of rsBTF, amidolytic activity of the rsBTF-bound and rsBTF-unbound fractions relative to native VIIa were 7.2 and 6.2%, respectively (Fig.3 A). The amidolytic activity of rsBTF-bound fraction but not rsBTF-unbound fraction was enhanced in the presence of rsBTF as expected (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of rsBTF, amidolytic activity of the rsBTF-bound and rsBTF-unbound fractions relative to native VIIa were 0.95 and 0.045%, respectively. We further examined the rsBTF binding ability of the two fractions after treatment with PMSF (Fig. 4). As compared with the PMSF-treated VIIa (IC50 = 60 nm), the modified VIIa in rsBTF-bound fraction (IC50 = 40 nm) had an enhanced affinity for rsBTF and effectively inhibited the amidolytic activity of VIIa·rsBTF complex. In contrast, the rsBTF-unbound fraction did not show a significant affinity for rsBTF. These data and Fig. 2 B are consistent with the view that the modification of VIIa with 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol leads to at least two forms of VIIa, one of which has increased affinity for rsBTF and the other of which has essentially no affinity for rsBTF.Table IAmino acid compositions of reduced and S-carboxamidomethylated derivatives of factor VIIaAmino acidPre-columnBoundUnboundDeduced from sequence (Ref. 28Takeya H.

The rate of S-2288 hydrolysis by the VIIa·rsBTF complex was assumed to be 100%, and the relative rates of S-2288 hydrolysis by the VIIa·rsBTF complex in the presence of the PMSF-treated derivatives of VIIa are shown on the vertical axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine location of the modified disulfide bond responsible for the loss of rsBTF binding ability, the samples in rsBTF-bound and rsBTF-unbound fractions were subjected to tryptic digestion, after which the digests were separated by reversed-phase HPLC.

Based on the amino acid analyses (Table II), U-8 and U-12 were assigned as the peptides corresponding to residues 305–315 and 316–337 of bovine VII (28Takeya H. Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Yamamichi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14868-14877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. On the other hand, B-14 was assigned as the peptide corresponding to residues 305–337 of bovine VII. As shown in Table II, 1.1 and 1.2 mol of S-carboxymethylcysteine/mol of peptides were detected in the amino acid analyses on U-8 and U-12, respectively, whereas S-carboxymethylcysteine was not detected in the analysis on B-14. Furthermore, the LLTQDXLQQSR and QRPGGPVVTD sequences corresponding to residues 305–315 and 316–325 of bovine VII were determined, respectively, in the NH2-terminal sequence analyses on U-8 and U-12. As expected, the NH2-terminal sequence analyses on B-14 showed the LLTQDXLQQSR and QRPGGPVVTD sequences. These results indicate that B-14 is a two-chain peptide derived from the protease domain of VIIa corresponding to residues 305–315 and 316–337 linked through a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329, whereas U-8 and U-12 are single-chain peptides corresponding to residues 305–315 and 316–337, respectively, of which cysteine residues have been S-carboxamidomethylated. The results also suggest that reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 in the protease domain of VIIa led to a loss of binding ability with rsBTF. On the other hand, the modified VIIa in rsBTF-bound fraction contained 1.2 mol of modified disulfide bonds/mol of protein and showed only a 7.2% relative amidolytic activity and slightly enhanced affinity for rsBTF. Therefore, modification of a single disulfide bond must associate with the loss of amidolytic activity and increase in affinity for rsBTF. To determine the modified disulfide bond, native VIIa was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the digests were also analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 5 A). The elution profile was compared with that of rsBTF-bound fraction (Fig.5 B). The observed differences between the elution profiles were only N-18 from the native VIIa and B-19 from the rsBTF-bound fraction. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis on N-18 showed the DAXK and GTWFLTGVV sequences. Based on the amino acid analysis (Table II), N-18 was assigned as the peptide corresponding to residues 338–341 and 354–379 of bovine VII (28Takeya H. Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Yamamichi Y. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14868-14877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that N-18 is a two-chain peptide derived from the protease domain of VIIa corresponding to residues 338–341 and 354–379 linked through a disulfide bond between Cys-340 and Cys-368. In contrast, the GTWFLTGVV, but not the DAXK, sequence was determined in the sequence analysis on B-19, as expected. S-Carboxymethylcysteine was detected in the amino acid analysis on B-19. However, the determined composition of amino acids was not consistent with the peptide corresponding to residues 354–379 of bovine VII (data not shown), probably because B-19 had not been well separated from other peptides in the reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 5 B). Unfortunately, anS-carboxamidomethylated peptide corresponding to residues 338–341 was missing in the elution profile of rsBTF-bound fraction. The small hydrophilic peptide may have passed through the column of reversed-phase HPLC. However, the results suggest that reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of a disulfide bond between Cys-340 and Cys-368 in the protease domain of VIIa led to a loss of amidolytic activity and a slight increase in affinity for rsBTF.Table IIAmino acid compositions of fragments derived from reduced and S-carboxamidomethylated derivatives of VIIa or native VIIaAmino acidU-8 (Residues 305–315)U-12 (Residues 316–337)B-14 (Residues 305–315 and 316–337)N-18 (Residues 338–341 and 354–379)Residues/molecule2-aCalculated from the 20-h hydrolysate with 5.7m HCl.Cmc2-bS-Carboxymethylcysteine.1.11.20.00.0Asp1.1 (1)2-cValues in parentheses are taken from the sequence data of bovine factor VII (Ref. 28).2.8 (3)4.5 (4)1.1 (1)Glu2.7 (3)1.2 (1)4.1 (4)1.2 (1)Ser0.6 (1)1.6 (2)2.2 (3)0.8 (1)Gly0.0 (0)3.4 (4)3.7 (4)5.5 (6)His0.0 (0)0.0 (0)0.0 (0)1.0 (1)Arg1.0 (1)1.2 (1)2.2 (2)1.2 (1)Thr1.1 (1)0.9 (1)2.0 (2)2.7 (3)Ala0.0 (0)1.0 (1)1.0 (1)4.0 (4)Pro0.0 (0)2.2 (2)2.4 (2)0.0 (0)Tyr0.0 (0)1.2 (1)0.9 (1)0.9 (1)Val0.0 (0)1.7 (2)1.8 (2)1.9 (2)Met0.0 (0)0.9 (1)0.7 (1)0.0 (0)1/2 Cys2-dDetermined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation.0.0 (1)0.0 (1)1.7 (2)1.7 (2)Ile0.0 (0)0.0 (0)0.0 (0)1.0 (1)Leu2.9 (3)0.0 (0)3.4 (3)1.2 (1)Phe0.0 (0)1.1 (1)1.2 (1)2.2 (2)TrpND2-eND, not determined.

Open table in a new tab To explore the site of VIIa involved in the interaction with TF, we modified intramolecular disulfide bonds of VIIa under controlled conditions and identified disulfide bonds essential for the interaction with TF and catalytic activity. We also examined reactivity of the essential disulfide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol by monitoring the amidolytic activity and the rsBTF binding ability of VIIa after modification. We found that the amidolytic activity of VIIa was sharply diminished during reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of a part of the disulfide bonds in VIIa (Fig. 1), suggesting that a very labile disulfide bond is important for the amidolytic activity of VIIa. On the other hand, rsBTF binding ability of VIIa was also reduced with increasing concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol. To determine which modified disulfide bonds are associated with loss of the functions, a partially modified VIIa was separated on an immobilized rsBTF column, and the separated samples were examined for their amidolytic activity, affinity for rsBTF, and location of their modified disulfide bonds. The result suggests that reduction and S-carboxamidomethylation of a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 in VIIa leads to loss of the binding ability with rsBTF. The crystal structure of human soluble TF·VIIa complex indicates that the region next to Cys-310–Cys-329 is in contact with soluble TF (29Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis of human VIIa recently reported by Dickinson et al. (30Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) indicates that the contact region containing residues of Met-306 and Asp-309 in human VIIa is essential for the affinity for human TF. We speculate that some structural elements in the contact region of VIIa are necessary for the affinity for rsBTF, and that such structural elements are destabilized with scission of the disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329. We also found that the modification of a disulfide bond between Cys-340 and Cys-368 in the protease domain of VIIa led to loss of amidolytic activity and slight increase in affinity for rsBTF. This disulfide bond exists in the vicinity of the S1 site of VIIa and may contribute to the recognition of substrates. Indeed, Varallyay et al. (31Varallyay E. Lengyel Z. Graf L. Szilagyi L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) revealed that an elimination of the disulfide bond Cys-191–Cys-220 of trypsin corresponding to Cys-340–Cys-368 of VIIa leads to great decreases in the catalytic activity and specificity of trypsin. We previously presented a model for TF-mediated acceleration of VIIa activity where the protease domain of VIIa exists in equilibrium between minor active and dominant zymogen-like inactive conformational states. In this model, preferential binding of TF to the active state leads to a shift in equilibrium into the active state, thereby accelerating VIIa activity (19Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A part of the binding energy of the interaction between VIIa and TF is presumed to be consumed to drive this conformational change of VIIa. Therefore, interaction of TF with the ground state of VIIa must contain some energetically unfavorable (repulsive) elements that are directly responsible for the TF-induced activation of VIIa. We speculate that the favorable interaction of TF with a region next to the disulfide bond Cys-310–Cys-329 provides an energy required for overcoming the unfavorable elements, thereby contributing to the conformational change of VIIa and stabilization of the interaction between TF and the protease domain of VIIa. On the other hand, the observed increase in the affinity for rsBTF after modification of the disulfide bond between Cys-340 and Cys-368 of VIIa may be explained as a perturbation of the active site of VIIa upon the scission of the disulfide bond, which effects a conformation of the ground state of VIIa thus eliminating a part of the energetically unfavorable elements. In our previous study, such a slight increase in affinity of VIIa for rsBTF has been observed when the active site of VIIa is modified with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (19Higashi S. Matsumoto N. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26569-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, further study will be required to clarify these mechanisms. Trypsinogen, but not trypsin, has a flexible segment named activation domain (32Bode W. Fehlhammer H. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Considering the analogy of structure among trypsin-type serine proteases, the putative activation domain in VIIa corresponding to that in trypsinogen/trypsin is a prime candidate for the site of effects of TF. In trypsinogen/trypsin, the disulfide bonds corresponding to Cys-340–Cys-368 and Cys-310–Cys-329 of VIIa are, respectively, in and adjacent to the activation domain (Fig.6). The labile nature of the disulfide bonds of VIIa observed in the present study may well reflect flexibility of the putative activation domain and its flanking region of VIIa. We speculate that the high flexibility of a region around the disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 contributes to the enhanced mobility of the adjacent activation domain in VIIa, thus making it unable for VIIa to gain active conformation in the absence of TF. Waxman et al. (33Waxman E. Laws W.R. Laue T.M. Nemerson Y. Ross J.B.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), who detected a segmental motion in human VIIa using a fluorescence anisotropy decay method, found that the segmental motion is lost after a complex formation with TF. Interaction of TF with a flexible region around the disulfide bond may associate with the loss of motion of the activation domain, thereby contributing to stabilization of the active conformational state of VIIa. The loop formed by a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 of VIIa is five residues longer than those of related serine proteases (Fig. 6), which may relate to the flexibility of a region around the disulfide bond. Recent studies on natural mutation of human VII suggest that substitutions of Arg-304 → Gln/Trp (22O'Brien D.P. Gale K.M. Anderson J.S. McVey J.H. Miller G.J. Meade T.W. Tuddenham E.G.D.

Redaelli R. Ballerini G. Pemberton S. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 86: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in the protease domain have an adverse effect on TF interaction. All of the sites of substitution are in close proximity, and the last substitution results in the lack of a disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329, which also suggests the importance of this region for interaction with TF. Whether or not the flexibility of a region around the disulfide bond between Cys-310 and Cys-329 contributes the motion of putative activation domain in VIIa will need to be determined.

The apo protein spontaneously formed disulfide-linked dimers and was modified readily by sulfhydryl reagents, whereas the holo protein remained monomeric and was unreactive toward sulfhydryl reagents unless a protein denaturant was present. These data indicated that the single cysteine residue of the domain (Cys-116) was much more reactive in the apo form of the protein. Incubation of apoBCCP87 with biotin ligase for different times, followed by reaction with fluorescein-5-maleimide, clearly showed that the loss of Cys-116 reactivity was the result of modification with biotin. In addition, reaction of Cys-116 with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) showed that apoBCCP87 denatured at lower urea concentrations than holoBCCP87. We also found that apoBCCP87 was at least 10-fold more sensitive than the holo form to proteolysis by a range of proteases. Identification of the cleavage sites indicated that the differences in protease sensitivity could not be attributed to shielding of susceptible bonds by the biotin moiety of the holo protein. These data indicate that a conformational change accompanies biotinylation of the biotin domain. Thus, modification of a β-turn protruding from the protein surface results in alteration of the overall structure of this protein domain.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) from Escherichia coli is a multi-subunit enzyme belonging to the biotin carboxylase family, enzymes that use a biotin moiety to transfer an activated carboxyl group from the carboxylation site to a second site where carboxyl transfer occurs. The biotin moiety is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue in the biotin carrier domain of the carboxylase (1Samols D. Thornton C.G. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Haase F.C. Wood H.G. J. Biol.

In acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the biotin carrier function is located in a 156-residue protein, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), 1The abbreviations used are: BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IAN, iodoacetamide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); FM, fluorescein-5-maleimide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IAN, iodoacetamide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. of which the COOH-terminal half comprises the biotin carrier domain (2Sutton M.R.

This protein was shown subsequently to be a stable proteolytic fragment of the intact subunit and to be very similar to the protease-resistant, biotin-containing fragment produced by digestion of BCCP with subtilisin Carlsberg (6Fall R.R.

Subsequent in vivoexperiments showed that both the subtilisin fragment (BCCP80) and the 9.1-kDa protein (BCCP82), comprising the COOH-terminal 80 and 82 residues, respectively, contain all the sequence information necessary to specify biotinylation (8Cronan Jr., J.E.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Dardelet al. (16Dardel F. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) concluded from the NMR spectra of lipoylated and unlipoylated forms of the domain that there is little conformational change associated with lipoylation.Both BCCP82 and intact BCCP purified from E. coli contain a single cysteine residue (Cys-116 of the intact protein) that is inaccessible to sulfhydryl reagents in the native state (5Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the orientation of Cys-116 in the crystal structure of the holo form of BCCP80 (11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), where the residue side chain is buried and forms part of the hydrophobic core. We have previously reported the expression and purification of both the apo (unbiotinylated) and holo forms of a slightly larger 87-residue COOH-terminal biotin domain peptide from BCCP (17Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 831-837Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A recent kinetic analysis of BCCP87 shows that interaction of BCCP87 and the intact BCCP with biotin ligase are essentially identical (18Nenortas E. Beckett D. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7559-7567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we present data showing that, unlike post-translational modification of the similar lipoyl domain, biotinylation of BCCP87 is accompanied by a conformational change resulting in alterations in the reactivity of Cys-116 and the susceptibility of the domain to a variety of proteases.RESULTSOur first indication that the cysteine residue of apoBCCP87 was more reactive than that of holoBCCP87 was the detection of disulfide dimers in some preparations of the apo protein by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown) and SDS-PAGE (Fig.1, lane 4). In contrast, we found only traces of dimer in our holoBCCP87 preparations, consistent with the reported inaccessibility of the cysteine thiol group (Fig. 1,lane 3; the faint band in this lane with mobility of the disulfide-linked dimer was <1% of the total protein, and most probably represents dimer formed from denatured protein during sample preparation or electrophoresis). The apoBCCP87 dimers were readily reduced by β-mercaptoethanol to give the monomeric species (Fig. 1,lane 2). Incubation of the holo protein with SDS prior to SDS-PAGE resulted in conversion of disulfide-linked holoBCCP87 dimers (dimer became 12% of total protein) and an increase in apo protein dimers to around 20% (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Dimer formation during storage was a relatively slow process, with 9% of apoBCCP87 present as dimers after 4 months at −20 °C.Sulfhydryl ModificationIn agreement with the early work on BCCP82 and intact BCCP (5Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), holoBCCP87 reacted with DTNB only in the presence of SDS or urea (Fig. 2). Only traces of a DTNB reaction with native holoBCCP87 was detected in a 17-h incubation (data not shown). In contrast, native apoBCCP87 gave a readily detected rate of modification (Fig. 2), which resulted in quantitative reaction of the thiol group within several hours (data not shown). The rates of modification of both forms of BCCP87 were increased in the presence of SDS and markedly increased on addition of urea (Fig. 2). However, the difference observed in reactivity of the two species persisted in the presence of the denaturants, where with either SDS or urea, the apo protein reacted more rapidly than the holo protein.Figure 2Reaction of BCCP87 with sulfhydryl reagents. Apo- and holoBCCP87 (12 μm) were modified with DTNB (100 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence and absence of denaturants. ○, holo; •, apo; □, holo + 2% SDS; ▪, apo + 2% SDS; ▵, holo + 8m urea; ▴, apo + 8 m urea.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two other sulfhydryl reagents, FM (Fig.3) and [14C]IAN (data not shown), gave very similar results. When samples of apo and holo protein were incubated with either of these reagents followed by analysis on PAGE, incorporation of 14C or fluorescent material into apoBCCP87 was linear with time for at least 2 h. No incorporation into the holo protein was detected over this time interval (data not shown). The differing reactivities of Cys-116 in the apo and holo forms indicated that it should be possible to follow the progress of the biotin ligase reaction by the loss of reactivity of the cysteine thiol. When freshly reduced apoBCCP87 was incubated with biotin ligase, biotin, and ATP, the total amount of FM-reactive protein decreased progressively with time until no reaction with the reagent could be observed (Fig. 3) and, as expected from the prior data, FM labeled only the apo form.Figure 3The effect of in vitrobiotinylation of BCCP87 on reactivity toward FM. ApoBCCP87 was reduced with dithiothreitol, freed of excess reducing reagent by gel filtration, and then incubated with biotin ligase (see “Experimental Procedures”). At the times indicated, samples were taken into EDTA to block the ligase reaction. The samples were then reacted with FM for 2 h, with final concentrations of protein and FM of 25 and 125 μm, respectively. After quenching the FM reactions with β-mercaptoethanol, the reaction products were analyzed by PAGE run in the absence of denaturants. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie staining and fluorescent-labeled protein detected following irradiation with medium range UV light using a UVP Transilluminator.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observation that the increased reactivity of apo protein over holo protein persisted in the presence of urea and SDS (Fig. 2) suggested that apoBCCP87 may be more readily denatured. Therefore, we used the reactivity of Cys-116 toward DTNB to follow unfolding of the two proteins. Samples of apo- and holoBCCP87 were incubated in varying concentrations of urea, before determining the initial rate of modification by DTNB. Expressing these rates as a proportion of the rate in 8 m urea (Fig. 4) generated curves which showed that apoBCCP87 unfolded at a lower concentration of urea than holoBCCP87, with half-maximal modification occurring at urea concentrations of 4.3 m and 5.2m, respectively.Figure 4The effect of urea on DTNB modification of BCCP87. Apo (•) or holo (○) BCCP87 (6 μm) was dissolved in varying concentrations of urea and allowed to equilibrate at 30 °C for at least 1 h. Modification was initiated by the addition of DTNB to a final concentration of 10 μm and the reaction followed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The initial rate of modification was calculated from the data and normalized as a function of the initial rates of modification in the native and fully denatured states, i.e. % = [(rate in x m urea − rate without urea)/(rate in 8m urea − rate without urea)] × 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ProteolysisSince the cysteine modification and denaturation data suggested a conformational difference upon biotinylation, we investigated the susceptibility of the two forms of the protein to a range of proteases having different specificities. Initially, the proteins were treated with chymotrypsin, trypsin or subtilisin Carlsberg as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and samples of the digest taken over time were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig.5). The results show that apoBCCP87 was considerably more susceptible to all three proteases, with decreasing quantities of the intact 10-kDa protein detected over 4 h and none remaining after 21 h of incubation. In contrast, quantitation of the bands by laser densitometry indicated that 85–90% of the holo protein was intact after 21 h of digestion (data not shown). As expected from the data of Fall and Vagelos (6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2078-2088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), subtilisin Carlsberg trimmed the amino terminus of holoBCCP87 to produce species of slightly greater electrophoretic mobility (presumably holoBCCP80) but was otherwise protease-resistant. Although the sequence of BCCP suggested that some peptide fragments of intermediate size might be produced, the initial cleavage products appeared to be rapidly degraded to fragments that were too small for analysis by SDS-PAGE.Figure 5SDS-PAGE of protease-treated BCCP87.Apo- or holoBCCP87 (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with chymotrypsin, trypsin, or subtilisin Carlsberg at a protease:BCCP ratio of 1:40 (w/w) for the times indicated and the products analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative mobilities of molecular weight markers are shown on the top panel, with lines to indicate the same positions on the lower panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One possible explanation for the observed difference in the protease digestion patterns was direct protection of susceptible residues by the biotin moiety of the holo protein. Therefore, we have used limited proteolysis and peptide mapping to determine where the proteins were first cleaved by trypsin and endoproteinase Arg-C. Digestion of apoBCCP87 with Arg-C released two peptides, which were detected in the chromatograms at the earliest time point (Fig.6 b). The peptides were identified as A2 and A1 (Fig. 6 a) by mass spectrometry (Table I). A peak corresponding to the remaining portion of the protein was not observed on HPLC, presumably due to the generation of an insoluble core peptide as seen by Suttonet al. (2Sutton M.R. Fall R.R. Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in trypsin digests of holoBCCP80. In contrast, there was no initial Arg-C digestion of holoBCCP87, but the same two peptides were released when the incubation times were extended (Fig.6 c). A third major peak, Ax, was subsequently released in both apo and holo protein samples. This was identified as peptide T8 (Table I), and is apparently due to a contaminating trypsin-like activity in the Arg-C preparation. When apoBCCP87 was subjected to digestion with trypsin (Fig. 6 d), the peptides that were first released at low levels corresponded to T1, T2, and T8 (Table I), i.e. we did not detect an initial cleavage at Lys-122, which is the biotinylated residue of the holo protein. We failed to recover material corresponding to the undigested portion of the molecule as expected (2Sutton M.R. Fall R.R. Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at Lys-122 was evident after 15 min digestion at a protease:BCCP ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The holo protein was not digested by trypsin under these conditions (Fig.6 e); however, after 60 min of exposure at a protease:BCCP ratio of 1:40 (w/w), peptides T1, T2, T8, and minor amounts of T4 were released (data not shown). Similar digestions with chymotrypsin gave at least eight peaks detected by HPLC after 15 min of digestion of apoBCCP87 at a protease:BCCP ratio of 1:200 (w/w), and several of these peaks were shown to contain multiple species when analyzed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). This is consistent with the observed absence of large peptide products (Fig. 5). Although the complexity of the chymotrypsin digestion products precluded further analysis, the HPLC profiles of apo- and holoBCCP87 confirmed the differing susceptibility seen on SDS-PAGE.Figure 6Limited proteolysis of BCCP87 analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. a, sequence of BCCP87 showing the predicted peptides from cleavage with Arg-C (A) and trypsin (T).

The quantum yield was not significantly affected in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl (reduced by 7% and 3% in apo and holo forms, respectively). Second derivative UV absorption spectra indicated a red shift in the maxima from the apo to holo state in the wavelengths contributed by the tyrosine residue. The observed λmax1 and λmax2 shifted from 284.25 nm and 276.8 nm, respectively, in the apo protein to 285.5 nm and 278.2 nm after biotinylation (Fig.7 b). There was no alteration to the phenylalanine region of the spectrum. These differences were independent of salt and protein concentration (data not shown).Figure 7Intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and second derivative UV spectra.

Comparison of the modification of apo- and holoBCCP87 with DTNB (Fig. 2), FM and IAN indicated that whereas Cys-116 was readily accessible in apoBCCP87, it was much less available for reaction in holoBCCP87. The latter result is consistent both with previous modification studies (5Nervi A.M. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Fall R.R. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8005-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the x-ray crystal structure of holoBCCP80 (11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The crystal structure also indicates that the lack of reactivity of Cys-116 in the native holo protein is not due to steric shielding by the biotin moiety. The only residue masked by the biotin ring structures is Leu-117, where the solvent accessible surface area is decreased by about half (11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The Cys-116 side chain is located on the other side of the β strand, and thus is well removed and blocked from interaction with the biotin moiety (Fig. 8). Furthermore, we have shown that the side chain of Cys-116 became inaccessible to modification as biotinylation proceeded (Fig. 3). The denaturation curves of the proteins (Fig. 4) indicated that apoBCCP87 had a more open structure which unfolded at a lower urea concentration than the holo protein. These data are consistent with a conformational change in the region around Cys-116 accompanying biotinylation.Figure 8A diagrammatic representation of the structure of the holoBCCP biotin domain. Residues relevant to this study are indicated. The significance of the interaction of the protruding thumb structure, beginning at Arg-93, with the biotin moiety (11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) is discussed in the text. (Figure was prepared using MOLSCRIPT (29Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) from the Protein Data Bank coordinates for BCCP80 derived by Athappily and Hendrickson (11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The considerably slower rate of proteolytic cleavage by Arg-C and trypsin in holoBCP87 that we have observed suggests that the conformational change extends to other regions of the molecule. This interpretation is consistent with the study of Fontana et al. (21Fontana A. Zambonin M. Polverino de Laureto P. De Philippis V. Clementi A. Scaramella E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), who demonstrated with apo- and holomyoglobin that limited proteolysis is a reliable method for detecting structural differences. The change in protease susceptibility of BCCP87 was not due to the physical proximity of the biotin moiety, since Arg-93 is 11 Å away from the biotin and Arg-84 and Lys-136 are on the opposite face of the molecule (Fig. 8). In fact, while there was a difference in the rate of proteolysis, it was clear that the same residues were the most susceptible in both forms of the protein. Thus it appears that, despite the location of Lys-122 in the apo protein, i.e. exposed on a hairpin turn and accessible to biotin ligase, this is not the residue most sensitive to trypsin. This finding is consistent with the proposal of Fontana et al. (21Fontana A. Zambonin M. Polverino de Laureto P. De Philippis V. Clementi A. Scaramella E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), who argue that exposure, accessibility, and protrusion are insufficient to explain limited proteolysis.The fluorescence and UV spectral data (Fig. 7) indicated that Tyr-92, the single tyrosine residue of the biotin domain, was in a more polar environment before biotinylation (22Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 265-277Google Scholar). Although these data are consistent with the results of the cysteine-modification and proteolysis studies, interpretation is complicated by the proximity of Tyr-92 and the biotin moiety. In the holoBCCP80 crystal structure the tyrosine and biotin ring structures are separated by only 4 Å (Ref.11Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar; Fig. 8), and thus the addition of the biotin moiety itself can account for the observed spectral changes. The decreased susceptibility of the protein to chymotrypsin after biotinylation may be due to a steric effect preventing cleavage at Tyr-92.We believe our results indicate that BCCP can exist in two stable conformers and that the conformation found depends on the action of biotin ligase. We doubt that the presence of a covalently linked biotin moiety could of itself lock the holo form into the cysteine-buried, protease-resistant conformation. Indeed, the function of biotin in enzymatic catalysis (23Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) requires that the imidazolidine ring of the BCCP biotin cofactor be free to enter the biotin carboxylase and carboxytransferase active sites of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and it is known that the biotin moiety of holoBCCP is free"
https://openalex.org/W2018172904,"Core fucosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides (GlcNAcbeta1, 4(Fucalpha1,6)GlcNAcbeta1-Asn) is a common modification in animal glycans, but little is known about the distribution of core-fucosylated glycoproteins in mammalian tissues. Two monoclonal antibodies, CAB2 and CAB4, previously raised against carbohydrate epitopes of Dictyostelium discoideum glycoproteins (Crandall, I. E. and Newell, P. C. (1989) Development 107, 87-94), specifically recognize fucose residues in alpha1,6-linkage to the asparagine-bound GlcNAc of N-linked oligosaccharides. These IgG3 antibodies do not cross-react with glycoproteins containing alpha-fucoses in other linkages commonly seen in N- or O-linked sugar chains. CAB4 recognizes core alpha1,6 fucose regardless of terminal sugars, branching pattern, sialic acid linkage, or polylactosamine substitution. This contrasts to lentil and pea lectins that recognize a similar epitope in only a subset of these structures. Additional GlcNAc residues found in the core of N-glycans from dominant Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants LEC14 and LEC18 progressively decrease binding. These antibodies show that many proteins in human tissues are core-fucosylated, but their expression is localized to skin keratinocytes, vascular and visceral smooth muscle cells, epithelia, and some extracellular matrix-like material surrounding subpopulations of lymphocytes. The availability of these antibodies now allows for an extended investigation of core fucose epitope expression in development and malignancy and in genetically manipulated mice."

However, there have been no reports of permanent transfectants expressing the botulinum neurotoxins. The light chain of BoNT/A (L-BoNT/A) permanently transfected into nonneuronal cells should also be expressed and cleave SNAP-25. This approach, avoiding more aggressive permeabilizing methods, would also generate stably transfected cell lines useful in long term studies. AtT-20 endocrine cells express high levels of SNAP-25 and secrete ACTH in response to stimulation with a variety of secretagogues. To study the role of SNAP-25 in regulated secretion, in this work we analyzed ACTH secretion from AtT-20 cells stably transfected with the L-BoNT/A gene and expressing the functional toxin. cDNA encoding L-BoNT/A was kindly provided by Dr. H. Niemann (Hannover, Germany). The entire L-BoNT/A coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using for 40 cycles the following parameters: denaturation 40 s at 95 °C; annealing, 40 s at 53 °C; and extension at 74 °C, 40 s.HindIII and XbaI restriction sites were included in the sense and antisense amplification primers, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was excised with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI-digested pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The pRC/CMV vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and a neomycin resistance gene for selection of stably transfected cells in a medium containing the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Polymerase chain reaction products cloned in pRC/CMV were sequenced to confirm the presence of L-BoNT/A sequences. Special attention was given to the catalytic domain. Pituitary cell cultures from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) and rat GH3 cells obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Thame, Oxfordshire, UK) were prepared and grown as described previously (7Aguado F. Majó G. Ruiz-Montasell B. Canals J.M. Casanova A. Marsal J. Blasi J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 69: 351-359Google Scholar). An AtT-20 mouse anterior pituitary cell line was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mm/liter glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. AtT-20 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of the DNA constructs (pRC/CMV-BoNT/A) or the parental vector (pRC/CMV) using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, stably transfected cells were selected by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Isolated individual clones were maintained in the presence of G418. BoNT/A was produced from a culture of Clostridium botulinum type A (NCTC no. 2916) as described previously (20DasGupta B.R. Sathyamoorthy V.

AtT-20 cell homogenates (50 μg of protein) were incubated with BoNT/A (100 nm final concentration) in 10 mm Hepes/KOH buffer, pH 7.2 containing 100 mm KCl, 40 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol and 0.5% Triton X-100. Incubation proceeded for 1 h at 37 °C and was followed by fractionation in SDS-PAGE, 12.5% gel, and immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (7Aguado F. Majó G. Ruiz-Montasell B. Canals J.M. Casanova A. Marsal J. Blasi J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 69: 351-359Google Scholar). 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in a solution consisting of 5% non-fat milk powder in TBS (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membranes were individually incubated with antibodies, in blocking buffer, at the indicated concentrations: anti-α-tubulin, 1/1000 (Sigma); anti-SNAP-25, 1/1000 (SMI 81, Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Baltimore, MD); anti-Rab3A, 1/2000 (21Matteoli M.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); anti-syntaxin 1, 1/2000 (HPC1) (22Barnstable C.J. Hofstein R. Akagawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 20: 286-290Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar); anti-synaptobrevin 2, 1/2000 (23Edelman E. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). After several washes with blocking solution, membranes were incubated for 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and peroxidase activity was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Corp.). AtT-20 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and lysed by resuspending the cells in the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet 40 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min on ice, nonsoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibody (SMI-81) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were then rinsed twice in the same buffer, twice in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 350 mmNaCl, and 1% Nonidet 40, and twice with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, without detergent and then processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. L-BoNT/A-transfected and control mock-transfected cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-multiwell plates and grown in 2 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 4 days to induce the appearance of large and extended cellular processes (24Matsuuchi L. Buckley K.M. Lowe A.W. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Following further rinsing, cells were preincubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubations with primary antibodies against α-tubulin, SNAP-25, Rab3A, and ACTH (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were done overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% gelatin. The immunocytochemical detection of antibodies was done using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, UK). Cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes coated with poly-d-lysine to minimize cell loss and grown for 5–6 days to near confluence. Before the experiments, cells were rinsed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the appropriate test substances. At the indicated times after incubation, conditioned medium was collected from each dish, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and stored at −20 °C until assayed for ACTH content. All tests were done at least in quadruple in two independent experiments. ACTH was determined by a two-site immunoradiometric assay (Allegro IRMA, Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA), using synthetic human ACTH1–39 as the standard (25Raff H. Findling J. Clin. Chem. 1989; 35: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All test were done in duplicate. 5 mm8-Br-cAMP (Sigma), high (55 mm KCl) extracellular potassium concentration, and 3 nm α-latrotoxin (Alomone, Israel) were used to stimulate secretion. Before use in AtT-20 cells the excitatory capacity of α-latrotoxin was tested by measuring glutamate release in rat brain synaptosomes (26Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Nature. 1986; 321: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The secretion data presented are the mean ± S.E. determined by a two-tailed, unpairedt test. The pituitary-derived cell line AtT-20 selected for these transfection studies contained considerably higher levels of SNAP-25 than other anterior pituitary cell types (Fig.1). Geneticin-resistant AtT-20 cells transfected with the L-BoNT/A gene were tested for expression of L-BoNT/A protease activity by immunoblot analysis of SNAP-25 to show the appearance of the L-BoNT/A-specific SNAP-25 proteolytic fragment. Of the antibiotic-resistant clones having variable capacity to cleave SNAP-25 (data not shown) a clone (cl.2) showing complete L-BoNT/A specific cleavage of SNAP-25 was chosen for further studies (Fig.2 A). The cleaving activity on SNAP-25 in the L-BoNT/A transfectants was indistinguishable from that of bona fide BoNT/A. Incubation of AtT-20 cell homogenates from either control clones (cl.13), transfected with parental vector only, or wild type cells with exogenous BoNT/A, resulted in the appearance of the cleaved form of SNAP-25 having identical size to that of SNAP-25 fragments derived from the L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (cl.2) (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, no additional protein bands were detected when cell extracts from L-BoNT/A-transfected clones were incubated with the exogenous BoNT/A (Fig. 2 A). Expression of L-BoNT/A had no detectable effect on the protein composition of the transfected cells as revealed by Coomassie Blue or silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels of cell lysates from control and L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (Fig.2 B). The cleaved form of SNAP-25 in L-BoNT/A-transfected cells retained the capacity to form protein complexes with synaptobrevin 2 and syntaxin 1. Immunoprecipitation experiments followed by immunoblot analysis show that anti-SNAP-25 monoclonal antibodies recognized and immunoprecipitated with equal efficiency both the intact and the L-BoNT/A-cleaved forms of SNAP-25 (Fig.3). L-BoNT/A-transfected cells displayed no apparent difference in viability, replication rate, or phenotype compared with wild type or control transfected cells. In addition, no differences in morphology were detected between L-BoNT/A-transfected cells exhibiting complete cleavage of SNAP-25 and control cells, showing an AtT-20 characteristic pattern of processes (Fig.4). α-Tubulin also showed similar intracellular distribution in wild type, control cells, and L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (Fig. 4). In addition, in L-BoNT/A-transfected cells, secretory granule (ACTH), synaptic-like microvesicle (Rab3A) markers, and SNAP-25 showed the same distribution pattern as that of control cells (Fig. 4). We examined whether L-BoNT/A transfected cells retained the capacity to release hormone upon appropriate stimulation. Basal release of ACTH (27Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was not significantly different in L-BoNT/A-transfected and control cells after a 15-min (p > 0.5) (Fig.5 A) or a 60-min release period (p > 0.5) (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when cells were stimulated for 15 min with a high (55 mm) concentration of extracellular potassium, a significant increase was observed in ACTH released from control cells compared with L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (p < 0.03) (Fig.5 A). Stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP and α-latrotoxin for 60 min also failed to induce ACTH secretion from L-BoNT/A transfectants (Fig. 5 B). An induced increase of cytosolic calcium by a 5 mmconcentration of the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP (28Luini A. Lewis D. Guild S. Corda D. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8034-8038Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) resulted in the release to the medium of ACTH from control cells (p < 0.01) but failed to stimulate release of the hormone from L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (p > 0.5). In a similar manner, treatment with α-latrotoxin (29Rosental L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) at 3 nmconcentration resulted in the release of ACTH from control cells (p < 0.05) but not from L-BoNT/A-transfected cells (p > 0.5). Furthermore, simultaneous use of 8-Br-cAMP and α-latrotoxin resulted in even higher increases in released ACTH from control cells (p < 0.01) but again failed to stimulate hormone release from L-BoNT/A-transfected cells over basal levels (p > 0.5) (Fig. 5 B). The L-BoNT/A gene, coding for a protease that specifically targets the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25 (10Blasi J. Chapman ER. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Südhof TC. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 12Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), was introduced into ACTH-secreting AtT-20 cells as a probe to investigate the role of SNAP-25 in regulated secretion. L-BoNT/A-transfected cells but not mock-transfected control cells expressed an L-BoNT/A activity indistinguishable from that of bona fide BoNT/A. The extent of SNAP-25 processing in L-BoNT/A transfectants was variable, a provable consequence of different dosages of genome-integrated L-BoNT/A sequences. The majority of cellular parameters we tested were unaffected by expression of L-BoNT/A. Furthermore, transfected cells expressing L-BoNT/A activity at the highest level showed no detectable changes in viability and growth rate when compared with control cells, in agreement with previous studies showing that BoNT/A toxin injected into muscles or added to neuronal cell cultures caused no physical or morphological damage to neurons (30Duchen L.W. Adams J.H. Duchen L.W. Greenfield's Neuropathology. 5th Ed. Edward Arnold, London1992: 1-68Google Scholar, 31Bigalke H. Dimpfel W. Habermann E. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2647-2657PubMed Google Scholar). The similar cellular distribution of SNAP-25 in control and transfected cells suggests that synthesis, distribution, and sorting of this protein was not affected by L-BoNT/A. In contrast to the observation of others (9Osen-Sand A. Staple J.K. Naldi E. Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Petitpierre S. Malgaroli A. Montecucco C. Catsicas S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), showing that BoNT/A impairs neurite extension and formation of new synapses in neuronal primary cell cultures, our data show that cellular processes, containing secretory granules and synaptic-like microvesicles typical of AtT-20 cells (24Matsuuchi L. Buckley K.M. Lowe A.W. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Tooze J. Hollinshead M. Fuller S.D. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Eur. J.

Cell. 1993; 4: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were unaffected by expression of L-BoNT/A. This suggests that SNAP-25 is not essential for the elongation of cellular processes and transport of secretory organelles in AtT-20 cells. A plausible means of reconciling our results with those reports (9Osen-Sand A. Staple J.K. Naldi E. Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Petitpierre S. Malgaroli A. Montecucco C. Catsicas S. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) is the finding of a non-neuronal form of SNAP-25, SNAP-23, that could fulfill the same role of SNAP-25 in AtT-20 cells (see below) (35Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The stimulus-evoked hormone secretion of ACTH, but not basal secretion, was completely blocked in L-BoNT/A-transfected cells regardless of the stimulus used, 8-Br-cAMP, KCl, α-latrotoxin, or both together, confirming a significant role of SNAP-25 in regulated exocytosis (10Blasi J. Chapman ER. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Südhof TC. Niemann H. Jahn R. Nature. 1993; 365: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). A similar inhibitory effect of BoNT/A has been shown on insulin secretion from permeabilized pancreas-derived cells (6Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban A J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Boyd R.S. Duggan M.J. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18216-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The present report shows that at low concentration α-latrotoxin, an inducer of neurotransmiter and neuropeptide release from nerve terminals (29Rosental L. Meldolesi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 42: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Waterman S.A. Maggi C.A. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 37Petrenko A.G. Perin M.S. Davletov B.A. Ushkaryov Y.A. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), evokes ACTH secretion from AtT-20 cells over basal levels, suggesting the presence of an α-latrotoxin receptor in these endocrine cells. Our finding that α-latrotoxin was unable to restore ACTH secretion in L-BoNT/A-transfected AtT-20 cells is in contrast with data showing that this toxin can stimulate neurotransmiter release from BoNT/A-poisoned nerve terminals (38Cull-Candy S.G. Lundh H. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. 1976; 260: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These observations may suggest the existence of different mechanisms in neurons and endocrine cells for the α-latrotoxin-induced secretion. One of the most remarkable features observed in L-BoNT/A-transfected AtT-20 cells was that the basal secretion level of hormone was not significantly affected. One possible explanation for this result is that SNAP-23, a SNAP-25 homologue lacking the peptide bond cleaved by L-BoNT/A (35Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), may also be responsible for constitutive and/or basal secretion level of ACTH. As far as we know the present report is the first successful attempt to obtain a stably transfected secretory cell line expressing the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin. This feature is especially relevant since the main effect of these toxins, the impairment of the regulated exocytosis, becomes amenable to study in secretory non-neural cells for long periods of time. We thank Drs. R. Jahn and C. Barnstable for the antibodies used in this report and Dr. H. Niemann for L-BoNT/A cDNA. We are thankful to Dr. J. Herreros for neurotoxin purification, to I. Gomez de Aranda for technical help, and to Jordi Ballabriga and Rafael Abost for statistics. We are grateful to Dr. C. Gundersen for helpful discussions."

An extreme example was the frameshift GR mutant 465*, mutated after amino acid 465. This generated a novel 21-amino acid “tail,” beginning within the second zinc finger of the human glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain, a region required for ICR-27 cell death caused by hologlucocorticoid receptor plus hormone. The cell loss mediated by 465* was faster but quantitatively equivalent to that caused by hologlucocorticoid receptor plus hormone. We are therefore investigating the mechanism of action of 465*. We overexpressed 465* with or without a glutathione S-transferase tag fused to its N terminus and tested its ability to affect glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven reactions in vitro. Partially purified 465* showed little binding to a consensus GRE, caused virtually no stimulation of transcription from a GRE, and failed to inhibit GR-driven transcription. However, GST-465* “trapped” several proteins from ICR-27 cell extracts, including c-Jun; recombinant c-Jun also was bound in vitro. In co-transfection assays of CV-1 cells, 465* expression reduced phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) transcriptional activation from a promoter containing multiple AP-1 sites. Further studies proved the repressive activity of 465* was c-Jun-specific and not due to squelching artifacts. The data suggest that interaction of 465* with other proteins, such as c-Jun, might be responsible for its cell killing function.

Biochemical, immunological, and genetic analyses of the GR imply that the protein folds into three distinct functional domains and several subdomains (4Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of the hGR, containing the major transactivation activity, is referred to as τ1 (amino acids 77–262; Refs. 4Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M.

A central 66-residue DNA binding domain (DBD, amino acids 420–486) comprises two zinc finger motifs and is followed by a “hinge region.” The binding of two zinc atoms by two clusters of four cysteines helps stabilize a system of loops and helices responsible for site-specific DNA binding and homodimerization (4Giguere V.

In the course of transfection experiments aimed at mapping the regions of the hGR required for its lethal effect, we discovered that certain fragments of the receptor could reduce the number of viable test cells independently of added steroid (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these hGR mutants lacked a large portion of their C termini, such that the entire LBD was missing. The hinge region of the hGR was removed to varying degrees in these mutants with no effect on their relative potencies in our assay. These mutants had been shown to have little or no transactivation activity of a GRE-driven reporter system, tested in co-transfection assays (14Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone C.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 15Yang-yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.T. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). An extreme case was mutant 465*, the product of a frameshift mutation at amino acid 465, within the second zinc finger of DBD. This results in retention of the amino acids that define the more amino-terminal zinc binding sequence but loss of part of the second “zinc finger” sequence from the wild type hGR DBD. Nevertheless, in our assay system, 465* was fully as active in reducing cell numbers as other C-terminal truncated hGR mutants that contained the entire DBD along with varying amounts of the hinge region. Therefore, we have focused our attention on the cell loss caused by transfection of 465*, further exploring possible mechanisms involved in the cell death process. ICR-27 cells were used to investigate the lethal effect of 465*. ICR-27 is a clone of cells selected for resistance to a high dose dexamethasone (Dex) from the Dex-sensitive cell line CEM-C7 (16Norman M.R. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3785-3791PubMed Google Scholar). CEM-C7 cells contain two alleles for the hGR, one wild type and the other containing a point mutation (17Harmon J.M. Thompson E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In ICR-27 cells, a deletion of the wild type gene has left only the ineffective mutant GR (17Harmon J.M. Thompson E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Palmer L.A. Hukku B. Harmon J.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6612-6618PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ashraf J. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whole cell competitive ligand binding assays show few glucocorticoid binding sites in ICR-27 cells. However, transfection with an expression vector containing the whole coding sequence of the hGR gene restores glucocorticoid responsiveness to ICR-27 cells (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Harbour D.V. Chambon P. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 35: 1-9Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When plasmids expressing 465* are introduced into ICR-27 cells, a rapid reduction in viable cell numbers is seen, which does not require added steroid.Our in vitro studies showed that 465* could not bind to a consensus GRE, nor could it cause the stimulation of transcription of a GRE-driven reporter. We therefore hypothesize that protein-protein interactions are involved in the lethal effects of 465* and other GR mutants lacking their LBDs. Our results suggest that such interactions, rather than direct binding of 465* to GRE, are likely to be important in the observed biological effects of the GR fragment. As an example, we show that the 465* fragment interacts with c-Jun and interferes with its site-specific regulation of transcription.DISCUSSIONWhen plasmids expressing fragments of the hGR that lack the LBD but retain the DBD are transiently transfected into any of several lymphoid cell lines, they cause cell loss (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to be apoptotic. The most extreme example of these truncated hGR fragments is 465*, in which a frameshift mutation interrupts the second zinc-binding region of the hGR DBD, replaces the ensuing 21 amino acids with a novel sequence, and then terminates the protein. We surveyed the lethal effect of 465* in a series of glucocorticoid-resistant cell lines from T cell leukemias, B cell myelomas, and myeloid leukemias (39Nazareth L.V. Johnson B.H. Chen H. Thompson E.B. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1789-1795PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of 465* caused cell loss only in the T cell and B cell lines and not in the myeloid cell lines tested. This raises the possibility of therapeutic applications against glucocorticoid-resistant lymphoid malignancies for agents based on 465*. In the work presented here, we have pursued several possible mechanisms for the activity of 465*.The cell kill mediated by 465* occurs rapidly compared with that following parallel transfections of holo-GR and treatment with agonist hormone (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of cells after 465* transfection starts 6–12 h later and usually peaks by 18–36 h. When holo-GR is transfected, no apoptosis occurs unless ligand is added, in which case cell loss begins about 24 h later and continues for 2–3 days, recapitulating the time course of apoptosis in glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM cells containing native hGR. The rapid cell death kinetics following 465* transfection suggested that the mechanism was unlikely to be through the classic GRE-driven glucocorticoid response pathway of these cells. However, in natural thymocytes, GR-steroid complexes evoke apoptosis much more swiftly (40Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar), so it was incumbent to consider the classic GRE-driven pathways as a possible mechanism. Further studies showed that 465* peptide had little affinity for a consensus GRE, as assayed by GMSA. In addition, recombinant 465* peptide did not activate a GRE-driven transcription in the cell-free system, and even in excess, 465* peptide added to the in vitro transcription system did not alter the activation of the target gene caused by hGR alone. Furthermore, in CV-1 cells, 465* did not activate the MMTV-CAT, a GRE-dependent reporter gene construct, and did not interfere with holo-GR induction. All these data strongly suggested that the classic GRE-driven transcriptional activation was not involved in the death of cells caused by 465*. This led us to investigate the possibility that a repressive function of 465* might cause cell lysis.It has been shown that holo-GR interacts with various transcription factors and regulatory proteins (41Ray A.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) through imprecisely defined domains. The 465* peptide may recognize certain transcription factors in a novel way or factors that are normally recognized by the holo-GR. Of the transcription factors known to interact with the holo-GR, c-Jun has been implicated in GR-caused apoptosis, specifically in CEM cells (34Zhou F. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 308-316Google Scholar). We therefore used c-Jun as a model system to test the hypothesis that the 465* peptide could interfere with the function of important cellular proteins. The results from several groups suggested that the GR DBD was indispensable for GR-c-Jun interaction (24Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 50Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 51Radler-Pohl A. Gebel S.

Sci. 1993; 684: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and, in some cases at least, direct DNA binding by the GR was not necessary for the GR to repress AP-1 activity. Further study suggested that repression of AP-1 activity and transactivation functions of the GR were separable entities and that the repression could be a function of GR monomers (24Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar).Although 465* has lost part of the second zinc finger of the DBD, it retains the ability to interact with c-Jun in vitro and to inhibit AP-1 activity from an AP-1-dependent reporter gene. The data showed less inhibitory effect for a given amount of transfected expression vector carrying the 465* gene than for one carrying the holo-GR, but this result does not measure the amount of each expressed protein. To better compare the inhibitory potency between 465* and holo-GR, we examined the relative level of immunoreactive 465* or hGR found in equivalent whole cell extracts from CV-1 cells transfected with equal amount of each expression plasmid. The results demonstrated that approximately twice as much hGR protein as 465* had been expressed. Although 465* and hGR were expressed from the same promoter, the stability of these two proteins may not be the same. The lower amount of expressed 465* protein in CV-1 cells may explain the lesser inhibitory effect of transfection with pRSh465*. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate that transfection of the 465* construct altered AP-1-dependent transcription. The interference was AP-1-specific, since increased expression of c-Jun counteracted the repressive effect caused by 465*. Also, 465* did not alter either GRE- or ERE-driven reporter gene activity. This indicated that 465* did not block the activity of general transcription machinery.The similar kinetics of cell death caused by 465* and several other GR mutants that lack the LBD but possess the DBD intact suggest that protein-protein interactions are more likely to be involved in the cell death process they evoke than is their direct binding to GRE sites in the genome. All of these mutants have little or no transactivation activity in co-transfection assays (14Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone C.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 15Yang-yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.T. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). We chose mutant 500* as an example of such mutants for comparison with 465*. Mutant 500* is as potent as 465* in affecting cell lysis, but 500* codes for a fully intact DBD. The 500* peptide bound a GRE, while 465* did not. On the other hand, by using the GST “trap” system, we found that both 465* and 500* selectively interacted with certain factors from the ICR-27 cells. It is possible that 465* and 500* interacted with the same proteins. We further demonstrated that both 465* and 500* interacted with recombinant c-Jun in vitro. By using c-Jun as a model system, we have shown that 465* not only physically interacted with c-Jun but also altered c-Jun's function. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that 465* and, by extension, other GR mutants lacking their LBDs, exert their lethal effect through binding to and altering the activity of certain transcription factors or other proteins essential for cell viability. For example, repression of potential “survival genes” could be mediated through transcriptional interference between 465* and transcription factors such as AP-1. Alternatively, 465* and similar constructs could directly interfere with some “vitality factors” or could activate lethal caspase cascades directly or indirectly (52Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 53Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). These possibilities are being investigated.From the evidence described in this paper, we propose that protein-protein interactions rather than direct binding to GRE are important in the lethal effects of 465*. The observed biological cell kill by 465* could be mediated by interference with certain transcription factors or other regulatory proteins required for cell survival.

(1Yamamoto K.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The GR is required for glucocorticoid-evoked apoptosis of lymphoid cells (2Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 267-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 3Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Biochemical, immunological, and genetic analyses of the GR imply that the protein folds into three distinct functional domains and several subdomains (4Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6293) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of the hGR, containing the major transactivation activity, is referred to as τ1 (amino acids 77–262; Refs. 4Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M.

A central 66-residue DNA binding domain (DBD, amino acids 420–486) comprises two zinc finger motifs and is followed by a “hinge region.” The binding of two zinc atoms by two clusters of four cysteines helps stabilize a system of loops and helices responsible for site-specific DNA binding and homodimerization (4Giguere V.

In the course of transfection experiments aimed at mapping the regions of the hGR required for its lethal effect, we discovered that certain fragments of the receptor could reduce the number of viable test cells independently of added steroid (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these hGR mutants lacked a large portion of their C termini, such that the entire LBD was missing. The hinge region of the hGR was removed to varying degrees in these mutants with no effect on their relative potencies in our assay. These mutants had been shown to have little or no transactivation activity of a GRE-driven reporter system, tested in co-transfection assays (14Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone C.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 15Yang-yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.T. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). An extreme case was mutant 465*, the product of a frameshift mutation at amino acid 465, within the second zinc finger of DBD. This results in retention of the amino acids that define the more amino-terminal zinc binding sequence but loss of part of the second “zinc finger” sequence from the wild type hGR DBD. Nevertheless, in our assay system, 465* was fully as active in reducing cell numbers as other C-terminal truncated hGR mutants that contained the entire DBD along with varying amounts of the hinge region. Therefore, we have focused our attention on the cell loss caused by transfection of 465*, further exploring possible mechanisms involved in the cell death process. ICR-27 cells were used to investigate the lethal effect of 465*. ICR-27 is a clone of cells selected for resistance to a high dose dexamethasone (Dex) from the Dex-sensitive cell line CEM-C7 (16Norman M.R. Thompson E.B. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 3785-3791PubMed Google Scholar). CEM-C7 cells contain two alleles for the hGR, one wild type and the other containing a point mutation (17Harmon J.M. Thompson E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In ICR-27 cells, a deletion of the wild type gene has left only the ineffective mutant GR (17Harmon J.M. Thompson E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Palmer L.A. Hukku B. Harmon J.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6612-6618PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ashraf J. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whole cell competitive ligand binding assays show few glucocorticoid binding sites in ICR-27 cells. However, transfection with an expression vector containing the whole coding sequence of the hGR gene restores glucocorticoid responsiveness to ICR-27 cells (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Harbour D.V. Chambon P. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 35: 1-9Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When plasmids expressing 465* are introduced into ICR-27 cells, a rapid reduction in viable cell numbers is seen, which does not require added steroid. Our in vitro studies showed that 465* could not bind to a consensus GRE, nor could it cause the stimulation of transcription of a GRE-driven reporter. We therefore hypothesize that protein-protein interactions are involved in the lethal effects of 465* and other GR mutants lacking their LBDs. Our results suggest that such interactions, rather than direct binding of 465* to GRE, are likely to be important in the observed biological effects of the GR fragment.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 53Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). These possibilities are being investigated.From the evidence described in this paper, we propose that protein-protein interactions rather than direct binding to GRE are important in the lethal effects of 465*. The observed biological cell kill by 465* could be mediated by interference with certain transcription factors or other regulatory proteins required for cell survival. When plasmids expressing fragments of the hGR that lack the LBD but retain the DBD are transiently transfected into any of several lymphoid cell lines, they cause cell loss (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to be apoptotic. The most extreme example of these truncated hGR fragments is 465*, in which a frameshift mutation interrupts the second zinc-binding region of the hGR DBD, replaces the ensuing 21 amino acids with a novel sequence, and then terminates the protein. We surveyed the lethal effect of 465* in a series of glucocorticoid-resistant cell lines from T cell leukemias, B cell myelomas, and myeloid leukemias (39Nazareth L.V. Johnson B.H. Chen H. Thompson E.B. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1789-1795PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of 465* caused cell loss only in the T cell and B cell lines and not in the myeloid cell lines tested. This raises the possibility of therapeutic applications against glucocorticoid-resistant lymphoid malignancies for agents based on 465*. In the work presented here, we have pursued several possible mechanisms for the activity of 465*. The cell kill mediated by 465* occurs rapidly compared with that following parallel transfections of holo-GR and treatment with agonist hormone (13Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of cells after 465* transfection starts 6–12 h later and usually peaks by 18–36 h. When holo-GR is transfected, no apoptosis occurs unless ligand is added, in which case cell loss begins about 24 h later and continues for 2–3 days, recapitulating the time course of apoptosis in glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM cells containing native hGR. The rapid cell death kinetics following 465* transfection suggested that the mechanism was unlikely to be through the classic GRE-driven glucocorticoid response pathway of these cells. However, in natural thymocytes, GR-steroid complexes evoke apoptosis much more swiftly (40Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar), so it was incumbent to consider the classic GRE-driven pathways as a possible mechanism. Further studies showed that 465* peptide had little affinity for a consensus GRE, as assayed by GMSA. In addition, recombinant 465* peptide did not activate a GRE-driven transcription in the cell-free system, and even in excess, 465* peptide added to the in vitro transcription system did not alter the activation of the target gene caused by hGR alone. Furthermore, in CV-1 cells, 465* did not activate the MMTV-CAT, a GRE-dependent reporter gene construct, and did not interfere with holo-GR induction. All these data strongly suggested that the classic GRE-driven transcriptional activation was not involved in the death of cells caused by 465*. This led us to investigate the possibility that a repressive function of 465* might cause cell lysis. It has been shown that holo-GR interacts with various transcription factors and regulatory proteins (41Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) through imprecisely defined domains. The 465* peptide may recognize certain transcription factors in a novel way or factors that are normally recognized by the holo-GR. Of the transcription factors known to interact with the holo-GR, c-Jun has been implicated in GR-caused apoptosis, specifically in CEM cells (34Zhou F. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 308-316Google Scholar). We therefore used c-Jun as a model system to test the hypothesis that the 465* peptide could interfere with the function of important cellular proteins. The results from several groups suggested that the GR DBD was indispensable for GR-c-Jun interaction (24Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 50Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 51Radler-Pohl A. Gebel S.

Sci. 1993; 684: 127-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and, in some cases at least, direct DNA binding by the GR was not necessary for the GR to repress AP-1 activity. Further study suggested that repression of AP-1 activity and transactivation functions of the GR were separable entities and that the repression could be a function of GR monomers (24Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Although 465* has lost part of the second zinc finger of the DBD, it retains the ability to interact with c-Jun in vitro and to inhibit AP-1 activity from an AP-1-dependent reporter gene. The data showed less inhibitory effect for a given amount of transfected expression vector carrying the 465* gene than for one carrying the holo-GR, but this result does not measure the amount of each expressed protein. To better compare the inhibitory potency between 465* and holo-GR, we examined the relative level of immunoreactive 465* or hGR found in equivalent whole cell extracts from CV-1 cells transfected with equal amount of each expression plasmid. The results demonstrated that approximately twice as much hGR protein as 465* had been expressed. Although 465* and hGR were expressed from the same promoter, the stability of these two proteins may not be the same. The lower amount of expressed 465* protein in CV-1 cells may explain the lesser inhibitory effect of transfection with pRSh465*. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate that transfection of the 465* construct altered AP-1-dependent transcription. The interference was AP-1-specific, since increased expression of c-Jun counteracted the repressive effect caused by 465*. Also, 465* did not alter either GRE- or ERE-driven reporter gene activity. This indicated that 465* did not block the activity of general transcription machinery. The similar kinetics of cell death caused by 465* and several other GR mutants that lack the LBD but possess the DBD intact suggest that protein-protein interactions are more likely to be involved in the cell death process they evoke than is their direct binding to GRE sites in the genome. All of these mutants have little or no transactivation activity in co-transfection assays (14Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone C.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 15Yang-yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.T. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). We chose mutant 500* as an example of such mutants for comparison with 465*. Mutant 500* is as potent as 465* in affecting cell lysis, but 500* codes for a fully intact DBD. The 500* peptide bound a GRE, while 465* did not. On the other hand, by using the GST “trap” system, we found that both 465* and 500* selectively interacted with certain factors from the ICR-27 cells. It is possible that 465* and 500* interacted with the same proteins. We further demonstrated that both 465* and 500* interacted with recombinant c-Jun in vitro. By using c-Jun as a model system, we have shown that 465* not only physically interacted with c-Jun but also altered c-Jun's function. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that 465* and, by extension, other GR mutants lacking their LBDs, exert their lethal effect through binding to and altering the activity of certain transcription factors or other proteins essential for cell viability. For example, repression of potential “survival genes” could be mediated through transcriptional interference between 465* and transcription factors such as AP-1. Alternatively, 465* and similar constructs could directly interfere with some “vitality factors” or could activate lethal caspase cascades directly or indirectly (52Henkart P.A.
